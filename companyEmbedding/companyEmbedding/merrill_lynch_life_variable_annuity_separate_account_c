Answer a few questions to get started


















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.



          1.
	
	
	       
					
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss - investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.



          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.




Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and, in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company®, New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.



          Annuities at Fidelity are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc. and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC.


          Fidelity Income Strategy Evaluator is an educational tool.

Answer a few questions to get started



















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.



          1.

Fidelity Personal Retirement Annuity (Policy Form No. DVA-2005, et al.) is issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), and, for New York residents, Personal Retirement Annuity (Policy Form No. EDVA-2005, et al.) is issued by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company®, New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC, and Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., are the distributors.
	
    

          3. This is a deferred variable annuity; investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will actuate depending on market performance.
	
    

          4. Clients are eligible for an annual fee of 0.10% if (1) the contract is purchased with an initial purchase payment of $1,000,000 or more on or after September 7, 2010, or (2) the contract value has accumulated to $1,000,000 or more on or after September 7, 2010, and at that time we are offering the contract to new applicants for 0.10%. See prospectus for additional details.
	
    

          5. Certain funds transferred or withdrawn in less than 60 days of purchase will be assessed a 1% fee, which is retained by the funds. See individual fund prospectus for additional details.
	
    

          6. Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.
	
    

          7.
	
	
	       Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


          8. Restrictions may apply. Please refer to product materials for additional details.
	
    

          9. Minimum subsequent premium amounts and limitations to when they are allowed prior to income start date may apply.
	
    

          10. Restrictions may apply depending on payment option and/or contract type selected. The new income amount will be determined by the issuing insurance company. Please refer to the product materials for additional details.
	
    

          11. This product is available in all states except New York. Product features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract for more complete product details.

After age 59½, an early access withdrawal or any withdrawal (including applicable Market Value Adjustment and surrender charges) that exceeds your GLWB amount will reduce your income guarantees.

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.


Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company,® New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Call or write to Fidelity or visit Fidelity.com for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Please read the prospectus and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Assets under management refers to general account investments and separate account assets.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

The variable annuity contract described here provides a variety of investment   
features. It also provides options for income protection later in life. It is   
important that you understand how the contract works, and its benefits, costs,  
and risks. First, some basics.                                                  

 WHAT IS AN ANNUITY?

An annuity provides for the systematic liquidation of a sum of money at the     
annuity date through a variety of annuity options. Each annuity option has      
different protection features intended to cover different kinds of income needs.
Many of these annuity options provide income streams that can't be outlived.    

 WHAT IS A VARIABLE ANNUITY?

A variable annuity bases its benefits on the performance of underlying          
investments. These investments may typically include stocks, bonds, and money   
market instruments. The annuity described here is a variable annuity.           

WHAT ARE THE RISKS IN OWNING A VARIABLE ANNUITY?

A variable annuity does not guarantee the performance of the underlying         
investments. The performance can go up or down. It can even decrease the value  
of money you've put in. You bear all of this risk. You could lose all or part of
the money you've put in.                                                        

 HOW DOES THIS ANNUITY WORK?

We put your premium payments as you direct into one or more subaccounts of the  
Account. In turn, we invest each subaccount's assets in corresponding portfolios
of the following:

The value of your Contract at any point in time up to the annuity date is called
your contract value. Before the annuity date, you are generally free to direct  
your contract value among the subaccounts as you wish. You may also withdraw all
or part of your contract value. If you die before the annuity date, we pay a    
death benefit to your beneficiary.                                              

We've designed this annuity as a long-term investment. Any money you take out of
the Contract is subject to tax, and if taken before age 59 1/2 may also be      
subject to a 10% federal penalty tax. FOR THESE REASONS, YOU NEED TO CONSIDER   
YOUR CURRENT AND SHORT-TERM INCOME NEEDS CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY THE 
CONTRACT.                                                                       
WHAT DOES THIS ANNUITY COST?
THIS ANNUITY DOES NOT IMPOSE ANY SALES CHARGES -- ON EITHER PURCHASES OR        
WITHDRAWALS. However, we impose a number of other charges, including an         
asset-based insurance charge. We provide more details on this charge, as well as
a description of all other charges, later in the prospectus.

 CAPSULE SUMMARY OF THE CONTRACT

This capsule summary provides a brief overview of the Contract. More detailed   
information about the Contract can be found in the sections of this Prospectus  
that follow, all of which should be read in their entirety.                     

PREMIUMS 

Generally, before the annuity date you can pay premiums as often as you like.   
The minimum initial premium is $25,000. Subsequent premiums generally must be   
$100 or more. The maximum premium that will be accepted without Company approval
is $1,000,000. Under an automatic investment feature, you can make subsequent   
premium payments systematically from your Merrill Lynch brokerage account. For  
more information, see "Automatic Investment Feature".                           

The Contract is available as a non-qualified contract or may be issued as an IRA
or purchased through an established IRA or Roth IRA custodial account with      
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S"). Federal law      
limits maximum annual contributions to IRAs and Roth IRAs. Transfer amounts from
tax sheltered annuity plans that are not subject to the Employee Retirement     
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, will be accepted as premium payments,  
as permitted by law. Other premium payments will not be accepted under a        
Contract used as a tax sheltered annuity.                                       

Tax favored arrangements, including IRAs and Roth IRAs, should carefully        
consider the costs and benefits of the Contracts (including annuity income      
benefits) before purchasing the Contract, since the tax arrangement itself      
provides for tax-sheltered growth.                                              

We offer another variable annuity contract that has a different death           
benefit, contract features, fund selections, and optional programs. However,    
this other contract also has different charges that would affect your           
subaccount performance and contract values. To obtain more information about    
this other contract, contact our Service Center or your Financial Consultant.   

THE ACCOUNT 

As you direct, we will put premiums into the subaccounts corresponding to the   
Funds in which we invest your contract value. For the first 14 days following   
the contract date, we put all premiums into the Domestic Money Market           
Subaccount. After the 14 days, we'll put the money into the subaccounts you've  
selected. In Pennsylvania, however, we won't wait 14 days. Instead, we'll invest
your premium immediately in the subaccounts you've selected. Currently, you may 
allocate premiums or contract value among 10 of the available subaccounts.      
Generally, within certain limits you may transfer contract value periodically   
among subaccounts.

FEES AND CHARGES 

ASSET-BASED INSURANCE CHARGE 

    We currently impose an asset-based insurance charge of 1.59% annually to
cover certain risks. It will never exceed 1.59% annually.           

The asset-based insurance charge compensates us for:                

          -      costs associated with the establishment and administration of
the Contract;                               

        -      mortality risks we assume for the annuity payment and death
   benefit guarantees made under the Contract; and

  -      expense risks we assume to cover Contract maintenance
expenses.                                   

     We deduct the asset-based insurance charge daily from the net asset value
of the Account. This charge ends on the annuity date.               

CONTRACT FEE 

We impose a $40 contract fee each year to reimburse us for expenses 
  related to maintenance of the Contract only if the greater of contract
      value, or premiums less withdrawals, is less than $25,000. Accordingly, if
     your withdrawals have not decreased your investment in the Contract below
      $25,000, we will not impose this annual fee. We may also waive this fee in
  certain circumstances where you own at least three Contracts. This fee
ends after the annuity date.                                        

PREMIUM TAXES 

      On the annuity date, we deduct a charge for any premium taxes imposed by a
  state or local government. Premium tax rates vary from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. They currently range from 0% to 5%.                   

You can find detailed information about all fees and charges imposed on the     
Contract under "Charges and Deductions".                                        

TRANSFERS AMONG SUBACCOUNTS 

Before the annuity date, you may transfer all or part of your contract value    
among the subaccounts up to twelve times per contract year without charge. You  
may make more than twelve transfers among available subaccounts, but we may     
charge $25 per extra transfer. (See "Transfers".)                               

Several specialized transfer programs are available under the Contract. You     
cannot use more than one such program at a time. First, we offer a Dollar Cost  
Averaging Program where money you've put in a designated subaccount is          
systematically transferred monthly into other subaccounts you select without    
charge. The main objective of this program is to minimize the impact of         
short-term price fluctuations to allow you to take advantage of market          
fluctuations. (See "Dollar Cost Averaging Program".) (There is no guarantee that
Dollar Cost Averaging will result in lower average prices or protect against    
market loss.)

Second, through participation in the Asset Allocation Program, you may have your
contract value invested under one of five asset allocation models. Your contract
value is then rebalanced quarterly based on the asset allocation model selected.
(See "Asset Allocation Program".)                                               

Third, you may also choose to participate in a Rebalancing Program where we     
automatically reallocate your contract value quarterly in order to maintain a   
particular percentage allocation among the subaccounts that you select. (See    
"Rebalancing Program".)                                                         

WITHDRAWALS 

You can withdraw money from the Contract six times each contract year.          
Additionally, under a Systematic Withdrawal Program, you may have automatic     
withdrawals of a specified dollar amount made monthly, quarterly, semi-annually,
or annually. These systematic withdrawals are in addition to the annual six     
withdrawals permitted under the Contract. For more information, see "Systematic
Withdrawal Program".                                                            

A withdrawal may have adverse tax consequences, including the imposition of a   
penalty tax on withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 (see "Federal Income Taxes").    

DEATH BENEFIT 

Regardless of investment experience, the Contract provides a guaranteed minimum 
death benefit if you die before the annuity date.                               

If you are age 80 or over when the Contract is issued, the death benefit equals 
the greater of premiums less adjusted withdrawals or the contract value. If you 
are under age 80 when the Contract is issued, the death benefit equals the      
greatest of premiums less adjusted withdrawals, the contract value, or the      
Maximum Anniversary Value. Maximum Anniversary Value equals the greatest        
anniversary value for the Contract.                                             

You can find more detailed information about the death benefit and how it is    
calculated, including age limitations that apply, under "Death Benefit".        

ANNUITY PAYMENTS 

Annuity payments begin on the annuity date and are made under the annuity option
you select. You may select an annuity date that cannot be later than the        
annuitant's 90th birthday. If you do not select an annuity date, the annuity    
date for nonqualified Contracts is the annuitant's 90th birthday. The annuity   
date for IRA or tax sheltered annuity Contracts is when the owner/annuitant     
reaches age 70 1/2.                                                             

Details about the annuity options available under the Contract can be found     
under "Annuity Options".                                                        

TEN DAY REVIEW 

When you receive the Contract, read it carefully to make sure it's what you     
want. Generally, within 10 days after you receive the Contract, you may return  
it for a refund. Some states allow a longer period of time to return the        
Contract. To get a refund, return the Contract to the Service Center or to the  
Financial Consultant who sold it. We will then refund the greater of all        
premiums paid into the Contract or the contract value as of the date you return 
the Contract. For contracts issued in Pennsylvania, we'll refund the contract   
value as of the date you return the Contract.

Because there is no contingent deferred sales charge, you would pay the same    
expenses whether you surrender your Contract at the end of the applicable time  
period or not, based on the same assumptions.

The preceding Fee Table and Examples help you understand the costs and expenses 
you will bear, directly or indirectly. The Fee Table and Examples include       
expenses and charges of the Account as well as the Funds. The Examples do not   
reflect the $40 contract fee because, based on our estimates of average contract
size and withdrawals, its effect on the examples shown would be negligible.     
Premium taxes may also be applicable. See the CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS section in

The subaccounts available under the Contract have not yet commenced

NOTES TO FEE TABLE

(a)   Merrill Lynch Asset Management, L.P. ("MLAM") and Merrill Lynch Life      
    Agency, Inc. have entered into a Reimbursement Agreement that limits the
     operating expenses, exclusive of any distribution fees imposed on Class B
      shares, paid by each Fund of the Merrill Lynch Variable Series Funds, Inc.
  in a given year to 1.25% of its average net assets. This Reimbursement
Agreement is expected to remain in effect for the current year.     

(b)   "Other Expenses" and "Total Annual Operating Expenses" shown for the      
    Mercury V.I. U.S. Large Cap Fund are based on expenses estimated for the
current fiscal year. Mercury Asset Management International Ltd. has
   agreed to limit for one year the operating expenses paid by the Mercury
V.I. U.S. Large Cap Fund to 1.25% of its average net assets.        

(c)   The Fee Table does not reflect fees waived or expenses assumed by Alliance
Capital Management L.P. ("Alliance") for the Alliance Premier Growth
Portfolio during the year ended December 31, 1998. Such waivers and 
assumption of expenses were made on a voluntary basis. Alliance may 
  discontinue or reduce any such waiver or assumption of expenses at any
time without notice. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998,
   Alliance waived management fees totaling 0.03% for the Alliance Premier
   Growth Portfolio. Considering such reimbursements, "Investment Advisory
   Fees" would have been 0.97% and "Total Annual Operating Expenses" would
have been 1.06%.

YIELDS AND TOTAL RETURNS

From time to time, we may advertise yields, effective yields, and total returns 
for the subaccounts. THESE FIGURES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EARNINGS AND DO NOT  
INDICATE OR PROJECT FUTURE PERFORMANCE. We may also advertise performance of the
subaccounts in comparison to certain performance rankings and indices. More     
detailed information on the calculation of performance information, as well as  
comparisons with unmanaged market indices, appears in the Statement of          
Additional Information.                                                         

Effective yields and total returns for a subaccount are based on the investment 
performance of the corresponding Fund. Fund expenses influence Fund performance.

The yield of the Domestic Money Market Subaccount refers to the annualized      
income generated by an investment in the subaccount over a specified 7-day      
period. The yield is calculated by assuming that the income generated for that  
7-day period is generated each 7-day period over a 52-week period and is shown  
as a percentage of the investment. The effective yield is calculated similarly  
but, when annualized, the income earned by an investment is assumed to be       
reinvested. The effective yield will be slightly higher than the yield because  
of the compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment.                         

The yield of a subaccount (besides the Domestic Money Market Subaccount) refers 
to the annualized income generated by an investment in the subaccount over a    
specified 30-day or one month period. The yield is calculated by assuming the   
income generated by the investment during that 30-day or one-month period is    
generated each period over 12 months and is shown as a percentage of the        
investment.                                                                     

The average annual total return of a subaccount refers to return quotations     
assuming an investment has been held in each subaccount for 1, 5 and 10 years,  
or for a shorter period, if applicable. The average annual total returns        
represent the average compounded rates of return that would cause an initial    
investment of $1,000 to equal the value of that investment at the end of each   
period. These percentages exclude any deductions for premium taxes.             

We may also advertise or present yield or total return performance information  
computed on different bases, but this information will always be accompanied by 
average annual total returns for the corresponding subaccounts. We may also     
advertise total return performance information for the Funds. We may also       
present total return performance information for a subaccount for periods before
the date the subaccount commenced operations. If we do, we'll base performance  
of the corresponding Fund as if the subaccount existed for the same periods as  
those indicated for the corresponding Fund, with a level of fees and charges    
equal to those currently imposed under the Contracts. We may also present total 
performance information for a hypothetical Contract assuming allocation of the  
initial premium to more than one subaccount or assuming monthly transfers from  
one subaccount to designated other subaccounts under a Dollar Cost Averaging    
Program. We may also present total performance information for a hypothetical   
Contract assuming participation in the Asset Allocation Program or the          
Rebalancing Program. This information will reflect the performance of the       
affected subaccounts for the duration of the allocation under the hypothetical  
Contract. It will also reflect the deduction of charges described above. This   
information may also be compared to various indices.                            

Advertising and sales literature for the Contracts may also compare the         
performance of the subaccounts and Funds to the performance of other variable   
annuity issuers in general or to the performance of particular types of variable
annuities investing in mutual funds, with investment objectives similar to each 
of the Funds corresponding to the subaccounts.                                  

Performance information may also be based on rankings by services which monitor 
and rank the performance of variable annuity issuers in each of the major       
categories of investment objectives on an

comparison are Lipper, VARDS, CDA/Weisenberger, Morningstar, MICROPAL, and      
Investment Company Data, Inc.                                                   

Advertising and sales literature for the Contracts may also compare the         
performance of the subaccounts to the Standard & Poor's Index of 500 Common     
Stocks, the Morgan Stanley EAFE Index, the Russell 2000 Index and the Dow Jones 
Indices, all widely used measures of stock market performance. These unmanaged  
indices assume the reinvestment of dividends, but do not reflect any "deduction"
for the expense of operating or managing an investment portfolio. Other sources 
of performance comparison that we may use are Chase Investment Performance      
Digest, Money, Forbes, Fortune, Business Week, Financial Services Weekly,       
Kiplinger Personal Finance, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Barrons, U.S. News &

Advertising and sales literature for the Contracts may also contain information 
on the effect of tax deferred compounding on subaccount investment returns, or  
returns in general. The tax deferral may be illustrated by graphs and charts and
may include a comparison at various points in time of the return from an        
investment in a Contract (or returns in general) on a tax-deferred basis        
(assuming one or more tax rates) with the return on a currently taxable basis.  

MERRILL LYNCH LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY

We are a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of  
Washington on January 27, 1986. We changed our corporate location to Arkansas on
August 31, 1991. We are an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch &  
Co., Inc., a corporation whose common stock is traded on the New York Stock     
Exchange.                                                                       

Our financial statements can be found in the Statement of Additional            
Information. You should consider them only in the context of our ability to meet
any Contract obligation.                                                        

 THE ACCOUNT

The Merrill Lynch Life Variable Annuity Separate Account A (the "Account")      
offers through its subaccounts a variety of investment options. Each option has 
a different investment objective.                                               

We established the Account on August 6, 1991. It is governed by Arkansas law,   
our state of domicile. The Account is registered with the Securities and        
Exchange Commission as a unit investment trust under the Investment Company     
Act of 1940. The Account meets the definition of a separate account under the   
federal securities laws. The Account's assets are SEGREGATED from all of our    
other assets.                                                                   

SEGREGATION OF ACCOUNT ASSETS 

Obligations to contract owners and beneficiaries that arise under the Contract  
are our obligations. We own all of the assets in the Account. The Account's     
income, gains, and losses, whether or not realized, derived from Account assets 
are credited to or charged against the Account without regard to our other      
income, gains or losses. The assets in each Account will always be at least     
equal to the reserves and other liabilities of the Account. If the Account's    
assets exceed the required reserves and other Contract liabilities, we may      
transfer the excess to our general account. Under Arkansas insurance law the    
assets in the Account, to the extent of its reserves and liabilities, may not be
charged with liabilities arising out of any other business we conduct nor may   
the assets of the Account be charged with any liabilities of other separate     
accounts.

NUMBER OF SUBACCOUNTS; SUBACCOUNT INVESTMENTS 

There are 11 subaccounts currently available through the Account. All           
subaccounts invest in a corresponding portfolio of the Merrill Lynch Variable   
Series Funds, Inc. (the "Variable Series Funds"); the AIM Variable Insurance    
Funds, Inc. (the "AIM V.I. Funds"); the Alliance Variable Products Series Fund, 
Inc. (the "Alliance Fund"); the MFS-Registered Trademark- Variable Insurance    
Trust-SM- (the "MFS Trust"); the Hotchkis and Wiley Variable Trust (the         
"Hotchkis and Wiley Trust"); or the Mercury Asset Management V.I. Funds, Inc.   
(the "Mercury V.I. Funds"). Additional subaccounts may be added or closed in    
the future.                                                                     

Although the investment objectives and policies of certain Funds are similar to 
the investment objectives and policies of other portfolios that may be managed  
or sponsored by the same investment adviser, manager, or sponsor, nevertheless, 
we do not represent or assure that the investment results will be comparable to 
any other portfolio, even where the investment advisors or manager is the same. 
Differences in portfolio size, actual investments held, fund expenses, and other
factors all contribute to differences in fund performance. For all of these     
reasons, you should expect investment results to differ. In particular, certain 
funds available only through the Contract have names similar to funds not       
available through the Contract. The performance of a fund not available through 
the Contract does not indicate performance of the similarly named fund available
through the Contract.                                                           

INVESTMENTS OF THE ACCOUNT

GENERAL INFORMATION AND INVESTMENT RISKS 

Information about investment objectives, management, policies, restrictions,    
expenses, risks, and all other aspects of fund operations can be found in the   
Funds' prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information. Read these        
carefully before investing. Fund shares are currently sold to our separate      
accounts as well as separate accounts of ML Life Insurance Company of New York  
(an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.), and         
insurance companies not affiliated with us, to fund benefits under certain      
variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts. Shares of these funds   
may be offered in the future to certain pension or retirement plans.            

Generally, you should consider the funds as long-term investments and vehicles  
for diversification, but not as a balanced investment program. Many of these    
funds may not be appropriate as the exclusive investment to fund a Contract for 
all contract owners. The Fund prospectuses also describe certain additional     
risks, including investing on an international basis or in foreign securities   
and investing in lower rated or unrated fixed income securities. There is no    
guarantee that any fund will be able to meet its investment objectives. Meeting 
these objectives depends upon future economic conditions and upon how well Fund 
management anticipates changes in economic conditions.

Plainsboro, New Jersey 08536. As the investment adviser, it is paid fees by     
these Funds for its services. The fees charged to each of these Funds are set   
forth in the summary below.                                                     

MLAM has entered into an agreement with Merrill Lynch Insurance Group, Inc.     
("MLIG"), an affiliate of ours, under which MLIG provides administration        
services for the Funds of Variable Series Funds used with the Contracts and     
other variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts we issue. Under    
this agreement, MLAM compensates MLIG in an amount equal to a portion of the    
annual gross investment advisory fees paid by these Funds to MLAM attributable  
to contracts we issue. MLAM and Merrill Lynch Life Agency, Inc. have entered    
into a Reimbursement Agreement that limits the operating expenses paid by each  
Fund of the Variable Series Funds in a given year to 1.25% of its average net   
assets (see "Selling the Contract").                                            

BASIC VALUE FOCUS FUND. This Fund seeks capital appreciation and, secondarily,  
income by investing in securities, primarily equities, that management of the   
Fund believes are undervalued and therefore represent basic investment value.   
MLAM receives an advisory fee from the Fund at the annual rate of 0.60% of the  
average daily net assets of the Fund.                                           

DOMESTIC MONEY MARKET FUND. This Fund seeks to preserve capital, maintain       
liquidity, and achieve the highest possible current income consistent with the  
foregoing objectives by investing in short-term domestic money market           
securities. MLAM receives an advisory fee from the Fund at the annual rate of   
0.50% of the average daily net assets of the Fund.                              

GOVERNMENT BOND FUND. This Fund seeks the highest possible current income       
consistent with the protection of capital afforded by investing in debt         
securities issued or guaranteed by the United States Government, its agencies or
instrumentalities. MLAM receives an advisory fee from the Fund at an annual rate
of 0.50% of the average daily net assets of the Fund.                           

INDEX 500 FUND. This Fund seeks investment results that, before expenses,       
correspond to the aggregate price and yield performance of the Standard & Poor's
500 Composite Stock Price Index (the "S&P 500 Index"). MLAM receives an advisory
fee from the Fund at an annual rate of 0.30% of the Fund's average daily net    
assets.                                                                         

SPECIAL VALUE FOCUS FUND. This Fund seeks long term growth of capital by        
investing in a diversified portfolio of securities, primarily common stocks, of 
relatively small companies that management of the Variable Series Funds believes
have special investment value, and of emerging growth companies regardless of   
size. MLAM receives an advisory fee from the Fund at the annual rate of 0.75% of
the average daily net assets of the Fund. This is a higher fee than that of many
other mutual funds, but management of the Fund believes it is justified by the  
high degree of care that must be given to the initial selection and continuous  
supervision of the types of portfolio securities in which the Fund invests.

assets of these Funds attributable to the Contracts.                            

AIM V.I. CAPITAL APPRECIATION FUND. This Fund seeks growth of capital through   
investment in common stocks, with emphasis on medium and small-sized growth     
companies. AIM receives an advisory fee from the Fund at an annual rate of 0.65%

owned by the companies issuing the securities or relative to the equity market  
generally. Income is a secondary objective. AIM receives an advisory fee from   
the Fund at an annual rate of 0.65% of the first $250 million of the Fund's     
average daily net assets and 0.60% of the Fund's average daily net assets in    
excess of $250 million.

ALLIANCE PREMIER GROWTH PORTFOLIO. This Fund seeks growth of capital by pursuing
aggressive investment policies. Since investments will be made based upon their 
potential for capital appreciation, current income is incidental to the

MATERIAL CONFLICTS, SUBSTITUTION OF INVESTMENTS AND CHANGES TO THE ACCOUNT 

It is conceivable that material conflicts could arise as a result of both       
variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts investing in the 
Funds. Although no material conflicts are foreseen, the participating insurance 
companies will monitor events in order to identify any material conflicts       
between variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners to         
determine what action, if any, should be taken. Material conflicts could result 
from such things as (1) changes in state insurance law, (2) changes in federal  
income tax law or (3) differences between voting instructions given by variable 
annuity and variable life insurance contract owners. If a conflict occurs, we   
may be required to eliminate one or more subaccounts of the Account or          
substitute a new subaccount. In responding to any conflict, we will take the    
action we believe necessary to protect our contract owners.                     

We may substitute a different investment option for any of the current Funds. We
can do this for both existing investments and the investment of future premiums.
However, before any such substitution, we would need the approval of the        
Securities and Exchange Commission and applicable state insurance departments.  
We will notify you of any substitutions.                                        

We may also add new subaccounts to the Account, eliminate subaccounts in the    
Account, deregister the Account under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the   
"1940 Act"), make any changes required by the 1940 Act, operate the Account as a
managed investment company under the 1940 Act or any other form permitted by    
law, transfer all or a portion of the assets of a subaccount or separate account
to another subaccount or separate account pursuant to a combination or          
otherwise, and create new separate accounts. Before we make certain changes we  
need approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission and applicable state    
insurance departments. We will notify you of any changes.

CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS

We deduct the charges described below to cover costs and expenses, services     
provided, and risks assumed under the Contracts. The amount of a charge may not 
necessarily correspond to the costs associated with providing the services or   
benefits.                                                                       

ASSET-BASED INSURANCE CHARGE 

We currently impose an asset-based insurance charge on the Account that equals  
1.59% annually. It will never exceed 1.59%.                                     

We deduct this charge daily from the net asset value of the subaccounts. This   
amount compensates us for mortality risks we assume for the annuity payment and 
death benefit guarantees made under the Contract. These guarantees include      
making annuity payments which won't change based on our actual mortality        
experience, and providing a guaranteed minimum death benefit under the Contract.

The charge also compensates us for expense risks we assume to cover Contract    
maintenance expenses. These expenses may include issuing Contracts, maintaining 
records, and performing accounting, regulatory compliance, and reporting        
functions. Finally, this charge compensates us for costs associated with the    
establishment and administration of the Contract, including programs like       
transfers and Dollar Cost Averaging.                                            

If the asset-based insurance charge is inadequate to cover the actual expenses  
of mortality, maintenance, and administration, we will bear the loss. If the    
charge exceeds the actual expenses, we will add the excess to our profit and it 
may be used to finance distribution expenses.                                   

CONTRACT FEE 

We may charge a $40 contract fee each year. We will only impose this fee if the 
greater of contract value, or premiums less withdrawals, is less than $25,000.  
Accordingly, if you have not made any withdrawals from your Contract (or your   
withdrawals have not decreased your investment in the Contract below $25,000),  
we will not impose this annual fee.                                             

The contract fee reimburses us for additional expenses related to maintenance of
certain Contracts with lower contract values. We do not deduct the contract fee 
after the annuity date. The contract fee will never increase.                   

If the contract fee applies, we will deduct it as follows:                      

-      We deduct this fee from your contract value on each contract 
anniversary that occurs on or before the annuity date.

   -      We deduct this fee from your contract value if you surrender the
 contract on any date other than a contract anniversary.

-      We deduct this fee on a pro rata basis from among all        
subaccounts in which your contract value is invested. 

Currently, a contract owner of three or more Contracts will be assessed no more 
than $120 in contract fees annually. We reserve the right to change this limit  
on contract fees at any time.

OTHER CHARGES 

TRANSFER CHARGES 

You may make up to twelve transfers among subaccounts per contract year without 
charge. If you make more than twelve, we may, but currently do not, charge you  
$25 for each extra transfer. We deduct this charge pro rata from the subaccounts
from which you are transferring contract value. Currently, transfers made by us 
under the Dollar Cost Averaging Program, the Asset Allocation Program, and the  
Rebalancing Program will not count toward the twelve transfers permitted among  
subaccounts per contract year without charge. (See "Dollar Cost Averaging
Program", "Asset Allocation Program", "Rebalancing Program", and "Transfers".)  

TAX CHARGES 

We reserve the right, subject to any necessary regulatory approval, to charge   
for assessments or federal premium taxes or federal, state or local excise,     
profits or income taxes measured by or attributable to the receipt of premiums. 
We also reserve the right to deduct from the Account any taxes imposed on the   
Account's investment earnings. (See "Tax Status of the Contract".)              

FUND EXPENSES 

In calculating net asset value, the Funds deduct advisory fees and operating    
expenses from assets. Information about those fees and expenses can be found in 
the attached prospectuses for the Funds, and in the Statement of Additional     
Information for each Fund.                                                      

PREMIUM TAXES 

Various states and municipalities impose a premium tax on annuity premiums when 
they are received by an insurance company. In other jurisdictions, a premium tax
is paid on the contract value on the annuity date.                              

Premium tax rates vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and currently range    
from 0% to 5%. Although we pay these taxes when due, we won't deduct them from  
your contract value until the annuity date. In those jurisdictions that do not  
allow an insurance company to reduce its current taxable premium income by the  
amount of any withdrawal, surrender or death benefit paid, we will also deduct a
charge for these taxes on any withdrawal, surrender or death benefit paid under 
the Contract.                                                                   

Premium tax rates are subject to change by law, administrative interpretations, 
or court decisions. Premium tax amounts will depend on, among other things, the 
contract owner's state of residence, our status within that state, and the      
premium tax laws of that state.                                                 

 FEATURES AND BENEFITS OF THE CONTRACT

As we describe the contract, we will often use the word "you". In this context  
"you" means "contract owner".                                                   

OWNERSHIP OF THE CONTRACT 

The contract owner is entitled to exercise all rights under the Contract. Unless
otherwise specified, the purchaser of the Contract will be the contract owner.  
The Contract can be owned by a trust or a corporation. However, special tax     
rules apply to Contracts owned by "non-natural persons" such as corporations or 

21

P-->N-424th�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
trusts. If you are a human being, you are considered a "natural person." You may
designate a beneficiary. If you die, the beneficiary will receive a death       
benefit. You may also designate an annuitant. You may change the annuitant at   
any time prior to the annuity date. If you don't select an annuitant, you are   
the annuitant.                                                                  

If a non-natural person owns the Contract and changes the annuitant, the        
Internal Revenue Code (IRC) requires us to treat the change as the death of a   
contract owner. We will then pay the beneficiary the death benefit.             

Only spouses may be co-owners of the Contract. When co-owners are established,  
they exercise all rights under the Contract jointly unless they elect otherwise.
Co-owner spouses must each be designated as beneficiary for the other. Co-owners
may also designate a beneficiary to receive benefits on the surviving co-owner's
death. IRA Contracts may not have co-owners.                                    

You may assign the Contract to someone else by giving notice to our Service     
Center. Only complete ownership of the Contract may be assigned to someone else.
You can't do it in part. An assignment to a new owner cancels all prior         
beneficiary designations except a prior irrevocable beneficiary designation.    
Assignment of the Contract may have tax consequences or may be prohibited on    
certain IRA Contracts, so you should consult with a qualified tax adviser before
assigning the Contract. (See "Federal Income Taxes".)                           

ISSUING THE CONTRACT 

ISSUE AGE 

You can buy a nonqualified Contract if you (and any co-owner) are less than 90  
years old. Annuitants on nonqualified Contracts must also be less than 90 years 
old when we issue the Contract. For qualified Contracts owned by natural        
persons, the contract owner and annuitant must be the same person. Contract     
owners and annuitants on qualified Contracts must be less than 70 1/2 years old 
when we issue the Contract.                                                     

INFORMATION WE NEED TO ISSUE THE CONTRACT 

Before we issue the Contract, we need certain information from you. We may      
require you to complete and return a written application in certain             
circumstances, such as when the Contract is being issued to replace, or in      
exchange for, another annuity or life insurance contract. Once we review and    
approve that information or application, and you pay the initial premium, we'll 
issue a Contract. Generally, we'll issue the Contract and invest the premium    
within two business days of our receiving your premium. If we haven't received  
necessary information within five business days, however, we will offer to      
return the premium and no Contract will be issued. You can consent to our       
holding the premium until we get all necessary information, and then we will    
invest the premium within two business days after we get the information.       

TEN DAY RIGHT TO REVIEW 

When you get the Contract, review it carefully to make sure it is what you      
intended to purchase. Generally, within ten days after you receive the Contract,
you may return it for a refund. The Contract will then be deemed void. Some     
states allow a longer period of time to return the Contract. To get a refund,   
return the Contract to our Service Center or to the Financial Consultant who    
sold it. We will then refund the greater of all premiums paid into the Contract 
or the contract value as of the date the Contract is returned. For contracts    
issued in Pennsylvania, we'll refund the contract value as of the date the      
Contract is returned.                                                           

22

P-->N-425th�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
PREMIUMS 

MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PREMIUMS 

Initial premium payments must be $25,000 or more. Subsequent premium payments   
generally must be $100 or more. You can make subsequent premium payments at any 
time before the annuity date. The maximum premium that will be accepted without 
Company approval is $1,000,000. We also reserve the right to reject subsequent  
premium payments.                                                               

The Contract is available as a non-qualified contract or may be issued as an IRA
or purchased through an established IRA or Roth IRA custodial account with      
MLPF&S. Federal law limits maximum annual contributions to IRAs and Roth IRAs.  
Transfer amounts from tax-sheltered annuity plans that are not subject to the   
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, will be accepted as
premium payments, as permitted by law. Other premium payments will not be       
accepted under a Contract used as a tax sheltered annuity. We may waive the $100
minimum for premiums paid under IRA Contracts held in custodial accounts with   
MLPF&S where you're transferring the complete cash balance of such account into 
a Contract.                                                                     

HOW TO MAKE PAYMENTS 

You can pay premiums directly to our Service Center at the address printed on   
the cover of this Prospectus or have money debited from your MLPF&S brokerage   
account.                                                                        

AUTOMATIC INVESTMENT FEATURE 

You may make systematic premium payments on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual   
or annual basis. Each payment must be for at least $100. Premiums paid under    
this feature must be deducted from an MLPF&S brokerage account specified by     
you and acceptable to us. You must specify how premiums paid under this         
feature will be allocated among the subaccounts. If you select the Asset        
Allocation Program or the Rebalancing Program, premiums will be allocated       
based on the model or the specified subaccounts and percentages you have        
selected. You may change the specified premium amount, the premium              
allocation, or cancel the Automatic Investment Feature at any time upon         
notice to us. We reserve the right to make changes to this program at any       
time.                                                                           

PREMIUM INVESTMENTS 

For the first 14 days following the contract date, we'll hold all premiums in   
the Domestic Money Market Subaccount. After the 14 days, we'll reallocate the   
contract value to the subaccounts you selected. (In Pennsylvania, we'll invest  
all premiums as of the contract date in the subaccounts you selected.)          

Currently, you may allocate your premium among 10 of the subaccounts.           
Allocations must be made in whole numbers. For example, 12% of a premium        
received may be allocated to the Basic Value Focus Subaccount, 58% allocated to 
the Government Bond Subaccount, and 30% allocated to the Index 500 Subaccount.  
However, you may not allocate 33 1/3% to the Basic Value Focus Subaccount and   
66 2/3% to the Government Bond Subaccount. If we don't get allocation           
instructions when we receive subsequent premiums, we will allocate those        
premiums according to the allocation instructions you last gave us. We reserve  
the right to modify the limit on the number of subaccounts to which future      
allocations may be made.                                                        

23

P-->N-426th�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
ACCUMULATION UNITS 

Each subaccount has a distinct value, called the accumulation unit value. The   
accumulation unit value for a subaccount varies daily with the performance and  
expenses of the corresponding fund. We use this value to determine the number of
subaccount accumulation units represented by your investment in a subaccount.   

--------------------------------------------------------------
HOW ARE MY CONTRACT TRANSACTIONS PRICED?

We calculate an accumulation unit value for each subaccount 
at the close of business on each day that the New York Stock
Exchange is open. Transactions are priced, which means that 
accumulation units in your Contract are purchased (added to 
your Contract) or redeemed (taken out of your contract), at 
the unit value next calculated after our Service Center     
receives notice of the transaction. For premium payments and
 transfers into a subaccount, units are purchased. For payment
of Contract proceeds (i.e., withdrawals, surrenders,        
annuitization, and death benefits), transfers out of a      
 subaccount, and deductions for any contract fee, any transfer
charge, and any premium taxes due, units are redeemed.      

--------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------
HOW DO WE DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF UNITS?

 We determine the number of units by dividing the dollar value
of the amount of the purchase or transfer allocated to the  
subaccount by the value of one accumulation unit for that   
subaccount for the valuation period in which the purchase or
transfer is made. The number of accumulation units in each  
subaccount credited to a Contract will therefore increase or
decrease as these transactions are made. The number of      
 subaccount accumulation units credited to a Contract will not
change as a result of investment experience or the deduction
of asset-based insurance charges. Instead, this charge and  
investment experience are reflected in the accumulation unit
value.                                                      

--------------------------------------------------------------

When we first established each subaccount, we arbitrarily set the value of an   
accumulation unit at $10. Accumulation unit values increase, decrease, or stay  
the same from one valuation period to the next. An accumulation unit value for  
any valuation period is determined by multiplying the accumulation unit value   
for the prior valuation period by the net investment factor for the subaccount  
for the current valuation period.                                               

The net investment factor is an index used to measure the investment performance
of a subaccount from one valuation period to the next. For any subaccount, we   
determine the net investment factor by dividing the value of the assets of the  
subaccount for that valuation period by the value of the assets of the          
subaccount for the preceding valuation period. We subtract from that result the 
daily equivalent of the asset-based insurance charge for the valuation period.  
We also take reinvestment of dividends and capital gains into account when we   
determine the net investment factor.                                            

24

P-->N-427th�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
We may adjust the net investment factor to make provisions for any change in tax
law that requires us to pay tax on earnings in the Account or any charge that   
may be assessed against the Account for assessments or federal premium taxes or 
federal, state or local excise, profits or income taxes measured by or          
attributable to the receipt of premiums. (See "Other Charges".)                 

 ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL CONTRACTS

DEATH OF ANNUITANT PRIOR TO ANNUITY DATE 

If the annuitant dies before the annuity date, and the annuitant is not a       
contract owner, the owner may designate a new annuitant. If a new annuitant is  
not designated, the contract owner will become the annuitant unless any owner is
not a natural person. If any contract owner is not a natural person, no new     
annuitant may be named and the death benefit will be paid to the beneficiary.   

TRANSFERS AMONG SUBACCOUNTS 

Before the annuity date, you may transfer all or part of your contract value    
among the subaccounts up to twelve times per contract year without charge. You  
can make additional transfers among subaccounts, but we may charge you $25 for  
each extra transfer. We will deduct the transfer charge pro rata from among the 
subaccounts you're transferring from. Currently, transfers made by us under the 
Dollar Cost Averaging Program, the Asset Allocation Program, and the Rebalancing
Program will not count toward the twelve transfers permitted among subaccounts  
per contract year without charge. (See "Dollar Cost Averaging Program", "Asset
Allocation Program", and "Rebalancing Program".) We reserve the right to change 
the number of additional transfers permitted each contract year.                

Transfers among subaccounts may be made in specific dollar amounts or as a      
percentage of contract value. You must transfer at least $100 or the total value
of a subaccount, if less.                                                       

You may request transfers in writing or by telephone, once we get proper        
telephone transfer authorization. Transfer requests may also be made through    
your Merrill Lynch Financial Consultant, or another person you designate, once  
we receive proper authorization. Transfers will take effect as of the end of the
valuation period on the date the Service Center receives the request. We will   
consider telephone transfer requests received after 4:00 p.m. (ET) to be        
received the following business day.                                            

An excessive number of transfers, including short-term "market timing"          
transfers, may adversely affect the performance of the underlying fund in which 
a subaccount invests. If, in our sole opinion, a pattern of excessive transfers 
develops, we reserve the right not to process a transfer request. We also       
reserve the right not to process a transfer request when the sale or purchase of
shares of a Fund is not reasonably practicable due to actions taken or          
limitations imposed by the Fund.                                                

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PROGRAM 

WHAT IS IT? 

The Contract offers an optional transfer program called Dollar Cost Averaging   
("DCA"). This program allows you to reallocate money at monthly intervals from a
designated subaccount to one or more other subaccounts. The DCA Program is      
intended to reduce the effect of short term price fluctuations on investment    
cost. Since we transfer the same dollar amount to selected subaccounts monthly, 
the DCA Program allows you to purchase more accumulation units when prices are  
low and fewer accumulation units when prices are high. Therefore, you may       
achieve a lower average cost per accumulation unit over the long-term. However, 
it is important to understand that a DCA Program does not assure a profit or    
protect                                                                         

25

P-->N-428th�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
against loss in a declining market. If you choose to participate in the DCA     
Program you should have the financial ability to continue making investments    
through periods of low price levels.                                            

If you choose to participate in the DCA Program, each month we will transfer    
amounts from the subaccount that you designate and allocate them, in accordance 
with your allocation instructions, to the subaccounts that you select.          

If you choose the Asset Allocation Program or the Rebalancing Program, you      
cannot use the DCA Program. We reserve the right to make changes to this program
at any time.                                                                    

PARTICIPATING IN THE DCA PROGRAM                                    

You can choose the DCA Program any time before the annuity date. To choose the  
DCA Program, we must receive a written request from you. Once you start using   
the DCA Program, you must continue it for at least three months. After three    
months, you may cancel the DCA Program at any time by notifying us in writing.  
Once you reach the annuity date, you may no longer use this program.            

MINIMUM AMOUNTS 

To elect the DCA Program , you need to have a minimum amount of money in the    
designated subaccount. We determine the amount required by multiplying the      
specified length of your DCA Program in months by your specified monthly        
transfer amount. Amounts of $100 or more must be allotted for transfer each     
month in the DCA Program. We reserve the right to change these minimums.        
Allocations must be designated in whole percentage increments. No specific      
dollar amount designations may be made. Should the amount in your selected      
subaccount drop below the selected monthly transfer amount, we'll notify you    
that you need to put more money in to continue the program.                     

WHEN DO WE MAKE DCA TRANSFERS? 

You select the date for DCA transfers. We will make the first DCA transfer on   
the selected date following the later of 14 days after the contract date or the 
date we receive notice of your DCA election at our Service Center. We'll make   
subsequent DCA transfers on the same day of each succeeding month. Currently, we
don't charge for DCA transfers; they are in addition to the twelve annual       
transfers permitted without charge under the Contract.                          

ASSET ALLOCATION PROGRAM 

Under the Asset Allocation Program, we will allocate your premiums and contract 
value according to an asset allocation model you select based on your investment
goals and risk tolerance. There are currently five asset allocation models to   
choose from:                                                                    

-     Capital Preservation

Each model identifies specific subaccounts and the percentage of premium or     
contract value which should be allocated to each of those subaccounts. We may   
periodically adjust the composition of each model. Any adjustments become       
effective at the end of the calendar quarter.                                   

The asset allocation models are not recommendations, have not been designed     
with your specific financial circumstances in mind, and may not be              
appropriate for any particular individual.  There may be other allocations      
that would be more appropriate to satisy your needs and goals.

P-->N-429th�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
When you elect the Asset Allocation Program, we allocate your premium or        
contract value in accordance with your selected model. On the last business day 
of each calendar quarter, we automatically reallocate your contract value to    
maintain the subaccounts and percentages for your selected model.               

We perform this periodic rebalancing to take account of:                        

     -     increases and decreases in contract value in each subaccount due to
subaccount performance,                                 

     -     increases and decreases in contract value in each subaccount due to
withdrawals, transfers, and premiums, and               

-     any adjustments we make to your selected model.               

Asset allocation can be elected at issue or at any time subsequent. To elect the
Asset Allocation Program, we must receive a written request from you. If you    
elect the Asset Allocation Program, you must include all contract value in the  
program. Unless you instruct us otherwise, we allocate premiums in accordance   
with your selected model. The asset allocation model that you select under the  
program will override any prior percentage allocations that you have chosen and 
we will allocate all future premiums accordingly. You may change your selected  
model at any time. Once elected, you may instruct us, in a written form         
satisfactory to us, at any time to terminate the program. Currently, we don't   
charge for transfers under this program; they are in addition to the twelve     
annual transfers permitted without charge under the Contract.                   

We reserve the right to make changes to this program at any time. If you choose 
the Rebalancing Program or the DCA Program, you cannot use the Asset Allocation 
Program.                                                                        

REBALANCING PROGRAM 

You may choose the Rebalancing Program, where you select the percentage of      
premiums and contract value which are to be allocated to the subaccounts you    
select based on your investment goals and risk tolerance.                       

When you elect the Rebalancing Program, we allocate your premiums or contract   
value in accordance with the subaccounts and percentages you have selected.     
On the last business day of each calendar quarter, we automatically             
reallocate your contract value to maintain the particular percentage            
allocation among the subaccounts that you have selected.                        

We perform this periodic rebalancing to take account of:                        

     -     increases and decreases in contract value in each subaccount due to
subaccount performance, and                             

     -     increases and decreases in contract value in each subaccount due to
withdrawals, transfers, and premiums.                   

To elect the Rebalancing Program, we must receive a written request from you. If
you elect the Rebalancing Program, you must include all contract value in the   
automatic reallocation. Unless you instruct us otherwise, we allocate premiums  
in accordance with the particular percentage allocation among the subaccounts   
that you have selected. The percentages that you select under the Rebalancing   
Program will override any prior percentage allocations that you have chosen and 
we will allocate all future premiums accordingly. Once elected, you may instruct
us, in a written form satisfactory to us, at any time to terminate the program. 
Currently, we don't charge for transfers under this program; they are in        
addition to the twelve annual transfers permitted without charge under the      
Contract.                                                                       

We reserve the right to make changes to this program at any time. If you choose 
the Asset Allocation Program or the DCA Program, you cannot use the Rebalancing 
Program.

WITHDRAWALS AND SURRENDERS 

WHEN AND HOW WITHDRAWALS ARE MADE 

Before the annuity date, you may withdraw money from the Contract up to six     
times per contract year. Withdrawals are subject to tax and prior to age 59 1/2 
may also be subject to a 10% federal penalty tax. (See "Federal Income Taxes".) 

Unless you direct us otherwise, we will make withdrawals from subaccounts in the
same proportion as the subaccounts bear to your contract value. You may make a  
withdrawal request in writing to our Service Center. You may withdraw money by  
telephone, once you've submitted a proper telephone authorization form to our   
Service Center, but only if the amount withdrawn is to be paid into a Merrill   
Lynch brokerage account. We will consider telephone withdrawal requests received
after 4:00 p.m. (ET) to be received the following business day.                 

MINIMUM AMOUNTS 

The minimum amount that may be withdrawn is $100. At least $5,000 must remain in
the Contract after you make a withdrawal. We reserve the right to change these  
minimums.                                                                       

SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PROGRAM 

Subject to state availability, you may have automatic withdrawals of a specified
dollar amount made monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually. Each          
withdrawal must be for at least $100 and the remaining contract value must be at
least $5,000. You may change the specified dollar amount or frequency of        
withdrawals or stop the Systematic Withdrawal Program at any time upon notice to
us. We will make systematic withdrawals from subaccounts in the same proportion 
as the subaccounts bear to your contract value. These systematic withdrawals are
in addition to the annual six withdrawals permitted under the Contract. We      
reserve the right to restrict the maximum amount that may be withdrawn each year
under the Systematic Withdrawal Program and to make any other changes to this   
program at any time.                                                            

SURRENDERS 

At any time before the annuity date you may surrender the Contract through a    
full withdrawal. The Contract must be delivered to our Service Center. We will  
pay you an amount equal to the contract value as of the end of the valuation    
period when we process the surrender, minus the contract fee, if applicable, and
minus any applicable charge for premium taxes. (See "Charges and Deductions".)  

PAYMENTS TO CONTRACT OWNERS 

We'll make any payments to you usually within seven days of our Service Center  
receiving your proper request. However, we may delay any payment, or delay      
processing any annuity payment or transfer request if:                          

(a)      the New York Stock Exchange is closed;                     

(b)      trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission;               

28

P-->N-431st�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
      (c)      the Securities and Exchange Commission declares that an emergency
       exists making it not reasonably practicable to dispose of
             securities held in the Account or to determine the value of the
Account's assets;                                 

   (d)      the Securities and Exchange Commission by order so permits for
the protection of security holders; or            

   (e)      payment is derived from a check used to make a premium payment
which has not cleared through the banking system. 

CONTRACT CHANGES 

Requests to change the owner, beneficiary, annuitant, or annuity date of a      
Contract will take effect as of the date you sign such a request, unless we have
already acted in reliance on the prior status. We are not responsible for the   
validity of such a request.                                                     

If you change the owner or annuitant on a nonqualified Contract, the new owner  
or annuitant must be less than 90 years old. For qualified Contracts, if you    
change the owner or annuitant, the new owner or annuitant must be less than     
70 1/2 years old.                                                               

DEATH BENEFIT 

GENERAL 

Regardless of investment experience, the Contract provides a guaranteed minimum 
death benefit to the beneficiary if you die before the annuity date. (If an     
owner is a non-natural person, then the death of the annuitant will be treated  
as the death of the owner.)                                                     

We will pay the death benefit in a lump sum unless the beneficiary chooses an   
annuity payment option available under the Contract. (See "Annuity Options".)   
However, if you die before the annuity date, federal tax law generally requires 
us to distribute the entire contract value within five years of the date of     
death. Special rules may apply to a surviving spouse. (See "Federal Income
Taxes".)                                                                        

We determine the death benefit as of the date we receive certain information at 
our Service Center. We call this information due proof of death. It consists of 
the Beneficiary Statement, a certified copy of the death certificate, and any   
additional documentation we may need to process the death claim. If we haven't  
received the other documents within 60 days following our receipt of a certified
death certificate, we will consider due proof of death to have been received and
we will pay the death benefit in a lump sum.                                    

Unless you irrevocably designated a beneficiary, you may change the beneficiary 
at any time before the annuity date.                                            

SPOUSAL CONTINUATION 

If your beneficiary is your surviving spouse, your spouse may elect to continue 
the Contract if you die before the annuity date. Your spouse becomes the        
contract owner and the beneficiary until your spouse names a new beneficiary. If
the death benefit which would have been paid to the surviving spouse is greater 
than the contract value as of the date we determine the death benefit, we will  
increase the contract value of the continued Contract to equal the death benefit
we would have paid to the surviving spouse. Your interest in each subaccount    
will be increased by the ratio of your contract value in each subaccount to your
contract value.

CALCULATION OF DEATH BENEFIT 

If you (or the older owner, if the Contract has co-owners, or the annuitant, if 
the owner is a non-natural person) are age 80 or over on the contract date, the 
death benefit is the greater of:                                                

   (i)     the premiums paid into the Contract less "adjusted" withdrawals
from the Contract; or                               

(ii)    the contract value.                                         

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this formula, each "adjusted" withdrawal equals the amount withdrawn      
multiplied by (a) DIVIDED BY (b) where:                                       

a  =     premiums paid into the Contract less previous "adjusted" withdrawals;
and                                                         

b  =     the contract value.                                                  

Both (a) and (b) are calculated immediately prior to the withdrawal.          
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you (or the older owner, if the Contract has co-owners, or the annuitant, if 
the owner is a non-natural person) are under age 80 on the contract date, the   
death benefit is the greatest of:                                               

    (i)      the premiums paid into the Contract less "adjusted" withdrawals
from the Contract;                                

(ii)     the contract value; or                                     

(iii)    the Maximum Anniversary Value.                             

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this formula, each "adjusted" withdrawal equals the amount withdrawn      
multiplied by the greater of (a) or (b) DIVIDED BY (c) where:                 

a  =     premiums paid into the Contract less previous "adjusted" withdrawals;

b  =     the Maximum Anniversary Value; and                                   

c  =     the contract value.                                                  

Values for (a), (b), and (c) are calculated immediately prior to the          
withdrawal.                                                                   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAXIMUM ANNIVERSARY VALUE 

The Maximum Anniversary Value is equal to the greatest anniversary value for the
Contract. An anniversary value is equal to the contract value on a contract     
anniversary increased by premium payments and decreased by "adjusted"           
withdrawals since that anniversary. "Adjusted" withdrawals are calculated       
according to the formula that appears immediately above this section.           

To determine the Maximum Anniversary Value, we will calculate an anniversary    
value for each contract anniversary through the earlier of your attained age 80 
or the anniversary on or prior to your date of death. If the contract has       
co-owners, we will calculate the anniversary value through the earlier of the   
older owner's attained age 80 or the anniversary on or prior to any owner's date
of death if a death benefit is payable. If an owner is a non-natural person,    
then the annuitant's age, rather than the owner's, will be used.                

We will calculate the Maximum Anniversary Value based on your age (or the age   
of the older owner, if the Contract has co-owners, or the annuitant, if the     
owner is a non-natural person) on the contract date. Subsequent changes in      
owner will not increase the period of time used to determine the Maximum        

30

P-->N-433rd�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
Anniversary Value. If a new owner has not reached attained age 80 and is        
older than the owner whose age is being used to determine the Maximum           
Anniversary Value at the time of the ownership change, the period of time       
used in the calculation of the Maximum Anniversary Value will be based on the   
age of the new owner at the time of the ownership change. If at the time of     
an ownership change the new owner is attained age 80 or over, we will use the   
Maximum Anniversary Value as of the anniversary on or prior to the ownership    
change, increased by premium payments and decreased by "adjusted" withdrawals   
since that anniversary.                                                         

FOR AN EXAMPLE OF THE CALCULATION OF DEATH BENEFIT, SEE APPENDIX A.             

ANNUITY PAYMENTS 

We'll make the first annuity payment on the annuity date, and payments will     
continue according to the annuity option selected. When you first buy the       
Contract, the annuity date for non-qualified Contracts is the annuitant's 90th  
birthday. The annuity date for IRA or tax sheltered annuity Contracts is when   
the owner/annuitant reaches age 70 1/2. However, you may specify an earlier     
annuity date. You may change the annuity date at any time before the annuity    
date.                                                                           

Contract owners may select from a variety of fixed annuity payment options, as  
outlined below in "Annuity Options." If you don't choose an annuity option,     
we'll use the Life Annuity with Payments Guaranteed for 10 Years annuity option 
when the contract owner reaches age 90 (age 70 1/2 for an IRA Contract or       
tax-sheltered annuity). You may change the annuity option before the annuity    
date. We reserve the right to limit annuity options available to IRA contract   
owners to comply with the Internal Revenue Code or regulations under it.        

We determine the dollar amount of annuity payments by applying your contract    
value on the annuity date to our then current annuity purchase rates less any   
applicable premium tax. Purchase rates show the amount of periodic payment that 
a $1000 value buys. These rates are based on the annuitant's age and sex (where 
permitted) at the time payments begin, and will assume interest of not less than
3% per year. The rates will never be less than those shown in the Contract.     

If the age and/or sex of the annuitant was misstated to us, resulting in an     
incorrect calculation of annuity payments, we will adjust future annuity        
payments to reflect the correct age and/or sex. We will deduct any amount we    
overpaid as the result of a misstatement from future payments with 6% annual    
interest charges. Likewise, if we underpaid any amount as the result of a       
misstatement, we correct it with the next payment made with 6% annual interest  
credited.                                                                       

If the contract value on the annuity date after the deduction of any applicable 
premium taxes is less than $5,000, we may cash out your Contract in a lump sum. 
If any annuity payment would be less than $50 (or a different minimum amount, if
required by state law), we may change the frequency of payments so that all     
payments will be at least $50 (or the minimum amount required by state law).    
Unless you tell us differently, we'll make annuity payments directly to your    
Merrill Lynch brokerage account.                                                

ANNUITY OPTIONS 

We currently provide the following fixed annuity payment options. After the     
annuity date, your contract value does not vary with the performance of the     
Account. We may in the future offer more options. If you or the annuitant dies  
while guaranteed payments remain unpaid, several options provide the ability to 
take the present value of future guaranteed payments in a lump sum.             

31

P-->N-434th�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
--------------------------------------------------------------

HOW WE DETERMINE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE
 GUARANTEED ANNUITY PAYMENTS

Present value refers to the amount of money needed today to 
fund the remaining guaranteed payments under the annuity    
payment option you select. The primary factor in determining
present value is the interest rate assumption we use. If you
 are receiving annuity payments under an option that gives you
 the ability to take the present value of future payments in a
lump sum and you elect to take the lump sum, we will use the
same interest rate assumption in calculating the present    
value that we used to determine your payment stream at the  
time your annuity payments commenced.                       

--------------------------------------------------------------

PAYMENTS OF A FIXED AMOUNT 

We will make equal payments in an amount you choose until the sum of all        
payments equals the contract value applied, increased for interest credited of  
at least 3%. The amount you choose must provide at least five years of payments.
These payments don't depend on the annuitant's life. If the annuitant dies      
before the guaranteed amount has been paid, you may elect to have payments      
continued for the amount guaranteed or to receive the present value of the      
remaining guaranteed payments in a lump sum. If the contract owner dies while   
guaranteed amounts remain unpaid, the beneficiary may elect to receive the      
present value of the remaining guaranteed payments in a lump sum.               

PAYMENTS FOR A FIXED PERIOD 

We will make equal payments for a period you select of at least five years.     
These payments don't depend on the annuitant's life. If the annuitant dies      
before the end of the period, you may elect to have payments continued for the  
period guaranteed or to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed   
payments in a lump sum. If the contract owner dies while guaranteed amounts     
remain unpaid, the beneficiary may elect to receive the present value of the    
remaining guaranteed payments in a lump sum.                                    

*LIFE ANNUITY                                                       

We make payments for as long as the annuitant lives. Payments will cease with   
the last payment made before the annuitant's death.                             

-----------------------------                                                   

      *     These options are "pure" life annuities. Therefore, it is possible
for the payee to receive only one annuity payment if the person (or persons) on 
whose life (lives) payment is based dies after only one payment or to receive   
only two annuity payments if that person (those persons) dies after only two    
payments, etc.

P-->N-435th�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS GUARANTEED FOR 5, 10, 15, OR 20 YEARS 

We make payments for as long as the annuitant lives. In addition, even if the   
annuitant dies before the period ends, we guarantee payments for either 5, 10,  
15, or 20 years as you selected. If the annuitant dies before the guaranteed    
period ends, you may elect to have payments continued for the period guaranteed 
or to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed payments in a lump  
sum. If the contract owner dies while guaranteed amounts remain unpaid, the     
beneficiary may elect to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed  
payments in a lump sum.                                                         

LIFE ANNUITY WITH GUARANTEED RETURN OF CONTRACT VALUE 

We make payments for as long as the annuitant lives. In addition, even if the   
annuitant dies, we guarantee payments until the sum of all annuity payments     
equals the contract value applied. If the annuitant dies while guaranteed       
amounts remain unpaid, you may elect to have payments continued for the amount  
guaranteed or to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed amount in
a lump sum. If the contract owner dies while guaranteed amounts remain unpaid,  
the beneficiary may elect to receive the present value of the remaining         
guaranteed amount in a lump sum.                                                

*JOINT AND SURVIVOR LIFE ANNUITY                                  

We make payments for the lives of the annuitant and a designated second person. 
Payments will continue as long as either one is living.                         

 JOINT AND SURVIVOR LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS GUARANTEED FOR 5, 10, 15, OR
20 YEARS 

We make payments during the lives of the annuitant and a designated second      
person. Payments will continue as long as either one is living. In addition,    
even if the annuitant and the designated second person die before the guaranteed
period ends, we guarantee payments for either 5, 10, 15, or 20 years as you     
selected. If the annuitant and the designated second person die before the end  
of the period, you may elect to have payments continued for the period          
guaranteed or to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed payments 
in a lump sum. If the contract owner dies while guaranteed amounts remain       
unpaid, the beneficiary may elect to receive the present value of the remaining 
guaranteed payments in a lump sum.                                              

INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT ANNUITY 

This annuity option is available only to IRA contract owners. Payments will be  
made annually based on either (a) the life expectancy of the annuitant; (b) the 
joint life expectancy of the annuitant and his or her spouse; (c) the life      
expectancy of the surviving spouse if the annuitant dies before the annuity     
date. Each annual payment will be equal to the remaining contract value on      
January 1, divided by the applicable current life expectancy, as defined by     
Internal Revenue Service regulations. Each subsequent payment will be made on   
the anniversary of the annuity date. Interest will be credited at our current   
rate for this option, but will not be less than 3%. On the death of the         
measuring life or lives prior to full distribution of the remaining value, we   
will pay that value to the beneficiary in a lump sum.                           

-----------------------------                                                   

      *     These options are "pure" life annuities. Therefore, it is possible
for the payee to receive only one annuity payment if the person (or persons) on 
whose life (lives) payment is based dies after only one payment or to receive   
only two annuity payments if that person (those persons) dies after only two    
payments, etc.

GENDER-BASED ANNUITY PURCHASE RATES 

Generally, the Contract provides for gender-based annuity purchase rates when   
life annuity options are chosen. However, in states that have adopted           
regulations prohibiting gender-based rates, blended unisex annuity purchase     
rates will be applied to both male and female annuitants. Unisex annuity        
purchase rates will provide the same annuity payments for male or female        
annuitants that are the same age on their annuity dates.                        

Employers and employee organizations considering purchase of the Contract should
consult with their legal advisor to determine whether purchasing a Contract     
containing gender-based annuity purchase rates is consistent with Title VII of  
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or other applicable law. We may offer such contract
owners Contracts containing unisex annuity purchase rates.                      

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES 

The following summary discussion is based on our understanding of current       
federal income tax law as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) now interprets it. 
We can't guarantee that the law or the IRS's interpretation won't change. It    
does not purport to be complete or to cover all tax situations. This discussion 
is not intended as tax advice. Counsel or other tax advisors should be consulted
for further information.                                                        

We haven't considered any applicable federal gift, estate or any state or other 
tax laws. Of course, your own tax status or that of your beneficiary can affect 
the tax consequences of ownership or receipt of distributions.                  

TAX STATUS OF THE CONTRACT 

DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 

Section 817(h) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and the regulations under it  
provide that separate account investments underlying a contract must be         
"adequately diversified" for it to qualify as an annuity contract under IRC     
section 72. The Account, through the subaccounts, intends to comply with the    
diversification requirements of the regulations under Section 817(h). This will 
affect how we make investments.                                                 

OWNER CONTROL 

In certain circumstances, owners of variable annuity contracts have been        
considered for Federal income tax purposes to be the owners of the assets of the
separate account supporting their Contracts due to their ability to exercise    
investment control over those assets. When this is the case, the contract owners
have been currently taxed on income and gains attributable to the separate      
account assets. There is little guidance in this area, and some features such as
the flexibility of an owner to allocate premium payments and transfer contract  
accumulation values, have not been explicitly addressed in IRS published        
rulings. While we believe that the Contracts do not give owners investment      
control over Account assets, we reserve the right to modify the Contracts as    
necessary to prevent an owner from being treated as the owner of the Account    
assets supporting the Contract.

REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS 

To qualify as an annuity contract under Section 72(s) of the IRC, a             
non-qualified annuity contract must provide that: (a) if any owner dies on or   
after the annuity starting date but before all amounts under the Contract have  
been distributed, the remaining amounts will be distributed at least as quickly 
as under the method being used when the owner died; and (b) if any owner dies   
before the annuity starting date, all amounts under the Contract will be        
distributed within five years of the date of death. So long as the distributions
begin within a year of the owner's death, the IRS will consider these           
requirements satisfied for any part of the owner's interest payable to or for   
the benefit of a "designated beneficiary" and distributed over the beneficiary's
life or over a period that cannot exceed the beneficiary's life expectancy. A   
designated beneficiary is the person the owner names as beneficiary and who     
assumes ownership when the owner dies. A designated beneficiary must be a       
natural person. If the deceased owner's spouse is the designated beneficiary, he
or she can continue the Contract when such contract owner dies.                 

The Contract is designed to comply with Section 72(s). We will review the       
Contract and amend it if necessary to make sure that it continues to comply with
the section's requirements.                                                     

Other rules regarding required distributions apply to Individual Retirement     
Annuities.                                                                      

TAXATION OF ANNUITIES 

IN GENERAL 

IRC Section 72 governs annuity taxation generally. We believe an owner who is a 
natural person usually won't be taxed on increases in the value of a contract   
until there is a distribution (i.e., the owner withdraws all or part of the     
accumulation or takes annuity payments). Assigning, pledging, or agreeing to    
assign or pledge any part of the accumulation usually will be considered a      
distribution. Distributions of accumulated investment earnings are taxable as   
ordinary income.                                                                

The owner of any annuity contract who is not a natural person (e.g., a          
corporation or a trust) generally must include in income any increase in the    
excess of the accumulation over the "investment in the contract" during the     
taxable year. There are some exceptions to this rule and a prospective owner    
that is not a natural person may wish to discuss them with a competent tax      
advisor.                                                                        

The following discussion applies generally to Contracts owned by a natural      
person:                                                                         

WITHDRAWALS AND SURRENDERS 

When you take a withdrawal from a Contract, the amount received generally will  
be treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to an amount equal to the excess
(if any) of the contract value immediately before the distribution over the     
investment in the Contract (generally, the premiums or other consideration paid 
for the Contract, reduced by any amount previously distributed from the Contract
that was not subject to tax) at that time. Other rules apply to Individual      
Retirement Annuities.                                                           

If you withdraw your entire contract value, you will be taxed only on the part  
that exceeds your investment in the Contract.                                   

ANNUITY PAYMENTS 

Although tax consequences may vary depending on the annuity option selected     
under an annuity contract, a portion of each annuity payment is generally not   
taxed and the remainder is taxed as ordinary income. The                        

35

P-->N-438th�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
non-taxable portion of an annuity payment is generally determined in a manner   
that is designed to allow you to recover your investment in the Contract ratably
on a tax-free basis over the expected stream of annuity payments, as determined 
when annuity payments start. Once your investment in the Contract has been fully
recovered, however, the full amount of each annuity payment is subject to tax as
ordinary income.                                                                

TAXATION OF DEATH BENEFIT PROCEEDS 

Amounts may be paid from a Contract because an owner or annuitant (if an owner  
is not a natural person) has died. If the payments are made in a single sum,    
they're taxed the same way a full withdrawal from the Contract is taxed. If they
are distributed as annuity payments, they're taxed as annuity payments.         

PENALTY TAX ON SOME WITHDRAWALS 

You may have to pay a penalty tax (10 percent of the amount treated as taxable  
income) on some withdrawals. However, there is usually no penalty on            
distributions:                                                                  

(1)    on or after you reach age 59 1/2;                            

   (2)    after you die (or after the annuitant dies, if an owner isn't an
individual);                                          

(3)    after you become disabled; or                                

      (4)    that are part of a series of substantially equal periodic (at least
          annual) payments for your life (or life expectancy) or the joint
   lives (or life expectancies) of you and your beneficiary.

Other exceptions may be applicable under certain circumstances and special rules
may apply in connection with the exceptions listed above. Also, additional      
exceptions apply to distributions from an Individual Retirement Annuity. You    
should consult a tax adviser with regard to exceptions from the penalty tax.    

TRANSFERS, ASSIGNMENTS, OR EXCHANGES OF A CONTRACT 

Transferring or assigning ownership of the Contract, designating a payee or     
beneficiary who is not also the owner, or exchanging a Contract can have other  
tax consequences that we don't discuss here. If you're thinking about any of    
those transactions, contact a tax advisor.                                      

WITHHOLDING 

Annuity distributions usually are subject to withholding for the recipient's    
federal income tax liability at rates that vary according to the type of        
distribution and the recipient's tax status. However, recipients can usually    
choose not to have tax withheld from distributions.                             

MULTIPLE CONTRACTS 

All non-qualified deferred annuity Contracts that we (or our affiliates) issue  
to the same owner during any calendar year are generally treated as one annuity 
Contract for purposes of determining the amount includible in such owner's      
income when a taxable distribution occurs. This could affect when income is     
taxable and how much is subject to the ten percent penalty tax discussed above.

POSSIBLE CHANGES IN TAXATION 

Although the likelihood of legislative change is uncertain, there is always the 
possibility that the tax treatment of the Contracts could change by legislation 
or other means. It is also possible that any change could be retroactive (that  
is, effective prior to the date of the change). A tax adviser should be         
consulted with respect to legislative developments and their effect on the      
Contract.                                                                       

POSSIBLE CHARGE FOR OUR TAXES 

Currently we don't charge the Account for any federal, state, or local taxes on 
them or the Contracts (other than premium taxes), but we reserve the right to   
charge the Account or the Contracts for any tax or other cost resulting from the
tax laws that we believe should be attributed to them.                          

INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES 

TRADITIONAL IRAs                                                    

Section 408 of the Code permits eligible individuals to contribute to an        
individual retirement program known as an "Individual Retirement Annuity" or    
"IRA." This Contract is available for purchase either as an IRA or through an   
established IRA custodial account with MLPF&S. An individual may make annual    
contributions of up to the lesser of $2,000 or 100% of adjusted gross income to 
an IRA. The contributions may be deductible in whole or in part, depending on   
the individual's income. Distributions from certain pension plans may be "rolled
over" into an IRA on a tax-deferred basis without regard to these limits.       
Amounts in the IRA (other than nondeductible contributions) are taxed when      
distributed from the IRA. A 10% penalty tax generally applies to distributions  
made before age 59 1/2, unless certain exceptions apply. IRAs have minimum      
distribution rules that govern the timing and amount of distributions. You      
should refer to your adoption agreement or consult a tax advisor for more       
information about these distribution rules. Adverse tax consequences may result 
if you do not ensure that contributions, distributions and other transactions   
with respect to the Contract comply with the law. The IRS has not reviewed the  
Contract for qualification as an IRA, and has not addressed in a ruling of      
general applicability whether a death benefit provision such as the enhanced    
death benefit provision in the Contract comports with IRA qualification         
requirements.                                                                   

ROTH IRAs                                                           

A Contract is available for purchase by an individual who has separately        
established a Roth IRA custodial account with MLPF&S. Roth IRAs, as described   
in section 408(a) of the IRC, permit certain eligible individuals to contribute 
to make non-deductible contributions to a Roth IRA in cash or as a rollover     
or transfer from another Roth IRA or other IRA. An individual may make annual   
contributions to a Roth IRA of up to the lesser of $2,000 or 100% of adjusted   
gross income. A rollover from or conversion of an IRA to a Roth IRA is          
generally subject to tax and other special rules apply. You may wish to         
consult a tax adviser before combining any converted amounts with any other     
Roth IRA contributions, including any other conversion amounts from other tax   
years. Distributions from a Roth IRA generally are not taxed, except that,      
once aggregate distributions exceed contributions to the Roth IRA, income tax   
and a 10% penalty tax may apply to distributions made (1) before age 59 1/2     
(subject to certain exceptions) or (2) during the five taxable years starting   
with the year in which the first contribution is made to any Roth IRA. A 10%    
penalty tax may apply to amounts attributable to a conversion from an IRA if    
they are distributed during the five taxable years beginning with the year in   
which the conversion was made.                                                  

TAX SHELTERED ANNUITIES 

Section 403(b) of the IRC allow employees of certain Section 501(c)(3)          
organizations and public schools to exclude from their gross income the premium 
payments made, within certain limits, on a contract that will                   

37

P-->N-440th�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
provide an annuity for the employee's retirement. In the future, it is intended 
that rollover and transfer amounts from tax sheltered annuity plans that are not
subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, will
be accepted as premium payments, as permitted by law, under a Contract. Other   
premium payments, including premium payments subject to IRC Section 402(g), will
not be accepted. Distributions of (1) salary reduction contributions made in    
years beginning after December 31, 1988; (2) earnings on those contributions;   
and (3) earnings on amounts held as of the last year beginning before January 1,
1989, are not allowed prior to age 59 1/2, separation from service, death or    
disability. Salary reduction contributions may also be distributed upon         
hardship, but would generally be subject to penalties.                          

OTHER TAX ISSUES FOR IRAs AND ROTH IRAs                             

Total annual contributions to all of an individual's IRAs and Roth IRAs may not 
exceed $2,000 or 100% of the individual's adjusted gross income. Distributions  
from an IRA or Roth IRA generally are subject to withholding for the            
participant's federal income tax liability. The withholding rate varies         
according to the type of distribution and the owner's tax status. The owner will
be provided the opportunity to elect not have tax withheld from distributions.

VOTING RIGHTS 

We own all Fund shares and Trust Units held in the Account. As the owner, we    
have the right to vote on any matter put to vote at any Funds' shareholder      
meetings. However, we will vote all Fund shares attributable to Contracts by    
following instructions we receive from you. If we don't receive voting          
instructions, we'll vote those shares in the same proportion as shares for which
we receive instructions. We determine the number of                             

38

P-->N-441st�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
shares you may give voting instructions on by dividing your interest in a       
subaccount by the net asset value per share of the corresponding Fund. We'll    
determine the number of shares you may give voting instructions on as of a      
record date we choose. We may vote Fund shares in our own right if laws change  
to permit us to do so.                                                          

You have voting rights until the annuity date. You may give voting instructions 
concerning:                                                                     

(1)    the election of a Fund's Board of Directors;               

(2)    ratification of a Fund's independent accountant;           

(3)    approval of the investment advisory agreement for a Fund   
corresponding to your selected subaccounts;         

(4)    any change in a fundamental investment policy of a Fund    
corresponding to your selected subaccounts; and     

  (5)    any other matter requiring a vote of the Fund's shareholders.

REPORTS TO CONTRACT OWNERS 

At least once each contract year before the annuity date, we will send you      
information about your Contract. It will outline all your Contract transactions 
during the year, your Contract's current number of accumulation units in each   
subaccount, the value of each accumulation unit of each subaccount, and the     
contract value.                                                                 

You will also receive an annual and a semi-annual report containing financial   
statements and a list of portfolio securities of the Funds.                     

SELLING THE CONTRACT 

MLPF&S is the principal underwriter of the Contract. Its principal business     
address is World Financial Center, 250 Vesey Street, New York, New York 10281.  
It was organized in 1958 under the laws of the state of Delaware and is         
registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It is a
member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. MLPF&S is an     
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.                   

Registered representatives (Financial Consultants) of MLPF&S sell the Contract. 
These Financial Consultants are also licensed through various Merrill Lynch Life
Agencies as our insurance agents. Through a distribution agreement we have with 
MLPF&S and companion sales agreements we have with the Merrill Lynch Life       
Agencies, Merrill Lynch Life Agencies and/or MLPF&S compensate the Financial    
Consultants. The maximum commission paid to a Financial Consultant is 0.51% of  
each premium. In addition, on the annuity date, the Financial Consultant will   
receive compensation of up to 1.5% of contract value. Financial Consultants may 
also be paid additional annual compensation of up to 0.51% of contract value.   
Reduced compensation may be paid on Contracts purchased by our employees or     
their spouses or dependents. Compensation may be paid in the form of non-cash   
compensation, subject to applicable regulatory requirements.                    

The maximum commission we will pay to the applicable insurance agency to be used
to pay commissions to Financial Consultants is 1.00% of each premium and up to  
1.00% of contract value.

STATE REGULATION 

We are subject to the laws of the State of Arkansas and to the regulations of   
the Arkansas Insurance Department. We are also subject to the insurance laws and
regulations of all jurisdictions in which we're licensed to do business.        

We file an annual statement with the insurance departments of jurisdictions     
where we do business. The statement discloses our operations for the preceding  
year and our financial condition as of the end of that year. Our books and      
accounts are subject to insurance department review at all times. The Arkansas  
Insurance Department, in conjunction with the National Association of Insurance 
Commissions, conducts a full examination of our operations periodically.        

YEAR 2000 

Many computer systems were designed using only two digits to designate years.   
These systems may not be able to distinguish the Year 2000 from the Year 1900   
(commonly known as the "Year 2000 Problem"). Like other investment companies and
financial and business organizations, the Account could be adversely affected if
the computer systems we use or the other service providers we use do not        
properly address this problem before January 1, 2000. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. 
has established a dedicated group to analyze these issues and to implement any  
systems modifications necessary to prepare for the Year 2000. Substantial       
resources are devoted to this effort. Currently, we don't anticipate that the   
transition to the 21st century will have any material impact on our ability to  
continue to service the Contract at current levels. In addition we have sought  
assurances from the other service providers that they are taking all necessary  
steps to ensure that their computer systems will accurately reflect the Year    
2000. We will continue to monitor the situation. At this time, however, we can't
give assurance that the other service providers have anticipated every step     
necessary to avoid any adverse effect on the Account attributable to the Year   
2000 Problem.                                                                   

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

There are no legal proceedings involving the Account. We and MLPF&S are engaged 
in various kinds of routine litigation that, in our judgment, are not material  
to our total assets.                                                            

EXPERTS 

Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent auditors, have audited our financial         
statements as of December 31, 1998 and 1997 and for each of the three years     
in the period ended December 31, 1998. They've also audited the financial       
statements of the Account as of December 31, 1998 and for the periods           
presented in the Statement of Additional Information. We include these          
financial statements in reliance upon the reports of Deloitte & Touche LLP      
given upon their authority as experts in accounting and auditing. Their         
principal business address is Two World Financial Center, New York, New York

LEGAL MATTERS 

Our organization, our authority to issue the Contract, and the validity of the  
form of the Contract have been passed upon by Barry G. Skolnick, our Senior Vice
President and General Counsel. Sutherland Asbill & Brennan LLP of Washington,   
D.C. has provided advice on certain matters relating to federal securities laws.

 OTHER INFORMATION

PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER 

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, an affiliate of Merrill     
Lynch Life, performs all sales and distribution functions regarding the         
Contracts and may be deemed the principal underwriter of Merrill Lynch Life     
Variable Annuity Separate Account A (the "Account") under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The offering is continuous.  MLPF&S has not received any           
payments or commissions in connection with the sale of the Contracts in the     
past three years.                                                               

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The financial statements of Merrill Lynch Life included in this Statement of    
Additional Information should be distinguished from the financial statements of 
the Account and should be considered only as bearing upon the ability of Merrill
Lynch Life to meet any obligations it may have under the Contract.              

The financial statements of the Account are not fully representative of the     
subaccounts available under the Contracts because the subaccounts have not      
yet commenced operations.                                                       

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS 

Merrill Lynch Life has entered into a Service Agreement with its parent, Merrill
Lynch Insurance Group, Inc. ("MLIG") pursuant to which Merrill Lynch Life can   
arrange for MLIG to provide directly or through affiliates certain services.    
Pursuant to this agreement, Merrill Lynch Life has arranged for MLIG to provide 
administrative services for the Account and the Contracts, and MLIG, in turn,   
has arranged for a subsidiary, Merrill Lynch Insurance Group Services, Inc.     
("MLIG Services"), to provide these services. Compensation for these services,  
which will be paid by Merrill Lynch Life, will be based on the charges and      
expenses incurred by MLIG Services, and will reflect MLIG Services' actual      
costs. No amounts paid pursuant to this agreement in the past three years       
were attributable to the Contracts.                                             

 CALCULATION OF YIELDS AND TOTAL RETURNS
MONEY MARKET YIELD                                                              

From time to time, Merrill Lynch Life may quote in advertisements and sales     
literature the current annualized yield for the Domestic Money Market Subaccount
for a 7-day period in a manner that does not take into consideration any        
realized or unrealized gains or losses on shares of the underlying Funds or on  
their respective portfolio securities. The current annualized yield is computed 
by: (a) determining the net change (exclusive of realized gains and losses on   
the sales of securities and unrealized appreciation and depreciation) at the end
of the 7-day period in the value of a hypothetical account under a Contract     
having a balance of 1 unit at the beginning of the period, (b) dividing such net
change in account value by the value of the account at the beginning of the     
period to determine the base period return; and (c) annualizing this quotient on
a 365-day basis. The net change in account value reflects: (1) net income from  
the Fund attributable to the hypothetical account; and (2) charges and          
deductions imposed under the Contract which are attributable to the hypothetical
account. The charges and deductions include the per unit charges for the        
hypothetical account for: (1) the asset-based insurance charge; and (2) the     
annual contract fee. For purposes of calculating current yield for a Contract,  
an average per unit contract fee is used, as described below. Current yield will
be calculated according to the following formula:                               

Current Yield = ((NCF - ES/UV) x (365/7)

 3

P-->N-449th�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�49th
Where:                                                                          

NCF      =        the net change in the value of the Fund (exclusive of         
           realized gains and losses on the sale of securities and
                  unrealized appreciation and depreciation) for the 7-day period
                attributable to a hypothetical account having a balance of 1
unit.                                       

ES       =        per unit expenses for the hypothetical account for the 7-day  
period.                                     

UV       =        the unit value on the first day of the 7-day period.          

Merrill Lynch Life also may quote the effective yield of the Domestic Money     
Market Subaccount for the same 7-day period, determined on a compounded basis.  
The effective yield is calculated by compounding the unannualized base period   
return according to the following formula:                                      

                                     365/7
 Effective Yield = (1 + ((NCF - ES)/UV))      -1

Where:                                                                          

NCF      =        the net change in the value of the Fund (exclusive of         
           realized gains and losses on the sale of securities and
                  unrealized appreciation and depreciation) for the 7-day period
                attributable to a hypothetical account having a balance of 1
unit.                                       

ES       =        per unit expenses of the hypothetical account for the 7-day   
period.                                     

UV       =        the unit value for the first day of the 7-day period.         

Because of the charges and deductions imposed under the Contract, the yield for 
the Domestic Money Market Subaccount will be lower than the yield for the       
corresponding underlying Fund.                                                  

The yields on amounts held in the Domestic Money Market Subaccount normally will
fluctuate on a daily basis. Therefore, the disclosed yield for any given past   
period is not an indication or representation of future yields or rates of      
return. The actual yield for the subaccount is affected by changes in interest  
rates on money market securities, average portfolio maturity of the underlying  
Fund, the types and qualities of portfolio securities held by the Fund and the  
Fund's operating expenses. Yields on amounts held in the Domestic Money Market  
Subaccount may also be presented for periods other than a 7-day period.         

OTHER SUBACCOUNT YIELDS 

From time to time, Merrill Lynch Life may quote in sales literature or          
advertisements the current annualized yield of one or more of the subaccounts   
(other than the Domestic Money Market Subaccount) for a Contract for 30-day or  
one-month period. The annualized yield of a subaccount refers to income         
generated by the subaccount over a specified 30-day or one-month period. Because
the yield is annualized, the yield generated by the subaccount during the 30-day
or one-month period is assumed to be generated each period over a 12-month      
period. The yield is computed by: (1) dividing the net investment income of the 
Fund attributable to the subaccount units less subaccount expenses for the      
period; by (2) the maximum offering price per unit on the last day of the period
times the daily average number of units outstanding for the period; then (3)    
compounding that yield for a 6-month period; and then (4) multiplying that      
result by 2. Expenses attributable to the subaccount include the asset-based    

 4

P-->N-450th�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�50th
insurance charge and the annual contract fee. For purposes of calculating the   
30-day or one-month yield, an average contract fee per dollar of contract value 
in the subaccount is used to determine the amount of the charge attributable to 
the subaccount for the 30-day or one-month period, as described below. The      
30-day or one-month yield is calculated according to the following formula:     

                                 6
 Yield = 2 ((((NI - ES)/(U x UV)) + 1)  - 1)

Where:                                                                          

NI       =        net investment income of the Fund for the 30-day or           
            one-month period attributable to the subaccount's units.

ES       =        expenses of the subaccount for the 30-day or one-month period.

U        =        the average number of units outstanding.                      

UV       =        the unit value at the close of the last day in the 30-day or  
one-month                                   

Currently, Merrill Lynch Life may quote yields on bond subaccounts. Because of  
the charges and deductions imposed under the Contracts, the yield for a         
subaccount will be lower than the yield for the corresponding Fund.             

The yield on the amounts held in the subaccounts normally will fluctuate over   
time. Therefore, the disclosed yield for any given past period is not an        
indication or representation of future yields or rates of return. A subaccount's
actual yield is affected by the types and quality of portfolio securities held  
by the corresponding Fund, and its operating expenses.

From time to time, Merrill Lynch Life also may quote in sales literature or     
advertisements, total returns, including average annual total returns for one or
more of the subaccounts for various periods of time. Average annual total       
returns will be provided for a subaccount for 1, 5 and 10 years, or for a       
shorter period, if applicable.                                                  

Total returns assume the Contract was surrendered at the end of the period      
shown, and are not indicative of performance if the Contract was continued for a
longer period. The Contract does not impose any surrender charge.

Average annual total returns for other periods of time may also be disclosed    
from time to time. For example, average annual total returns may be provided    
based on the assumption that a subaccount had been in existence and had invested
in the corresponding underlying Fund for the same period as the corresponding   
Fund had been in operation. The Funds commenced operations as indicated below:

Average annual total returns represent the average annual compounded rates of   
return that would equate an initial investment of $1,000 under a Contract to the
redemption value or that investment as of the last day of each of the periods.  
The ending date for each period for which total return quotations are provided  
will generally be as of the most recent calendar quarter-end.                   

Average annual total returns are calculated using subaccount unit values        
calculated on each valuation day based on the performance of the corresponding  
underlying Fund, the deductions for the asset-based insurance charge and the    
contract fee, and assume a surrender of the Contract at the end of the period   
for the return quotation (although the Contract does not impose a surrender     
charge). For purposes of calculating total return, an average per dollar        
contract fee attributable to the hypothetical account for the period is used, as
described below. The total return is then calculated according to the following 
formula:                                                                        
         1/N
  TR = ((ERV/P)    ) + 1

Where:                                                                          

TR       =        the average annual total return net of subaccount recurring   
                  charges (such as the asset-based insurance charge and contract
fee).                                       

ERV      =        the ending redeemable value at the end of the period of the   
           hypothetical account with an initial payment of $1,000.

P        =        a hypothetical initial payment of $1,000.                     

N        =        the number of years in the period.                            

From time to time, Merrill Lynch Life also may quote in sales literature or     
advertisements total returns for other periods.                                 

From time to time, Merrill Lynch Life also may quote in sales literature or     
advertisements total returns or other performance information for a hypothetical
Contract assuming the initial premium is allocated to more than one subaccount  
or assuming monthly transfers from a specified subaccount to one or more        
designated subaccounts under a dollar cost averaging program. Merrill Lynch Life
also may quote in sales literature or advertisements total returns or other     
performance information for a hypothetical Contract assuming participation in an
asset allocation or rebalancing program. These returns will reflect the         
performance of the affected subaccount(s) for the amount and duration of the    
allocation to each subaccount for the hypothetical Contract. They also will     
reflect the deduction of charges described above. For example, total return     
information for a Contract with a dollar cost averaging program for a 12-month  
period will assume commencement of the program at the beginning of the most     
recent 12-month period for which average annual total return information is     
available. This information will assume an initial lump-sum investment in a     
specified subaccount (the "DCA subaccount") at the beginning of that period and 
monthly transfers of a portion of the contract value from the DCA subaccount to 
designated other subaccount(s) during the 12-month period. The total return for 
the Contract for this 12-month period therefore will reflect the return on the  
portion of the contract value that remains invested in the DCA subaccount for   
the period it is assumed to be so invested, as affected by monthly transfers,   
and the return on amounts transferred to the designated other subaccounts for   
the period during which those amounts are assumed to be invested in those       
subaccounts. The return for an amount invested in a subaccount will be based on 
the performance of that subaccount for the duration of the investment, and will 
reflect the charges described above. Performance information for a dollar       
cost-averaging program also may show the returns for various periods for a      
designated subaccount assuming monthly transfers to the subaccount, and may     
compare those returns to returns assuming an initial lump-sum investment in that
subaccount. This information also may be compared to various indices, such as   
the Merrill Lynch 91-day Treasury Bills index or the U.S. Treasury Bills index  
and may be illustrated by graphs, charts, or otherwise.

ITEM 26. PERSONS CONTROLLED BY OR UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH THE DEPOSITOR OR    
REGISTRANT 

  Merrill Lynch Life Insurance Company is an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("ML & Co."). A list of subsidiaries of 
ML & Co. appears below.                                                         

SUBSIDIARIES OF THE REGISTRANT

        The following are subsidiaries of ML & Co. as of February 24, 1999 and
the states or jurisdictions in which they are organized. Indentation indicates  
the principal parent of each subsidiary. Except as otherwise specified, in each 
case ML & Co. owns, directly or indirectly, at least 99% of the voting          
securities of each subsidiary. The names of particular subsidiaries have been   
omitted because, considered in the aggregate as a single subsidiary, they would 
not constitute, as of the end of the year covered by this report, a "significant
subsidiary" as that term is defined in Rule 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

ITEM 27.      NUMBER OF CONTRACTOWNERS 

As of the date hereof, there are no owners of the Contracts.    

ITEM 28.      INDEMNIFICATION 

The following provisions regarding the Indemnification of Directors and 
Officers of the Registrant are applicable:                                      

AMENDED AND RESTATED BY-LAWS OF MERRILL LYNCH LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, ARTICLE VI

 SECTIONS 1, 2, 3 AND 4--INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES
AND INCORPORATORS                                                       

SECTION 1. ACTIONS OTHER THAN BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION. The        
Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to
be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or         
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than
an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he  
is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, against expenses  
(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement    
actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or 
proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to  
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect
to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his    
conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by      
judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or   
its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did  
not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or  
not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any  
criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct 
was unlawful.                                                                   

SECTION 2. ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION. The Corporation shall 
indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party  
to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the
Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is 
or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, against expenses     
(including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in          
connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in 
good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be   
made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have
been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that

C-9 

P-->N-462nd�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�62nd
the Court of Chancery or the Court in which such action or suit was brought     
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but
in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and         
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery  
or such other Court shall deem proper.                                          

SECTION 3. RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION. To the extent that a director, officer or  
employee of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in   
defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of    
this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be  
indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably
incurred by him in connection therewith.                                        

SECTION 4. DETERMINATION OF RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION. Any indemnification under 
Sections 1 and 2 of this Article (unless ordered by a Court) shall be made by   
the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination    
that indemnification of the director, officer, or employee is proper in the     
circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
Sections 1 and 2 of this Article. Such determination shall be made (i) by the   
board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who   
were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is
not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so  
directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the     
stockholders.                                                                   

BY-LAWS OF MERRILL LYNCH & CO., INC.,                                           
SECTION 2--INDEMNIFICATION BY CORPORATION                               

Any persons serving as an officer, director or trustee of a corporation,
trust, or other enterprise, including the Registrant, at the request of Merrill 
Lynch are entitled to indemnification from Merrill Lynch, to the fullest extent 
authorized or permitted by law, for liabilities with respect to actions taken or
omitted by such persons in any capacity in which such persons serve Merrill     
Lynch or such other corporation, trust, or other enterprise. Any action         
initiated by any such person for which indemnification is provided shall be     
approved by the Board of Directors of Merrill Lynch prior to such initiation.   

OTHER INDEMNIFICATION                                                           

There is no indemnification of the principal underwriter, Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, with respect to the Contract.              

The indemnity agreement between Merrill Lynch Life Insurance Company    
("Merrill Lynch Life") and its affiliate Merrill Lynch Life Agency, Inc.        
("MLLA"), with respect to MLLA's general agency responsibilities on behalf of   
Merrill Lynch Life and the Contract, provides:                                  

        Merrill Lynch Life will indemnify and hold harmless MLLA and all persons

C-10

P-->N-463rd�Page�of�69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�63rd
        associated with MLLA as such term is defined in Section 3(a) (21) of the
       Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against all claims, losses, liabilities
       and expenses, to include reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of the
        sale by MLLA of insurance products under the above-referenced Agreement,
        provided that Merrill Lynch Life shall not be bound to indemnify or hold
       harmless MLLA or its associated persons for claims, losses, liabilities
and expenses arising directly out of the willful misconduct or  
negligence of MLLA or its associated persons.                   

   Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the  
Registration pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the Registrant  
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission  
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,   
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against 
such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred 
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the   
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such

Answer a few questions to get started


















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.



          1.
	
	
	       
					
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss - investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.



          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.




Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and, in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company®, New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.



          Annuities at Fidelity are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc. and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC.


          Fidelity Income Strategy Evaluator is an educational tool.

Answer a few questions to get started



















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.



          1.

          2. Fidelity Personal Retirement Annuity (Policy Form No. DVA-2005, et al.) is issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), and, for New York residents, Personal Retirement Annuity (Policy Form No. EDVA-2005, et al.) is issued by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company®, New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC, and Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., are the distributors.
	
    

          3. This is a deferred variable annuity; investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will actuate depending on market performance.
	
    

          4. Clients are eligible for an annual fee of 0.10% if (1) the contract is purchased with an initial purchase payment of $1,000,000 or more on or after September 7, 2010, or (2) the contract value has accumulated to $1,000,000 or more on or after September 7, 2010, and at that time we are offering the contract to new applicants for 0.10%. See prospectus for additional details.
	
    

          5. Certain funds transferred or withdrawn in less than 60 days of purchase will be assessed a 1% fee, which is retained by the funds. See individual fund prospectus for additional details.
	
    

          6. Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.
	
    

          7.
	
	
	       Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


          8. Restrictions may apply. Please refer to product materials for additional details.
	
    

          9. Minimum subsequent premium amounts and limitations to when they are allowed prior to income start date may apply.
	
    

          10. Restrictions may apply depending on payment option and/or contract type selected. The new income amount will be determined by the issuing insurance company. Please refer to the product materials for additional details.
	
    

          11. This product is available in all states except New York. Product features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract for more complete product details.
	
    

          12. Issuing Company: New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (a Delaware Corporation), a wholly owned subsidiary of New York Life Insurance Company, 51 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10010. Available in jurisdictions where approved. State variations may apply and benefits may vary. In most jurisdictions, the policy form number for the New York Life Clear Income Fixed Annuity – FP Series is ICC14-P130; in some states, it may be 214-P130, and state variations may apply.

          13. Any withdrawal prior to age 59½ will reduce your Guaranteed Living Withdrawal Benefit (GLWB) amount. After age 59½, an early access withdrawal or any withdrawal (including applicable Market Value Adjustment and surrender charges) that exceeds your GLWB amount will reduce your income guarantees.
	
    

          14. Fixed annuities available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. These products are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., and, for certain products, by Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE. A contract's financial guarantees are solely the responsibility of and are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
	
    

          Withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
	
    

          Some products and features may not be available in all states and variations may apply. Certain features may not be available in all products or depending on type of funds used to purchase the annuity.
	
    

          The New York Life Clear Income Fixed Annuity—FP Series should only be considered if you intend to receive payments under the GLWB Rider.

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

Annuities




Building a brighter future begins with knowing what you’ll have in retirement. Annuities can help you grow and protect what you’ve saved. They provide guaranteed¹ income for you and your loved ones regardless of market performance. And because one size doesn’t fit all, Brighthouse Financial annuities are flexible enough to meet your unique saving and investing goals.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Assets under management refers to general account investments and separate account assets.

A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.
