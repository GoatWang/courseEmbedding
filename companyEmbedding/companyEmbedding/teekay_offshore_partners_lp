					Full Description



Teekay Offshore Partners L.P., incorporated on August 30, 2006, is a provider of marine transportation, oil production, storage, long-distance towing and offshore installation and maintenance and safety services to the offshore oil industry focusing on the deep-water offshore oil regions of the North Sea, Brazil and the East Coast of Canada. The Company operates shuttle tankers; towage vessels; floating, production, storage and off-loading (FPSO) units; floating storage and off-take (FSO) units; units for maintenance and safety (UMS); long-distance towing and offshore installation vessels, and conventional crude oil tankers. The Company's segments include shuttle tanker segment, FPSO segment, FSO segment, conventional tanker segment, towage segment and UMS segment. The Company's fleet consists of approximately 30 shuttle tankers, including over three chartered-in vessels and approximately one HiLoad Dynamic Positioning (DP) unit, over six FPSO units, approximately seven FSO units, over six long-distance towing and offshore installation vessels, a UMS and over two conventional oil tankers.The Company's shuttle tankers are primarily subject to long-term, fixed-rate time-charter contracts for a specific offshore oil field or under contracts of affreightment for various fields. The number of voyages performed under these contracts of affreightment normally depends upon the oil production of each field. The Company's shuttle tankers service the conventional spot tanker market. The Company's shuttle tanker fleet consists of over 30 vessels that operate under fixed-rate contracts of affreightment, time charters and bareboat charters, over one shuttle tanker in lay-up as a conversion candidate, and the HiLoad DP unit. All of these shuttle tankers, with the exception of the HiLoad DP unit, provide transportation services to energy companies, primarily in the North Sea, Brazil and the East Coast of Canada. It has approximately 110 vessels in the world shuttle tanker fleet (including over 20 newbuildings), the majority of which operate in the North Sea and Brazil. Shuttle tankers also operate in the United States Gulf.The Company uses the FPSO units to provide production, processing and storage services to oil companies operating offshore oil field installations. These services are provided under long-term, fixed-rate FPSO contracts, some of which also include certain incentive compensation or penalties based on the level of oil production and other operational measures. The Company's FPSO fleet consists of the Petrojarl Varg, the Cidade de Rio das Ostras (Rio das Ostras), the Piranema Spirit, the Voyageur Spirit, the Petrojarl I and the Petrojarl Knarr FPSO units, all of which it owns 100%, and the Itajai and the Libra FPSO units, of which it owns 50%. The Company's FSO units provide an on-site storage solution to oil field installations that have no oil storage facilities or that require supplemental storage. The Company's FSO units are placed on long-term, fixed-rate time charters or bareboat charters as an integrated part of the field development plan. It has approximately 90 FSO units operating and over seven FSO units on order in the world fleet, and has approximately seven FSO units in which its ownership interests ranged from 89% to 100%, including over one vessel undergoing conversion into an FSO unit. Its FSO units include Suksan Salamander, Navion Saga, Pattani Spirit, Dampier Spirit, Apollo Spirit and others. The Company's conventional oil tankers are used primarily for transcontinental seaborne transportation of oil.The Company provides long-distance towing and offshore installation vessels with DP2 capability. The Company has approximately 30 long-distance towing and offshore installation vessels operating and over four long-distance towing and offshore installation vessels on order in the world fleet. Its towage fleet includes over 10 long-distance towing and offshore installation vessels (including over four ultra-long distance towing and offshore installation vessel newbuildings). All of its delivered towing and offshore installation vessels operate on voyage-charter towage contracts. The Company has a UMS, the Arendal Spirit, and approximately two newbuildings. The Arendal Spirit operates on a fixed-rate time-charter contract. It has approximately 40 DP UMS operating and over 20 units on order in the world fleet. The UMS fleet is used primarily for offshore accommodation, storage and support for maintenance and modification projects on existing offshore installations, or during the installation and decommissioning of large floating exploration, production and storage units, including FPSO units, floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) units and floating drill rigs.

Teekay Corporation 
               NYSE : TK

 


Teekay Offshore Partners L.P. 
               NYSE : TOO

 






July 26, 2017 22:51 ET
Teekay and Brookfield Announce Strategic Partnership and Investment in Teekay Offshore



HAMILTON, BERMUDA--(Marketwired - July 26, 2017) - Teekay Corporation (Teekay or Teekay Parent) (NYSE:TK) and Teekay Offshore Partners L.P. (Teekay Offshore or the Partnership) (NYSE:TOO) today announced that they have agreed to enter into a strategic partnership with Brookfield Business Partners L.P. (NYSE:BBU)(TSX:BBU.UN), together with its institutional partners (collectively Brookfield). This transaction is part of a comprehensive solution for Teekay Offshore, which includes a $640 million equity investment and other financing initiatives detailed below. 
Highlights

Brookfield is attracted to Teekay Offshore's high-quality contracted cash flows and market leading positions in the offshore production and logistics space 
Comprehensive solution significantly strengthens Teekay Offshore's balance sheet 
Fully finances Teekay Offshore's existing growth projects, which are expected to provide significant near-term cash flow growth 
Positions Teekay Offshore to better service its customers and take advantage of future growth opportunities 
Teekay Offshore has ordered two shuttle tanker newbuildings, which will serve under the Master Agreement with Statoil, with the option to order two additional vessels under similar terms 

"We are excited to have Brookfield join us as a strategic partner and co-sponsor of Teekay Offshore, which is a strong endorsement of Teekay Offshore's leading market positions in the marine infrastructure space," commented Kenneth Hvid, Teekay's President and CEO. "The combination of Teekay's operational platform and Brookfield's global business platform and access to long-term capital is a complementary fit and creates one of the world's strongest offshore marine infrastructure companies. Out of the range of alternatives evaluated, we believe this comprehensive solution represents the best possible outcome for all of our long-term stakeholders and positions Teekay Offshore to benefit from an energy market recovery. This transaction maintains the stability of Teekay Offshore's significant forward cash flows and also improves Teekay Parent's financial position by eliminating all of its financial guarantees to Teekay Offshore and increasing its own liquidity by approximately $140 million. This will enhance Teekay Parent's ability to be a supportive sponsor to all of its Daughter companies going forward." 
"Brookfield's co-sponsorship in Teekay Offshore provides both immediate and long-term benefits," commented Ingvild Sæther, President and CEO of Teekay Offshore Group Ltd. "This transaction fully finances Teekay Offshore's existing growth projects which, when delivered over the next few quarters, are expected to contribute an incremental $200 million of run-rate annual cash flow from vessel operations. Longer-term, the co-sponsorship of Brookfield and Teekay will provide greater access to capital, which will enable Teekay Offshore to better service its customers and take advantage of future growth opportunities as the global energy markets recover. Our recent order of shuttle tanker newbuildings to service Teekay Offshore's North Sea Master Agreement with Statoil is just one example of the customer demand we are already seeing for our offshore production and logistics services."
"Teekay Offshore has established itself as a global leader in the provision of marine services to the offshore oil production industry," said Cyrus Madon, CEO of Brookfield Business Partners. "Our investment represents an opportunity to acquire a high quality, highly contracted business with presence in attractive markets, and we look forward to supporting Teekay Offshore with its continued growth."
Summary of the Comprehensive Solution

Brookfield and Teekay will invest $610 million and $30 million, respectively, in Teekay Offshore at a price of $2.50 per common unit and receive 65.5 million Teekay Offshore warrants (Warrants) on a pro rata basis. Following the investment, Brookfield will own approximately 60 percent and Teekay will own approximately 14 percent of the common units of Teekay Offshore;

Brookfield will acquire from Teekay Parent both a 49 percent interest in Teekay Offshore GP LLC (TOO GP), the general partner of Teekay Offshore, and an option to acquire an additional 2 percent of TOO GP. On closing, Brookfield will have the right to elect four members to the nine-member Board of Directors of TOO GP;

Teekay Offshore will repurchase and cancel all $304 million of the outstanding Series C-1 and Series D preferred units from the existing unitholders for an aggregate amount of approximately $250 million in cash, which will save approximately $28 million in annual distributions;

Teekay Offshore has reached agreement in principle with the lenders of the Arendal Spirit UMS debt facility to extend the mandatory prepayment date out to September 30, 2018, in exchange for a certain principal prepayment, subject to receipt of lenders' final internal approvals;

Brookfield will acquire from Teekay Parent an existing $200 million intercompany loan previously extended to Teekay Offshore in exchange for $140 million in cash and 11.4 million of the Warrants to be issued to Brookfield. Brookfield has agreed to extend the maturity date of the intercompany loan from 2019 to 2022;

Teekay Offshore will transfer its shuttle tanker business into a new, wholly-owned, non-recourse subsidiary, Teekay Shuttle Tankers LLC (ShuttleCo). As part of the formation of ShuttleCo, a majority of Teekay Offshore's shuttle tanker fleet will be refinanced with a new $600 million, five-year debt facility, and two 50 percent-owned vessels will be refinanced with a new $71 million, four-year debt facility. In addition, an existing $250 million debt facility secured by the three East Coast Canada newbuildings, and an existing $143 million private placement project bond financing secured by two vessels, will be transferred from Teekay Offshore to ShuttleCo;

A significant portion of Teekay Offshore's Norwegian Kroner (NOK) bond series due to mature in late-2018 and early-2019 is expected to be repurchased with proceeds from a new five-year, up to $250 million U.S. dollar denominated bond offering by ShuttleCo in the Norwegian bond market; and

Certain financial institutions providing interest rate swaps to Teekay Offshore have agreed to (i) lower the fixed interest rate on the swaps, (ii) extend the termination option of the swaps by two years to 2021, and (iii) eliminate the financial guarantee and security package currently provided by Teekay Parent in return for a certain prepayment amount and fee. 

Distribution Declarations
As a condition of Brookfield's equity investment, Teekay Offshore has agreed to reduce its existing common unit distribution to reinvest cash in the business and further strengthen the Partnership's balance sheet. For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, TOO GP has declared a cash distribution of $0.01 per common unit. The cash distribution on the Teekay Offshore common units is payable on August 11, 2017 to all unitholders of record on August 7, 2017. 
In addition, TOO GP has declared cash distributions of $0.4531 and $0.5313 per Teekay Offshore Series A Preferred unit and Series B Preferred unit, respectively, for the period from May 15, 2017 to August 14, 2017. The cash distributions on the preferred units are payable on August 15, 2017 to all unitholders of record on August 8, 2017. 
Shuttle Tanker Newbuilding Order
In addition to the formation of ShuttleCo, Teekay Offshore has entered into conditional shipbuilding contracts with Samsung Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. to construct two Suezmax-size, DP2 shuttle tanker newbuildings, with options to order up to two additional vessels. These newbuilding vessels will be constructed based on the Partnership's New Shuttle Spirit design which incorporates proven technologies to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions, including LNG propulsion technology. Upon delivery in 2019 and 2020, these new vessels will provide shuttle tanker services in the North Sea under the Partnership's existing Master Agreement with Statoil ASA (Statoil), which will free up required vessel capacity to service Teekay Offshore's contract of affreightment (CoA) portfolio in the North Sea.
The strategic partnership with Brookfield, and related transactions, has been approved by the Board of Directors of Teekay, TOO GP, and Brookfield. Teekay Offshore's Conflicts Committee, comprised of independent members of the board of directors of TOO GP, also approved the transactions between Teekay Offshore and Brookfield and Teekay Offshore and Teekay. Closing of the transactions, which remains subject to customary conditions, including, among others, regulatory approvals, is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2017.
DNB Markets acted as global coordinator and financial advisor to Teekay Offshore. Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. and Potter Anderson & Corroon acted as independent financial and legal advisors to Teekay Offshore's Conflicts Committee. 
Conference Call
Teekay and Teekay Offshore plan to host a conference call on Thursday, July 27, 2017 at 1 p.m. (ET) to discuss the transaction. All shareholders and interested parties are invited to listen to the live conference call by choosing from the following options:

Forward Looking Statements
This release contains forward-looking statements (as defined in Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements in this release include, in particular, statements regarding: the proposed investment (the "Investment") by Brookfield and Teekay in the Partnership and related transactions; the timing and completion of such Investment and transactions; the expected effects of the completion of the Investment and the transactions on the Partnership's operations and financial condition, including its ability to benefit from an energy market recovery, reduced financial leverage, enhanced liquidity, future access to capital, and increased ability to better service customers and take advantage of future growth opportunities; the expected effects of the completion of such Investment on Teekay, including a release of Teekay from financial guarantees; the future cash flow from vessel operations to be provided by the Partnership's existing growth projects; required capital expenditures for newbuilding vessels; and the expected employment of the newbuilding shuttle tankers under the Partnership's agreement with Statoil and the expected required capacity in the Partnership's CoA fleet in the North Sea. Forward-looking statements are necessary estimates reflecting the judgment of senior management, involve known and unknown risks and are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. 
        Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: failure to satisfy the closing conditions of the Investment and related transactions, including, without limitation, obtaining the required approvals from relevant regulatory authorities; any failure of counterparties to agreements with Teekay or the Partnership to perform their commitments relating to the Investment and related transactions; the possible assertion by counterparties to existing contracts with the Partnership that Brookfield's acquisition of a 49 percent interest in TOO GP requires their consent for the closing; failure to realize the expected benefits of the Investment and related transactions; newbuilding delays and cost overruns relating to the existing growth projects; changes in exploration, production and storage of offshore oil and gas, either generally or in particular regions that would impact expected future growth; and those factors discussed in the Partnership's filings from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The Partnership expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the Partnership's expectations with respect thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

Why Teekay Offshore Partners L.P., Teekay LNG Partners L.P., and Teekay Corporation Stocks Soared in March
The Teekay family of partnerships and companies had a bounce-back month in March. Here's why.











                Jason Hall
            

                (TMFVelvetHammer)



            
            Apr 6, 2016 at 9:07AM
            
            





Energy shipping is in a weak cycle. Eventually it will recover and Teekay investors should do well. Image source: Teekay. 
What: Shares of several stocks that are part of the Teekay Corporation (NYSE:TK) family, including Teekay, Teekay LNG Partners L.P. (NYSE:TGP), and Teekay Offshore Partners L.P. (NYSE:TOO), were up big in March:

TK data by YCharts.
Teekay Tankers Ltd. (NYSE:TNK) was the only Teekay stock to finish March on a down note.
So what: The market's exuberance for Teekay, and particularly Teekay Offshore and Teekay LNG Partners, is more a reaction to "no more bad news" than it was anything "good" that's happened. Even after the strong market gains in March, shares of all of the Teekay family stocks are still well down for the year:

TK data by YCharts.





It's tied to several things. First, there's significant concern that the prospects for much of Teekay's business, which is heavily tied to shipping of energy products such as crude oil, propane, and liquefied natural gas, are facing strong headwinds. This is tied to weak demand for shipping of oil and refined products in the near future, as global demand continues to be relatively weak, and economic uncertainty, especially in parts of Asia including China, weighs on energy markets. There are also fears that the expectations for huge growth in LNG shipping could be overly optimistic. 
The near-term weakness was a key reason that Teekay, Teekay LNG Partners, and Teekay Offshore all slashed their dividend and distribution payouts late last year, sending income investors fleeing the stocks to find higher-yield income. Another driver behind the payout cut was the (ongoing) weakness in the equity markets, which presented a challenge for Teekay LNG and Teekay Offshore, which have used equity offerings in the past to raise capital. The decline in the stock prices for these partnerships had pushed the yields up so high that equity offerings as a source of capital were simply no longer cost-effective. 
Now what:
Uncertain demand for LNG shipping could weigh on Teekay LNG for some time. Image source: Teekay LNG Partners.
While there's still some uncertainty about near-term demand, the dividend cuts from last year helped free up a lot of cash flows that Teekay can use to fund capital plans and support operations. At the same time, the Teekay family recently declared upcoming dividend payments, and held payouts steady at the levels announced in late 2015, so there don't appear to be any forthcoming cuts. 





At the same time, it's likely that the Teekay family of stocks will remain very volatile, moving up and down with energy prices as much as "real" news.
As things stand today, Teekay Corporation stock yields about 2.8% based on the current dividend, while Teekay Offshore yields about 9% and Teekay LNG yields 4.7%. Looking ahead several years, it's likely that these prices turn out to be more than fair, and you could be collecting much larger payouts on your initial investment.
Nonetheless, there's also reason to expect the share prices to continue moving up and down, and you could certainly see them fall lower than current levels in the short term. There's also the potential that, if the biggest fears come true and demand for energy shipping further weakens, or if LNG growth doesn't pan out, dividend cuts could happen again. 
But if you're willing to stomach the short-term volatility and the cyclical nature of shipping in general, a long-term investment in almost any of the Teekay family of stocks could turn out very well in a few years' time.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!

Teekay Offshore Partners L.P. Company Profile

   Oil produced offshore has to get to market somehow, and that's where marine transportation company Teekay Offshore Partners comes in. It generates most of its revenue from its fleet of about 35 shuttle tankers, which are used to transport oil from offshore fields to onshore processing facilities. Teekay Offshore also owns conventional long-haul oil tankers and floating storage and offtake (FSO) units. Business from Norwegian oil and gas giant Statoil (formerly StatoilHydro) accounts for about 30% of the company's sales; Teekay Offshore's parent company, tanker operator Teekay Corporation, accounts for another 15%. Teekay Corporation controls a majority stake in Teekay Offshore and owns its general partner.

									Tax Information								







The Partnership has elected to be treated as a C-Corporation for tax purposes (our investors receive the standard 1099 form and not a K-1 form).
Distributions we pay to U.S. unitholders will be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent the distributions come from earnings and profits (“E&P”) and as a nondividend distribution or a return of capital (“ROC”) to the extent the distributions exceed E&P.
Distributions we pay to a non-U.S. unitholder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax if the non-U.S. unitholder is not engaged in a U.S. trade or business.
For more detailed tax commentary, please refer to the F-1 prospectus for Teekay Offshore Partners L.P. (“TOO”).
The chart below describes the total distributions made by TOO in 2016 and the reporting of such distributions on United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Form 1099.
Please note that the determination of whether these distributions constitute a dividend from E&P or a ROC is not made for U.S. federal income tax purposes until the end of the fiscal year. If you are a U.S. unitholder and you received an IRS Form 1099 that does not set forth such amounts, you should contact your broker or tax advisor.
Holders are directed to consult their own tax advisors to determine the appropriate tax treatment with respect to the distributions.

Teekay Offshore Partners L.P. Revenue and Financial Data

   Oil produced offshore has to get to market somehow, and that's where marine transportation company Teekay Offshore Partners comes in. It generates most of its revenue from its fleet of about 35 shuttle tankers, which are used to transport oil from offshore fields to onshore processing facilities. Teekay Offshore also owns conventional long-haul oil tankers and floating storage and offtake (FSO) units. Business from Norwegian oil and gas giant Statoil (formerly StatoilHydro) accounts for about 30% of the company's sales; Teekay Offshore's parent company, tanker operator Teekay Corporation, accounts for another 15%. Teekay Corporation controls a majority stake in Teekay Offshore and owns its general partner.
