Alec E. Gores
Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Alec Gores is the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Gores Group, a global investment firm focused on acquiring controlling interests in mature and growing businesses which can benefit from the firm's operating experience and flexible capital base.

Mr. Gores began his career as a self-made entrepreneur and operating executive. In 1978, he self-funded and founded Executive Business Systems (EBS), a developer and distributor of vertical business software systems. Within seven years, EBS had become a leading value-added reseller in Michigan and employed over 200 people. In 1986, CONTEL purchased EBS and Mr. Gores subsequently began acquiring and operating non-core businesses from major corporations and building value in those entities, a decision that ultimately led to the founding of what has evolved into The Gores Group today.

Under his leadership, The Gores Group has continued to acquire businesses in need of operational and financial resources, while creating value and working with management to establish an entrepreneurial environment as a foundation for sustainable growth. This philosophy has served the firm well. Since 1987 over 80 businesses have been successfully acquired. The current portfolio includes over 20 active companies world-wide with combined annual revenues of over $7 billion. 

Mr. Gores holds a degree in computer science from Western Michigan University and lives in the Los Angeles area.

The Gores Group Revives Cosmo Specialty Fibers Inc.




      Grays Harbor County reinvigorated with opening of high purity cellulose 
      mill
    





May 21, 2011 04:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The 
      Gores Group LLC, a Beverly Hills-based private equity firm, today 
      announced the official opening of the Cosmo 
      Specialty Fibers mill. The Gores Group led the acquisition of the 
      Grays Harbor County, Wash., high purity cellulose mill from Weyerhaeuser 
      Company, which closed the mill in October 2005.
    


      CSF was reopened in an area that relies on the lumber industry as a 
      large contributor to its economy. With the closure of the Weyerhaeuser 
      mill, the City of Cosmopolis lost 40 percent of its revenue and more 
      than 200 jobs. The Gores Group’s investment in the mill will add back 
      those jobs—many of them filled by former Weyerhaeuser staff and over 95% 
      employed from Washington State—while funneling more than $110 million 
      annually into the economy.
    

      “That is our strength,” said Alec Gores, founder and chairman of the 
      Gores Group. “The ability to see a potential investment opportunity not 
      obvious to others and then dive deep and fast with 360 degrees of due 
      diligence that draws on world class, in-house expertise. Our intense 
      analysis showed us that the mill was fully capable of achieving 
      consistently high volumes of top quality acetate production.
    

      “This investment is the definition of marketplace diversity with a pulp 
      feedstock that can be used for clothing, cosmetics, filters, LED 
      screens, cellophane wrap, pharmaceuticals, food processing, and many 
      other products,” Alec Gores added. “The mill can run on biomass and 
      recycled liquors pulled out of the digesting process with very little 
      use of fossil fuel. And it uses Hemlock – not only the best fiber in the 
      world for dissolving pulp, but also a fully renewable resource itself.”
    

      Cosmo Specialty Fibers CEO Mike Entz added, “We are very excited to 
      reopen the mill. The Gores Group is proving that we can create and keep 
      manufacturing jobs in America—where they are needed—and with its 
      operational and financial support, we’ll produce outstanding product, 
      bolster the economy and continue to build on America’s great 
      manufacturing legacy.”
    

About The Gores Group LLC


      Since its inception by Alec E. Gores in 1987, The Gores Group has 
      acquired 80 companies worldwide with combined revenues in excess of $15 
      billion and currently has $4.0 billion in equity under active 
      management. Gores has become a leading investor, primarily in the 
      technology, telecommunications, business services and industrial 
      sectors, having demonstrated over time a reliable track record of 
      creating substantial value in its portfolio companies alongside 
      management. Private equity-backed companies, like those that Gores 
      invests in, have been shown to grow faster than other types of companies 
      and Gores' private equity returns have consistently and significantly 
      outperformed publicly traded indices.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
