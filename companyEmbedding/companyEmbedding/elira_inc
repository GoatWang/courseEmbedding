Excellent service from the quote to the completion of the project.  Selected this company because of the professionalism shown by the employees. Provided a comprehensive quote so all questions were answered. Installation was problem free. Would highly recommend that customers look into this company; they will be pleased with what they find.

Project:
Repair or Replace a Sump Pump



The installed pump was too noisy and required replacement. The technician who installed the pump agreed to replace it later at no additional cost.

Fantastic service and response.  The office contacted me within a very short time of my original request, and read what I had written.  Although I had scheduled an appointment on line, they were able to schedule a better time based on what I had written.
The technician who came out was wonderful.  Very knowledgeable, very friendly, explained what was wrong and what was needed, and was very thorough.
Would definitely use them again for any needs, and would highly recommend them.

He can on time and could quickly diagnose the issue and fixed it. Explained how the various parts work and what is the problem. Did not try to sell parts that I do not need.

Randy was wonderful!  (Thank you Home Advisor reviewers for pointing me in his direction.)  He responded to my request with a prompt voice message,, and when we talked, asked all the right questions to assess my needs (in a house that has stood empty for several years & needed the heating system resuscitated & moisture dissipated).  Also found & fixed a venting problem (the cheapest & most critical part of his fixes), and laid out several options and costs for each component.  He was able to come the very next day and get the work done quickly, efficiently, and, most importantly, made me feel like these improvements will hold up and work well.  I also feel pretty confident that his much more personalized service cost me significantly less than any of the local big shops would have charged me.

We had an emergency with a night time breakdown of the furnace on a cold night. Randi responded in less than an hour and was able to locate and pick up a critical part and fix the furnace the same night.

What is the screening process that Service Professionals go through in order to become members of the HomeAdvisor network?





Verify Trade License
            HomeAdvisor checks to see if the business carries the appropriate state-level license. 
Verify Insurance
            As a part of our screening process, we encourage professionals to carry general liability insurance. We require coverage for hundreds of services. 
Verification of State Business Filings
            For business types that require a Secretary of State filing, we confirm that the business is in good standing in the state in which it is located.
Criminal Records Search
            HomeAdvisor uses 3rd party data sources to conduct a criminal search for any relevant criminal activity associated with the owner/principal of the business.
Sex Offender Search
            We confirm that the owner/principal is not listed on the official state Sex Offender web site in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located. 
Bankruptcy Search
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the history of the principal/owner of the business for bankruptcy filings by or against them.
Legal Search for Civil Judgments
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the principal/owner of the business for state level civil legal judgments entered against them.
Liens Search
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the principal/owner of the business for liens placed against them.
Identity Verification (SSN)
            HomeAdvisor verifies the social security number(s) of the owner/principal for identity check purposes. This check applies primarily to smaller business entities.
Identity Verification (Reverse Phone Lookup)
            We conduct a reverse business phone lookup to identify records matching the phone number information provided by the business.








NOTE: Member service professional information confirmed as described above may change or expire over time; while HomeAdvisor attempts to maintain accurate and up-to-date information, and confirms changes when notified, we cannot guarantee that profile and screening information is accurate. Therefore, we recommend that before working with a service professional you verify that information presented is still current and/or acceptable to you.

            HomeAdvisor's Terms and Conditions for a full description of how we screen Service Professionals


**Only for U.S. service professionals 
















            HomeAdvisor's Screening Process
         
HomeAdvisor uses the following criteria to screen service professionals at the time they apply for membership in our network:







Licensing
Applicants must carry required state-level licensing to perform work in the trade and service area for which they apply.




Sex Offender Search
We check the official sex offender website in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located to confirm that there is not a match with the applicant.




Legal Search for Civil Judgments
We use third-party data sources to check the principal/owner of each business for bankruptcy filings and significant state-level civil legal judgments, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, occurring within 12 months prior to application for membership in the HomeAdvisor network.






Criminal Records Search
HomeAdvisor uses third-party sources to conduct a criminal search, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, for relevant criminal activity associated with the business owner/principal within three years prior to application.




State Business Filings
We confirm that service professionals applying as corporations or limited liability companies are in good standing in the state in which they are located.




Identity Verification (Social Security Number)
HomeAdvisor verifies the social security numbers of business owners/principals to confirm their identities. (This applies primarily to small businesses.)







            Notification to residents of AL, CO, DE, GA, ID, KS, KY, LA, ME, MA, MI, MS, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, SD, UT, VA, VT, WY: HomeAdvisor uses a third party to screen professionals.
