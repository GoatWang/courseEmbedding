We apologize if you have been trying to contact customer service this past week about a “Pending” order status.  We just updated the website to include our temporary customer service cell phone to be able to better assist with questions and updates concerning any outstanding orders or issues.  We have been getting a very high number of incoming emails over the last 2 weeks with order inquiries which has slowed down the response time to answer every email we receive.  You can text or call the new customer service cell number for a quicker response. 
 
When will my order ship?

At Purity Solutions fast shipping is our number one priority and all orders should ship within 24-48 hours, Monday-Friday once the order has been successfully processed.
Notice: If your order is not submitted by 12:00pm central time it will not ship until the next business day.
However, In order to provide our customers discounted pricing and from the high volume of orders during our holiday sales the normal shipping policy does not apply. During a sale your order could take an additional 3-5 days to ship.
Upon processing and shipping your order, an e-mail will automatically be sent to you with all important updates and information such as your order number and tracking information. 

What shipping methods are available?

We use both Priority Mail and Express Mail provided by U.S Postal service. In contrast, USPS is not required to scan a package at pickup or during transit, only during delivery.  Periodic rate increases by the USPS may apply.  UPS and Fedex options coming soon.......

What is your return policy?

We issue full refunds on all items that are returned within 90 days of your order. For a FULL REFUND, all items muststill be sealed in their original shrink wrap packaging and shipped back to us at your own expense.  When the product has been received, credit will be issued to the card used at the time of placing the order and funds should be returned to your account within 24-48 hours of the trasaction return (more time may be needed depending on varying bank policy). 
If youare not satisfied with any product you have purchased but it has been opened, we will offer product replacement, exchange, or store credit for the full value of the product(s).  The unused portion of the product must be returned and once received the replacement, exchange or credit will be issued right away.

 

Do you test your products?

Yes, Purity Solutions is thegame changer in the research chemical industry, all products are thoroughly tested by several of the most respected labs in the USA.

My product is colored, why is this?

The products are colored for ease of recognition during the research process which aids in lab safety. Some laboratories / researchers include material recognition methods in their research protocols and color coding works very well for this. Although seen as not necessary by some, most researchers prefer color coding systems and are pervasive in the laboratory environment.  Variations in color such as lighter, darker, shade variations do not constitute a change in formulation or quality concerns.  

Standards in coloring applications are usually very consistent but occassionally slight shade variations may occur if different brands, amounts, or combinations of the coloring agents are used when mixing bulk solutions.  This DOES NOT mean that any changes in concentration of raw material, quality of active compounds, notable changes in liquid or supension formulations or ANY other relative changes for research purposes is of concern. 
Why does my order say "Offline" after I check out?

WHEN YOU PLACE AN ORDER WITH PURITY SOLUTIONS YOU WILL SEE A "PENDING" STATUS when the order has been submitted.  This means the payment and order information have been submitted to us but your card has not been charged at that time.

***WE NEED TO HAVE YOUR CIV/CVV VERIFICATION NUMBER TO MANUALLY PROCESS YOUR ORDER.  THIS CIV/CVV CODE NEEDS TO BE PUT IN THE COMMENTS SECTION WHEN PLACING YOUR ORDER (OTHERWISE A PURITY SOLUTIONS STAFF MEMBER WILL NEED TO CONTACT YOU VIA EMAIL OR PHONE TO GET THE VERIFICATION CODE AND YOUR ORDER CAN'T BE PROCESSED IN STANDARD TIME).***
What updates should I receive after I submit my order?

When you submit your order a CONFIRMATION EMAIL will be sent with a copy of your invoice.  
When the order has been processed (your card has been charged) your order status will be changed to "ACCEPTED" and an email will be sent.  
When the shipping label has been created for your order an email from ShippingEasy with your tracking and shipping info.

How long does it take to "Process" my order?

ORDERS ARE TYPICALLY PROCESSED MANUALLY WITHIN 24-48 HOURS OF PLACING THE "OFFLINE" ORDER. 

I tried to make a purchase that did not go through yet my online bank statement shows that funds have been withdrawn?

The order that you tried to place may have not have gone through but your credit card has not been charged. However, your financial institution is showing a pending amount on your credit card statement. THIS IS NORMAL. This amount will drop off in 2 - 10 days according to the banking / credit institution's policy. PLEASE REMEMBER, It is only a "pending" charge, it will not go through.

Why have I not received my order confirmation e-mail?

Since e-mails are sent by our server automatically if you do not receive your confirmation e-mail then more than likely your order has been picked up by your spam box. Please check your spam box for this e-mail and add purity_solutions@yahoo.com to your safe e-mail list. 

What information will show up on my Billing Statement?

Charges will appear as "Celtic Labs LLC".  The new processing company has fraud protection and verification.  A verification text or email will be sent at the time the order is processed to confirm that the charge was authorized. 

Why  doesn't my order go through? I'm getting an error message or decline code after I hit the "submit" button to complete the checkout process.

Edit your Billing address with the proper information. Please keep in mind that your billing information and 3 digit code must be correct to the letter for the order to go through. Many credit card processors have increased the level of address matching that must take place in order for an order to process successfully. Things such as abbreviations and characters should match what your bank / cc processor has on file for you EXACTLY or you will be declined. Apply in the invoice exactly what is on file with the card. Please contact your card services if needed to update the information and try again. Be sure to read the text on the error page when the order is declined. This can give helpful information as well.

 If you have any questions or any concerns about our products, services, or an existing order our customer service representatives are ready and available to help assist you today.  Please feel free to contact us via our Customer Support email at puritysolutionscs@gmail.com and for a limited time we are also opening our direct phone to our main warehouse for anyone to call in to inquire about their order status or to place a manual order via phone. The direct number is 985-276-4787 and 985-956-1697 cell

If you have any other payment processing questions please contact customer service for more details.

We apologize if you have been trying to contact customer service this past week about a “Pending” order status.  We just updated the website to include our temporary customer service cell phone to be able to better assist with questions and updates concerning any outstanding orders or issues.  We have been getting a very high number of incoming emails over the last 2 weeks with order inquiries which has slowed down the response time to answer every email we receive.  Our main customer service phone number has still been out of order due to lack of available service reps to come to our warehouse to repair the line ever since the flooding in Louisiana early in August.  You can text or call the new customer service cell number for a quicker response. 
We have everything except Exemestane in stock at this time and our shipping turnaround time IS back to our normal 24-48 hours from the time the payment is successfully processed.  This extra security and modification of our site will be a major benefit for us and our customers but it is an inconvenience for everyone involved.  We will continue to have temporary options to pay directly via paypal invoicing request/link, COD/Mail orders via money order or cashier’s check and direct bank/wire transfer options.  We are even offering an additional 10% discount, free products of choice and free shipping upgrades for direct wire transfers via bank wire or money gram (western union is not available) until our new processing is finalized     *Min order amount or order date considerations may apply.  

Free Product of choice with new Loyalty Rewards points system.  Email for more information on how to join.  General Program details are listed below:
We hope the new Loyalty Reward Points program will do well and make our customer base a little happier after all the ups and downs with processing and stock supply issues these last few months......as we are really wanting to work on revamping customer service relations and getting an answering service to assist with calls and emails this month.

We will be offering 15-20% discount on bulk orders starting with quantities of 10+. 
We have a Loyal Points reward that gives 1 point for every $25 dollars spent and for every 10 points we give a free product of choice.  We are offering free express upgrades for orders over $250.  

New Products coming soon: 
We will have several new sales and promotions and catalog expansion once our merchant processing issue has been fixed.  We will be adding new products to Purity Solutions catalog over the upcoming months:  Coming Soon DMAA/CaffeineSolution
If anyone has questions or concerns, please call 985-415-1753 or email puritysolutionscs@gmail.com for further assistance with payment instructions or updates regarding any recent orders placed.  Please be sure to include your order number, payment options or any other important details when emailing a request for payment instructions or our available payment invoicing or links (PAYPAL NO LONGER AVAILABLE).
We apologize for so many recent changes and any confusion or frustration that your recent order with us may have caused.  We have been in business for over a decade and have worked very hard to build our loyal customer base and with all the hurdles and difficulties we have struggled with, we would hate to lose even a single customer because of these difficult circumstances that have hindered us for way too long now. 
The best thing that we can do is continue to work towards expanding our customer service support and communications to address any outstanding order request or concern and expand our payment options until our processing is back online.  We want to thank everyone who has been so patient and supportive these last few months and we hope to continue to be your number one choice for all future orders when needing any of our highest quality custom research solution supplies.
Sincerely,
Purity Solutions Admin

Edit your Billing address with the proper information. Please keep in mind that your billing information and 3 digit code must be correct to the letter for the order to go through. Many credit card processors have increased the level of address matching that must take place in order for an order to process successfully. Things such as abbreviations and characters should match what your bank / cc processor has on file for you EXACTLY or you will be declined. Apply in the invoice exactly what is on file with the card. Please contact your card services if needed to update the information and try again. Be sure to read the text on the error page when the order is declined. This can give helpful information as well.

 If you have any questions or any concerns about our products, services, or an existing order our customer service representatives are ready and available to help assist you today.  Please feel free to contact us via our Customer Support email at puritysolutionscs@gmail.com and for a limited time we are also opening our direct phone to our main warehouse for anyone to call in to inquire about their order status or to place a manual order via phone. The direct number is temporarily unavailable and 985-705-3957 (cell)

Serial Port Prototypting
Lots of small embedded/robotic systems make extensive use of serial ports for communication between sensors, actuators, and a central processor of some sort. Despite this being one of the simplest interfaces one can work with, it can still be a serious headache to initially set up, debug, and prototype with. This tutorial is going to look at some handy tools you can use to make prototyping, development, and hardware configuration easier when using a serial port on a Linux box.
Port Configuration
Most of the default behaviors for Linux’s serial port functionality were chosen based on the assumption that the port would be used for communication with some kind of external modem or terminal application. While the implementation is flexible enough to give you near complete control of the port, these defaults can be disorienting for first timers.
One of the more annoying behaviors is line termination  – depending on your particular OS the serial port might be sticking new line or carriage return characters on the end of your packets without you realizing it. Weird things might also happen when your control program opens or closes the port.
Ideally what you’re after is a ‘raw port’, one which sends only the exact character sequences specified. There’s a few different ways to go about getting this behavior:
Via C Program
From within a C program a serial port’s properties are set through the termios interface.
#include 
#include  
First, obtain a file handle to the serial device based on the IO characteristic desired:
int fd = open("/dev/ttyUSB0", O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NONBLOCK); //non-blocking
int f d = open("/dev/ttyUSB0", O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_SYNC); //blocking
Then, set up the control data structure and use it to set the baud rate for the port:
struct termios attrs;
cfsetispeed(&attrs, B115200);
cfsetospeed(&attrs, B115200);
Set the control flags associated with desired port behavior:



No Parity

attrs.c_cflag &= ~PARENB;



Odd Parity

attrs.c_cflag |= PARENB;
attrs.c_cflag |= PARODD;



Even Parity

attrs.c_cflag |= PARENB;
attrs.c_cflag &= ~PARODD;



One Stop Bit

attrs.c_cflag &= ~CSTOPB;



Two Stop Bits

attrs.c_cflag |= CSTOPB;



Set Character/Word Size to N=[5,8] bits

attrs.c_cflag &= ~CSIZE;
attrs.c_cflag |= CSN;




Finally, apply the settings structure to the port to commit the changes.
tcsetattr(fd, TCSANOW, &attrs);
Via Command Line
You can also deal with this settings completely outside of your program, which cuts down on added logic that doesn’t actually add to your controller. Be aware that each time you reboot the machine (or add/remove the USB device when applicable) the settings are going to reset.
To set raw mode and a baud rate, use the following command:
 stty -F /dev/ttyS0 raw 
Other options:



No Parity
-parenb


Odd Parity
parenb parodd


Even Parity
parenb -parodd


One Stop Bit
-cstopb


Two Stop Bits
cstopb


Set Character/Word Size to N=[5,8] bits
csN



To set a port to 115200 baud with even parity, a 8 bit character size, and two stop bits:
stty -F /dev/ttyS0 raw 115200
stty -F /dev/ttyS0 parenb -parodd cstopb cs8
Check the stty man page for more information.
Command Line I/O
echo
When you’re first testing a new peripheral, it’s a pain to have to write up a full program in order to send out a simple test string to see if the device works. Fortunately, unix has a solution – echo. echo is used to copy a string specified by the user to stdout (or to some node like /dev/ttyS0 that the user specifies using a pipe). Let’s say I wanted to print “hello world” to a file, I would do so by:
echo "hello world" > somefile
And now somefile will contain the string “hello worldn”. Echo can also be used to push arbitrary binary strings to a file. (Don’t forget, in unix my serial port is also a file.) Let’s say I want to send a byte string of:
[ 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x2D ]
out of /dev/ttyS0.  I can do this by writing some C code to push the characters, or I can avoid reinventing the wheel and use echo:
echo -n -e "xFFxFFx10x11x12x2D" > /dev/ttyS0
You’ll notice that two new command line switches were added to my echo call. The first ‘-n’ supresses the automatic newline that echo adds by default to the end of a string. If I’m printing out to a serial port I almost certainly don’t want this behavior, so I use ‘-n’ to turn it off. The second switch ‘-e’ enables the intepretation of “backslash escapes”, these are the format codes like “xFF” that allow us to print non-ascii characters that aren’t available on the keyboard. You can read about all of them in the man page, the one’s you’re most likely to use are:

xHH – specify a byte with hexadecimal value HH
NNN – specify a byte with octal value NNN
n – newline character (equivalent to x0A or 012)

cat
The flip side of echo, an input handling program, is cat. cat will copy the contents of its input files to stdout. You can use this with a serial port to view the activity on the line. Running the command:
cat /dev/ttyS0
will print any activity on the serial port to your terminal screen. Unfortunately, your terminal isn’t equipped to handle the non-printable bytes that your serial device is probably sending to your machine. To get a better look at things, you can redirect cat’s output to a program that does hex formatting, like so:
cat /dev/ttyS0 | hexdump
Now you’ll get a hexadecimal printed version of your data instead, a much more intuitive format for peripheral communication.

If you’d also like to save a copy of the data somewhere as it comes stream in, you can use a neat little program called tee. Change your current cat command to:
cat /dev/ttyS0 | hexdump | tee somefile
and the file somefile will contain a copy of whatever cat processed, in hex formatting. If you remove the hexdump command from this chain, the file will contain the raw data.
socat
Another painful part of developing for serial devices is unit testing the code. Most times the best way to really exercise code is with other bits of code – before you hook things up to your often expensive hardware. It’s possible to do code testing using either files or pipes as an endpoint (instead of your serial device), but these mechanisms aren’t entirely symmetric in terms of their access mechanisms. Character files don’t track well – input and output tend to step on each other’s toes. Pipes, on the other hand, are unidirectional where a terminal endpoint is bidirectional, forcing the I/O logic to fork at the front end and creating needless headaches. How, then, does one achieve a reasonable simulation of the device from a file access standpoint? Then answer is TTY emulation through socat.
Socat (SOcket CAT) is (quoting the man page) “a command line based utility that establishes two bidirectional byte streams and transfers data between them.” Basically it lets you create all types of pipes, sockets, and other transport mechanisms. For embedded systems work it incredibly useful for its ability to credibly fake a serial port (pty). The following command will create a pair of virtual ptys:
socat -d -d pty,echo=0,raw pty,echo=0,raw
The program will print out the two end points it has created (probably in /dev/pts/, but that depends on your particular system). To one of the end points you can hook your control program. To the other you’ll have to hook up to something that can somewhat credibly fake the I/O characteristic of your test device – or you could just use the cat/echo combination from above. The one hang up with this approach is that the actual ptys allocated are not always consistent – sometimes /dev/pts/1 will be allocated and sometimes /dev/pts/5 will be allocated. This is a function of the state of the OS as a whole and there’s not a lot you can do about it. Socat can, however, create links to the unreliably named pts nodes. The links themselves will be in whatever location is specifed, with the names requested. To do this:
socat pty,echo=0,raw,link=link1 pty,echo=0,raw,link=link2
This will create link1 and link2 in the current directory that will point back to the underlying ptys.
If you’ve written your controller to use stdio to do its communication, you can have socat invoke the program directly and connect the endpoint automatically. To get this behavior do the following:
socat -d -d pty,echo=0,raw "exec:progname,pty,echo=0,raw"
Socat’s command line can also be used to specify whatever configuration parameters the virtual ports might require (the same type of behavior covered in the “Port Configuration” section above.



Baud Rate
bRATE (ex: b115200)


No Parity
parenb=0


Odd Parity*
parenb=1,parodd=1


Even Parity*
parenb=1,parodd=0


One Stop Bit
cstopb=0


Two Stop Bits
cstopb=1


Set Character/Word Size to N=[5,8] bits
csN (ex: cs8)



*(The man page indicates that these options should work, but the version of socat on my system would not accept them – your mileage may vary.)
To create a port pair with 115200 baud with no parity, a 8 bit character size, and two stop bits:
socat pty,echo=0,raw,link=link1,b115200,parenb=0,cs8,cstopb=1 pty,echo=0,raw,link=link2,b115200,parenb=0,cs8,cstopb=1
