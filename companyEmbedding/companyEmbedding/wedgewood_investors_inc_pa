 Investment Philosophy and Approach
Since 1984...
At Wedgewood Investors we employ a top down approach to stock selection. All selections are based on a proprietary process that encompasses tangible metrics such as financial ratios and share price as well as intangibles like guidance and management. We are long-term investors and maintain a very low turnover rate within our portfolio. We utilize our process not only for the buy side of the portfolio, but also the sell side. A solid sell discipline is just as important as effective purchasing criteria.

Market Commentary by Dan Teed








As January Goes...
February 7, 2013

There is a saying in the capital markets that “As January goes, so does the rest of the year”. Given that the S&P 500 was up over 5% for the month of January, I really hope this saying is true for 2013. The reality, however, is that the markets will fluctuate and sometimes fluctuate wildly. In the past few years we have seen some of the most volatile markets in history. So, what does “the rest of the year” have in store for the markets?

The Risk of Rising Interest Rates
Bond Risk

Last week the Federal Open Market Committee held a two day meeting to discuss how the Fed viewed the current economic situation.  These meetings occur every month, and at the conclusion of the meeting they release the opinion of the committee members and how they feel the Federal Reserve should act going forward.  For many months the Fed has declared that they see rates remaining low “well into 2014”.

What are analysts saying about Oracle Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Oracle Corporation stock: 
1. KeyCorp analysts commented, "We focused on Oracle’s cloud transition, and how moving to the cloud can generate 3x the revenue per customer, as well as Oracle’s opportunity in the SaaS market. Oracle’s opportunity in cloud and SaaS, and valuation, have been the main area of investor push-back since our upgrade. As Oracle continues to execute on its cloud transition, we believe multiple expansion can continue. Key Investment Points Oracle on average could see 3x the revenue from a customer who moves its workload from on-premise to the cloud. Transitions at Autodesk and Adobe, showed lifetime customer value driven from the cloud is much higher than from on-premise. As Oracle moves its customers to the cloud, it should gain a similar benefit. For the customer, migrating to the cloud can lead to significant overall cost savings, based on labor and hardware costs needed to manage on-premise solutions." (7/18/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Oracle has outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. The company's offerings in SaaS and PaaS have gained significant momentum in the past few quarters, which improves competitive position against salesforce.com and Workday. Further, the introduction of Gen 2 IaaS data centers is expected to improve Oracle’s competitive prowess against Amazon. We believe the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, estimates have been going up ahead of the company's Q4 earnings release. However, the transition from on-premise licensing to cloud-based subscription business model will take some more time to complete, which will impact upcoming results. Moreover, higher investments on IaaS will affect gross margin expansion. Further, a strong U.S. dollar remains a headwind." (6/15/2017)
3. UBS AG analysts commented, "Hardware and services misses in ORCL's F3Q results were handily offset by Cloud and a surprise license upside, with disciplined opex ' G&A especially low on 1x items ' delivering 42.5% OPM, +100bps ahead of consensus. A lower tax rate also helped (UBSe ~3c impact), lifting F3Q EPS to 69c or 7c ahead of Street. This marks the first Q since Nov'14 ORCL has beat both consensus revs and EPS, and combined with 1) healthy ARR growth +73% cc - renders the reiterated FY $2B +40% y/y target more achievable, 2) indications more operating efficiency can be had (headcount -800 q/q the largest since May'10) - still targeting double-digit EPS growth in FY18 by net income improvement vs. buyback driven share count reduction, 3) demonstrable balance sheet strength - ORCL announced an unanticipated +27% dividend increase with results; 4) reasonable valuation; and 5) optionality from tax reform we think shares could garner incremental interest with inflecting fundamentals providing the basis for ORCL's valuation disconnect to narrow vs. peers and market multiples; maintain Buy." (3/16/2017)
4. Wedbush analysts commented, "ORCL's 3Q/Feb. looked better than its 2Q performance, based on our calculations of organic results. As we expected, SaaS and PaaS metrics benefited from the addition of NetSuite, but they also looked better organically. Also, good cost control and an improved tax rate give us reasons to be more positive on the outlook for FY18 EPS growth. However, we remain concerned that consensus expectations for FY18 revenues (about 3% implied organic constant-currency Y/Y) look too high. Although margins could improve next year as optics benefit from the cloud transition, we think they could be pressured longer-term due to a more competitive cloud pricing environment for enterprise applications and database. We would stay on the sidelines." (3/16/2017)
5. Barclays PLC analysts commented, "If the company continues to deliver we think investors would need to re-think the story which could lead to multiple expansion. FX continues to be a headwind but we are starting to see increasing cash flow from the cloud transition story. Hence, we raise our price target to $51 from $47 and reiterate our Overweight rating."
