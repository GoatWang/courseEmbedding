Institutional-caliber wealth management
Using a transparent and collaborative approach, Delphi strives to provide clarity and peace of mind in an unpredictable world.




Our services are driven by thoughtful excellence
Providing institutional-caliber wealth management services, Delphi works to create thoughtfully designed and managed portfolios. Delphi also emphasizes tax efficiency and risk-adjusted returns, in an effort to help you preserve the wealth you’ve worked so hard to build. Read on to learn more about our integrated, transparent and collaborative process.



Assessment
Our assessment process is based on two premises: listening and understanding. Sitting down with you and your family, our team works to understand your unique wealth management needs: What are your plans and goals? What are the risks and opportunities most relevant to you? How is your current portfolio performing?
Taking a comprehensive inventory of your financial landscape, we strive to identify what is and isn’t working. And rather than selling you products, we listen, learning whether or not we can be helpful. If we’re not the best fit, we say so. And if we agree to work together, we promise to continue listening, even after the initial assessment process.




Planning
After understanding where you are now and where you’d like to go, we map your family’s goals to a customized investment strategy. Our planning process helps you understand the risks and trade-offs of different approaches so, working together, we can make the best decisions for you and your family.
We put our extensive knowledge of capital markets, asset allocation, financial modeling and investing to work for you, building a personalized strategy that helps you accomplish your family’s short and long-term goals. And even as we move on to management and coordination, we’re constantly re-assessing and refining, working to secure your family’s future.



Management
Once we’ve created your investment strategy, we begin the meticulous work of constructing and managing your personalized portfolio. Our focus on tax efficiency combined with our disciplined methodology allows us to give you a tax-aware investment solution that also controls risk through systematic and thoughtful rebalancing.
You’ll have 24-7 access to your accounts through our sophisticated online reporting system. Unlike typical investment reports, ours are clear and concise, telling a complete story in a short, easy to digest format. Moreover, our reports tell you the honest truth about what’s happening with your investments. Identifying issues as they arise, we communicate with you and your other advisors to constantly optimize your investment strategy.




Coordination
Understanding that we’re part of a larger tax, legal and estate-planning framework, we work collaboratively with the rest of your advisory team. Whether you need us to take a central role in coordination, or work under another advisor’s lead, we’ll help ensure everyone has the information needed to manage your wealth.
Decisions made about your portfolio don’t happen in a vacuum, and lack of coordination can create a big impact on your lifestyle, charitable goals and family legacy. We’re committed to being excellent members of your advisory team, remaining available, when requested, to coordinate with your banking, legal, insurance and tax advisors.

One stop. Many options.
Preparing for retirement should create excitement, not concern. Yet for many, that’s not necessarily the case. 

          According to a recent study, 60 percent of pre-retirees do not have a plan for how much money they will spend each year in retirement and where that money will come from.1 Additionally, three in four Americans remain highly anxious about their overall retirement outlook.2 

          That’s where we come in.

          We use insurance products, such as fixed annuities, and a variety of investment products to help you build financial strategies. From tax-efficient strategies to investment advice to protecting some of your assets — we’ll cover as many bases as possible to help you create a strategy that supports your retirement lifestyle and long-term financial goals.

At Alliance Wealth Management Group, we can offer you the following products and services:

Retirement Income Strategies

Annuities

Once we understand your financial situation, risk tolerance and investment objectives, we can help you decide which types of products and services fit within your financial strategy.

Retirement Income Strategies
Will I have enough?
Life expectancy in the United States is at an all-time high.1 While that’s great news, one drawback to a longer life is the greater possibility of outliving your savings. In fact, in one study, 43 percent of Americans surveyed said their No. 1 fear in retirement was the possibility of outliving their savings.2

          Figuring out the best way to make your savings stretch over the next 25 to 30 years can not only be confusing, it can also be overwhelming.

          But it doesn’t have to be that way.

          Insurance products like annuities can provide a steady and reliable income stream for the rest of your life, while investment products create opportunities for long-term growth. We can help you incorporate both in a financial strategy designed to put you on the path to the retirement lifestyle you want.

          "Older People Fear This More Than Death.”



Wealth Management
Time could be on your side when it comes to investing.
Generally speaking, the longer you invest the more potential your money has to grow. If you are still trying to recover from losses in recent years and you’re looking to get back on track to accumulating wealth, you may want to consider a more aggressive asset allocation with at least a portion of your money. However, those who’ve lost in the stock market may sometimes be a little more wary of approaches that increase their market risks.
If that sounds like you, there are more conservative investment options available that provide the potential for wealth accumulation. Using these investment options in conjunction with insurance contracts such as annuities can help you design a more conservative retirement strategy. After all, the last thing you want to do in retirement is lose more ground during another market correction.



Asset Protection
Don’t put all your (NEST)eggs in one basket.
You’ve got plans — a lot of them. Wouldn’t it be more fun to focus on your dreams than constantly worrying about what the market’s doing?
Diversifying your retirement assets among a variety of vehicles — including a mix of both insurance products and investments, depending on what is appropriate for your situation — may offer you the best chance of meeting your retirement income goals.
Anyone who invests in the market should understand it involves potential risk of principal. So, to provide some security not found in the stock market, you may want to include some insurance products in your financial strategy. These products, such as annuities, can provide supplemental income throughout retirement and protect your money from declines due to stock market losses. 



Annuities
If you’ve ever worried about outliving your retirement savings, you’re not alone. 
A recent study found that 67 percent of Americans indicated they would be willing to give up smaller pay increases in exchange for steady and reliable income in retirement. In the same study, 78 percent said the disappearance of pensions has made it harder to achieve the American dream.1
With pension offerings on the decline, you may want to consider a fixed income component to your financial strategy. In short, adding an annuity may be an opportunity to help ensure a portion of your retirement income will be guaranteed.
What is an annuity?
An annuity is a contract you purchase from an insurance company. For the premium you pay, you receive certain fixed and/or variable interest crediting options able to compound tax deferred until withdrawn. When you are ready to receive income distributions, this vehicle offers a variety of guaranteed payout options — some even for life.

        Most annuities have provisions that allow you to withdraw a percentage of the value of the contract each year up to a certain limit. However, withdrawals will reduce the contract value and the value of any protected benefits. Excess withdrawals above the restricted limit typically incur “surrender charges” within the first five to 15 years of the contract. Because they are designed as a long-term retirement income vehicle, annuity withdrawals made before age 59 ½ are subject to a 10 percent penalty fee, and all withdrawals may be subject to income taxes.
1 The National Institute on Retirement Security. “Retirement Security 2015: Roadmap for Policy Makers – Americans’ Views of the Retirement Crisis.” March 2015.



Life Insurance
Life insurance isn’t for you — it’s for those you leave behind.
If helping loved ones maintain a standard of living, and avoid financial hardships after your passing is a priority for you, life insurance products can help. A general rule is that you may want to seek coverage between five and seven times your gross annual income. As far as the various types of policies go, they can generally be placed into one of two categories: term and permanent.
Term insurance generally provides coverage for a specified period of time and pays out a specified amount of coverage to your beneficiaries only if you die within that time period. A permanent insurance policy, on the other hand, will stay permanently in effect for the rest of your life, as long as premiums continue to be paid.



Investments
You worked hard for your assets. Now they can work for you.
Inflation, unexpected expenses, once-in-a-lifetime travel opportunities… Predicting the unpredictable is impossible. That’s why it may be prudent to have a certain amount of your nest egg in investment products.
Investing involves risk, and there are no ways to guarantee that you won’t lose money, but having a certain portion of your assets in the market gives you the opportunity to build on your existing wealth. Over time, that growth potential could help you offset the effects of inflation and other factors that erode the purchasing power of your assets — assets you may be counting on to see you to and through retirement.
From stocks and bonds to mutual funds and retirement accounts, we welcome the opportunity to help you figure out where investment products might fit in your overall financial strategy.



Tax-Efficient Strategies
If taxes rise in the future, will it cut into your retirement savings?
Rising taxes may be a concern for anyone — especially for individuals approaching retirement. Having a solid strategy in place for how you will pay taxes on your retirement income can be an important component to living on a fixed income and avoiding surprises come tax time.
Investing in or purchasing a tax-deferred vehicle means your money can compound interest for years, without paying current income taxes, potentially allowing it to earn interest at a faster rate. Tax-deferred vehicles only allow you to defer paying income taxes until the money is withdrawn — presumably during retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket. However, few financial vehicles avoid taxes altogether.
Because tax-deferred vehicles are generally designed to help individuals work toward specific long-term goals, there may be restrictions on when money can be withdrawn without penalty. Early withdrawals may be subject to charges and fees. Withdrawals prior to age 59 ½ may be subject to a 10 percent federal additional tax.
Our firm is not permitted to offer, and no statement contained herein shall constitute, tax or legal advice. You should consult a legal or tax professional on any such matters.



Long-Term Care Strategies
Who will take care of you if you are unable to care for yourself?
As the oldest baby boomers begin to wind through their 70s, one of the biggest concerns may not be outliving income, but outliving good health. With at-home care services averaging $20 per hour1 and assisted living facility costs averaging $3,600 per month,2 it’s understandably daunting. Does your retirement income strategy account for this kind of possibility? Would you be prepared for twice that amount as a married couple?
Considering that you could have to reduce your financial means before Medicaid will pay for long-term care and neither your employer group health insurance nor major medical insurance will cover long-term care, you may want to consider planning ahead for these potential expenses.
We can help evaluate your situation and determine what kinds of products could fit into a comprehensive long-term care strategy, one that is suited to your needs and circumstances.

IRA & 401(k) Rollovers
What’s the best way to handle old IRAs and 401(k)s? 
When you change jobs or retire, there are four things you can generally do with the assets in any employer-sponsored retirement plan:

Leave the money where it is
Take the cash (and pay income taxes and perhaps a 10 percent additional federal tax if you are younger than age 59½)
Transfer the money to another employer plan (if the new plan allows)
Roll the money over into an IRA

Rolling over from one qualified plan to another qualified plan allows your money to continue growing tax-deferred until you receive distributions in retirement. We can help you determine if a rollover is the right move for you.



IRA Legacy Planning
What will your legacy be?
IRA accounts have become one of the largest types of assets inherited by loved ones. If you don’t anticipate needing your IRA money in retirement, you may wish to consider a legacy planning strategy that potentially reduces taxes and increases the payout your beneficiaries will receive upon your death.
You may want to use some of the value in your IRA to provide your beneficiaries with a regular stream of income while leaving the balance of IRA assets invested for tax-deferred growth. The result may yield substantially more money paid out over the course of your beneficiaries’ lifetimes. 
We can help you evaluate your financial situation to determine if IRA legacy planning could help you, and we can work with attorneys and tax professionals to help you meet your goal of structuring a long-lasting inheritance for your loved ones.

Referred Services
In addition to the above services, we can refer you to professionals or work with your preferred professionals to address your needs for: Trusts, Probate, Charitable Giving, Estate Planning, Tax Planning

Trusts
What’s the best way to leave money to loved ones?
There are many different types of trusts, and they can be complex to set up and execute. However, a trust can be a very flexible and advantageous means to transfer your assets in the future. Trusts can also provide current benefits, such as tax deferral and deductions. Unlike a will, a trust may help avoid probate upon your death.
We are happy to work together with you and a qualified estate planning attorney to help you learn more about trusts and ensure they work in concert with your overall financial strategy.
Our firm is not permitted to offer, and no statement contained herein shall constitute, tax or legal advice. You should consult a legal or tax professional on any such matters.



Probate
A will can save your loved ones time, money and hassle.
Probate is the potentially lengthy and costly court process by which a will is proved either valid or invalid. If you do not create a will or set up a trust to transfer your property when you die, state law will determine what happens to your estate. This is called intestate.
Without a will or some other form of legal estate planning, there is the chance that your property may not go where you wish. We can refer you to a qualified estate planning attorney who can assist you in these matters.
Our firm is not permitted to offer, and no statement contained herein shall constitute, tax or legal advice. You should consult a legal or tax professional on any such matters.



Charitable Giving
Giving back — your way.
Creating a charitable gift-giving plan may provide you with multiple tax breaks: an income tax deduction, the avoidance of capital gains on highly appreciated assets and the reduction or elimination of estate taxes on the charitable contribution upon your death.
With changes in the tax environment, there may be compelling reasons to integrate philanthropy into your financial and estate planning.
We are happy to work with you and a qualified professional to help you decide if this is a good option for you.
Our firm is not permitted to offer, and no statement contained herein shall constitute, tax or legal advice. You should consult a legal or tax professional on any such matters.



Estate Planning
What will happen to your assets when you’re gone?
Estate planning is simply determining (while you’re still alive) where your assets should go after you die. Without a properly structured estate plan, your wishes may not be fulfilled, and there may be unintended consequences for your loved ones.
While the concept may seem simple, the vehicles, planning and implementation process can be rather complex. Because of the estate tax laws and the emerging vehicles to help you protect and transfer your assets effectively, it’s important to work with experienced estate planning professionals who stay current in this field and advise clients on a day-to-day basis.
We are happy to work with you and a qualified estate planning attorney to help you pass on the legacy you choose.
Our firm is not permitted to offer, and no statement contained herein shall constitute, tax or legal advice. You should consult a legal or tax professional on any such matters.



Tax Planning
Are you overpaying in taxes?
Paying taxes is part of our patriotic duty, but no one wants to pay more than their fair share. This is as important as ever as you approach retirement. Don’t watch your returns and your estate dwindle as a result of legally avoidable taxes: take action early and get ahead of next year’s tax filing.
We can partner with tax professionals who help ensure that your retirement assets are allocated and distributed as tax efficiently as possible.
Our firm is not permitted to offer, and no statement contained herein shall constitute, tax or legal advice. You should consult a legal or tax professional on any such matters.

Here's our Story. We're looking forward to hearing yours.
Alliance Wealth Management Group, LLC was formed with a singular focus:  To help people nearing retirement or already in retirement plan their financial future.  We call it income planning, and we specifically create an Alliance Income Plan for each client.  It takes a collaborative effort with our clients to produce a financial plan where the focus remains squarely on what you want to accomplish with your money.

Some of what we do is art; some is science.  Products and strategies vary because family financial situations vary.  We don’t believe that a cookie cutter approach works, therefore, each plan is customized.  We use a variety of insurance and investment products to diversify our client's assets to keep them on the path of financial independence. 

Mike Ballard has been in the financial industry for the past 32 years.  He had an accomplished career at Protective Life Corporation, serving as President/CEO of ProEquities, Inc., a registered broker/dealer.  He built that firm from a start-up to one with 1,100 financial planners around the country.  Mike also served for a number of years on The Children’s Hospital of Alabama Foundation Board of Directors.  In addition, he served as the board’s President and was also appointed to The Hospital’s Board of Trustees.  

After a long career with Protective Life, Mike chose to create Alliance Wealth Management Group, a dozen years ago.  He saw that near-retirees lacked the necessary direction to make their retirement dreams a reality.  By using his experience and knowledge of the insurance and investment industries, he helps clients work toward their financial goals. 



Mike lives in Birmingham with his wife of 30 years, Mary.  They have two adult children.  Mike is an accomplished marathon runner, and has completed 18 marathons.

Here's our Story. We're looking forward to hearing yours.
Alliance Wealth Management Group, LLC was formed with a singular focus:  To help people nearing retirement or already in retirement plan their financial future.  We call it income planning, and we specifically create an Alliance Income Plan for each client.  It takes a collaborative effort with our clients to produce a financial plan where the focus remains squarely on what you want to accomplish with your money.

Some of what we do is art; some is science.  Products and strategies vary because family financial situations vary.  We don’t believe that a cookie cutter approach works, therefore, each plan is customized.  We use a variety of insurance and investment products to diversify our client's assets to keep them on the path of financial independence. 

Mike Ballard has been in the financial industry for the past 32 years.  He had an accomplished career at Protective Life Corporation, serving as President/CEO of ProEquities, Inc., a registered broker/dealer.  He built that firm from a start-up to one with 1,100 financial planners around the country.  Mike also served for a number of years on The Children’s Hospital of Alabama Foundation Board of Directors.  In addition, he served as the board’s President and was also appointed to The Hospital’s Board of Trustees.  

After a long career with Protective Life, Mike chose to create Alliance Wealth Management Group, a dozen years ago.  He saw that near-retirees lacked the necessary direction to make their retirement dreams a reality.  By using his experience and knowledge of the insurance and investment industries, he helps clients work toward their financial goals. 



Mike lives in Birmingham with his wife of 30 years, Mary.  They have two adult children.  Mike is an accomplished marathon runner, and has completed 18 marathons.

Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Speak with an advisor  






A Comprehensive Approach
Our corporate executive services are designed to help you mitigate risk, minimize income taxes, plan for retirement, and manage the wealth you’ve worked so hard to build.




Diversification and Exit Strategies

Speak With an Advisor  




Maximization of Executive Compensation
Salary, bonuses, benefit plans, stock options, restricted stock—whatever your compensation includes, there’s a way to optimize it. We work with you to effectively utilize each component so that you get the most out of all of them.
Speak With an Advisor  



Concentrated Stock Management

Speak With an Advisor  




Risk Management

Speak With an Advisor  



Retirement Planning
Executives often have many levers to pull and multiple paths to take along the journey to retirement. Designing the most efficient route takes thoughtful advice, a little time, and a smart team to support you along the way.
Speak With an Advisor  




Collaboration

Institutional-caliber wealth management
Using a transparent and collaborative approach, Delphi strives to provide clarity and peace of mind in an unpredictable world.




Our services are driven by thoughtful excellence
Providing institutional-caliber wealth management services, Delphi works to create thoughtfully designed and managed portfolios. Delphi also emphasizes tax efficiency and risk-adjusted returns, in an effort to help you preserve the wealth you’ve worked so hard to build. Read on to learn more about our integrated, transparent and collaborative process.



Assessment
Our assessment process is based on two premises: listening and understanding. Sitting down with you and your family, our team works to understand your unique wealth management needs: What are your plans and goals? What are the risks and opportunities most relevant to you? How is your current portfolio performing?
Taking a comprehensive inventory of your financial landscape, we strive to identify what is and isn’t working. And rather than selling you products, we listen, learning whether or not we can be helpful. If we’re not the best fit, we say so. And if we agree to work together, we promise to continue listening, even after the initial assessment process.




Planning
After understanding where you are now and where you’d like to go, we map your family’s goals to a customized investment strategy. Our planning process helps you understand the risks and trade-offs of different approaches so, working together, we can make the best decisions for you and your family.
We put our extensive knowledge of capital markets, asset allocation, financial modeling and investing to work for you, building a personalized strategy that helps you accomplish your family’s short and long-term goals. And even as we move on to management and coordination, we’re constantly re-assessing and refining, working to secure your family’s future.



Management
Once we’ve created your investment strategy, we begin the meticulous work of constructing and managing your personalized portfolio. Our focus on tax efficiency combined with our disciplined methodology allows us to give you a tax-aware investment solution that also controls risk through systematic and thoughtful rebalancing.
You’ll have 24-7 access to your accounts through our sophisticated online reporting system. Unlike typical investment reports, ours are clear and concise, telling a complete story in a short, easy to digest format. Moreover, our reports tell you the honest truth about what’s happening with your investments. Identifying issues as they arise, we communicate with you and your other advisors to constantly optimize your investment strategy.




Coordination
Understanding that we’re part of a larger tax, legal and estate-planning framework, we work collaboratively with the rest of your advisory team. Whether you need us to take a central role in coordination, or work under another advisor’s lead, we’ll help ensure everyone has the information needed to manage your wealth.
Decisions made about your portfolio don’t happen in a vacuum, and lack of coordination can create a big impact on your lifestyle, charitable goals and family legacy. We’re committed to being excellent members of your advisory team, remaining available, when requested, to coordinate with your banking, legal, insurance and tax advisors.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
