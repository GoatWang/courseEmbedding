 Prettier Than You CD music Product Description

Prettier Than You album for sale by Brian Stevens was released Feb 06, 1996 on the Q Division label. All songs written by Brian R. Prettier Than You songs Stevens. Prettier Than You CD music contains a single disc with 13 songs. The first solo album by former Cavedogs singer/guitarist Brian Stevens removes the sort of rootsy element that typified that fine band. Stevens spent the years between the breakup of the Cavedogs and his solo debut recording and touring with fellow Bostonian Aimee Mann, and 1996's Prettier Than You even poaches a couple of members of Mann's Whatever-era band: former XTC guitarist Dave Gregory and multi-instrumentalist/producer Jon Brion. It's strictly Stevens' show all the way, however, and as if he had years' worth of material to get out as quickly as possible, Prettier Than You blithely leaps from '60s-flecked psychedelia ("Disillusioned Days" sounds like the Byrds covering the Bevis Frond) to a rocking brand of power pop to the sort of country-pop songs Mike Nesmith used to slip onto Monkees albums. From the ultra-catchy opener "Zasu Pitts" on, no two songs sound alike, but Stevens' clever lyrics and strong way with guitar pop hooks make for a bracing debut. ~ Stewart MasonPersonnel: Brian R. Stevens (vocals, bass, guitar, keyboards, harmonica, mandolin); Merrie Amsterburg (vocals); Dave Gregory (guitar, keyboards); Peter Linton, Clayton Scoble (guitar); Marc Lowenstein (saxophone, vocals); Jon Baker Lupfer (saxophone, vocals); Jon Brion (Clavinet, guitar); Milt Sutton (drums); Roberto Toledo. Recorded at Q Division Studios Ltd.,  Boston, Massachusetts and The Shed, Swindon, England.

Company Profile | Stevens Products Ltd.
































Structure of Stevens Products Limited
SPL is the registered corporate entity in our company structure, responsible for financing and procurement.
							The various divisions provide alternative routes to market depending on the market segment needs.



Commercial Outdoor Machinery is the retail division which market direct to commercial users of specialist outdoor machinery such as excavators, skid steers, tree chippers, golf course equipment, mowers and turf renovation equipment.
Stevens Outdoor Power Equipment is the wholesale division which primarily markets to resellers through a nationwide dealer network of approximately 140 dedicated Outdoor Power Equipment outlets.
Stevens Manufacturing is the manufacturing division which provides attachments and product improvements for brands distributed by Stevens Outdoor Power Equipment and Commercial Outdoor Machinery. It also manufactures other low volume niche products to suit the local market which are not able to be imported from overseas.






HISTORY
Founded in 1974 by Hayward and Brian Johnston, Stevens Products began as a small father and son manufacturing and engineering business operating from their home garage.Through the 1980's and beyond, Stevens Products designed and manufactured many of their own products including tractor mowers and walk behind mowers. From this background the company is well known and respected by municipalities and local governments nationwide. Today SPL is a third generation business and now occupies a 30,000 ft2 facility on two acres.
IMPORTING & DISTRIBUTION
In 1988, SPL diversified from manufacturing and engineering and began importing mowers from the USA. With generations of engineering experience at its core and its onsite engineering facility, the company was well equipped to modify and acclimatise imported equipment to ensure it worked optimally in New Zealand conditions. Although having a land area a little larger than the United Kingdom, New Zealand's population is only 4.5 million. This fact makes the companies' achievements with the brands it has chosen to represent to date truly amazing, well surpassing their supplier's expectations.
OWNERSHIP & FINANCIAL POSITION
SPL is a privately held company wholly owned by the Johnston family. The family owns the property and facilities, and the shareholders provide all the funding.
SUSTAINABILITY
SPL offers an exceptionally resilient business model in today's rapidly evolving market because of its experience in Manufacturing, Research & Development, Importing, Wholesale, and Retail. These core strengths give SPL suppliers a distinct advantage by ensuring that products remain relevant to the New Zealand market conditions, and can be distributed to market through the most effective channel.
OUR MISSION:
Passionately sell great products and services that our customers enjoy using to make their jobs easier and more satisfying, put our customers at the heart of everything we do, and keep ahead of the competition by applying ‘Perfected for Acclimatised Performance’.
OUR VISION: 
To continue growing at a rate of 22% per annum from sales of high quality capital equipment (including parts, service, attachments and hire), and have a worldwide top 3 per capita market penetration for all brands we sell.

Lackawanna Marks the Spot

On the Move

With the dependable PATH train just a short walk from campus, getting to New York City is a breeze. 











A Nod to the Past

The Stevens campus is dotted with historic buildings and structures that are reminders of the proud legacy of the university's founding family.
