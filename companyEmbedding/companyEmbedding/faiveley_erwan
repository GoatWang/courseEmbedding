Faiveley



 Portfolio Producer






Founded in 1825, Domaine Faiveley has seen its fair share of vintages. Based in the Côte de Nuits, this family run domaine has over time, progressed and expanded to such a point that it now owns vines in some of the finest terroirs in Burgundy, including Gevrey-Chambertin, Volnay, and Puligny-Montrachet. The vineyard holdings are often small averaging at 1 hectare; therefore production sizes are extremely limited. Yet the domaine commands more than 10 hectares of Grand Crus, including the entirely Faiveley owned Corton Clos des Cortons Faiveley Grand Cru. Maturation takes place in oak barrels from coopers have been rigorously selected for their fine grain and light toast. For red wines a third new oak is used for the Premiers Crus and two thirds for the Grands Crus. Remaining a family run domaine, it was François Faiveley who introduced more modern techniques of sorting and fermentation. Now, he has passed this on to his son, Erwan Faiveley, who took over the domaine in 2007 and has set about fine-tuning the winemaking process to make a more gentle, elegant style of Burgundy.  The red premiers crus are aged. Wine produced under the Joseph Faiveley label are a product of fruit sourced by the negociant arm of the business, in many cases, from some of the top vineyards in Burgundy. The Faiveley family also own Domaine de la Framboisiere in Mercurey from which they had bought fruit from since 1933. After working together for four generations they bought the Domaine in 2011.

Tax Status Explained


IB stands for In Bond. Wines that are stored In Bond have not had UK Duty and VAT paid on them.
Most of our wines are available for purchase under bond, as fine wines often need to be laid down in order to allow them to mature. Many clients choose therefore to store them in our bonded warehouse and pay the tax as and when they wish to get the wines delivered. Please note that Wines purchased In Bond can be exported to non-EU countries without the need for Duty and VAT to be paid.
DP stands for duty paid. If you wish to get wines delivered for drinking, the duty and VAT will need to be paid as it leaves its bonded state in the warehouse. The wine is then said to be duty paid.
All taxes must be paid in order for us to be authorised to ship or deliver wine (unless the wine is bonded and being moved to another bonded warehouse or being shipped directly outside of the EU.)
EP stands for En Primeur. These wines are currently held with the Estate and Domaine’s we work with and will be shipped in due course.

Faiveley





Since 1825, the Faiveley family has always cultivated the vineyards with the greatest respect for its terroirs in Cote de Nuits, Cote de Beaune and Cote Chalonnaise. To create great Burgundies, Erwan Faiveley associates the principles of modern oenology with really traditional maturation, in French oak barrels, in 19th century vaulted cellars. From the arrival of the harvested grapes to bottling, nothing is left to chance. Each terroir and each vintage, benefits from special attention which makes the cuvées unique. Each bottle therefore becomes the faithful reflection of its terroir of origin.
