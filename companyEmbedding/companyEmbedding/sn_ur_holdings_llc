The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Security and Issuer.   This Schedule 13D (this Schedule 13D) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) relates to the common units (the Common Units) of Sanchez Production Partners LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the Issuer), held by SN UR Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanchez Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (each, a Reporting Person or collectively, the Reporting Persons). The principal executive offices of the Issuer are located at 1000 Main Street, Suite 3000, Houston, Texas 77002.   Item 2. Identity and Background.   (a)                                 This Schedule 13D is filed jointly by each of the following persons:   (i)                         SN UR Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Holdings); and   (ii)                      Sanchez Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Sanchez Energy).   Certain information required by this Item 2 concerning the executive officers and directors of Sanchez Energy are set forth on Schedule A, which is incorporated into this Item 2 by reference.   (b)                                 The address of the principal office for the Reporting Persons is 1000 Main Street, Suite 3000, Houston, Texas 77002.   (c)                                  Holdings is a wholly-owned, member-managed, limited liability company subsidiary of Sanchez Energy, the sole member of Holdings. Sanchez Energy is primarily engaged in the business of exploring, acquiring and developing unconventional oil and natural gas resources in the onshore U.S. Gulf Coast.   (d) and (e)                                        The Reporting Persons, nor, to the best of any Reporting Persons knowledge, Sanchez Energys executive officers or directors listed on Schedule A has, during the last five years, been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or been party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.   Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.   On November 16, 2016, Holdings and the Issuer entered into a Common Unit Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) pursuant to which Holdings purchased 2,272,727 Common Units (the Purchased Units) at a price of $11.00 per Purchased Unit.  The consideration for the Purchased Units was funded from Holdings available cash on hand. The closing of the Purchase Agreement and the sale of the Purchased Units was conditioned on, among other things, the Issuer consummating (i) the public offering and sale of 6,550,802 Common Units and (ii) the acquisitions described below under Item 4.  In connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement on November 22, 2016, Holdings and the Issuer also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement), dated November 22, 2016, that provides for, among other things, certain customary registration rights for Holdings, including demand registration rights with respect to the preparation and filing with the SEC of one or more registration statements for the purpose of registering the resale of the Purchased Units. The transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement were approved by an independent committee of Sanchez Energys board of directors.   The descriptions of the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the agreements, which are filed as Exhibits A and B, respectively, to this Schedule 13D and are incorporated into this Item 3 by reference.   4      Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.   Each Reporting Person acquired the Common Units reported in this Schedule 13D solely for investment purposes. Each Reporting Person may make additional purchases or dispositions of the Issuers securities either in the open market or in private transactions depending on such Reporting Persons business, prospects and financial condition, the market for the Issuers securities, general economic conditions, stock market conditions and other future developments.   On November 22, 2016, Sanchez Energy and SN Midstream, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanchez Energy (SNM), consummated the disposition of 50% of the outstanding membership interests in Carnero Processing, LLC (Carnero) pursuant to the previously announced Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated October 6, 2016, among Sanchez Energy, SNM and the Issuer.  Carnero is constructing a cryogenic gas processing facility located in La Salle County, Texas.  The Issuer paid aggregate cash consideration of $55.5 million and agreed to assume approximately $24.5 million of remaining estimated capital contribution commitments in connection with the acquisition.  In addition, on November 22, 2016, SN Cotulla Assets, LLC and SN Palmetto, LLC (together, the Seller), each a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanchez Energy, also consummated the disposition of working interests in 23 producing Eagle Ford wellbores located in Dimmit and Zavala counties in South Texas together with escalating working interests in an additional 11 producing wellbores located in the Palmetto Field in Gonzales County, Texas, pursuant to the previously announced Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated October 6, 2016, among the Seller, on the one hand, and the Issuer and SEP Holdings IV, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer, on the other hand.  The Seller received aggregate cash consideration of $25.6 million after $1.4 million in normal and customary closing adjustments.  The transactions referred to above were approved by an independent committee of Sanchez Energys board of directors.  Sanchez Energy and its subsidiaries have in the past and may in the future make proposals with respect to, negotiate and enter into transactions similar to the foregoing with the Issuer and its subsidiaries.  Until October 2030 Sanchez Energy has granted to the Issuer a right of first offer on certain midstream assets of Sanchez Energy and its subsidiaries.   As noted on Schedule A, certain of Sanchez Energys directors and executive officers were appointed to serve as directors or executive officers of the Issuers general partner prior to the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement. In addition, A. R. Sanchez, Jr., Antonio R. Sanchez, III, Eduardo A. Sanchez and Patricio D. Sanchez, collectively, indirectly own over a majority of the equity interests in and control SP Holdings, LLC (SP Holdings), which owns all of the Issuers incentive distribution rights (which represent the right to receive increasing percentages of quarterly distributions in excess of specified amounts) and all of the equity interests in the Issuers general partner (the entity responsible for conducting the Issuers business and managing its operations), giving SP Holdings the right to appoint the directors of the Issuers general partner, subject to the director appointment rights of Stonepeak Catarina Holdings LLC as described in the Issuers Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 14, 2015. To the best of the Reporting Persons knowledge, however, SP Holdings and/or its direct or indirect equity owners have no current intention of changing the board of directors or management of the Issuers general partner.  SP Holdings and/or its direct or indirect equity holders, as direct and indirect owners of the Issuers general partner, may cause the Issuer to change its distribution policy or its capitalization, through the issuance of debt or equity securities, from time to time in the future. To the best of the Reporting Persons knowledge, however, SP Holdings and/or its direct or indirect equity owners have no current intention of changing the present capitalization or distribution policy of the Issuer.   From time to time, the board of directors of the Issuers general partner may grant equity awards to qualifying participants pursuant to the Issuers Long-Term Incentive Plan attached hereto as Exhibit E and may approve the issuance of equity interests in the Issuer to SP Holdings pursuant to the Issuers Amended and Restated Shared Services Agreement described in Item 6 below.   Except as described in this Schedule 13D, neither the Reporting Persons nor, to the best of any Reporting Persons knowledge, Sanchez Energys executive officers or directors listed on Schedule A, has, as of the date of this Schedule 13D, any plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions or events specified in clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of this Schedule 13D. Each Reporting Person and such other persons may change its, his or her plans or proposals in the future. In determining from time to time whether to sell or dispose of the Common Units reported as beneficially owned in this Schedule 13D (and in what amounts) or to retain such Common Units, each Reporting Person and each such other person will take into consideration such factors it deems relevant, including the business and prospects of the Issuer, anticipated future developments concerning the Issuer, existing and anticipated market conditions from time to time, general economic conditions, regulatory matters, and other opportunities available to such Reporting Person and other persons. Each Reporting Person and such other persons reserve the right to acquire additional securities of the Issuer in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions (which may be with the Issuer or with third parties) or otherwise, to dispose of all or a portion of their holdings of securities of the Issuer or to change their intention with respect to any or all of the matters referred to in this Item 4.   Depending on these factors, and other factors that may arise in the future, each Reporting Person, any of Sanchez Energys executive officers or directors listed on Schedule A, or Sanchez Energys affiliates may be involved in matters specified in clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of this Schedule 13D and, depending on the facts and circumstances at such time and subject to applicable law, may formulate a plan with respect to such matters. In addition, each Reporting Person or other persons or entities identified above may from time to time hold discussions with or make proposals to management of the Issuer or its general partner, the board of directors of the Issuers general partner, to other unitholders of the Issuer or to third parties regarding such matters.   5      The information set forth in this Item 4 is subject to change, and there can be no assurances that the matters described in this Item 4 will occur or that each Reporting Person or other person or entity referred to herein will or will not take, or cause to be taken, any of the actions described above or any similar actions.   Item 5.
