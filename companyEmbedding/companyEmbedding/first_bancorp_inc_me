	PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS









	The health of the Company depends on a strong, independent and attentive Board. The Nominating/Governance Committee of the Board of Directors believes that it is necessary for each of the Company’s Directors to possess a considerable amount of business management and educational experience. In addition, Directors must have sound judgment, wisdom, integrity and ethics. Directors are encouraged to attend seminars and courses to enhance their directorship skills. Each of our outside Directors brings to the Company knowledge from his or her field of expertise, including leadership, finance, marketing and human resources, through the management of their own companies or professional practices. These experiences provide perspective, analytical insight and objectivity when overseeing and evaluating Management. In addition, all Directors serve as referral sources for the Company’s subsidiary. All Directors of the Company also serve on the subsidiary’s Board and meet the requirements for Directors as set forth by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Board’s familiarity with the Bank’s systems and controls is crucial in maintaining the Company’s safety and soundness. In order to be a candidate for a Director of the Company, each individual must meet the following criteria:













	•






	Be a citizen of the United States.
















	•






	Have the financial capacity to own and/or purchase the minimum equity interest in the Company as specified in the Company’s bylaws.
















	•






	Be available to attend the monthly meetings of the Board of Directors and Board Committee meetings, as scheduled from time to time.
















	•






	Have the ability and willingness to represent the interests of the Shareholders of the Company.
















	•






	Meet any additional criteria that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may establish for directors of a national bank.







	If any person named as nominee should be unwilling or unable to stand for election at the time of the Annual Meeting, the holder of the Proxy will vote for any replacement nominee or nominees recommended by the Board of Directors. Each person listed below has consented to be named as a nominee, and the Board of Directors knows of no reason why any of the nominees may not be able to serve as a Director if elected.




	The Nominating/Governance Committee has nominated the following individuals to be submitted to a vote of the Shareholders at the meeting, each to serve (if elected) for a one (1) year term and until his or her successor is duly elected:

	The First Bancorp 2017 Proxy Statement • Page 5












	About the Board of Directors and Its Committees









	As of the date of this Proxy Statement, The First Bancorp, Inc. had a Board comprised of nine Directors. During 2016 there were six regular Board meetings and one Annual Meeting. After each regular Board meeting time is provided for an executive session without Management present. The Board’s Attendance Policy states that all members of the Board are strongly encouraged to attend each meeting of the Board and Committees on which they serve. All Directors attended at least 80% of Board meetings and meetings held by Committees of which they were members in 2016. The aggregate attendance at Board and Committee meetings by all members of the Board of Directors and its Committees in 2016 was in excess of 95%. All Directors are expected to attend the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and all Directors were in attendance at the 2016 Annual Meeting.









	Although the Company does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity, the Board and the Nominating/Governance Committee believe it is essential that the Board members represent diverse view points and skill sets (such as gender, race, national origin and education as well as professional experience), and consider each nominee’s/Director’s credentials, competencies and skills as well as the candidate’s area(s) of qualifications and expertise that would enhance the Board’s composition and effectiveness.









	Audit Committee.


	 The members of the Company’s Audit Committee for 2016 were Mark N. Rosborough - Chairman, Robert B. Gregory and David B. Soule, Jr. This Committee met four times during 2016. The Company’s Audit Committee receives and reviews reports on examinations and accounting audits of the Company, and works to ensure the adequacy of operating practices, procedures and controls. The Company’s Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Company’s Audit Committee, which is included as Appendix A beginning on page 41 of this document, and can be found on the Company’s website (www.thefirstbancorp.com). The 2016 report of the Audit Committee can be found on page 38 of this document.









	Nominating/Governance Committee.


	 The members of the Company’s Nominating/Governance Committee for 2016 were Mark N. Rosborough - Chairman, Katherine M. Boyd and Stuart G. Smith. This Committee met three times during 2016. As stated in the Nominating/Governance Committee Charter adopted on February 19, 2004, the Committee is responsible for the nomination of Board of Directors members, establishing the tenure and the retirement policies for members of the Board of Directors and reviewing their overall effectiveness. The Nominating charter can be found on the Company’s website (www.thefirstbancorp.com). Under the Company’s Bylaws, if a Shareholder wishes to nominate a Director for consideration by the Committee, he or she must be a Shareholder of record and have continuously held at least $2,000 in market value of the Company’s Common Stock (as determined by the President) for at least one year as of the date of submittal of such proposal and must continue to hold those securities through the date of such annual meeting. The Committee will also consider if a proposed candidate meets the criteria set forth on page 3 of this document. Each member of the Nominating/Governance Committee is independent as defined under the listing standards of the NASDAQ stock market.









	Compensation Committee.


	 The Company’s Compensation Committee is a standing committee of the Bank’s Board of Directors since all executive compensation is paid by the Bank. The members of the Committee for 2016 were Bruce B. Tindal - Chairman, Mark N. Rosborough, Stuart G. Smith and David B. Soule, Jr. This Committee met twice during 2016. No Director of the Bank or the Company serves as a Director on the board of any other corporation with a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or that is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or of any company registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The function of this Committee is to establish the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and to review and approve the compensation of other Senior Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee Charter adopted in 2013 can be found on the Company’s website (www.thefirstbancorp.com).









	In addition to the Compensation Committee, there are five other standing committees of the Bank’s Board of Directors: Executive, Audit, Asset/Liability, Trust and Directors’ Loan. Certain members of Management also








	The First Bancorp 2017 Proxy Statement • Page 6












	serve on some committees of the Bank. There are no family relationships among any of the Directors of the Company.












	Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation in Compensation Decisions









	No member of the Compensation Committee was, or ever has been, an officer or employee of the Company or the Bank. All Committee members are customers of and engage in transactions with the Bank in the ordinary course of business. As described in “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions”, all loans to such individuals were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the Bank and, in the opinion of Management, did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.












	Third Party Compensation of Directors




	Under Rule 5250 (b)(3) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies must disclose the material terms of all agreements and arrangements between any Director or nominee for Director, and any person or entity other than the Company (the "Third Party"), relating to compensation or other payment in connection with such person's candidacy or service as a director of the Company. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, none of the Company’s Directors or nominees for Director were receiving such compensation.




	Director Independence









	The Board reviewed the independence of the Company’s Directors in January 2017 based on NASDAQ standards. In this review, the Board considered transactions and relationships between each Director (and any member of his or her immediate family) and the Company or the Bank and between certain entities in which any Director or any immediate family member has certain interests, on the one hand, and the Company or the Bank, on the other hand. The purpose of this review was to determine which of such transactions or relationships were inconsistent with a determination that the Director is independent under NASDAQ rules. As a result of the review, the Board affirmatively determined that as of January 2017 all of the Directors are independent of the Company and the Bank under NASDAQ rules with the exception of President McKim.









	Risk Oversight









	The Board takes an active role as a whole and also at the committee level in overseeing management of the Company’s risk. The Board regularly reviews information regarding the Company’s liquidity and operations as well as the risks associated with each. While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board of Directors is regularly informed through committee reports about such risk. The Company’s Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to the Company’s executive compensation practices and plans. The Asset/ Liability Committee is responsible for overseeing financial risk. The Audit Committee oversees reports from examiners and auditors of both the internal audit function and independent outside auditors and federal regulators. The Directors’ Loan Committee monitors lending policies to ensure they are adequate and that the lending function follows sound practices. The Trust Committee reviews activities of the Trust and Investment Department to ensure that all trust functions are conducted in accordance with Bank policy, applicable laws and regulations and in a sound manner consistent with fiduciary standards and duties. The Nominating/Governance Committee manages risk associated with the independence of the Board of Directors and potential conflicts.













	The First Bancorp 2017 Proxy Statement • Page 7












	Leadership Structure









	The Company believes that having an independent Director serving as Chairman of the Board is prudent. The Chairman of the Board is elected by a vote of the Directors to serve a one-year term with a maximum appointment of eight terms. The Chief Executive Officer serves on the Board of Directors; however, his main focus is to provide leadership to the Company for accomplishing the directives established by the Board of Directors and is responsible for the general administration, oversight, care and management of all property and business of the Company, and for all of its departments as well as full authority over all officers, managers and employees.









	Code of Ethics









	The Company’s Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, which was adopted by the Board of Directors on June 19, 2003, and the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which was adopted by the Board of Directors on April 15, 2004, are incorporated in the Company’s 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibits 14.1 and 14.2, respectively. They are available on the Company’s website at


	www.thefirstbancorp.com


	, and a copy may be obtained, free of charge, by written request to the Company.









	Audit Committee Financial Expert









	Pursuant to Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company is required to disclose whether it has at least one “Financial Expert” serving on its Audit Committee and if so, the name of the expert and whether the expert is independent of Management. A company that does not have an Audit Committee Financial Expert must disclose this fact and explain why it has no such expert.




	At the present time, the Company’s Audit Committee does not have a member who meets the Securities and Exchange Commission’s complete definition of a financial expert. It is the opinion of the Company’s Board of Directors, however, that the Company addresses its audit functions with a depth of penetration and rigor that meets the intent of the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the following reasons:













	•






	The Company is a one-bank holding company owning all of the capital stock in the Bank. All Directors of the Bank meet the requirements and qualifications imposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Bank’s principal regulator, which conducts regular supervisory examinations of the Bank. In addition to requiring knowledge of the banking industry and the financial regulatory system, these qualifications require a “background, knowledge, and experience in business or another discipline to oversee the Bank.”
















	•

	Compensation Discussion and Analysis









	Executive Summary









	The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of The First Bancorp, Inc. oversees the Company’s executive compensation program. The Committee consists solely of “Independent Directors”, i.e., those Directors who are neither officers or employees of the Company or its subsidiaries nor have a relationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment to carry out the responsibilities of a Director and who are otherwise “independent” under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc.




	The Committee has the direct responsibility to:













	1.






	Review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), evaluate the CEO’s performance in light of those goals and objectives and determine the CEO’s compensation level based on this evaluation. The corporate goals which are developed to encourage Management to not take undue or excessive risk are established jointly between the Compensation Committee and the CEO and are driven by the Company’s strategic plan and annual operating budget. In addition to the Company-wide goals, the Committee and the CEO jointly agree on individual performance goals for the CEO. Examples of these goals, which may vary from year to year, include the Company’s earnings targets, loan and deposit growth objectives, risk management analysis, as well as specific individual goals such as implementing components of the approved strategic plan and leadership development.
















	2.






	Review and approve the compensation of all other Executive Officers of the Company with recommendations and input from the CEO.
















	3.






	Review and approve grants, awards and issuances under, or any material amendment of, the equity-based long-term and short-term incentive plans, which are described below. In consultation with Management, oversee regulatory compliance with respect to compensation matters, including overseeing the Company’s policies on structuring compensation programs to preserve tax-deductibility and, as and when required, establish performance goals and certify that performance goals have been attained for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
















	4.






	Establish and review Company stock ownership guidelines for the CEO and other Executive Officers of the Company.
















	5.






	Review and approve any severance or similar termination payments proposed to be made to any current or former Executive Officer of the Company, and any agreements providing for such payments.















	Philosophy of Our Executive Compensation Program









	The Company recognizes that the attraction and retention of high-performing employees are among the key components of the organization’s past performance and future success. In support of that objective, the Compensation Committee believes that the most effective executive compensation program is one that rewards annually the achievement of established long-term and strategic goals, and aligns executives’ interests with those of Shareholders and the long-term interests of the Company. The Committee evaluates both performance and compensation of our executives relative to the compensation paid to similar executives at comparably sized and similarly performing banks. Our goal is to maintain an appropriate relationship between the compensation of our executives and the Company’s performance. The overall objectives of our compensation program are:













	a)






	To provide both short-term and long-term alignment between pay and performance;
















	b)






	To align executive interests with those of Shareholders;
















	c)






	To remain competitive within the relevant marketplace in terms of total compensation; and
















	d)






	To enable the Company to attract, retain, and motivate top talent.











	The First Bancorp 2017 Proxy Statement • Page 12












	The elements of our compensation program are discussed in more detail below, but in summary, the elements of our program are as follows:













	a)






	Base Pay will target slightly above the market median (55


	th


	to 75


	th


	percentile) of the Company’s peer







	group, established by Pearl Meyer & Partners and described below, and will reflect the individual executive’s role, experience and contribution to the Company.













	b)






	Short-term incentives will reflect annual goals related to the Company’s profitability and asset quality as well as the achievement of individual goals for each executive.
















	c)






	Long-term incentives which focus on achievement of longer-term objectives and seek to reduce incentives driven by short-term developments may be awarded on an annual basis and are intended to promote the retention of the executive team.
















	d)






	The Committee will determine an appropriate mix of base pay, short-term and long-term incentives based on the executive’s position and tenure with the Company.
















	e)






	Other benefits will be competitive and appropriate to retain and attract talented individuals.
















	f)






	All elements of our compensation are evaluated by the Compensation Committee to ensure they are not designed to encourage or incentivize Management to cause the Company to take excessive or undue risk.
















	g)






	In addition to the compensation program, the Compensation Committee has also established stock ownership guidelines for the CEO and other Senior Executive Officers (SEOs). These ownership guidelines further align the SEO's performance with the long term goals of the Company.












	Total compensation is expected to vary each year, and evolve over the long-term to reflect our performance relative to our peers and the industry with corresponding returns for our Shareholders.









	Considerations in Determining Executive Compensation









	In 2016, Pearl Meyer, a consulting firm specializing in compensation and benefits for financial institutions, conducted a comprehensive total senior executive compensation analysis for the Company. The peer group utilized by the Company consisted of publicly traded non-metropolitan bank holding companies located in New England, New York and Pennsylvania. The results of this review were used to guide the Committee’s refinement of the Company’s compensation philosophy and resulting compensation programs for senior executives.









	Compensation Benchmarking:


	Understanding and having a comparative analysis of the compensation of senior banking executives in the banking industry is a key element considered by the Committee in making compensation decisions. Similar to the Company’s past internal practices, Pearl Meyer assisted the Committee with defining a peer group of institutions of similar asset size and regional location. The peer group includes the two comparable banks located in the state of Maine and other banks located in similar non-metropolitan areas in the Northeast. The comparable companies are reviewed annually and may change slightly depending on changes either in the market or in the peer group banks themselves. The peer group targets approximately 20 institutions ranging from two-thirds to two times the Company’s size in terms of assets. The overall objective is to position the Company at approximately the median salary levels of the peer group.




	     Performance factors will also be taken into account should a company in the peer group have performance that varies greatly from that of the group and/or the Company. We may discount a defined peer bank or drop a company from the group should performance vary widely.








































	The First Bancorp 2017 Proxy Statement • Page 13












	The peer group used for 2016 was as follows:



















	Lake Sunapee Bank Group






	Camden National Corporation








	Orrstown Financial Services, Inc.






	Arrow Financial Corporation








	ACNB Corporation






	CNB Financial Corporation








	Enterprise Bancorp, Inc.






	Evans Bancorp, Inc.








	Codorus Valley Bancorp, Inc.






	Merchants Bancshares, Inc.








	ESSA Bancorp, Inc.






	Bar Harbor Bankshares








	Ameriserv Financial, Inc.






	Chemung Financial Corporation








	Hingham Institution for Savings






	Citizens & Northern Corporation








	Penns Woods Bancorp, Inc.






	 










	     In addition to the peer group, the consultant included data from other industry data bases and surveys including Watson Wyatt Financial Institutions Benchmark Survey and Pearl Meyer’s own annual survey. Data and competitive perspectives were assessed relative to base salary, total cash compensation, short- and long- term incentives, total direct compensation, benefits and other compensation and total compensation. The Committee reviewed data individually and in the aggregate. Data from the review was used to develop pay guidelines and as a reference for decisions for both short-term and long-term compensation.









	Elements of the Compensation Program - Detail









	Base Pay


	: Base salary is used to recognize the experience, skills, knowledge and responsibilities required of all our employees, including our executives. When establishing base salaries for 2016, as noted previously, the Compensation Committee engaged the services of Pearl Meyer to conduct a comprehensive compensation analysis. One result of this analysis was the establishment of a peer group, detailed above, and the Committee made a decision to target base salaries just above the market median (55


	th


	to 75


	th


	percentile) of that peer group’s base compensation for similarly positioned executives. In addition to the peer group comparison, a variety of other factors are used to determine base compensation, including: the seniority of the individual, the level of the officer’s responsibility and the performance of the officer in meeting his/her annual goals. The annual goals of the SEOs, other than the CEO, are set jointly by the CEO and the Officer, and reviewed by the Compensation Committee. These goals are aligned with the Company’s annual goals and individualized for the area of responsibility of the SEO. For example, goals of the Senior Loan Officer center on loan growth targets and loan quality parameters, the latter being measured on the basis of loan delinquency rates, level of non-performing loans and amount of loan charge-offs for the year. The CFO has goals based on asset/liability management, investment portfolio performance and quality of financial reporting. As a high-performing Company with consistent results, specifically in the categories of Return on Assets, Return on Equity and Efficiency Ratio that are typically in the upper third of our peer group, we believe that the base salaries of our executives should be reflective of our performance within our industry. Base salaries are reviewed at least annually by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee, with assistance from Pearl Meyer, has worked to design an effective program to motivate and retain SEOs, which may utilize long-term restricted stock.









	Short-Term Incentives









	In 2012, the Board of Directors approved a Short-Term Incentive Plan. The five SEOs and certain other senior executives are eligible for incentives under this program, which is part of a total compensation package including base salary, annual incentives, equity and benefits. The philosophy of the Compensation Committee was to set competitive, reasonable base salaries and allow for the potential of meaningful incentives tied to the Company’s short-term initiatives to optimize profitability, growth, and excellence in individual performance, and to promote teamwork among its participants.








	The First Bancorp 2017 Proxy Statement • Page 14












	The plan is designed to:


















	▪






	Ensure clarity of expectations in terms of expected results;
















	▪






	Recognize and reward achievement of annual business goals;
















	▪






	Motivate and reward superior performance;
















	▪






	Encourage teamwork and collaboration among the Company’s leadership and across business groups;
















	▪






	Attract and retain talent needed to grow the Company/Bank;
















	▪






	Be competitive with market; and
















	▪






	Ensure incentives are appropriately risk-balanced (i.e., do not motivate or reward excessive risk taking).












	Employees who are eligible for incentive awards are subject to meeting the following requirements:













	▪






	New hires must be employed prior to October 1



	st



	 to be eligible to participate in the plan for the performance period. Employees hired after that date must wait until the next calendar year to be eligible for an award under the plan. Eligibility begins the first full month worked. Participants receive a pro-rated award using full months worked during the plan year.
















	▪






	Awards under the plan shall be limited to individuals employed by the Company/Bank on the date of payment,




	except in the case of disability, death, or retirement.
















	▪






	Participants on a performance improvement plan or with an unsatisfactory performance rating at the time of payment or who have given notice of resignation at the time of payment are not eligible to receive an award.












	Each participant has a target incentive opportunity based on his or her role. The target incentive reflects a percentage of base salary determined to be consistent with competitive market practices. Actual awards are based on achievement of specific goals and could range from 0%, for not achieving minimal performance, to 150% of target, for exceptional performance. Each participant has five predefined performance goals used to determine his or her short-term incentive award in three performance categories: Company-wide, individual specific, and discretionary. The goals are then weighted to reflect the focus and contribution for each position in the Company.




	The plan is based on a balance of multiple measures, layered oversight, and reasonable ceilings for exceptional performance. The plan is structured to discourage excessive risk taking. The Compensation Committee reviewed the plan design to insure it is in line with best practices for risk. The altering, inflating, and/or inappropriate manipulation of performance/financial results or any other violation of recognized ethical business standards will subject any participant to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. In addition, any incentive compensation as provided by the plan to which such a participant would otherwise be entitled will be revoked or subject to “claw back.”




	The Short-term Incentive Plan operates on a calendar year schedule (January 1 - December 31). Annual cash incentive awards will be paid out by March 15th immediately following the Plan year. Awards granted under this program are in the form of cash.
















































































	The First Bancorp 2017 Proxy Statement • Page 15












	Since all SEO compensation is paid by the Bank, not the Company, the performance measures for the Short-Term Incentive Plan are based on the Bank's, not the Company's, 2016 performance. The following tables summarize the performance measures, weightings, as well as potential and total payouts for each SEO in 2016:

	Long-Term Incentives









	Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards


	: In 2010, the Company’s shareholders voted to establish an equity-based long-term incentive plan which grants authority to the Board of Directors to issue stock options, restricted stock and other equity-based grants to retain and motivate existing high-performing employees and to attract new members to the Management team should the need arise. The purpose of this plan is to incentivize executives through equity ownership




	and align their interests with those of the Shareholders while providing mid-term and longer-term incentives tied to overall Company performance. It is among the objectives of this plan that, by having a portion of the executive’s compensation tied to the performance of the Company’s stock, the individual will be rewarded for enhancing long-term shareholder value.




	The mid- to long-term outlook of this type of compensation serves as a balance to the short-term rewards of base compensation and the short-term incentive plan. Due to conservative vesting provisions, stock options and restricted stock grants are also designed to encourage an executive to remain with the Company. The amount of options granted reflects the executive’s position in the organization, level of responsibility, impact on the Company’s performance and actual performance in meeting individual performance goals.




	The plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and in 2012, the Compensation Committee established specific long-term incentive targets for the SEOs based on position in the Company. The plan approved by shareholders implements safeguards, including clawbacks, to curtail undue








	The First Bancorp 2017 Proxy Statement • Page 20












	short-term risk taking. The Compensation Committee is responsible for the design and oversight for these safeguards.




	For 2016 performance, grants under the long-term incentive plan were awarded by the Company’s Compensation Committee on January 26, 2017, and were based on the previous day’s closing price for the Company's common stock of $29.10 per share. All awards have cliff vesting, with Mr. Ward’s having a vesting period of one year from the date of grant, and the remaining SEOs having a vesting period of five years from date of grant. The following table summarizes the 2016 targets and actual grants to the SEOs under the long-term incentive program:

	The Board of Directors is required to make appropriate adjustments in connection with the 2010 Plan and any outstanding awards to reflect stock dividends, stock splits and certain other events. In the event of a merger, liquidation or other reorganization event, as defined in the 2010 Plan, the Board of Directors is authorized to provide for outstanding options or other stock-based awards to be assumed or substituted for, and, if the acquiring or succeeding corporation does not agree to assume or substitute for, such awards, the Board of








	The First Bancorp 2017 Proxy Statement • Page 21












	Directors is authorized to provide for the acceleration of any award, and, if applicable, to make an award fully exercisable prior to consummation of the reorganization event or to provide for a cash out of the value of any outstanding options. Upon the occurrence of a reorganization event, the repurchase and other rights of the Company under each outstanding award shall inure to the benefit of the Company’s successor and shall apply to the cash, securities or other property which the Common Stock was converted into or exchanged for pursuant to such reorganization event in the same manner and to the same extent as they applied to the Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award.











	Stock Ownership Guidelines









	On October 17, 2012, the Compensation Committee voted to establish ownership guidelines applicable to Directors, Named Executive Officers, and other executives as recommended by the President and CEO and approved by the Compensation Committee. Executives and Directors are expected to maintain the ownership (by Company grant and individual ownership) of at least the following amounts of the Company's stock:



















	Participant






	Required Value or Number of  Shares








	Directors






	5,000 Shares








	President and CEO






	2x Base Salary








	Senior Executive Officers (SEO)






	1x Base Salary















	As of December 31, 2016, all Directors and SEOs met the above stock ownership guidelines except for Directors Kelly and Russell. Until the ownership guideline is achieved, 75% of Ms. Kelly's and Mr. Russell's directors' fees will be paid in Company stock. The Company has no policies with regard to hedging activities related to shares owned under the above guidelines.









	Compensation Mix









	With assistance from Pearl Meyer, the Compensation Committee believes that the Company has developed an appropriate mix of base pay, short-term incentives and long-term incentives for the Senior Executive Officers. Utilizing the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee reviews the mix and determines how long-term incentives fit with total compensation. The Committee’s expectation is that long-term incentives will constitute 10% to 25% of total compensation depending on the executive and his or her position in the Company. In addition to the long-term incentive plan, the short-term incentive plan approved by the Board in 2012 provides for short-term incentives that could also constitute 10% to 25% of total compensation depending on the executive, his or her position in the Company and the executive’s job performance in the prior year. With the addition of the short-term and long-term incentive programs, base compensation should constitute 50% to 80% of total pay depending on the executive, his or her position and individual achievement in relation to his or her goals. These percentages are based on industry averages and best practices.









	Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan


	: The Company also sponsors an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental retirement plan established in 1997 for certain Executive Officers. The plan provides supplemental retirement benefits payable in installments over 20 years, commencing upon retirement or death. The costs for this plan are recognized over the service lives of the participating Executive Officers. As of December 31, 2016, only one active executive (CFO Ward) was a participant in the plan. The projected retirement benefit for Mr. Ward is $61,127 per year, with such payments beginning in the year 2018. The benefit is capped at the above amount. On December 30, 2008, the Company amended the plans to change the normal retirement age to receive the full benefit under the Plan from age 65 to age 63. The date on which the Executive Officer may begin to collect the retirement benefit payments did not change, however, and remains January 1 of the year in which the Executive Officer turns age 65. The plan also contains a restrictive covenant that may result in the Executive Officer forfeiting all accrued benefits should he accept employment with a








	The First Bancorp 2017 Proxy Statement • Page 22












	competing financial institution within five years after his termination of employment with the Company.









	Other Benefits









	401(k) and Other Benefits


	: The Company’s primary retirement plan is the 401(k) Plan. It is available to any employee who has attained the age of 21 and completed six months of continuous service. The Company typically provides a match at 50% of employee deferrals to the extent that the deferral does not exceed 6% of eligible compensation. In addition, an annual discretionary component may typically be paid. The Board makes a determination at the end of each fiscal year as to what, if any, amount is to be paid based on the financial performance of the Company for that year. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, this discretionary amount was 2.0% of base salary for all eligible employees. Employee contributions are 100% vested at all times, while employer contributions are vested over a five-year period. Upon termination of employment for any reason, a plan participant may receive his or her contribution account and earnings allocated to it, as well as the vested portion of his or her employer-matching account and earnings allocated to it. Non-vested amounts are forfeited and are used by the Company to help defray plan administration expenses.









	Stock Purchase Plan


	: The Company has a stock purchase plan available to all employees and Directors that provides an opportunity to purchase shares through payroll deduction. Directors may elect to have up to 100% of their fees placed in the stock purchase plan. The purchase price is at the fair market value of the shares without a commission as determined by the NASDAQ closing price on the day the shares are purchased.









	Severance and Change of Control Benefits


	: The Company does not have any employment agreements with any of the executives of the Company. For the one active executive covered under the SERP, being CFO Ward, his defined benefits under the SERP shall become fully vested upon a change of control.









	Company Vehicle


	: Senior executives are provided mileage reimbursement for business travel when using their own vehicles. For certain named Executive Officers, a Company-owned vehicle may be provided subject to approval of the Compensation Committee. The non-business use of the vehicle is taxable income to the executive and is included as part of the executive’s total compensation. In 2016 the three executives with Company-provided vehicles were CEO McKim, CFO Ward, and EVP Wootton.









	Bank-Owned Life Insurance


	: The Company may purchase a single-premium life insurance policy on the life of an executive with a split dollar benefit between the Company and the executive’s estate. The Company believes that Bank Owned Life Insurance is a good investment option for the Company and also provides key man protection upon the untimely death of a senior executive. The cash surrender value is an asset of the Company.









	Supplemental Long Term Disability Insurance


	: In 2010, the Company purchased supplemental long-term disability insurance policies for the five most highly compensated executives. Four of those executives remain with the Company and are covered by this policy. This insurance was purchased as a group policy through Union Central Insurance and is intended to assist with any shortfalls that may exist due to the insurance caps applicable to the Company's overall group policy.

	Compensation of Chief Executive Officer and Other SEOs









	Base Salary




	As noted previously, the Compensation Committee has established targets for Base Pay at just above the market median (55th to 75th percentile) of the Company’s peer group, established by Pearl Meyer, and each executive’s actual base pay will reflect the executive’s role, experience and contribution to the Company. CEO McKim was appointed President of the Bank in 2014 and he assumed the title of CEO of the Company on January 5, 2015. His salary for 2016 was set at $430,000 which placed him in the 45



	th



	 percentile for the peer group. As noted above, the Compensation Committee will use the data provided by Pearl Meyer and various other factors, including 2016 operating results after Mr. McKim’s first year in office, to move his base salary to the target level desired by the Committee and what is outlined in our compensation philosophy and strategy.




	The Compensation Committee’s decisions related to 2016 base salaries were based on 2015 operating results. The Bank continued to outperform its national peer group in many areas - as measured by the Uniform Bank Performance Report. These included return on average assets, return on average equity, the efficiency ratio, and asset quality ratios. Building and strengthening the Company’s capital is a priority, and in 2016 the Company’s regulatory capital ratios remained strong. The Board and Management place a high value on building shareholder value, and the $0.22 per share quarterly dividend was increased to $0.23 per share in the second quarter of 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company also declared a special cash dividend of $0.12 per share. Additional detail on the Company’s performance is further detailed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in its Annual Report on Form 10-K.









	Stock Grants/Long-Term Incentives









	As noted above, in 2012, the Compensation Committee established specific long-term incentive targets for the SEOs based on position in the Company for grants to be made under the Equity Incentive Plan approved by stockholders in 2010. Grants for 2016 performance under the Long-Term Incentive Program were awarded on January 26, 2017 and based on the previous day’s closing price for the Company’s common stock of $29.10 per share. All awards have cliff vesting, with Mr. Ward’s vesting one year from the date of grant, and the




	remaining SEOs' vesting five years from the date of grant. The details of these grants can be found on page 21.




	Grants for 2015 performance under the Long-Term Incentive Program were awarded on January 28, 2016 and based on the previous day’s closing price for the Company's common stock of $18.11 per share. All awards have cliff vesting, with Mr. Ward’s vesting one year from the date of grant, and the remaining SEOs vesting five years from date of grant. The details of these grants can be found on page 21.




	Grants for 2014 performance under the Long-Term Incentive Program were awarded on January 29, 2015 and based on the previous day’s closing price for the Company's common stock of $16.70 per share. All awards have cliff vesting, with Mr. Ward’s vesting one year from the date of grant, and the remaining SEOs vesting five years from date of grant. The details of these grants can be found on page 21.









	Other Compensation









	In 2016, there were no additional compensation items other than those detailed in the table below for CEO McKim, CFO Ward, EVP Wootton, EVP Norton and EVP Elder. The change in pension value and non- qualified retirement plan earnings for CFO Ward represents the required accounting accruals under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and does not constitute a cash payment.

	Stock-Based Compensation









	At the 2010 Annual Meeting, shareholders approved the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”). This plan reserved 400,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance in connection with stock options, restricted stock awards and other equity based awards to attract and retain the best available personnel, provide additional incentive to officers, employees and non-employee Directors and promote the success of our business. Such grants and awards will be structured in a manner that does not encourage the recipients to expose the Company to undue or inappropriate risk. Options issued under the 2010 Plan will qualify for treatment as incentive stock options for purposes of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Other compensation under the 2010 Plan will qualify as performance-based for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and will satisfy NASDAQ guidelines relating to equity compensation.




	       In 2014, awards of 25,843 shares of restricted stock were made under the 2010 Plan representing both Long- and Short-Term Incentives based on 2013 performance. These included 14,745 shares to the five SEOs and 11,098 shares to other executives. All of the shares have cliff vesting on the fifth anniversary of the grant except for EVP Ward’s, which vest on the second anniversary of the grant date.




	       In 2015, awards of 13,652 shares of restricted stock were made under the 2010 Plan representing Long-Term Incentives based on 2014 performance. These awards included 10,110 shares to the five SEOs and 3,542 to other executives. All of the shares have cliff vesting on the fifth anniversary of the grant except for EVP Ward’s, which vest on the first anniversary of the grant date. In addition, an award of 527 shares was made in 2015 as a retention incentive to a non-SEO.




	       In 2016, awards of 17,061 shares of restricted stock were made under the 2010 Plan representing Long Term Incentives based on 2015 performance. These awards included 11,264 shares to the five SEOs as detailed in the table below and 5,797 to other executives. All of the shares have cliff vesting on the fifth anniversary of the grant except for EVP Ward's shares, which vest on the first anniversary of the grant date. In addition, awards of 4,786 shares were made in 2016 to a group of Mortgage Loan Officers based on 2015 performance.

	Pension Plan









	Although the 401(k) Plan is the Company’s primary retirement plan, the Company also sponsors an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for one Executive Officer. The plan provides supplemental retire-ment benefits payable in installments over 20 years upon retirement or death. The costs for this plan are recognized over the service lives of the participating Executive Officers. The projected retirement benefit for Mr. Ward is $61,127 per year, with such payments beginning in the year 2018. The benefits are capped at the above amounts. On December 30, 2008, the Company amended the plan to change the normal retirement age to receive the full benefit under the Plan from age 65 to age 63. The date on which the Executive Officer may begin to collect the retirement benefit payments does not change, however, and remains January 1 of the year in which the Executive Officer turns age 65. The Plan also contains a restrictive covenant that may result in the Executive Officer forfeiting all accrued benefits should he accept employment with a competing financial institution within five years after his termination of employment with the Company.

	The Company does not have Nonqualified Deferred Compensation as part of its compensation program.









	Other Employee Benefits









	The Bank provides all full-time employees with group life, health, and long-term-disability insurance. A Flexible Benefits Plan is available to all full-time employees after satisfying eligibility requirements and to part-time employees scheduled to work an average of 30 hours per week.









	Compensation Policies and Practices









	Compensation Programs









	The Company has four primary means of compensating its employees: base pay, the Stakeholder bonus program, the short-term incentive plan and the equity-based long-term incentive plan. Full detail on these programs is provided in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. A summary is provided below.









	Base Pay


	: Base salary is used to recognize the experience, skills and responsibilities of all of the Company’s employees, including its Senior Executive Officers. To determine appropriate levels of base pay for employees other than Senior Executive Officers, the Company participates in a salary survey conducted by Pearl Meyer This survey, conducted of financial institutions in New England, provides much of the information needed to determine base pay for hourly employees, line supervisors and members of middle management. In 2016, the Company also utilized the Pearl Meyer Northeast Banking survey to provide further guidance on base pay for these groups of employees. For the average employee of the Company, it is expected that total compensation will be comprised of base pay, equaling 85% to 90% of total compensation, and that the Stakeholder Bonus Program will be 10% to 15% of total compensation. The total compensation mix for Senior Executive Officers is detailed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis.









	Stakeholder Bonus Program


	: The other key component of compensation for most employees is the Stakeholder Cash Bonus program. This program is not available to SEOs and certain other senior officers. The Stakeholder program was originally implemented in 1994 and is available to all eligible employees. This element of the performance compensation program is designed to support the long-term viability of the Company and increase shareholder value. It addresses these objectives by tying the performance payout to multiple goals which include profitability, growth, productivity and loan quality. The guiding principle is to reach a balance of these goals, which should collectively have a positive impact on maximizing long-term








	The First Bancorp 2017 Proxy Statement • Page 29












	shareholder value without incentivizing employees to take undue risk. The Committee believes that this performance-based program provides a reward for high levels of current performance without sacrificing the achievement of long-term goals. Each year specific key performance indicators are chosen along with Company- wide financial performance trigger levels. The objective of the program is to align the performance of employees with the Company’s short- and long-term objectives so neither set of goals is sacrificed for the other.









	Short-Term Incentive Plan


	: In 2012, the Board of Directors approved a short-term incentive plan for the five SEOs and certain other senior officers of the Company. This element of the compensation program is specifically designed to ensure clarity of expectations in terms of expected results on a short-term basis to recognize and reward achievement of annual business goals and to motivate and reward superior performance. This program also ensures that incentives are appropriately risk-balanced in that they do not motivate or reward excessive risk taking and ensure that the Company is competitive with the market in order to attract and retain talent needed to grow the Company. The short-term incentive is intended to be a cash bonus.









	Long-Term Incentive Plan


	: In 2010, the Company’s shareholders voted to establish a new equity-based long- term incentive plan which grants authority to issue stock options, restricted stock and other equity-based grants to retain existing high-performing employees and to attract new members to the Management team should the need arise. The purpose of this plan is to incentivize executives through equity ownership and align their interests with those of the Shareholders while providing longer-term incentives tied to overall Company performance. It is among the objectives of this plan that, by having a portion of the executive’s compensation tied to the performance of the Company’s stock, the individual will be rewarded for enhancing long-term shareholder value.




	The mid- to long-term outlook of this type of compensation serves as a balance to the short-term rewards of base compensation and the short-term incentive plan. Stock options and restricted stock grants are also intended to encourage an executive to remain with the Company. The amount of options or restricted stock granted reflects the executive’s position in the organization, level of responsibility, impact on the Company’s performance and actual performance in meeting individual performance goals.









	Miscellaneous Compensation


	: In addition to the compensation elements outlined above, the Company also offers a small cash bonus for successful hiring referrals and for referrals to the Company’s investment management division.









	Compensation Policies and Practices and Risk Management









	Management does not believe that the Company’s compensation policies and practices for its employees are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Incentive compensation is not tied to individual production volumes or other short-term measures, but is instead focused on a balance of measures which reward enhancing the Company’s long-term viability and performance. The Company has extensive risk monitoring and robust internal controls, and internal and external audit activities provide a deterrent for and a means of detecting such risk behaviors.









	Compensation Committee Certification









	During 2016, the Compensation Committee met with Senior Risk Officer, Tony C. McKim, to review the Company’s overall compensation program, for all employees as well as for Senior Executive Officers. Meetings were held on January 28, 2016, and September 22, 2016. The overall risk of the Bank’s compensation programs was discussed at the meeting on January 28, 2016. After discussion with Mr. McKim and a thorough review of the Company’s compensation programs, the Committee concluded that the compensation program for all employees, including Senior Executive Officers, is balanced, aligning








	The First Bancorp 2017 Proxy Statement • Page 30












	employees’ interests with those of Shareholders, and is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, including by incentivizing undue risk-taking.









	Use of Compensation Consultants









	The Compensation Committee contracted with Pearl Meyer in 2016 to conduct a comprehensive analysis of total compensation for the Company’s Senior Executive Officers as well as for other selected members of Management. The Bank also a participated in Pearl Meyer’s salary survey for New England banks to determine salary ranges for other levels of employees as detailed above.









	Say on Pay









	At the 2016 Annual Meeting, Shareholders were asked to approve (on a non-binding basis) the compensation of the Company’s executives. The following table presents the results of the voting:

	Certain Relationships and Related Transactions









	The Federal Reserve Act permits the Bank to contract for or purchase property from any of its Directors only when such purchase is made in the regular course of business upon terms not less favorable to the Bank than those offered by others unless the purchase has been authorized by a majority of the Board of Directors not interested in the transaction. Similarly, the Federal Reserve Act prohibits loans to Executive Officers of the Bank unless such transactions have been made upon substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the lender, and certain other prescribed conditions have been met.




	The Bank has had, and expects to have in the future, banking transactions in the ordinary course of its business with Directors, Executive Officers and principal Shareholders of the Company and their affiliates. All such transactions have been made upon substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the lender and meet the established written policies of the Bank. Compliance with lending to Directors, Executive Officers and principal Shareholders of the Company is reviewed periodically by the Company’s internal audit function and the results of such audits are reported to the Audit Committee. In the opinion of Management, such loans have not involved more than the normal risk of collectibility nor have they presented other unfavorable features. The total amount of loans outstanding at December 31, 2016 to the Company’s Directors, Executive Officers and their affiliates was $23,292,661, which constituted 2.17% of the Bank’s total loans outstanding at that date.


















	The First Bancorp 2017 Proxy Statement • Page 33












	Director Compensation









	Fees paid by the Bank to its Directors as a group totaled $275,223 in 2016, but no fees are paid to Directors of the Company in their capacities as such. Of the $275,223 paid to the outside Directors, 65.1% of this portion was reinvested in the Company through the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. CEO McKim, who is the only Director who is also an employee of the Company, receives no additional compensation for serving on the Board of Directors of the Company or the Bank. The following table of Director Compensation details compensation paid to Directors in 2016.

	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance









	Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires that the Company’s Directors, Executive Officers, and any person holding more than ten percent of the Company’s Common Stock file with the SEC reports of ownership changes, and that such individuals furnish the Company with copies of the reports.




	Based solely on a review of the reports furnished to the Company, or written representations from reporting persons that all reportable transactions were reported, the Company believes that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 the Company’s officers, Directors and greater than ten percent owners timely filed all reports they were required to file under Section 16(a).

	PROPOSAL 2 – NON-BINDING VOTE ON THE COMPANY’S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION









	As required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Board of Directors is submitting for shareholder approval, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company’s named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. This vote is known as “Say-on-Pay”.









	This is a non-binding resolution and accordingly will not have any binding legal effect regardless of whether or not it is approved and may not be construed as overruling a decision by the Company or the Board of Directors or to create or imply any change to the fiduciary duties of the Board. Furthermore, because this non-binding advisory resolution primarily relates to compensation of the named executive officers that has already been paid or contractually committed, there is generally no opportunity for us to revisit those decisions. However, the Compensation Committee intends to take the results of the vote on this proposal into account in its future decisions regarding the compensation of our named executive officers.









	Approval of the Company’s executive compensation policies and procedures would require that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes cast against it. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast and therefore will not affect the determination as to whether the Company’s executive compensation policies and procedures are approved. Because this Shareholder vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Company’s Board of Directors.









	THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR PROPOSAL NO. 2.

	PROPOSAL 3: APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS









	Berry Dunn McNeil & Parker, LLC (BerryDunn) has served as independent auditor for the Company and the Bank since 1994. In the opinion of the Board of Directors, the reputation, qualifications and experience of the firm make its reappointment appropriate for 2017. It is the desire of the Board of Directors Audit Committee that the appointment of BerryDunn as independent auditors be ratified by the Shareholders at the Annual Meeting. Representatives from BerryDunn will be present at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from Shareholders.







	This proposal will be adopted if the number of shares voted in favor of the proposal exceeds the number of shares voted against the proposal. Broker non-votes and




	abstentions will not be included in either total.

(the “Company”) shall be comprised of at least three directors each of whom is (i) “independent” under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., except as provided below, and under the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules promulgated thereunder, (ii) does not accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the Company or any of its subsidiaries other than in his or her capacity as a member of the Board or any committee of the Board, (iii) is not an “affiliate” of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, as such term is defined in Rule 10A‑3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), (iv) has not participated in the preparation of the financial statements of the Company or any subsidiary at any time during the preceding three years, (v) a person none of whose Family Members has served as an executive officer of the Company or any subsidiary at any time during the preceding three years, or as an executive officer of another entity where at any time during the preceding three years any of the executive officers of the Company or any subsidiary served on that other entity's compensation committee, and (vi) a person none of whose Family Members is a current partner of the Company's outside auditor, or was a partner or employee of the Company's outside auditor who worked on the Company's audit at any time during any of the preceding three years.

A person is deemed not to be in control of an entity if he or she is not an executive officer of the entity and is not the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 10% of any class of voting equity securities of the entity. “Indirect” acceptance by a Committee member of any consulting, advisory or compensatory fee includes acceptance of such a fee by a spouse, parent, child, sibling, or anyone sharing a home with the Committee member (a “Family Member”), or an entity in which such Committee member or Family Member is a partner, member, an officer such as “managing director” occupying a comparable position or executive officer, or occupies a similar position (except limited partners, non‑managing members and those occupying similar positions who, in each case, have no active role in providing services to the Company or any subsidiary) and which entity provides accounting, consulting, legal, investment banking or financial advisory services to the Company or any subsidiary. With respect to clause (ii) of this paragraph, payments received (directly or indirectly) from the Company or any subsidiary by a Committee member or Family Member during the three years ending December 31, 2013 shall not render such Committee member not “independent” if such payments did not exceed, in any year, the greater of (a) $200,000, or (b) 5% of the recipient's consolidated gross revenues.

	With respect to its role as the Company's qualified legal compliance committee, to review and discuss any reports concerning material violations submitted to it by outside counsel pursuant to the SEC attorney professional responsibility rules (17 C.F.R. Part 205). In connection with such reports, the Audit Committee shall inform the Company's President of any report received by it of evidence of a material violation of federal or state securities laws, a possible material breach of fiduciary duty arising under federal or state law, or a similar material violation of any federal or state law, in each case by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents (a “Material Violation”) and which report contains credible evidence based upon which it would be unreasonable under the circumstances for a prudent and competent attorney not to conclude that it is reasonably likely that a Material Violation has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur. Such reports may originate from attorneys representing the Company, from Company employees or otherwise. However, if the Audit Committee determines that informing the President would be futile or otherwise inappropriate, it shall instead inform the other members of the Board thereof. The Audit Committee shall determine whether an investigation with respect to such report as to a possible Material Violation is necessary and, if it so determines, shall so notify the Board and initiate such investigation, to be conducted by counsel selected by the Committee with the involvement of such other expert personnel as the Committee deems necessary. At the conclusion of any such investigation, the Committee shall recommend, by majority vote, that the Company implement an appropriate response to evidence of a Material Violation and inform the President and the Board of the results of such investigation and the appropriate remedial measures to be adopted. The Committee has the authority and the responsibility, acting by majority vote, to take all other appropriate action, including the authority to notify the SEC in the event that the Company fails in any material respect to implement an appropriate response that the Committee has recommended the Company to take.







	Any report of a Material Violation submitted to the Audit Committee in good faith, and the identity of the person submitting it (if an employee or director), shall be kept confidential (both by the submitting person and the recipient(s) thereof) and disclosed only to Audit Committee members, Board members, legal counsel and other








	The First Bancorp 2017 Proxy Statement • Page 45












	experts retained by the Audit Committee, and senior executives and other personnel of the Company having, in the judgment of the Audit Committee, a need to know the contents of the report in order for the Audit Committee to effectively evaluate and, if appropriate, investigate and take further action with respect to the subject matter of the report. There shall be no retaliatory action whatsoever taken with respect to any person who submits such a report in good faith. The fact that such reports should be submitted to a member of the Audit Committee, and the provisions of this paragraph, should be communicated to all Company employees promptly following the adoption of this Charter, at the time of hiring of any Company employees hired after the adoption of this Charter, and on a recurring basis at least annually.


















	E.






	With respect to reporting and recommendations,
















	i.






	to prepare any report or other disclosures, including any recommendation of the Audit Committee, required by the rules of the SEC to be included in the Company's annual proxy statement;

	Committee Structure and Operations




	The Audit Committee Chair is designated by the Company's Board of Directors. The Audit Committee shall meet once every fiscal quarter, or more frequently if circumstances dictate, to discuss with management the annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements, as applicable. The Audit Committee should meet periodically with management, the third party engaged to perform the internal audit function and the independent auditors to discuss any matters that the Audit Committee or any of these persons or firms believe should be discussed privately. The Audit Committee may request any officer or employee of the Company or the Company's outside counsel or independent auditors to attend a meeting of the Audit Committee or to meet with any members of, or consultants to, the Audit Committee. Members of the Audit Committee may participate in a meeting of the Audit Committee by means of conference call or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other.

	The Audit Committee shall have the resources and authority appropriate to discharge its duties and responsibilities, including the authority to select, retain, terminate, and approve the fees and other retention terms of special or independent counsel, accountants or other experts and advisors, as it deems necessary or appropriate, without seeking approval of the Board or management. The Committee will have full access to the Company's books, records, facilities, and personnel. The Committee has the authority and available funding to perform or supervise special investigations and to incur administrative expenses in connection with fulfilling its obligations. The Committee will have the sole authority to approve fees and related terms of such engagements for outside experts.

	Compensation to the independent auditors and any other public accounting firm engaged for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other audit, review or attest services for the Company;
















	2.






	Compensation of any advisers employed by the Audit Committee; and
















	3.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided.

Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.
