Infrastructure



A fast-growing asset class with a strong global growth profile
Infrastructure is one of the fastest growing asset classes globally, with target infrastructure allocations increasing significantly over recent years1. We expect portfolio allocations to infrastructure assets to rise further in coming years as the benefits of investing in infrastructure are increasingly recognised.
There is a significant need for new infrastructure in both developed and developing economies. It is estimated that approximately US$57 trillion needs to be invested in global infrastructure by 20302. This means there will be a broad and growing range of infrastructure investment opportunities.

Direct infrastructure
Listed infrastructure











A$11.5bn* in assets under management
Expertise on the ground on four continents
More than 25 years of market leadership




Why infrastructure?


In our view, the benefits of this asset class offer a compelling fit for investors seeking a blend of stability and attractive returns.








Low volatility
Infrastructure assets are often regulated and exhibit strong monopolistic qualities with high barriers to entry. These characteristics mean infrastructure assets can be less volatile than traditional asset classes.










Stable, long-term cash flows
Long-duration asset lives may make for stable, long-term cash flows linked to inflation.










Natural diversification
A range of sub-sectors within infrastructure may offer natural opportunities to build well-diversified portfolios that can perform throughout the economic cycle.




Why AMP Capital? 


AMP Capital is a pioneer in infrastructure investment with more than 25 years of leadership in the asset class. We began investing in direct infrastructure in the late 1980s, through finance participation in the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.
Our infrastructure investment team’s capabilities span research, origination and due diligence, transaction execution, asset management and portfolio construction and management.
Be it a petroleum pipeline in Spain, a wind farm in Nebraska or an airport in Australia, AMP Capital clients can access the benefits of infrastructure by investing in listed and unlisted infrastructure equity, providing a gateway into projects that retail investors may typically find difficult to access.
Scale
As one of the leading infrastructure managers, our size, reputation and networks mean we can provide access to innovative investment opportunities across a range of sectors globally. This includes investments in energy, power, transport, utilities, airports, seaports, communications infrastructure and social infrastructure.
Breadth
AMP Capital’s infrastructure team features more than 70 infrastructure investment professionals* across the globe. The infrastructure team has specialist and extensive experience spanning a diverse range of sectors, lifecycles and geographic regions. It also spans the full range of ways to invest in infrastructure, whether it’s through equity or debt, in both listed and unlisted markets.
Information advantage
Our clients may benefit from the information advantage that comes from AMP Capital’s scale and breadth as well as our culture of collaboration across many teams. Our expertise spans infrastructure, real estate, fixed income, equities, multi-asset investing and macro markets. Collaboration between these teams informs our decision-making process.


Why now?


Infrastructure’s low correlation to most other asset classes may help insulate investors from financial market volatility and often offer income streams higher than those typically available in today’s low interest rate environment.
Listed infrastructure securities
Global listed infrastructure companies may offer investors higher dividend or coupon payments than global equities and global bonds, respectively, as operating margins are often high and cash flows are very stable. It may also offer investors a highly liquid way to gain exposure to infrastructure.
Unlisted infrastructure equity 
Direct infrastructure investment may provide diversification benefits and attractive risk-adjusted returns as well as low correlation with most other asset classes.

We focus on ‘core and pure’ infrastructure assets


We only invest in companies we believe provide a sufficient return for the commensurate risk. Our philosophy is centred around an investment approach which focuses on ‘core and pure’ infrastructure assets. These are companies that own and operate infrastructure assets with no or low exposure to commodity, volume and competition risks.  We believe that these assets can provide investors with superior risk-reward characteristics.


What sets us apart


             
        







In-depth understanding of local market conditions
With investment professionals based in Sydney, London and Chicago, our team is close to the major markets and has an in-depth understanding of local market conditions.










Our investment process uses local expertise in a globally integrated approach
Our investment process involves a fundamental bottom-up analysis of both valuation and equity. We use our in-depth knowledge of local markets to apply this analysis, and complement it with an analysis of top-down factors.










Proven history across geographies, lifecycles and sectors
As one of the first infrastructure investors, we have a long history of infrastructure investing across multiple jurisdictions and sectors, and throughout market cycles.










Culture of collaboration provides an information advantage
With more than 70 investment professionals across our infrastructure platform, constant communication and information sharing across the team enable us to capitalise on our depth and breadth of coverage.




Risks


Risks specific to infrastructure investments include the risks of investing in share markets, infrastructure and international markets. In addition, the risks associated with interest rates, gearing and the cost of debt, derivatives, investment management, co-ownership of assets, fluctuations in rental income, rental demand and fund termination risks. Please refer to the relevant fund’s Information Memorandum or Product Disclosure Statement for more information.

AMP Capital Diversified Infrastructure Trust ranked best in the world for ESG
10 November 2016


Not for release or distribution in the US
AMP Capital’s Diversified Infrastructure Trust (ADIT) has been ranked by GRESB Infrastructure as the number one infrastructure fund globally for its environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance.

GRESB is an organisation that assesses the ESG performance of real assets around the world.  AMP Capital is a co-founding member of GRESB Infrastructure and has worked collaboratively with other leading institutions to develop the global standard, which was launched in 2015 to look at infrastructure entities.

GRESB’s inaugural 2016 infrastructure report included submissions from 51 funds and 134 infrastructure assets from across 53 countries.  ADIT was rated number one in the world with an overall average GRESB score of 55 and was the only infrastructure fund to receive a score above 50.  This score is a combined ranking of the fund and its underlying assets, which include Melbourne Airport, Interlink (Sydney’s M5 motorway) and Powerco in New Zealand.

AMP Capital Head of Australia and New Zealand Infrastructure Equity Funds Michael Cummings said: “AMP Capital has been a pioneer in the ESG space and ESG is a key consideration within our investment processes across the organisation.  Subsequently, ADIT and its assets have had strong and well established ESG policies in place for many years now and I’m delighted this commitment to ESG has been recognised by GRESB.  The result also indicates the strong correlation between positive ESG performance and strong financial performance as ADIT is also the number one performing unlisted Australian infrastructure fund over a three and five-year period, according to the Mercer Investment Performance Survey.

“Institutional investors increasingly want to invest in infrastructure funds and assets that have strong ESG credentials as they provide a positive correlation with comprehensive risk management policies and sustainable financial performance.  A recent Preqin report indicated that more than 50 per cent of global investors now consider ESG as a key component of investing in infrastructure, which is a higher percentage than any other asset class.  We believe ADIT’s world-beating ESG performance will make it a compelling prospect for infrastructure investors in Australia and also Asia where the fund is attracting interest from pension funds and other institutional investors.”

ADIT is one of the longest-running infrastructure funds in the world.  Established in 1995, it holds a diversified portfolio of quality, mature infrastructure assets in Australia and New Zealand and aims to generate stable, long-term returns.

Glossary




Objective
The fund's investment objective is a high level of current income and long-term capital appreciation.


Highlights
Potential for enhanced portfolio returns and portfolio diversification through the use of commercial real estate investments offers the potential for:
		

High level of current income  and capital appreciation.
Diversification from equity and debt investments across the capital structure and around the world.
Rising income over time from investments in infrastructure and real estate.
Access to an investment team with significant real asset management experience.




Investment Strategy

			The fund will invest at least 80% of its managed assets in securities or other instruments that provide investment exposure to real assets.  The fund will focus on infrastructure and real estate companies’ securities and may also invest in other real asset related investments including whole loans. The fund will actively manage the portfolio allocation among infrastructure and real estate companies, with flexibility to invest across the capital structure—in any type of equity and debt securities offered by a particular company. All of the fund’s debt may be rated lower than investment grade (Ba1/BB+ or worse by S&P, Moody's, or Fitch), but no more than 10% of the fund’s managed assets may be invested in securities rated CCC+/Caa1 or lower at any time. The fund may invest up to 75% of its managed assets in non-U.S. issuers. The fund may also opportunistically writes call options primarily on securities issued by real asset related companies, seeking to enhance its risk-adjusted total returns over time. The fund uses leverage.

			The chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made on the date indicated. Original Investment & Cumulative Distributions is the original investment value added to the cash flow received from distributions. The total returns are not adjusted to reflect the effects of taxation and assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
		

			Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Concentration Risk: The fund’s investments are concentrated in issuers of one or a few specific economic sectors,  so the fund may be subject to more risks than if it were broadly diversified across the economy.Real Estate Securities Risk: Real estate securities such as REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) may be affected by economic downturns and changes in real estate values, rents, property taxes, interest rates and tax laws, in addition to geographical concentration risks.Infrastructure Risk: Infrastructure-related securities may face adverse economic, regulatory, political, and legal changes, which could negatively affect the value of the security, its income, or both.Common Stock Risk: Common stock returns often have experienced significant volatility.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.Leverage Risk: The fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share NAV, market price, and distributions.  Leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative. Leverage is intended to increase common share net income, but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.  Different forms of leverage, including swaps, may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk. Leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk, as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limits.Whole Loan Risk: The fund invests in individual loans, which may be relatively illiquid and more difficult to value, and which subject the fund to credit and default risk associated with the individual borrower.Foreign Investment Risk: Investments in non-U.S securities involve special risks not typically associated with domestic investments including currency risk, if not hedged - the risk that changes in exchange rates will affect the value of the fund’s investments, as well as adverse political, social and economic developments. These risks often are magnified in emerging markets.Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) Risk: Investing in MBS entails various risks, including credit risks inherent in the underlying collateral, the risk that the servicer fails to perform its duties, liquidity risks, interest rate risks, structure risks, and geographical concentration risks.Preferred Securities Risk: Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk.Call Risk or Prepayment Risk: Issuers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled, forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities.Convertible Securities Risk: Convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than non-convertible fixed-income securities of similar credit quality.Call Option Risk: The value of call options sold (written) by the fund will fluctuate. The fund may not participate in any appreciation of its equity portfolio as fully as it would if the fund did not sell call options. In addition, the fund will continue to bear the risk of declines in the value of its equity portfolio.Tax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






†† Cash-flow Based Distribution

				Historical distribution sources have included net investment income, realized gains and return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time which may be viewed at nuveen.com/CEFdistributions. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholders’ 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year. You should not draw any conclusions about a fund’s past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate.
			

				Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.

Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust’s life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit.

Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust’s life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.   
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.
A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several market sectors. This trust is concentrated in the healthcare sector. There are certain risks specific to the healthcare companies such as governmental regulation and the risk that a product may never come to pass.








1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities.

Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.
3The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach that estimated size, the amount of the estimated annual expenses per unit may exceed the amounts reflected. On the business day following the end of the initial offering period, the Sponsor and/or the Supervisor will waive their respective fees, and/or the Sponsor will reimburse the Portfolio operating expenses, in an amount so that the total estimated annual expenses calculated on that date do not exceed $0.0350 per unit.However, subsequent to that date the value of the Portfolio as well as the number of outstanding units may decline, and/or the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the estimated amounts, any of which could result in the actual amount of the total annual expenses exceeding $0.0350 per unit.

 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The financial condition of an issuer of Securities held by the Trust may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
The Trust is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the financials, health care, consumer discretionary, consumer staples and industrials. Negative developments in these industries will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The Trust may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the broader market. The Trust invests significantly in securities issued by financials companies and utilities companies, and, as a result of their potentially higher dividend yield relative to the broader market, the trust may exhibit greater sensitivity to movements in interest rates than the broader market. 
Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.
Central Equity Trust securities are offered by Edward Jones. As described more fully in the prospectus, Edward Jones may have received compensation in other capacities from, or have other relationships with, the issuers of the common stocks held by a Trust. The opinions expressed may change at anytime.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain.

2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit.

Because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach that estimated size, the amount of the estimated annual expenses per unit may exceed the amounts reflected. On the business day following the end of the initial offering period, the Sponsor and/or the Supervisor will waive their respective fees, and/or the Sponsor will reimburse the Portfolio operating expenses, in an amount so that the total estimated annual expenses calculated on that date do not exceed $0.0350 per unit.However, subsequent to that date the value of the Portfolio as well as the number of outstanding units may decline, and/or the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the estimated amounts, any of which could result in the actual amount of the total annual expenses exceeding $0.0350 per unit.

You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The financial condition of an issuer of Securities held by the Trust may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
The Trust is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the financials, health care, consumer discretionary, consumer staples and industrials. Negative developments in these industries will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The Trust may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the broader market. The Trust invests significantly in securities issued by financials companies and utilities companies, and, as a result of their potentially higher dividend yield relative to the broader market, the trust may exhibit greater sensitivity to movements in interest rates than the broader market. 
Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.
Central Equity Trust securities are offered by Edward Jones. As described more fully in the prospectus, Edward Jones may have received compensation in other capacities from, or have other relationships with, the issuers of the common stocks held by a Trust. The opinions expressed may change at anytime.
