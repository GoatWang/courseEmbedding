 Vape Holdings, Inc. 20264 Ventura Boulevard Suite A Woodland Hills, CA 91364 United States Main Telephone: (949) 743-3399 or (877) 827-VAPE-959 (877) 827-3959 Email: info@vapeholdings.com Website: http://www.vapeholdings.com Transfer Agent Information: http://www.otcmarkets.com/research/service-provider/Registrar-&-Transfer-Co.?id=2346&b=n&filterOn=6         Connect with Hive Ceramics Instagram: http://instagram.com/hiveceramics Twitter: https://twitter.com/hiveceramics Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFiecGs-LnjolJnCDp9aXKA  Vape Holdings Inc. Business Units:  Vaporizers:  Vape Holdings intends to build sales channels within the legal marijuana markets with unique hardware which outperforms the competition.  Our products are expected to meet the needs of consumers who use vaporizers for consuming oils, dry herbs, or concentrates.  Building upon a vast base of knowledge, product expertise, and market research — Vape Holdings features a team of domestic engineers in process of creating new devices and intellectual property as future core assets of the company. With announcements anticipated in the beginning of 2014 — Vape Holdings is poised to introduce cutting-edge technology specifically for vaporization of cannabis concentrates.  Known colloquially as “dabs,” this segment of consumption is wrought with opportunity. Considered among the first companies to utilize ceramic elements for concentrates, Vape Holdings’ future product line features all-natural, 100% non-porous vaporization elements made for unparalleled taste and purity.  The product line will feature a proprietary blend of non-reactive, food grade ceramics providing excellent heat retention, superior corrosion resistance, and unrivaled flavor.  Vape Holdings expects to develop a full line of vaporizers which feature this technology, as well as partnerships with other brands who wish to improve the quality and durability of their own product lines. Future innovations will likely include: * Vaporizers * Ceramic elements for OEMs * Dry herb chambers * Tooling & OEM / ODM services   Concentrates: Concentrates refer to the product from extraction of cannabis compounds through the use of a solvent and often sophisticated chemical process.  Solvents used in the cannabis extraction process include butane, carbon dioxide, alcohol, or even oxygen. 1) Vape Holdings is currently negotiating with a Colorado state-licensed enterprise to acquire a state-of-the-art cannabis extraction facility, or its production via commercial offtake.  As they are available, details will be announced by company press release. 2) Vape Holdings intends to pioneer standards of manufacturing stable, pure, and highly effective concentrates for a variety of purposes within states where marijuana / cannabis are legal. 3)  Vape Holdings expects to increase scale after achieving the proposed acquisition of an initial cannabis extraction facility, and replicate this business in other locales or states where cannabis extraction is both legal and commercially viable. The purpose of extraction is to remove cannabinoids from plant matter in order to create a product with higher purity for personal consumption.  By first removing cannabinoids from marijuana plant matter, then removing any potentially harmful solvents utilized in the extraction process — consumers are left with a highly effective and potent product to meet their needs. Cannabis concentrates are used throughout a variety of products, and represent the highest growth vertical within the legal commercial marijuana industry. Examples of products created from cannabis concentrates, which Vape Holdings intends to produce in licensed facilities or acquire, include: - “Hash Oil” for vaporization, or simply “oil” - Edibles such as candies, cookies, sauces, and more - “Wax,” or solid extracted cannabis compounds   E-cigarettes: Despite an influx of hundreds of new brands in the e-cigarette business, Vape Holdings is uniquely positioned to succeed within this emerging market on account of its research and team. Vape Holdings goals for e-cigarettes include: 1)  Develop four distinct brands which speak to different, targeted demographics. 2)  Partner with existing brands to expand product mix and sales capabilities. 3)  Create direct marketing programs for high-margin sales of developed products and brands. 4)  Establish wholesale sales channels through in-house B2B sales teams. 5)  Align with proven, value-added resellers which already sell into retail chains. 6)  Seek “white-label” or co-branding relationships which leverage advertising efforts. In order to succeed in this fragmented marketplace, especially considering the entry of “big tobacco” and their associated marketing budgets, Vape Holdings has teamed up with two marketing powerhouses in order to improve ROI on marketing investments moving forward. Media Powers (www.MediaPowers.com) produces quantifiable results, meaning advertising dollars can be tracked to the revenue they generate.  When Vape Holdings implements advertising programs, Media Powers is expected to help identify and improve return on investment — ensuring gradual increase in sales and market share for any brands which are developed and introduced. Vape Holdings’ research indicates that, although a large base of brands exists within the e-cigarette markets — consistent, efficient branding does not.  There appear to be only a small handful of efficient brands in this space.  With sales figures expected to eclipse $2 billion USD in 2013, the company believes that opportunities abound in this market. In order to achieve strong brands, Vape Holdings has enlisted the assistance of the award-winning branding experts at HOOK (www.HookUSA.com).  A former Ad Age Award Winner for Southeast Agency of the Year — HOOK is expected to help Vape Holdings brands stand out amidst a clutter of competition.   Acquisitions:  As a publicly-traded company (trading under Peoplestring Corporation OTCQB:  VAPE), Vape Holdings seeks to make corporate acquisitions within our three business verticals. Vaporizers:  Marijuana or cannabis vaporizers and brands. Cannabis Concentrates:  State-approved, compliant, licensed facilities in medical marijuana or recreational marijuana-legal states. E-Cigarettes:  Retail stores, existing brands with established sales channels, and proprietary products or technology.    Management: Kyle Tracey, CEO & CFO  Vape Holdings Inc.  Joe Andreae, President Vape Holdings Inc. WOODLAND HILLS, Calif., March 27, 2014 — Vape Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: VAPE) (the “Company”), a holding company functioning within the legal cannabis industry, is pleased to announce that industry veteran Joe Andreae has accepted the position of President of Vape Holdings, Inc. and will join the Company’s Board of Directors, effective immediately. Andreae has significant experience in the legal cannabis industry, having been involved in Alternative Medicine for most of his life, participating in cooperatives and collectives, and also as a national sales manager for an OEM LED horticultural light manufacturer where he was integral in the rapid growth of that business. Andreae maintains strong and current relationships in the industry in which Vape is situated due to these past successes. “I am elated to have my respected colleague Joe Andreae join my team at Vape Holdings,” added Tracey. “We are assembling a core leadership of dynamic and varied industry veterans whom I expect will both expedite and officiate Vape’s acceptance in this growing opportunity. I firmly believe that Mr. Andreae has the dynamism, relationships and practical expertise that I need in our President.” “On the heels of Monday’s announced acquisition of HIVE Ceramics, Joe will immediately begin pursuing bulk sales orders with parties interested in our state of the art vapor delivery system,” Tracey added. “I am pleased to participate in the exciting opportunity that I see in Vape Holdings,” stated Andreae. “It is most satisfying to blend my passion with vocation and to be a part of something that matters. I will do my absolute best to deliver results and long term value for the shareholders of this Company, specifically through the establishment of a valuable set of concentrate standards.” http://finance.yahoo.com/news/vape-holdings-names-industry-veteran-121500544.html

Anticipate Growth, Elevate Expectations





   




(July 25) Dear Shareholders,
I want to thank all of you for supporting Vape Holdings through the toughest time in our company’s history. I apologize for the delay in introducing myself and communicating my plan for the company. With the situation that Vape Holdings was in, I felt that it was my responsibility to take the time to outline and convey a plan that I believe will be essential to our recovery. My predecessors had good intentions for the directions they went in, but ultimately fell short. Over the next six months I hope to reinvigorate Vape Holdings and guide it down the road to success by focusing on the following key factors:
Fiscal Conservatism:
We have worked diligently to scale back operations and will continue to reduce any unnecessary expenses in the future. Our goal is to be at an operational breakeven and then move into profitability. We hope to avoid any type of toxic financing and use profits to grow our company responsibly.
Stick to the Business Model:
We are refocusing on our core business, which is developing innovative products and distributing them to a premier customer base of retailers. In the near future we plan to release our new “advanced ceramic” product line, ONYX, that will help refine the industry and further strengthen the reputation of HIVE and Vape Holdings. A limited number of our newly designed ONYX product will be for sale on the HIVE Ceramics website in the near future. In addition to strengthening our foundation we plan to selectively distribute high quality products from other brands as the opportunities present themselves, allowing our customers to do more of their purchasing from us.
Stabilize Capital Structure:
Many of Vape Holdings recent challenges have been caused by investments that haven’t returned profits in excess of the cost of capital. We have been working around the clock to stabilize the capital structure and are focused on finishing the debt consolidation. We also plan to work with investors to manage the conversion of outstanding notes so the impact of new shares on the market is manageable.
Clarity for investors:
I am committed to sharing information about our progress on these matters and working with you to revitalize Vape Holdings. We have received advice and offers from our shareholders within the industry to assist where they can. We appreciate this tremendously and hope to work with all parties to positively impact the company. We would like any of our shareholders to contact our Investor Relations team to receive updates or discuss any potential joint efforts. In addition to reaching out directly we will be updating you through our press releases, public filings and website regularly.
Thank you again for your continued support. I look forward to working together to create a long and bright future for Vape Holdings.
Best Regards,
Benjamin Beaulieu
