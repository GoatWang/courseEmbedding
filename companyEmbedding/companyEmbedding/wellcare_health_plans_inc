WellCare and St. Elizabeth Healthcare Form Value-Based Care Partnership
        																																																								
              

          Agreement Aligns Payment with Health Outcomes

LOUISVILLE, Ky. and TAMPA, Fla., July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- To drive quality and improve health outcomes for its Medicaid and Medicare Advantage members, WellCare of Kentucky, a subsidiary of WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (NYSE:    WCG) formed a new value-based care partnership with St. Elizabeth Healthcare, the largest health system in northern Kentucky.








Health care organizations now emphasize payments based on quality of care, rather than just paying according to how many procedures are done. This is known as a value-based model as it focuses on patients' overall health and long-term well-being.  
"Our partnership with St. Elizabeth aims to deliver quality care and positive outcomes in a cost effective way for our members," said William Jones, president, WellCare of Kentucky. "The incentives are tied to performance improvements and quality outcomes that are based on respected health care performance measurement tools." 
Under the partnership, WellCare of Kentucky will collaborate with St. Elizabeth Healthcare's physicians to drive quality-based improvements in certain Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS®) measures, a tool used by more than 90 percent of America's health plans to measure performance on important dimensions of care and service. The partnership will also focus on quality and performance measures set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) five-star quality rating system, which assesses Medicare beneficiaries' experience with their health plans and the health care system. 
St. Elizabeth Healthcare, which operates three acute care facilities and a critical access hospital, provides comprehensive hospital acute care including neonatal and other major hospital services and primary and preventive care including prenatal, obstetrics, pediatrics, gynecology, internal medicine, mental health and eldercare. St. Elizabeth Healthcare currently manages care for approximately 17,400 WellCare of Kentucky members. 
"We are excited to enter into a value-based contract with WellCare," said Bill Banks, vice president of managed care, St. Elizabeth Healthcare. "Working together to deliver high-quality care in an efficient manner positions us for success in our communities."
For more information about St. Elizabeth Healthcare visit www.stelizabeth.com.
As of March 31, 2017, WellCare serves approximately 446,000 Medicaid plan members, 8,500 Medicare Advantage plan members and 22,000 Medicare Prescription Drug Plan members in Kentucky.

About WellCare Health Plans, Inc.Headquartered in Tampa, Fla., WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (NYSE:    WCG) focuses exclusively on providing government-sponsored managed care services, primarily through Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Plans, to families, children, seniors and individuals with complex medical needs. WellCare serves approximately 4.1 million members nationwide as of March 31, 2017.

History[edit]
Wellcare began operations in 1985 in Tampa, FL, as a Medicaid provider for the State of Florida. With the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, WellCare began offering Medicare beneficiaries private health insurance plans. These programs were known as Medicare+Choice or Part C plans. In 2003, WellCare began offering Medicare Advantage plans with prescription drug benefits after the signing of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. In 2006, Wellcare began offering Medicare Medicare Part D plans and has since become one of the top 10 Part D insurance providers by membership volume for these types of plans.
On October 24, 2007, law enforcement agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Health and Human Services, and the Florida Attorney General's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit executed a search warrant on the premises of WellCare Health Plans' headquarters in Tampa, FL. Trading on WellCare's stock was halted on the news but subsequently fell as low as 80% below the 52-week high.[2] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has WellCare's financials under watch and several class-action lawsuits were launched against WellCare on behalf of shareholders. WellCare has said that its normal business operations have not been affected by the federal and state investigations, and that it remains financially sound, with over $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents.[citation needed]
In a now-unsealed plea agreement, prosecutors and a former employee said the company inflated expenditures by submitting fake documents to the state. Under some mental health care contracts, WellCare was paid a flat per-patient fee and required to spend at least 80 percent of it on care. Any leftover amount beyond 20 percent was to be repaid to the state, but the bogus expenditures allowed WellCare to keep that surplus. WellCare agreed in August to repay $35 million, its best estimate of the total wrongly kept from 2002-2006. After the raid, the company restated its quarterly and annual profits, driving down net income by $32 million, and saw its top three executives resign. No criminal charges have been announced against WellCare or its officials but investigations by Florida, Connecticut, and federal prosecutors are ongoing. The Securities and Exchange Commission is leading an informal investigation, and Wellcare faces numerous shareholder lawsuits and sealed whistleblower complaints, the company's SEC filings say. WellCare has since halted all Florida campaign contributions.[3]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since late 2012, WellCare has acquired many smaller Medicare & Medicaid supplement providers that has significantly expanded the company's national coverage areas:
• November, 2012: Easy Choice Health Plan in California[4]
• February, 2013: UnitedHealthcare's Medicaid business in South Carolina[5]
• April, 2013: Missouri Care, Incorporated[6]
• September, 2013: Purchase of Windsor Health Group (primarily in Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, and South Carolina) was announced, anticipated to be completed in FQ4, 2013.[7]

What small business owners are saying























“Beyond being simple, the process is fast.
                            We started looking at insurance in December
                            and we were all set in January.” see more



Garry O'Grady, President

Bull City Learning | Durham, North Carolina




                        “We chose UnitedHealthcare because it was the most accommodating to small
                        businesses like ours. One example is the well-designed website that made it easy
                        to move through the steps. It's very visual and straightforward.

                        “So much goes into purchasing health care for a small business. I had blocked off

                               information to finalizing my UnitedHealthcare plan that quickly. The experience was
                               also so straightforward, I didn't have any questions about what I was purchasing.”

History[edit]
Wellcare began operations in 1985 in Tampa, FL, as a Medicaid provider for the State of Florida. With the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, WellCare began offering Medicare beneficiaries private health insurance plans. These programs were known as Medicare+Choice or Part C plans. In 2003, WellCare began offering Medicare Advantage plans with prescription drug benefits after the signing of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. In 2006, Wellcare began offering Medicare Medicare Part D plans and has since become one of the top 10 Part D insurance providers by membership volume for these types of plans.
On October 24, 2007, law enforcement agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Health and Human Services, and the Florida Attorney General's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit executed a search warrant on the premises of WellCare Health Plans' headquarters in Tampa, FL. Trading on WellCare's stock was halted on the news but subsequently fell as low as 80% below the 52-week high.[2] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has WellCare's financials under watch and several class-action lawsuits were launched against WellCare on behalf of shareholders. WellCare has said that its normal business operations have not been affected by the federal and state investigations, and that it remains financially sound, with over $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents.[citation needed]
In a now-unsealed plea agreement, prosecutors and a former employee said the company inflated expenditures by submitting fake documents to the state. Under some mental health care contracts, WellCare was paid a flat per-patient fee and required to spend at least 80 percent of it on care. Any leftover amount beyond 20 percent was to be repaid to the state, but the bogus expenditures allowed WellCare to keep that surplus. WellCare agreed in August to repay $35 million, its best estimate of the total wrongly kept from 2002-2006. After the raid, the company restated its quarterly and annual profits, driving down net income by $32 million, and saw its top three executives resign. No criminal charges have been announced against WellCare or its officials but investigations by Florida, Connecticut, and federal prosecutors are ongoing. The Securities and Exchange Commission is leading an informal investigation, and Wellcare faces numerous shareholder lawsuits and sealed whistleblower complaints, the company's SEC filings say. WellCare has since halted all Florida campaign contributions.[3]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since late 2012, WellCare has acquired many smaller Medicare & Medicaid supplement providers that has significantly expanded the company's national coverage areas:
• November, 2012: Easy Choice Health Plan in California[4]
• February, 2013: UnitedHealthcare's Medicaid business in South Carolina[5]
• April, 2013: Missouri Care, Incorporated[6]
• September, 2013: Purchase of Windsor Health Group (primarily in Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, and South Carolina) was announced, anticipated to be completed in FQ4, 2013.[7]

On October 24, 2007, law enforcement agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Health and Human Services, and the Florida Attorney General's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit executed a search warrant on the premises of WellCare Health Plans' headquarters in Tampa, FL. Trading on WellCare's stock was halted on the news but subsequently fell as low as 80% below the 52-week high.[2] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has WellCare's financials under watch and several class-action lawsuits were launched against WellCare on behalf of shareholders. WellCare has said that its normal business operations have not been affected by the federal and state investigations, and that it remains financially sound, with over $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents.[citation needed]
In a now-unsealed plea agreement, prosecutors and a former employee said the company inflated expenditures by submitting fake documents to the state. Under some mental health care contracts, WellCare was paid a flat per-patient fee and required to spend at least 80 percent of it on care. Any leftover amount beyond 20 percent was to be repaid to the state, but the bogus expenditures allowed WellCare to keep that surplus. WellCare agreed in August to repay $35 million, its best estimate of the total wrongly kept from 2002-2006. After the raid, the company restated its quarterly and annual profits, driving down net income by $32 million, and saw its top three executives resign. No criminal charges have been announced against WellCare or its officials but investigations by Florida, Connecticut, and federal prosecutors are ongoing. The Securities and Exchange Commission is leading an informal investigation, and Wellcare faces numerous shareholder lawsuits and sealed whistleblower complaints, the company's SEC filings say. WellCare has since halted all Florida campaign contributions.[3]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since late 2012, WellCare has acquired many smaller Medicare & Medicaid supplement providers that has significantly expanded the company's national coverage areas:
• November, 2012: Easy Choice Health Plan in California[4]
• February, 2013: UnitedHealthcare's Medicaid business in South Carolina[5]
• April, 2013: Missouri Care, Incorporated[6]
• September, 2013: Purchase of Windsor Health Group (primarily in Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, and South Carolina) was announced, anticipated to be completed in FQ4, 2013.[7]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
