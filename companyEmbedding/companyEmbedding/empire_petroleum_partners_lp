What Our Customers Think
 


 Thank you for inviting me to the training class yesterday. I think the class was very beneficial! There was a lot of knowledge that I gained throughout the presentation. An idea that really got me thinking about was the "Thanks For Tanks." It's a great idea! Another advantage throughout the presentation was how to calculate specific costs. I would recommend this presentation for business owners all over, who have set goals for their business.Reyan Khanji, Owner of Midwest Fuels 
 Good afternoon, thank you for having me at the dealer meeting. The loss prevention training class was very beneficial to me. I learned a lot from it, plus I think everyone who is getting into this business must take this course. I would love to take more classes like that. It helps us run our businesses more efficiently.Moussa Bazzi, Jefferson Express, PC 5590 
..Thank you for the opportunity to attend the Empire Petroleum PVP educational class in Charlotte, NC. It was a great presentation and very informative. It provided a tremendous amount of information that I was able to bring back with me and utilize in my daily operations here at the store. The food provided at lunch was also totally awesome. Great experience overall! I look forward to attending the next class.Brenda, Battleground, PC 5041 
The Empire Preferred Vendor Program is a real asset to our business. When I was notified AmeriGas was added to the program I was excited about the significant savings we would receive. The difference in price per tank is $3.70 and that is an awesome savings! We are very happy with the PVP program.Gini Winstead, DownEast Travel Center

The Dallas, TX-based company, which was founded in 2014 and booked
$1.5 billion in sales ($50 million gross profit) for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2014, plans to list on the NYSE under the
symbol EPLP. Barclays and Wells Fargo Securities are the joint
bookrunners on the deal. No pricing terms were disclosed.

Mergers & Acquisitions News
Empire Petroleum Partners Forming MLPOffers details on IPO, wholesale acquisition strategyBy 

Greg Lindenberg,
Editor, CSP










May 13, 2015
DALLAS -- With a strategy to expand mainly through continued wholesale acquisitions, Empire Petroleum Partners LP has filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) for an initial public offering (IPO) to form a master limited partnership (MLP).As reported in a 21st Century Smoke/CSP Daily News Flash, the Dallas-based company, which distributes fuel to more than 1,300 gas stations and convenience stores across 27 states and the District of Columbia, hopes to raise $100 million with the IPO, according to a report by Law360.Empire distributes motor fuel to 1,060 sites operated by independent dealers; 190 sites operated by independent consignment agents, where it sells motor fuel directly to consumers but do not operate the sites; and 61 company-operated sites. The motor fuel distribution network serves retail fuel outlets primarily in its four core markets of Texas, the Southeast, the Great Lakes and the Mid-Atlantic regions."We believe that our long-term, fixed-margin motor fuel supply agreements with independent dealers … provide us with stable and predictable cash flow that will support consistent distributions to our unitholders. We intend to grow our business primarily through acquisitions of wholesale fuel supply agreements, which we believe will add to the scale, stability and diversification of our motor fuel distribution network," the company said in the SEC filing.The company intends to capitalize on the highly fragmented distributor market. As of January 2015, there were approximately 4,850 domestic wholesale fuel distributors, it said, citing data from Petroleum Trends International Inc., reflecting the fragmented nature of the industry. In addition, in recent years, major oil companies have been increasing the minimum volume, scale and credit requirements for their motor fuel distribution partners."As a result, we believe there is considerable opportunity for consolidation in our industry given the large number of wholesale fuel distributors with limited scale that may consider selling their businesses," said the company."Since 2011, we have pursued an acquisition growth strategy and have successfully completed 12 acquisitions, increasing our annual volume of distributed motor fuel at a compound annual growth rate of 77% from 165 million gallons in 2011 to 919 million gallons in 2014," Empire said."We believe that targeting acquisitions in and around our current core markets will allow us to improve our purchasing power with major oil companies and leverage our existing personnel in these markets. In addition, we have a proven ability to expand into and quickly achieve scale in new markets, and we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in new markets. We intend to pursue high-quality assets in attractive markets and focus on the acquisition of long-term wholesale motor fuel supply agreement portfolios," the company said.“Following the accumulation of significant assets, this is the culmination of their objective, which is to file for an IPO and officially become a publicly traded MLP, which others [recently GPM] have done, and Lehigh Gas before them.  It's a trend. By market standards, these are very small MLPs and IPO issues. But the returns for the general partners are significant,” said Ken Shriber, managing director of Petroleum Equity Group, Chappaqua, N.Y.  "These small MLPs that come onto the market represent a significant movement towards the continued consolidation in the industry, and in the future, some of the MLP might merge, or sell as well. That's a realistic option down the road."In other company news, Jeff Goodwin has joined Empire Petroleum Partners as COO. Most recently, he was senior vice president of field operations and for Murphy Oil and Murphy USA. Previously, he was with The Pantry and Hess.Related Content

Empire Petroleum Acquires American Energy Distribution
Purchase adds Exxon, Mobil and CITGO brands to company's supplier network.

April 10, 2012, 08:00 pm



GAITHERSBURG, Md. -- Continuing its focus on growth opportunities, Empire Petroleum Partners LLC purchased the assets of Texas-based American Energy Distribution LP. The company's operations were merged into Empire as of April 2.
The acquisition adds the Exxon, Mobil and CITGO brands to Empire's supplier network and significantly enhances its Southwest regional footprint, the company said. Additionally, it adds substantial fuel volume and more than 120 new customer accounts.
"Our mission is to create lasting partnerships that consistently exceed expectations," said Empire President and CEO Eli Kimel. "As our industry undergoes a considerable transition, we seek to become a reliable and stable partner for our customers, suppliers, employees and [the] communities in which we serve. With that goal, we are pleased to announce the addition of Mr. Shawn Bhagat, a successful industry veteran and founder of American Energy, to our Empire team. Shawn brings a long history of growth, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit to Empire and our industry."
Bhagat, CEO of American Energy, added: "Our family and operating team are excited to join the Empire platform to continue our legacy. Although we have always operated as a strong independent distributor, we believe that Empire has the capability to offer our customers and employees a diverse set of resources and tools to make them more successful. In this dynamic industry, I believe that Empire is creating a unique and sustainable distribution platform, which can succeed for decades to come."
Following last year's major equity infusion from American Infrastructure MLP Fund and establishment of a $100-million credit facility, Empire plans to announce several new acquisitions over the coming months, according to the announcement.
In November, Empire merged with Quik-Way Group, which distributes fuel to more than 230 customers and controls the real estate interests of 87 properties. Through that deal, Empire extended its reach into Texas and Louisiana.

Empire Petroleum Partners Registers for $100M IPO
Company distributes motor fuel to more than 1,300 gas stations.

May 13, 2015, 02:10 pm



 



DALLAS — Empire Petroleum Partners LP filed a Form S-1 on Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise up to $100 million in an initial public offering (IPO).
Dallas-based Empire Petroleum distributes motor fuel to more than 1,300 gas stations. These fuels are sold under a variety of brand names, including Shell, BP, Sunoco, ExxonMobil, Gulf, Marathon, Valero, Chevron, CITGO and Phillips 66.
If approved by the SEC, Empire Petroleum will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EPLP.

According to Renaissance Capital LLC, Empire Petroleum was founded in 2014, booked $1.5 billion in sales and had a $50-million profit for its fiscal year ended Dec. 31. Barclays and Wells Fargo are the joint bookrunners on the deal. No pricing terms were disclosed.
Empire Petroleum's SEC filing follows that of peer GPM Petroleum LP (GPMP), which filed in April to also raise up to $100 million in an IPO. As CSNews Online previously reported, GPM Investments LLC, operator of 502 convenience stores, would purchase a majority of its motor fuel from GPMP.
