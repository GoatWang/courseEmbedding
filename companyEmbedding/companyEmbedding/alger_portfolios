About Us - Adco Marketing Promotional Products & Tradeshow Giveaways
Adco Marketing ® has been in the printing and promotional product advertising business since the 1970's begining as Adco Pony Express. Initially the focus was on printing and distribution but did include promotional items like door hangers. Later, Richard Avery transitioned the business to focus more on the promotional products field and updated the name to Adco Specialties. Richard Avery and his associates sold both printing and traditional promotional advertising products and tradeshow giveaways including custom coffee mugs, logo pens. sports promotional items to local teams and custom embroidered business shirts and apparel. In the late 1980's, Mr. Avery hired Karen Herzog who sold inexpensive promotional items to surrounding businesses. The business promotional items that were bought were an eye opener to Karen who eventually went back to work with Mr. Avery in 1996 and opened an independent office in Marin and transitioned the name to Adco Marketing ®. Karen immediately took off as the number one sales person for Adco Marketing ® and Mr. Avery eventually sold his business to Karen to concentrate on his advertising printing business.The business was originally run as a traditional distributor specializing in mainly local companies but quickly transitioned with the quick launch of the website www.adcomarketing.com. However, when her partner, Michael Herzog, joined her, they decided to expand Adco Marketing's ® presence on the web. Adco Marketing’s ® online presence as a quality promotional items distributor quickly expanded the business. Specializing in trade show giveaways, unique promotional items and rush promotional products, the website was an immediate hit and launched them into the world of online promotional products.Adco Marketing ® wanted to be different than other distributors advertising on the web by providing a wide selection with full customer service. Other promotional product advertising companies were setting up call centers, many overseas, to keep costs low. With this, however, Adco Marketing ® believed that customer service suffered as well. At Adco Marketing ®, our goal was to set up an online presence with superior customer service. Adco Marketing ® was also one of the first to implement services for rush promotional items and products.A lot of companies specialize in selling the business promotional items of the moment. We however, are looking for the products that are stylish, popular, and will also be used for years to come. There are many marketing items and trade show giveaways that do not make a long term impact on your customer or target advertising audience when distributed. Then there are those that make a sudden and often lasting impact on your clients.For example, one trade show giveaway that was distributed by our client was a light up customized yo yo. The client originally wanted to go with an inexpensive promotional item like a plastic logo pen. We, however, convinced them to distribute the custom yo yos. The client called us from the show to describe how all of the people visiting the booth were having an impromptu contest with the imprinted yo yos and that their trade show giveaway booth was the center of the show. The interesting part of the story is that a custom yo yo is not that much more than a logo pen.Our latest focus has been toward mobile gifts like custom power banks and iWallets. As these products have come down considerably in cost, they have grown in popularity. With this, we have seen a larger demand for trade show giveaways and items that advertise a company's mobile commitment. We can also produce many of our eco-friendly and organic promotional products rush!At Adco Marketing ®, you will get an experienced customer representative who will give you great promotional marketing ideas. There are many ways to imprint promotional products as well, and we can guide you on which method would look best for your industry or target audience, or we can prepare a list of advertising ideas we feel would be best for your event!We have factories come to us to try, touch and feel the business promotional items we sell. We are proud to sell quality promotional items at a great price! Inexpensive promotional products do not have to mean low quality! For this reason, we are proud to sell everything from a $0.33 logo pen to a $125 leather custom padfolio and custom Ogio Bags, power banks and mobile promotional items, Brookstone, Totes and much more.If you have any questions about Adco Marketing ® or any of our promotional items or tradeshow giveaways, please call us anytime at (888) 332-ADCO or (888) 332-2326. If you are outside of the United States or Canada, please call us at (415) 927-2881. You can also email us at sales@adcomarketing.com This e-mail address is being protected from spambots.

About Us - Adco Marketing Promotional Products & Tradeshow Giveaways
Adco Marketing ® has been in the printing and promotional product advertising business since the 1970's begining as Adco Pony Express. Initially the focus was on printing and distribution but did include promotional items like door hangers. Later, Richard Avery transitioned the business to focus more on the promotional products field and updated the name to Adco Specialties. Richard Avery and his associates sold both printing and traditional promotional advertising products and tradeshow giveaways including custom coffee mugs, logo pens. sports promotional items to local teams and custom embroidered business shirts and apparel. In the late 1980's, Mr. Avery hired Karen Herzog who sold inexpensive promotional items to surrounding businesses. The business promotional items that were bought were an eye opener to Karen who eventually went back to work with Mr. Avery in 1996 and opened an independent office in Marin and transitioned the name to Adco Marketing ®. Karen immediately took off as the number one sales person for Adco Marketing ® and Mr. Avery eventually sold his business to Karen to concentrate on his advertising printing business.The business was originally run as a traditional distributor specializing in mainly local companies but quickly transitioned with the quick launch of the website www.adcomarketing.com. However, when her partner, Michael Herzog, joined her, they decided to expand Adco Marketing's ® presence on the web. Adco Marketing’s ® online presence as a quality promotional items distributor quickly expanded the business. Specializing in trade show giveaways, unique promotional items and rush promotional products, the website was an immediate hit and launched them into the world of online promotional products.Adco Marketing ® wanted to be different than other distributors advertising on the web by providing a wide selection with full customer service. Other promotional product advertising companies were setting up call centers, many overseas, to keep costs low. With this, however, Adco Marketing ® believed that customer service suffered as well. At Adco Marketing ®, our goal was to set up an online presence with superior customer service. Adco Marketing ® was also one of the first to implement services for rush promotional items and products.A lot of companies specialize in selling the business promotional items of the moment. We however, are looking for the products that are stylish, popular, and will also be used for years to come. There are many marketing items and trade show giveaways that do not make a long term impact on your customer or target advertising audience when distributed. Then there are those that make a sudden and often lasting impact on your clients.For example, one trade show giveaway that was distributed by our client was a light up customized yo yo. The client originally wanted to go with an inexpensive promotional item like a plastic logo pen. We, however, convinced them to distribute the custom yo yos. The client called us from the show to describe how all of the people visiting the booth were having an impromptu contest with the imprinted yo yos and that their trade show giveaway booth was the center of the show. The interesting part of the story is that a custom yo yo is not that much more than a logo pen.Our latest focus has been toward mobile gifts like custom power banks and iWallets. As these products have come down considerably in cost, they have grown in popularity. With this, we have seen a larger demand for trade show giveaways and items that advertise a company's mobile commitment. We can also produce many of our eco-friendly and organic promotional products rush!At Adco Marketing ®, you will get an experienced customer representative who will give you great promotional marketing ideas. There are many ways to imprint promotional products as well, and we can guide you on which method would look best for your industry or target audience, or we can prepare a list of advertising ideas we feel would be best for your event!We have factories come to us to try, touch and feel the business promotional items we sell. We are proud to sell quality promotional items at a great price! Inexpensive promotional products do not have to mean low quality! For this reason, we are proud to sell everything from a $0.33 logo pen to a $125 leather custom padfolio and custom Ogio Bags, power banks and mobile promotional items, Brookstone, Totes and much more.If you have any questions about Adco Marketing ® or any of our promotional items or tradeshow giveaways, please call us anytime at (888) 332-ADCO or (888) 332-2326.

About Us - Adco Marketing Promotional Products & Tradeshow Giveaways
Adco Marketing ® has been in the printing and promotional product advertising business since the 1970's begining as Adco Pony Express. Initially the focus was on printing and distribution but did include promotional items like door hangers. Later, Richard Avery transitioned the business to focus more on the promotional products field and updated the name to Adco Specialties. Richard Avery and his associates sold both printing and traditional promotional advertising products and tradeshow giveaways including custom coffee mugs, logo pens. sports promotional items to local teams and custom embroidered business shirts and apparel. In the late 1980's, Mr. Avery hired Karen Herzog who sold inexpensive promotional items to surrounding businesses. The business promotional items that were bought were an eye opener to Karen who eventually went back to work with Mr. Avery in 1996 and opened an independent office in Marin and transitioned the name to Adco Marketing ®. Karen immediately took off as the number one sales person for Adco Marketing ® and Mr. Avery eventually sold his business to Karen to concentrate on his advertising printing business.The business was originally run as a traditional distributor specializing in mainly local companies but quickly transitioned with the quick launch of the website www.adcomarketing.com. However, when her partner, Michael Herzog, joined her, they decided to expand Adco Marketing's ® presence on the web. Adco Marketing’s ® online presence as a quality promotional items distributor quickly expanded the business. Specializing in trade show giveaways, unique promotional items and rush promotional products, the website was an immediate hit and launched them into the world of online promotional products.Adco Marketing ® wanted to be different than other distributors advertising on the web by providing a wide selection with full customer service. Other promotional product advertising companies were setting up call centers, many overseas, to keep costs low. With this, however, Adco Marketing ® believed that customer service suffered as well. At Adco Marketing ®, our goal was to set up an online presence with superior customer service. Adco Marketing ® was also one of the first to implement services for rush promotional items and products.A lot of companies specialize in selling the business promotional items of the moment. We however, are looking for the products that are stylish, popular, and will also be used for years to come. There are many marketing items and trade show giveaways that do not make a long term impact on your customer or target advertising audience when distributed. Then there are those that make a sudden and often lasting impact on your clients.For example, one trade show giveaway that was distributed by our client was a light up customized yo yo. The client originally wanted to go with an inexpensive promotional item like a plastic logo pen. We, however, convinced them to distribute the custom yo yos. The client called us from the show to describe how all of the people visiting the booth were having an impromptu contest with the imprinted yo yos and that their trade show giveaway booth was the center of the show. The interesting part of the story is that a custom yo yo is not that much more than a logo pen.Our latest focus has been toward mobile gifts like custom power banks and iWallets. As these products have come down considerably in cost, they have grown in popularity. With this, we have seen a larger demand for trade show giveaways and items that advertise a company's mobile commitment.
