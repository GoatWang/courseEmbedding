Thomson Horstmann & Bryant, Inc.

                                    Thomson Horstmann & Bryant (THB) specializes in providing investment advisory services with respect to the smaller capitalization range of the US equity market. The firm manages portfolios in a Core-with-a-Value Bias style that focuses on quality and growth. They strive to identify companies early on when they are still priced at reasonable valuations. Their investment decision process begins by employing screens of companies within the small/micro-cap universe. Several fundamental valuation techniques reduce the preliminary screen to potential companies for investment. THB looks for companies with a relatively low p/e multiple and institutional under-ownership. THB’s advice is limited to the following smaller company strategies: Micro-Cap, Small-Cap Core, Small-Cap Value, Small-Cap II, and Mid-Cap.

Definition
Accounts Receivable is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset.

Explanation
1. Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Days sales outstanding measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company's accounts receivables are being managed.
First Financial Northwest Inc's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as:



Days Sales Outstanding


=Account Receivable/Revenue*Days in Period

=3.389/9.397*91


=32.91



2. In Ben Grahams calculation of liquidation value, First Financial Northwest Inc's accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value:

Liquidation value


=Cash and Cash Equivalents-Total Liabilities+(0.75 * Account Receivable)+(0.5 * Inventory)


=26.073-918.771+0.75 * 3.389+0.5 * 0


=-890.16



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.
