2 Dexcom G5 Mobile Continuous Glucose Monitoring System, User’s Guide, 2015.
 
BRIEF SAFETY STATEMENT  The Dexcom G5 Mobile Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System ("G5") is a glucose monitoring system indicated for the management of diabetes in persons age 2 years and older. The G5 is designed to replace fingerstick blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions. The G5 also aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. The G5 is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription. CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not rely on the G5 CGM data if you have recently taken acetaminophen. Remove the G5 (sensor, transmitter, and receiver) before Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The G5 is MR Unsafe. Do not bring any portion of the G5 into the MRI environment. WARNING CGM-based diabetes treatment decisions are only approved with the G5, not previous generations of Dexcom CGM systems. Calibrate at least once every 12 hours using a fingerstick. If your G5 does not display a sensor glucose reading and an arrow, or if you are getting inaccurate or inconsistent readings, take a fingerstick. If your glucose readings and alerts do not match your symptoms or expectations, take a fingerstick to confirm. Failure to do so may lead to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. The G5 is not approved for use in pregnant women, persons on dialysis or critically ill persons. If a sensor breaks and no portion of it is visible above the skin, do not attempt to remove it. Seek professional medical help if you have infection or inflammation on or near the sensor insertion point. Report broken sensors to Dexcom Technical Support. Sensor placement is not approved for sites other than under the skin of the belly (ages 2 years and older) or upper buttocks (ages 2-17 years). To “share” data, you need an internet connection and a separate compatible smart device running the Dexcom Follow App. Contact Dexcom Toll Free at 877-339-2664 or www.dexcom.com for detailed indications for use and safety information.

Reason for Recall
Dexcom Inc. is recalling the Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems because the audible alarm may not activate in the receiver piece when low or high glucose levels (hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia) are detected.

Health care providers who prescribe these monitoring systems to patients in their care

What to Do

press the center button on your receiver to access the Main Menu
scroll down to Profiles
select Profiles
scroll down to Try It
select Try It
scroll down to 55 Fixed Low
select 55 Fixed Low
verify that you receive vibrations first (vibratory portion of alarm), followed by beeps (audible portion of alarm).

Customers should contact Dexcom at their free hotline number: (844) 607-8398, if the audio alert does not work properly.
How do I report a problem?
Health care professionals and consumers may report adverse reactions or quality problems they experienced using these devices to MedWatch: The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program  either online, by regular mail or by FAX.

Announcement




SAN DIEGO, CA – Dexcom, Inc. (NASDAQ: DXCM) issues this press release to supplement its previous customer notification and remind its patients to periodically test the audible alarms and alerts on certain receivers manufactured by Dexcom to make sure that the audible alarms and alerts are functioning properly.

Specifically, the speaker failed to properly provide audible alerts and alarms in some or all instances. Customers who rely on audible alerts and alarms may not be notified of severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if the speaker in their receiver does not function properly. The immediate health consequences of severe hypoglycemia include loss of consciousness, seizure, and in rare instances death. Patients with questions regarding the notification, or who would like to notify Dexcom that the audible alarms and alerts on their receiver are not functioning properly, should call our dedicated hotline toll free at (844) 607-8398 or visit our website at www.dexcom.com/notification.

5 Notes



History[edit]
DexCom's roots stem from 1967 research on implanted glucose sensors at the University of Wisconsin, and started with a focus on creating an implantable sensor that the body would not reject and that would perform for a long period of time.[1] With over 40 patents,[2] Dexcom’s Sensor technology is based on this research.
Dexcom's history includes multiple generations of sensor technology coupled with partner development agreements. In 2006, Dexcom received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and launched the Dexcom STS Continuous Glucose Monitoring System.[3] This was a three-day sensor that provided up to 288 glucose measurements every 24 hours. Dexcom received approval of the second generation product, the Seven Continuous Glucose Monitoring System in May, 2007. This device improved on accuracy as well as extending usage from three to seven days of continuous wear.[4] In 2008, Dexcom announced two consumer development agreements with Insulet Corporation[5] and Animas Corporation[6] as well as a development agreement with Edwards Lifesciences for a continuous glucose monitor in the intensive care unit hospital environment.[7] During February 2009, Dexcom received approval for the SEVEN PLUS Continuous Glucose Monitor, the third generation Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring system from the FDA.[8] This product received a CE mark in November 2009. In 2013, development to integrate with Insulet broke up. [9] Dexcom entered a non-exclusive agreement with Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. in 2015 to allow the integration of next generation G5 and G6 continuous glucose monitoring systems into Tandem's insulin pumps.[10]
Dexcom Seven Plus Continuous Glucose Monitor[edit]
The Dexcom Seven Plus is Dexcom's third generation continuous glucose monitor. It can show a new glucose reading every 5 minutes for up to seven days of uninterrupted wear-time to show where glucose levels are, where they have been and where they are going.[11] The system is made up of three technologies: the sensor, transmitter, and receiver. The sensor is a flexible round wire that goes just under the skin to read glucose levels, and attaches to the skin with an adhesive patch. The transmitter snaps into the sensor; it wirelessly sends glucose information to the Receiver every 5 minutes. The receiver displays glucose levels and trends. It is about the size and weight of a cell phone.
The system features include:

According to a self-study by the manufacturer: excellent accuracy, especially in the "hypo-zone" and during rapid rates of glucose change[12][13]
1-hour, 3-hour, 6-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour period trend graphs on the receiver[14]
Trend arrows to show where glucose is heading[15]
Alerts & alarms to notify the user when glucose goes either above or below a user defined level[16]
Water-resistant sensor & transmitter pod (The receiver is not water-resistant)[17]
Rechargeable[18]

While the receiver holds up to 30 days of data, the Dexcom Data Manager 3 (DM3) software allows data downloads from the Dexcom CGM systems to a computer. This provides users the ability to track their trends and progress over time. DM3 works with all versions of SEVEN Receivers. With the SEVEN PLUS, meal, insulin, health, and activity information entered can be reviewed later with the DM3 software. A1c values can also be entered in the software for tracking and viewing improvements.[19]
G4 Platinum Continuous Glucose Monitoring System with Share[edit]
On Jan 26, 2015, the FDA approved[20] this latest DEXCOM continuous glucose monitoring system which also

links and shares glucose data, readout every 5 minutes, with cellphones via Bluetooth using a "free" display app, as of 04/18/2015 only available on Apple iPhones (4S & later; Android app pending), along with
sharing this same data with up to 5 others, of the user's choice, via cell phone.

Like previous versions,

each sensor element is rated for use of 7 days (some users achieving longer times)
transmitter and display re-usable with many subsequent sensors (transmitter has an internal non-rechargeable battery that last 1 year)
using a calibration check about every 12 hours serving as the calibration reference
for a graph of glucose readings every 5 minutes, 288 readings/24 hours,

which are all displayed on both the DEXCOM monitor & linked cell phones.
G5 Constant glucose monitoring system with share and follow[edit]

Each sensor only lasts 7 days (it can be restarted but is not recommended)
The Dexcom G5 transmits via bluetooth to the receiving mobile device.
A sub system application (Dexcom follow) can be used to follow the progress of the wearer of the G5.
A calibration is required every 12 hours .
Dexcom G5 uses the same sensor as the G4 using a different transmitter.

5 Notes



History[edit]
DexCom's roots stem from 1967 research on implanted glucose sensors at the University of Wisconsin, and started with a focus on creating an implantable sensor that the body would not reject and that would perform for a long period of time.[1] With over 40 patents,[2] Dexcom’s Sensor technology is based on this research.
Dexcom's history includes multiple generations of sensor technology coupled with partner development agreements. In 2006, Dexcom received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and launched the Dexcom STS Continuous Glucose Monitoring System.[3] This was a three-day sensor that provided up to 288 glucose measurements every 24 hours. Dexcom received approval of the second generation product, the Seven Continuous Glucose Monitoring System in May, 2007. This device improved on accuracy as well as extending usage from three to seven days of continuous wear.[4] In 2008, Dexcom announced two consumer development agreements with Insulet Corporation[5] and Animas Corporation[6] as well as a development agreement with Edwards Lifesciences for a continuous glucose monitor in the intensive care unit hospital environment.[7] During February 2009, Dexcom received approval for the SEVEN PLUS Continuous Glucose Monitor, the third generation Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring system from the FDA.[8] This product received a CE mark in November 2009. In 2013, development to integrate with Insulet broke up. [9] Dexcom entered a non-exclusive agreement with Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. in 2015 to allow the integration of next generation G5 and G6 continuous glucose monitoring systems into Tandem's insulin pumps.[10]
Dexcom Seven Plus Continuous Glucose Monitor[edit]
The Dexcom Seven Plus is Dexcom's third generation continuous glucose monitor. It can show a new glucose reading every 5 minutes for up to seven days of uninterrupted wear-time to show where glucose levels are, where they have been and where they are going.[11] The system is made up of three technologies: the sensor, transmitter, and receiver. The sensor is a flexible round wire that goes just under the skin to read glucose levels, and attaches to the skin with an adhesive patch. The transmitter snaps into the sensor; it wirelessly sends glucose information to the Receiver every 5 minutes. The receiver displays glucose levels and trends. It is about the size and weight of a cell phone.
The system features include:

According to a self-study by the manufacturer: excellent accuracy, especially in the "hypo-zone" and during rapid rates of glucose change[12][13]
1-hour, 3-hour, 6-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour period trend graphs on the receiver[14]
Trend arrows to show where glucose is heading[15]
Alerts & alarms to notify the user when glucose goes either above or below a user defined level[16]
Water-resistant sensor & transmitter pod (The receiver is not water-resistant)[17]
Rechargeable[18]

While the receiver holds up to 30 days of data, the Dexcom Data Manager 3 (DM3) software allows data downloads from the Dexcom CGM systems to a computer. This provides users the ability to track their trends and progress over time. DM3 works with all versions of SEVEN Receivers. With the SEVEN PLUS, meal, insulin, health, and activity information entered can be reviewed later with the DM3 software. A1c values can also be entered in the software for tracking and viewing improvements.[19]
G4 Platinum Continuous Glucose Monitoring System with Share[edit]
On Jan 26, 2015, the FDA approved[20] this latest DEXCOM continuous glucose monitoring system which also

links and shares glucose data, readout every 5 minutes, with cellphones via Bluetooth using a "free" display app, as of 04/18/2015 only available on Apple iPhones (4S & later; Android app pending), along with
sharing this same data with up to 5 others, of the user's choice, via cell phone.

Like previous versions,

each sensor element is rated for use of 7 days (some users achieving longer times)
transmitter and display re-usable with many subsequent sensors (transmitter has an internal non-rechargeable battery that last 1 year)
using a calibration check about every 12 hours serving as the calibration reference
for a graph of glucose readings every 5 minutes, 288 readings/24 hours,

which are all displayed on both the DEXCOM monitor & linked cell phones.
G5 Constant glucose monitoring system with share and follow[edit]

Each sensor only lasts 7 days (it can be restarted but is not recommended)
The Dexcom G5 transmits via bluetooth to the receiving mobile device.
A sub system application (Dexcom follow) can be used to follow the progress of the wearer of the G5.
A calibration is required every 12 hours .
Dexcom G5 uses the same sensor as the G4 using a different transmitter.

2 Dexcom G5 Mobile Continuous Glucose Monitoring System, User’s Guide, 2015.
 
BRIEF SAFETY STATEMENT  The Dexcom G5 Mobile Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System ("G5") is a glucose monitoring system indicated for the management of diabetes in persons age 2 years and older. The G5 is designed to replace fingerstick blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions. The G5 also aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. The G5 is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription. CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not rely on the G5 CGM data if you have recently taken acetaminophen. Remove the G5 (sensor, transmitter, and receiver) before Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The G5 is MR Unsafe. Do not bring any portion of the G5 into the MRI environment. WARNING CGM-based diabetes treatment decisions are only approved with the G5, not previous generations of Dexcom CGM systems. Calibrate at least once every 12 hours using a fingerstick. If your G5 does not display a sensor glucose reading and an arrow, or if you are getting inaccurate or inconsistent readings, take a fingerstick. If your glucose readings and alerts do not match your symptoms or expectations, take a fingerstick to confirm. Failure to do so may lead to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. The G5 is not approved for use in pregnant women, persons on dialysis or critically ill persons. If a sensor breaks and no portion of it is visible above the skin, do not attempt to remove it. Seek professional medical help if you have infection or inflammation on or near the sensor insertion point. Report broken sensors to Dexcom Technical Support. Sensor placement is not approved for sites other than under the skin of the belly (ages 2 years and older) or upper buttocks (ages 2-17 years). To “share” data, you need an internet connection and a separate compatible smart device running the Dexcom Follow App. Contact Dexcom Toll Free at 877-339-2664 or www.dexcom.com for detailed indications for use and safety information.

5 Notes



History[edit]
DexCom's roots stem from 1967 research on implanted glucose sensors at the University of Wisconsin, and started with a focus on creating an implantable sensor that the body would not reject and that would perform for a long period of time.[1] With over 40 patents,[2] Dexcom’s Sensor technology is based on this research.
Dexcom's history includes multiple generations of sensor technology coupled with partner development agreements. In 2006, Dexcom received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and launched the Dexcom STS Continuous Glucose Monitoring System.[3] This was a three-day sensor that provided up to 288 glucose measurements every 24 hours. Dexcom received approval of the second generation product, the Seven Continuous Glucose Monitoring System in May, 2007. This device improved on accuracy as well as extending usage from three to seven days of continuous wear.[4] In 2008, Dexcom announced two consumer development agreements with Insulet Corporation[5] and Animas Corporation[6] as well as a development agreement with Edwards Lifesciences for a continuous glucose monitor in the intensive care unit hospital environment.[7] During February 2009, Dexcom received approval for the SEVEN PLUS Continuous Glucose Monitor, the third generation Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring system from the FDA.[8] This product received a CE mark in November 2009. In 2013, development to integrate with Insulet broke up. [9] Dexcom entered a non-exclusive agreement with Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. in 2015 to allow the integration of next generation G5 and G6 continuous glucose monitoring systems into Tandem's insulin pumps.[10]
Dexcom Seven Plus Continuous Glucose Monitor[edit]
The Dexcom Seven Plus is Dexcom's third generation continuous glucose monitor. It can show a new glucose reading every 5 minutes for up to seven days of uninterrupted wear-time to show where glucose levels are, where they have been and where they are going.[11] The system is made up of three technologies: the sensor, transmitter, and receiver. The sensor is a flexible round wire that goes just under the skin to read glucose levels, and attaches to the skin with an adhesive patch. The transmitter snaps into the sensor; it wirelessly sends glucose information to the Receiver every 5 minutes. The receiver displays glucose levels and trends. It is about the size and weight of a cell phone.
The system features include:

According to a self-study by the manufacturer: excellent accuracy, especially in the "hypo-zone" and during rapid rates of glucose change[12][13]
1-hour, 3-hour, 6-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour period trend graphs on the receiver[14]
Trend arrows to show where glucose is heading[15]
Alerts & alarms to notify the user when glucose goes either above or below a user defined level[16]
Water-resistant sensor & transmitter pod (The receiver is not water-resistant)[17]
Rechargeable[18]

While the receiver holds up to 30 days of data, the Dexcom Data Manager 3 (DM3) software allows data downloads from the Dexcom CGM systems to a computer. This provides users the ability to track their trends and progress over time. DM3 works with all versions of SEVEN Receivers. With the SEVEN PLUS, meal, insulin, health, and activity information entered can be reviewed later with the DM3 software. A1c values can also be entered in the software for tracking and viewing improvements.[19]
G4 Platinum Continuous Glucose Monitoring System with Share[edit]
On Jan 26, 2015, the FDA approved[20] this latest DEXCOM continuous glucose monitoring system which also

links and shares glucose data, readout every 5 minutes, with cellphones via Bluetooth using a "free" display app, as of 04/18/2015 only available on Apple iPhones (4S & later; Android app pending), along with
sharing this same data with up to 5 others, of the user's choice, via cell phone.

Like previous versions,

each sensor element is rated for use of 7 days (some users achieving longer times)
transmitter and display re-usable with many subsequent sensors (transmitter has an internal non-rechargeable battery that last 1 year)
using a calibration check about every 12 hours serving as the calibration reference
for a graph of glucose readings every 5 minutes, 288 readings/24 hours,

which are all displayed on both the DEXCOM monitor & linked cell phones.
G5 Constant glucose monitoring system with share and follow[edit]

Each sensor only lasts 7 days (it can be restarted but is not recommended)
The Dexcom G5 transmits via bluetooth to the receiving mobile device.
A sub system application (Dexcom follow) can be used to follow the progress of the wearer of the G5.
A calibration is required every 12 hours .
Dexcom G5 uses the same sensor as the G4 using a different transmitter.

History[edit]
DexCom's roots stem from 1967 research on implanted glucose sensors at the University of Wisconsin, and started with a focus on creating an implantable sensor that the body would not reject and that would perform for a long period of time.[1] With over 40 patents,[2] Dexcom’s Sensor technology is based on this research.
Dexcom's history includes multiple generations of sensor technology coupled with partner development agreements. In 2006, Dexcom received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and launched the Dexcom STS Continuous Glucose Monitoring System.[3] This was a three-day sensor that provided up to 288 glucose measurements every 24 hours. Dexcom received approval of the second generation product, the Seven Continuous Glucose Monitoring System in May, 2007. This device improved on accuracy as well as extending usage from three to seven days of continuous wear.[4] In 2008, Dexcom announced two consumer development agreements with Insulet Corporation[5] and Animas Corporation[6] as well as a development agreement with Edwards Lifesciences for a continuous glucose monitor in the intensive care unit hospital environment.[7] During February 2009, Dexcom received approval for the SEVEN PLUS Continuous Glucose Monitor, the third generation Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring system from the FDA.[8] This product received a CE mark in November 2009. In 2013, development to integrate with Insulet broke up. [9] Dexcom entered a non-exclusive agreement with Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. in 2015 to allow the integration of next generation G5 and G6 continuous glucose monitoring systems into Tandem's insulin pumps.[10]
Dexcom Seven Plus Continuous Glucose Monitor[edit]
The Dexcom Seven Plus is Dexcom's third generation continuous glucose monitor. It can show a new glucose reading every 5 minutes for up to seven days of uninterrupted wear-time to show where glucose levels are, where they have been and where they are going.[11] The system is made up of three technologies: the sensor, transmitter, and receiver. The sensor is a flexible round wire that goes just under the skin to read glucose levels, and attaches to the skin with an adhesive patch. The transmitter snaps into the sensor; it wirelessly sends glucose information to the Receiver every 5 minutes. The receiver displays glucose levels and trends. It is about the size and weight of a cell phone.
The system features include:

According to a self-study by the manufacturer: excellent accuracy, especially in the "hypo-zone" and during rapid rates of glucose change[12][13]
1-hour, 3-hour, 6-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour period trend graphs on the receiver[14]
Trend arrows to show where glucose is heading[15]
Alerts & alarms to notify the user when glucose goes either above or below a user defined level[16]
Water-resistant sensor & transmitter pod (The receiver is not water-resistant)[17]
Rechargeable[18]

While the receiver holds up to 30 days of data, the Dexcom Data Manager 3 (DM3) software allows data downloads from the Dexcom CGM systems to a computer. This provides users the ability to track their trends and progress over time. DM3 works with all versions of SEVEN Receivers. With the SEVEN PLUS, meal, insulin, health, and activity information entered can be reviewed later with the DM3 software. A1c values can also be entered in the software for tracking and viewing improvements.[19]
G4 Platinum Continuous Glucose Monitoring System with Share[edit]
On Jan 26, 2015, the FDA approved[20] this latest DEXCOM continuous glucose monitoring system which also

links and shares glucose data, readout every 5 minutes, with cellphones via Bluetooth using a "free" display app, as of 04/18/2015 only available on Apple iPhones (4S & later; Android app pending), along with
sharing this same data with up to 5 others, of the user's choice, via cell phone.

Like previous versions,

each sensor element is rated for use of 7 days (some users achieving longer times)
transmitter and display re-usable with many subsequent sensors (transmitter has an internal non-rechargeable battery that last 1 year)
using a calibration check about every 12 hours serving as the calibration reference
for a graph of glucose readings every 5 minutes, 288 readings/24 hours,

which are all displayed on both the DEXCOM monitor & linked cell phones.
G5 Constant glucose monitoring system with share and follow[edit]

Each sensor only lasts 7 days (it can be restarted but is not recommended)
The Dexcom G5 transmits via bluetooth to the receiving mobile device.
A sub system application (Dexcom follow) can be used to follow the progress of the wearer of the G5.
A calibration is required every 12 hours .
Dexcom G5 uses the same sensor as the G4 using a different transmitter.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
