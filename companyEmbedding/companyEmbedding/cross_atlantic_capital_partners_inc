I. 

INTRODUCTION 

Claim construction is meant to be a straightforward exercise where the Court interprets 

the words of a claim, affording them their plain and ordinary meaning, as informed by a review 

of the intrinsic record. Facebook’s proposed constructions do just that. For each term, 

Facebook has provided the plain meaning, and then explained how that meaning is supported by 

the specification of U.S. Patent No. 6,519,629 (“’629 patent”). The resulting definitions are clear 

and concise and will assist the trier of fact in understanding the issues in this case. 

For most of the terms, the constructions proposed by the two parties appear to be 

relatively similar. However, while similar in content, many of XACP’s proposed constructions 

violate basic principles of claim construction. Noticing this, Facebook offered to meet and 

confer with XACP to try to arrive at constructions both parties could agree with that also comply 

with the tenets of claim construction established by the Federal Circuit. XACP did not respond 

to Facebook’s overtures. As a result, the majority of XACP’s constructions violate at least one 

of the following three cardinal rules of claim construction: 

1. 

The accused product must not be considered in construing the claim terms, yet 

XACP asks the Court to do so; 

2. 

Limitations from the specification must not be imported into the claims, yet 

XACP’s constructions incorporate direct quotes from the preferred embodiments recited in the 

specification; and 

3. 

Claim construction should provide clarity and certainty to the claims, not render 

them more vague and amorphous, as many of XACP’s proposals do. 

Facebook respectfully requests that its straightforward, consistent constructions be 

adopted.

II. 

BACKGROUND 

Facebook is a leading social networking website that connects people with those who 

work, study and live around them. Facebook was established in 2004 and has grown rapidly to 

service tens of millions of users throughout the world. Facebook’s success and sustained growth 

have occurred due to the company’s own efforts and innovations, which were completely 

independent of the patent at issue in this case. In fact, Facebook had no knowledge or awareness 

of the ’629 patent prior to the filing of this action on July 3, 2007. 

Cross-Atlantic Capital Partners, Inc. (“XACP”), on the other hand, is not a technology 

company and has no product of its own. It is an investment company that allegedly acquired 

rights in the patent as the result of a failed investment in a company called iKimbo. 

The ’629 patent has 32 claims, all of which XACP has asserted against Facebook. The 

patent began as an application for an online gaming system filed on September 15, 1998. That 

application did not disclose anything about creating communities. It was transformed into the 

present patent through a major revision of the specification. More specifically, the applicants 

first disclosed a community creation system in a continuation-in-part application filed on 

February 25, 2000. Almost all of the text in the ’629 patent that is cited by both parties to 

support the claim terms briefed herein was added in February 2000. 

III. LEGAL PRINCIPLES 

Claim construction is an issue of law to be determined by the Court. See Markman v. 

Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 979 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc), aff’d 517 U.S. 370 

(1996). There is a well-established body of authority providing guidance to courts on the 

permissible sources for determining the meaning of disputed claim terms. That body of law also 

contains a number of prohibitions that courts must abide by to avoid error. The following is a 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



2 





synopsis of the claim construction framework, as well as a list of prohibitions of which XACP’s 

proposed constructions run afoul. 

A. 

General Tenets of Claim Construction 

It is well-established that the words of a claim “are generally given their ordinary and 

customary meaning.” Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 

1996). That ordinary and customary meaning “is the meaning that the term would have to a 

person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective 

filing date of the patent application.” Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 

2005) (en banc); Texas Digital Sys., Inc. v. Telegenix, Inc., 308 F.3d 1193, 1202 (Fed. Cir. 2002). 

Accordingly, the claim construction process begins with a review of the sources of interpretation 

a person of ordinary skill would reference – the plain meaning and the intrinsic record. Phillips, 

415 F.3d at 1313-14. 

1. 

Intrinsic Record 

The intrinsic record is made up of three sources, the claims of the patent, the patent 

specification and the prosecution history. “Such intrinsic evidence is the most significant source 

of the legally operative meaning of disputed claim language.” Liquid Dynamics Corp. v. 

Vaughan Co., Inc., 355 F.3d 1361, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (quoting Vitronics, 90 F.3d at 1582). 

a. 

The Plain Meaning and the Claims Themselves 



“In construing claims we search for the ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term 

to a person of ordinary skill in the art.” L.B. Plastics, Inc. v. Amerimax Home Products, Inc., 

499 F.3d 1303, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The claim language itself provides the primary guidance. 

The context of the surrounding words of a claim must also be considered in determining the 

ordinary and customary meaning of a particular term. ACTV, Inc. v. Walt Disney Co., 346 F.3d 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



3 





1082, 1088 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Further, “[b]ecause claim terms are normally used consistently 

throughout the patent, the usage of a term in one claim can often illuminate the meaning of the 

same term in other claims.” Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314; see also Rexnord Corp. v. Laitram 

Corp., 274 F.3d 1336, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2001); CVI/Beta Ventures, Inc. v. Tura LP, 112 F.3d 1146, 

1159 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Finally, analysis of the differences between claims can be useful for 

determining the meaning of particular claim terms. Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314 (citing Laitram 

Corp. v. Rexnord, Inc., 939 F.2d 1533, 1538 (Fed. Cir. 1991)). 

b. 

The Specification 

The claims are not to be considered in isolation. They “must be read in view of the 

specification, of which they are a part.” Markman, 52 F.3d at 979. The specification “is always 

highly relevant to the claim construction analysis. Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best 

guide to the meaning of a disputed term.” Vitronics, 90 F.3d at 1582. While a claim term is to 

be given its ordinary meaning, the patentee may use the specification to give a term a special 

definition that differs from that ordinary meaning, but only if it does so clearly and explicitly. 

See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. The specification may also “reveal an intentional disclaimer, or 

disavowal, of claim scope by the inventor. In that instance as well, the inventor has dictated the 

correct claim scope, and the inventor’s intention, as expressed in the specification, is regarded as 

dispositive.” Id. (citing SciMed Life Sys., Inc. v. Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc., 242 F.3d 

1337, 1343-44 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). Finally, courts “should also consider the patent’s prosecution 

history, if it is in evidence.” Markman, 52 F.3d at 980. 

2. 

Extrinsic Sources 

Courts may also rely on extrinsic sources – sources external to the patent and prosecution 

history, such as dictionaries and treatises. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317. Dictionaries and 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



4 





treatises can be useful in claim construction for the purpose of allowing courts “‘to better 

understand the underlying technology’ and the way in which one of skill in the art might use the 

claim terms.” Id. at 1318 (citing Vitronics, 90 F.3d at 1584, n.6). These sources may be used “if 

the court deems it helpful in determining ‘the true meaning of language used in the patent 

claims.’” Id. (citing Markman, 52 F.3d at 980). 

B. 

Prohibitions in Claim Construction 

XACP has attempted to induce the Court to violate several established prohibitions of 

claim construction by asking the Court to: (1) construe the claim terms with reference to the 

accused product; (2) import limitations from the specification into the claims; and (3) adopt 

open-ended, vague, non-definitions of claim terms that would obscure, rather than clarify the 

scope of the asserted claims. Each of these improper practices is discussed in the sections below. 

1. 

The Claims May Not Be Construed by Reference to the Accused 
Product 

In its claim construction brief, XACP repeatedly asks the Court to construe the terms of 

the ’629 patent with reference to the features of the accused facebook.com website. The Federal 

Circuit has expressly and emphatically rejected such a practice. As this Court recently observed, 

“[o]ne form of extrinsic evidence that a court may not use to supply limitations to the patent 

claim language is the accused device.” Heraeus Electro-Nite Co. v. Midwest Instrument Co., 

Inc., No. 06-355, 2007 WL 3274147, at *3 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (Padova, J.) (emphasis in original); 

accord NeoMagic Corp. v. Trident Microsystems, Inc., 287 F.3d 1062, 1074 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (“It 

is well settled that claims may not be construed by reference to the accused device.”). “A claim 

is construed in the light of the claim language, the other claims, the prior art, the prosecution 

history, and the specification, not in light of the accused device.” SRI Intern. v. Matsushita Elec. 

Corp. of America, 775 F.2d 1107, 1118 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (en banc) (emphasis in original). “It is 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



5 





only after the claims have been construed without reference to the accused device that the 

claims, as so construed, are applied to the accused device to determine infringement.” Id. 

(emphasis in original). Even the case cited by XACP for the proposition that the Court should 

consider the accused Facebook product in construing the claims expressly rejects that assertion: 

This court, of course, repeats its rule that ‘claims may not be 
construed with reference to the accused device.’ (citations 
omitted). As noted earlier, that rule posits that a court may not use 
the accused product or process as a form of extrinsic evidence to 
supply limitations for patent claim language. Thus, the rule forbids 
a court from tailoring a claim construction to fit the dimensions of 
the accused product or process and to reach a preconceived 
judgment of infringement or noninfringement. In other words, it 
forbids biasing the claim construction process to exclude or 
include specific features of the accused product or process. 

Wilson Sporting Goods Co. v. Hillerich & Bradsby Co., 442 F.3d 1322, 1330-31 (Fed.Cir. 2006). 

It is only permissible to consider the accused product during claim construction in limited 

circumstances where such reference is needed solely to determine which aspects of a claim 

should be construed. Id.; Pall Corp. v. Hemasure Inc., 181 F.3d 1305, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1999) 

(“Although the construction of the claim is independent of the device charged with infringement, 

it is convenient for the court to concentrate on those aspects of the claim whose relation to the 

accused device is in dispute.”); Scripps Clinic & Research Found. v. Genentech, Inc., 927 F.2d 

1565, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (“Of course the particular accused product (or process) is kept in 

mind, for it is efficient to focus on the construction of only the disputed elements or limitations 

of the claims.”). 

Accordingly, all portions of XACP’s claim construction brief that ask the Court to refer 

to the accused Facebook website in construing the disputed terms of the ’629 patent should be 

disregarded. See XACP Br. at 5-6, 8-9, 28. 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K)

2. 

Importing Limitations From The Specification Into The Claims Is 
Forbidden 

Importing limitations from the specification into the claims has been referred to by the 

Federal Circuit as “one of the cardinal sins of patent law.” Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1320 (quoting 

SciMed Life Sys., 242 F.3d at 1340). Patent specifications often describe very specific 

embodiments of an invention, as is the case with the ’629 patent. The Federal Circuit has 

repeatedly warned against confining the claims of the patent to those specific embodiments. See, 

e.g., Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1323; Nazomi Communications, Inc. v. ARM Holdings, PLC, 403 F.3d 

1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2005); Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 358 F.3d 898, 906-08 (Fed. 

Cir. 2004); Teleflex, Inc. v. Ficosa North America Corp., 299 F.3d 1313, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2002). 

“Although courts should consider the specification when construing a claim, a court 

cannot add ‘limitations appearing only in the specification.’” Heraeus Electro-Nite, 2007 WL 

3274147, at *2 (quoting Electro Med. Sys. S.A. v. Cooper Life Sciences, Inc., 34 F.3d 1048, 1054 

(Fed. Cir. 1994)). The Federal Circuit has recognized that there is a distinction between using 

the specification to interpret a claim, which is permissible, and importing a limitation from the 

specification into the claim, which is prohibited. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1323. “[T]here is 

sometimes a fine line between reading a claim in light of the specification, and reading a 

limitation into the claim from the specification.” Id. “To help locate this ‘fine line,’ the Federal 

Circuit has reminded courts that they ‘look to the specification to ascertain the meaning of the 

claim term as it is used by the inventor in the context of the entirety of his invention, and not 

merely to limit a claim term.’” Heraeus Electro-Nite, 2007 WL 3274147, at *2. 

In this case, XACP repeatedly asks the Court to commit the cardinal sin of importing 

limitations from the specification into the claims. Many of XACP’s proposed constructions 

contain language quoted verbatim from preferred embodiments described in the specification, 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



7 





despite an express prohibition on the practice from the Federal Circuit. See, e.g., XACP’s 

proposed constructions for “community,” “creation transmission,” “published,” “registered 

user,” “subscribe,” “community fields,” “user fields” and “vendor fields.” 

Further, it is clear that the ’629 patentee intended the embodiments set forth in the ’629 

patent specification to be exemplary only, not limiting. Indeed, in many cases a patentee only 

uses specific embodiments as a tool to teach one of ordinary skill how to make and use the 

claimed invention, not to limit the scope of the claims. “[U]pon reading the specification in that 

context, it will become clear whether the patentee is setting out specific examples of the 

invention to accomplish those goals, or whether the patentee instead intends for the claims and 

the embodiments in the specification to be strictly coextensive.” Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1323 

(citing SciMed Life Sys., 242 F.3d at 1341). In this case, the specification states that the 

embodiments described therein are for “the purpose of explaining the present invention” and 

“not intended to limit the scope of the invention.” ’629 patent, Col. 4, lines 24-27. 

To accept XACP’s constructions would clearly be erroneous and would run afoul of the 

Federal Circuit’s prohibition on importing limitations from the specification into the claims. It 

would also run contrary to the patentee’s express intention not to limit the scope of the claims to 

the exemplary embodiments described in the specification. 

3. 

Open-Ended Constructions Are Also Prohibited 

Many of XACP’s proffered constructions state that elements of the ’629 patent claims 

“may” perform a particular function. This type of vague, open-ended construction has been 

expressly rejected by the Federal Circuit. In Cybersettle, Inc., v. National Arbitration Forum, 

Inc., the Federal Circuit rejected the trial court’s claim construction whereby an accused method 

would infringe the claim if it was merely “capable of” a particular function. In rejecting that 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



8 





construction, the Court reasoned: 

A patented method is a series of steps, each of which must be 
performed for infringement to occur. It is not enough that a 
claimed step be “capable” of being performed. (citation omitted). 
A party that does not perform a claimed step does not infringe a 
method claim merely because it is capable of doing so. 

243 Fed. Appx. 603, 606-07 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (emphasis added) [attached as Exhibit F].1 See also 

Ormco Corp. v. Align Tech., Inc., 463 F.3d 1299, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (rejecting an argument 

that a claim requiring the replacement of appliances can be performed if the appliances are 

merely “capable of” being replaced). 

In addition, certain of XACP’s proposed constructions allow for such an open ended 

application that, if adopted, they would result in a claim scope that vastly exceed any reasonable 

interpretation of the claim. For example, as detailed below, XACP’s proposed construction for 

“application object” is so vague that if it were adopted, there would be no definitive definition 

for the term. This is a problem shared by many of XACP’s constructions, as detailed below. 

IV. DISPUTED CLAIM TERMS 

Facebook’s arguments regarding the disputed claim terms are set forth below. For each 

disputed claim term, Facebook has provided a chart showing a side-by-side comparison of 

Facebook’s and XACP’s proposed construction. Rather than organizing the terms in 

alphabetical order, Facebook has ordered the disputed claim terms in a manner that groups terms 

that present similar issues. For the convenience of the Court, Facebook is also providing an 

appendix (attached as Exhibit B) identifying, in alphabetical order, each disputed claim term and 

providing representative claims of the ’629 patent in which each term appears.

A. 

“Registered User” 

Facebook’s Proposed Construction 

XACP’s Proposed Construction 

A person who has provided, at least once, 
registration information (e.g., name, address, 
personal information, etc.). 

A person who has provided, at least once, 
requested registration information (e.g., name, 
address, personal information, etc.) and 
forwarded the information to a controller. 



The main difference between the parties’ constructions is that Facebook concludes its 

construction of “registered user” after defining who a registered user is, while XACP asks the 

Court to import several limitations from the specification to narrow the definition of registered 

user. XACP’s construction requires that the information be “requested,” and after it is provided, 

sent to a “controller.” Neither of these limitations has anything to do with the plain meaning of 

“registered user” and both were improperly read in from the specification. XACP’s proposed 

construction should therefore be rejected. 

1. 

Plain Meaning of “User” and “Registered” 

The parties agree that a “registered user” is a person who has provided, at least once, 

registration information (e.g. name, address, personal information, etc.). This construction is 

consistent with the plain meaning of the terms “registered” and “user.” See Webster’s II New 

College Dictionary, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1999, p. 933 and p. 1215 [Ex. C], respectively. 

Nothing more is required to define the term. 

2. 

The Specification Does Not Alter the Plain Meaning 

The specification always uses the term “registered user” in a way that is consistent with 

the plain meaning. XACP’s attempt to import further limitations is unsupportable. Nothing in 

the specification requires “registered user” to be defined to include the additional steps of 

registration information being “requested” from some unknown entity, or “sent to a central 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



10 





controller.” In fact, the very section of the specification XACP relies upon makes it clear that 

these steps are mere design choices of a preferred embodiment — not definitional. See ’629 

patent, Col. 27, lines 5-6 (“A registration for (or other means of providing the requested 

information) is completed by the user and may be sent by client 110 to central controller modules 

115 at step 545.”) (italics added). The fact that these steps are optional requires that they not be 

imported into the construction of “registered user.” 

B. 

“Community” 

Facebook’s Proposed Construction 

XACP’s Proposed Construction 

A virtual place or electronic medium where 
people having common interests can interact, 
which can be accessed by a computer or other 
device. 

Information and at least one function relating to 
a specific transaction, interaction and/or 
expression of interest that may be accessed 
and/or interacted with by a plurality of users 
with common interests through a private or 
public communication network, such as web 
pages or an Internet site. 



“Community” is a commonly used term with a plain and ordinary meaning, which is 

captured by Facebook’s proposed construction. XACP is attempting to contort this commonly 

understood word into a narrow reflection of the preferred embodiment in the specification. 

XACP’s construction begins with “[i]nformation and least one function,” which has nothing to 

do with the term “community.” XACP should not be permitted to alter the plain meaning by 

adding litigation-inspired limitations into the construction of this term. 

1. 

The Plain Meaning of “Community” Is Applicable 

Webster’s defines “community” as “1. a. A group of people residing in the same locality 

and under the same government. b. The area or locality in which such a group resides. 2. A 

group or class having common interests.” Webster’s II New College Dictionary 227 (Houghton 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



11 





Mifflin Company ed. 1999) [Ex. C]. Since the ’629 patent deals entirely in a computer 

environment (see discussion below of the intrinsic record), a “community” in the context of the 

patent is necessarily virtual. Otherwise, the term should be given its plain and ordinary meaning. 

2. 

The Intrinsic Record Supports Use of the Plain Meaning Applied to a 
Computer Environment 

The specification is the single best source of determining claim meaning, but only to the 

extent it is used to determine if the plain meaning of a term should be utilized or if the term has 

been expressly given a special meaning. It cannot be used to read limitations from preferred 

embodiments into the claims. See Part III, supra. 

The intrinsic record is clear that the plain meaning of the word “community” governs and 

should only be slightly altered to be applicable to a computer environment. The first mention of 

a “community” in the specification concerns “The William Henry Harrison Historical 

Preservation Society.” That “community” is described as a place on a computer (a virtual place) 

where people with a shared interest in William Henry Harrsion can interact. ’629 patent, Col. 4, 

lines, 27-46. The “Omaha Sailing Club” (col. 7, line 25- col. 12, line 41), “The XYZ Softball 

Team” (col. 11, line 66- col. 12, line 41) and other examples of communities are similarly 

described. The specification is clear that these “communities” exist in a computer environment 

(Col. 7, lines 59-60), and even states that these communities may contain all of the applications 

necessary to view and interact in the communities on the Internet. ’629 patent, Col. 14, lines 66-

67. Thus, the specification supports the use of the plain meaning of the word “community” 

altered only to the extent necessary to be applicable to a computer environment. 

XACP’s construction, on the other hand, improperly ignores the plain meaning of 

“community” by specifying that a community is undefined “information and at least one 

function.” The specification makes it abundantly clear, however, that a “community” is separate 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



12 





and distinct from the functions and applications with which it interacts: “According to an 

embodiment of the invention, community creating module 165 may provide the framework 

through which central controller module 115 interacts with a user to create a community, and 

related applications and functions.” ’629 patent, Col. 7, lines 53-57 (emphasis added). If the 

community was meant to be defined to include one or more functions, the functions would not be 

described separately in the specification. Therefore, Facebook’s proposed construction, which 

does not improperly read limitations in from the specification, should be adopted. 

C. 

“Community is Created,” “Create a Community,” “Creating a Community” 
and “Created Community” 

XACP has proposed separate constructions for four closely related terms that include the 

word “community,” i.e. “community is created,” “create a community,” “creating a community” 

and “created community.” Facebook does not believe it is necessary to separately construe these 

four phrases once the terms “community” and “create” are construed. 

The parties are in agreement that the word “create” means “to bring into being.” 

Webster’s II New College Dictionary, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1999, p. 265 [Ex. C]. 

“Created” is merely the past tense: “brought into being,” and “creating” is the gerund form 

signifying present action, “bringing into being.” Because all of these terms are simply different 

forms of the same word, “create,” it is sufficient to simply construe the root word “create” 

according to its plain meaning. 

D. 

“Community Field,” “User Field” and “Vendor Field” 

The terms “community field,” “user field” and “vendor field” appear only in four 

dependent claims (i.e. 8, 16, 24 and 32) of the ’629 patent. Each of these claims is substantially 

the same. Claim 8 reads (with the disputed terms shown in underlining): 




PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



13 





The method according to claim 1, wherein community 
8. 
information further comprises community fields, whereby the 
community presents to a user at least [sic] at least one of: 



wherein the presentation is based in part on a comparison of user 
fields, community fields and vendor fields. 

a) at least one other user having user fields; 
b) at least one other community having community fields; and 
c) at least one vendor product having vendor fields; 

The parties’ proposed constructions of these terms are set forth below: 

Claim term 

Facebook’s Construction 

XACP’s Construction 

User field 

A location in which information 
about a user may be entered and/or 
stored. 

Community field 

A location in which information 
about a community may be entered 
and/or stored. 

Vendor field 

A location in which information 
about a vendor may be entered 
and/or stored. 

Information that designates the 
interests and/or demographics of a 
user, which may comprise, but is not 
limited to, language, a category or 
categories of interest, age group, 
location, and/or other items 
associated with a user. 

Information that designates the 
interests and/or demographics of a 
community, which may comprise, 
but is not limited to, a category or 
categories of interest, language, 
location, age group, and/or meta 
tags of interest associated with a 
community which may overlap with 
another community identification 
information. 

Information that describes a product 
or service, which may comprise, but 
is not limited to, a category or 
categories of interest, language, 
location, age group, and/or meta-
tags of interest associated with a 
product or service. 



The primary difference between the Facebook and XACP constructions concerns 

precisely what the term “field” means. Facebook’s constructions define the three “fields” as 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



14 





locations where information about a user, community and vendor may be entered and/or stored. 

XACP, on the other hand, defines the “fields” by reference to the actual information represented 

in those fields, and improperly imports a number of limitations from the specification. As shown 

below, XACP’s proposed constructions should be rejected. 

1. 

Facebook’s Construction is the Plain and Ordinary Meaning 

Facebook’s constructions of “user field,” “community field” and “vendor field” are 

consistent with the plain and ordinary meaning of the term “field.” As defined by Microsoft 

Press, a “field” is a “location in a record in which a particular type of data is stored.” Microsoft 

Computer Dictionary 182-83 (4th ed. 1999) [Ex. E]. This is consistent with the dictionary cited 

by XACP, which defines field as “a portion of a record in a database, containing one piece of 

information.” XACP Br. at 34 (citing Barron’s Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms 187 

(2003)). Both of these definitions make clear that a “field” is where particular information is 

stored – and not the actual information itself. 

2. 

The Specification Supports Facebook’s Construction 

This plain and ordinary meaning is consistent with the specification of the ’629 patent, 

which likewise draws a distinction between a “field” and the information contained therein: 

A user may select Search Function 3045 to search for communities, 
users, vendors, and/or products. As described above, a creator may 
designate one or more community fields, and a user may designate a 
user field. According to an embodiment of the invention, a vendor may 
designate a vendor field. A vendor may have a product to sell to one or 
more users and/or communities. A vendor may describe the product by 
providing information for vendor fields. Vendor fields may comprise a 
category or categories of interest, language, location, age group, and 
meta-tags of interest associated with the product. According to an 
embodiment of the invention, vendor fields, community fields, and user 
fields may have corresponding information. Central controller module 
115 may have a field matching function associated therein to match 
users, communities, and vendors based on the fields provided. A user 
may provide information in a user field. 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



15 





’629 patent, col. 22, lines 2-18 (emphasis added). As this passage repeatedly makes clear, the 

“fields” are the locations where the information about users, communities and vendors is stored – 

not the information itself. 

XACP’s constructions should be rejected because they improperly attempt to import 

limitations from the specification into the claims. In fact, XACP’s proposed constructions 

attempt to pull language verbatim from portions of the specification which make clear that they 

are merely identifying examples of the categories of information that can be stored in the user, 

community and vendor fields. See, e.g., ’629 patent, col. 16, lines 4-7 (“User fields may 

comprise a user’s selection of language, a category or categories of interest, age group, location, 

and other items to designate interests of the user.”); id. at col. 8, lines 56-61 (“Community fields 

may comprise a category or categories of interest, language, location, age group, and meta-tags 

of interest associated with the community, and may overlap with other community identification 

information.”); id. at col. 22, lines 9-12 (“Vendor fields may comprise a category or categories of 

interest, language, location, age group, and meta-tags of interest associated with the product.”). 

E. 

“Creation Module,” “Receiver Module,” “Transmitter Module” and 
“Subscription Module” 

The terms “creation module,” “receiver module,” “transmitter module” and “subscription 

module” present common issues and thus will be addressed together. The parties’ proposed 

constructions are set forth below: 










PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



16 





Claim term 

Facebook’s Construction 

XACP’s Construction 

Receiver module 

A section of a computer program 
that receives data. 

Transmitter module A section of a computer program 

or device that transmits data. 

Creation module 

A section of a computer program 
that creates a community. 

Subscription module A section of a computer program 
that allows a user to subscribe to 
one or more subscription objects. 

A section of a computer program 
that may provide the function of 
receiving data. 

A section of a computer program 
or device that may provide the 
function of transmitting data. 

A section of a computer program 
that may provide the function of 
creating a community. 

A section of a computer program 
that may provide the function of 
subscribing to one or more 
subscription objects. 



As shown in the chart above, both parties generally agree on the plain meaning of these 

terms as they relate to the function and purpose of the “receiver module,” “transmitter module,” 

“creation module” and “subscription module.” They do not agree, however, on whether those 

four modules must actually perform their designated functions. XACP’s proposed constructions 

are illusory and should be rejected. As stated above in Part III.B.3, supra, XACP’s proposed 

constructions are also contrary to Federal Circuit authority. 

XACP’s proposed constructions specify “[a] section of a computer program that may” 

perform a designated function. The designated functions, under XACP’s proposed constructions, 

are entirely optional. A “section of a computer program” could satisfy the definition of “receiver 

module” even if it receives nothing, or could be a “transmitter module” even if it transmits 

nothing, or could be a “creation module” even if it creates nothing. Because there is no required 

functionality under XACP’s proposed construction, there is no functional difference between the 

receiver, transmitter, creation and subscription modules. Any “section of a computer program” 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



17 





could satisfy XACP’s illusory constructions, even if it never performs its designated function. 

1. 

The Specification Supports Facebook’s Construction 

The specification makes clear that these four modules are not simply theoretical 

constructs with purely optional behavior. They are recited in claims 9, 13 and 25 because they 

perform specific, unique functions relating to the claimed community creation system. The 

receiver module receives information; the transmitter module transmits it; the creation module 

creates a community; and the subscription module subscribes to subscription objects. This is 

consistent with the specification, which describes the modules as actually performing their 

respective, specific functions: 

According to another embodiment of the invention, a computer usable 
medium having computer readable program code embodied therein for 
interaction in and creation of may be provided. For example, the 
computer usable medium may comprise a CD ROM, a floppy disk, a 
hard disk, or any other computer usable medium. One or more of the 
modules of a system may comprise computer readable program code 
that is provided on the computer usable medium such that when the 
computer usable medium is installed on a computer system, those 
modules cause the computer system to perform the functions described. 

’629 patent, Col. 30, lines 32-41 (emphasis added); see also ’629 patent, Col. 30, lines 42-52 

(“According to another embodiment the . . . communication module 180 . . . and subscription 

objects module 412 may comprise computer readable code that, when installed on a computer, 

perform the functions described above.”). The specification confirms that the four modules 

actually cause the computer to perform their designated functions. Nowhere in the specification 

does it suggest that their behavior is entirely optional. Thus, XACP’s proposed constructions 

should be rejected. 




PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K)

F. 

“Display Module” 

Facebook’s Proposed Construction 

XACP’s Proposed Construction 

A device that displays on-screen information, 
such as a CRT display. 

A section of a computer program or device that 
may provide the function of displaying onscreen 
information. 



There are two disagreements between Facebook and XACP as to the meaning of “display 

module.” First, the parties do not agree on whether a display module is simply a “device” or can 

also include “a section of a computer program.” Second, reminiscent of the terms discussed in 

the preceding sections, the parties do not agree on whether the display module must actually 

perform any function. As explained below, the intrinsic record confirms that a “display module” 

is a physical device used with a computer to display on-screen information, and is not a 

computer program. 

1. 

Facebook’s Construction is the Plain and Ordinary Meaning 

The dictionary definition of “display” is “[t]he visual output device of a computer, which 

is commonly a CRT-based video display.” Microsoft Computer Dictionary 145 (4th ed. 1999) 

[Ex. E]; Microsoft Press Computer Dictionary 111 (1991) [Ex. D]. The term “CRT” is an 

acronym for “cathode-ray tube” (CRT), which simply refers to the picture tube used with 

televisions, computer monitors and other video display devices.2 

2. 

Facebook’s Construction is Consistent with the Specification 

Facebook’s construction is also consistent with the specification, which expressly defines 


2 Microsoft Computer Dictionary 118 (4th ed. 1999) [Ex. E] (defining “CRT” as: “Acronym 
for cathode-ray tube. The basis of the television screen and the standard microcomputer display 
screen. A CRT display is built around a vacuum tube containing one or more electron guns 
whose electron beams rapidly sweep horizontally across the inside front surface of the tube, 
which is coated with a material that glows when irradiated.”) (bold in original). 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



19 





the term “display module” as having its plain and ordinary meaning: 

According to an embodiment of the invention, each computer 110 
may be configured as a typical home based computer. Other 
configurations may also be used. Each computer 110 may contain a 
communication application module 155, a processor module 160 and 
a memory module 170. . . Computer 110 may have at least one input 
device 120 for controlling the computer 110. Input device 120 may 
be a keyboard, joystick, touchpad, scanner or any similar device or 
combination of devices. Each of computers 110 may also include a 
display module 140, such as a CRT display or other device. 

’629 patent, col. 5, line 57-col. 6. line 8 (bold in original; underlining added). The passage above 

from the specification makes clear that the “display module” is a CRT display “or other device,” 

which does not suggest that the display module can be a computer program as XACP suggests. 

XACP argues that a “display module” must be construed as including a section of a 

computer program because the specification refers to other types of “modules” that may be 

implemented as computer code. Not only is there nothing in the specification to suggest that a 

“display module” can be a portion of a computer program, the specification indicates that just the 

opposite is true. The specification makes clear that some “modules” may be provided as 

computer code, but others (such as the display module) may not: 

According to one embodiment central controller module 115, user 
interface module 125, link application module 130, processor module 
140, memory module 170, communication application module 155, user 
interface module 25, community creating module 165, invitation module 
175, communication module 180 application platform 404, session 
controller module 406, governor server module 408, application 
controller modules 410, and subscription objects module 412 may 
comprise computer readable code that, when installed on a computer, 
perform the functions described above. Also, only some of the modules 
may be provided in computer readable code. 

’629 patent, col. 30, line 42-53 (bold in original; underlining added). 

The above-quoted passage provides a comprehensive listing of the various “modules” 

that may be provided as computer code, but notably, does not include “display module” as one of 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



20 





them. The passage also states that “only some of the modules may be provided as computer 

readable code,” which obviously means that other modules cannot. The “display module” is 

clearly one of the modules that may not be provided as computer code as it is referred to in the 

specification solely as a physical display device. See SafeTCare Mfg., Inc. v. Tele-Made, Inc., 

497 F.3d 1262, 1269 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (“In explaining the importance of referring to the 

specification in determining and understanding the meaning and scope of a patent claim, we have 

stated that ‘the specification ‘is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis.’”) 

(quoting Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1315). 

Finally, Facebook’s construction is the only construction that is consistent with the 

manner in which “display module” is used in the claim. The term “display module” appears only 

in claim 25, as follows: “a display module for displaying prompts for the community 

identification information, the at least one communications address, and the selection of the at 

least one application object.” ’629 patent, col. 34, lines 10-13. A computer program is not 

physically capable of “displaying prompts,” or anything else, to a user. It is simply a collection 

of instructions to carry out operations on data. To actually “display prompts,” or anything else 

for that matter, a physical device is required for generating visual signals for the user to perceive. 

G. 

“Creation Transmission” 

Facebook’s Proposed Construction 

XACP’s Proposed Construction 

An electronic signal indicating a request to 
create a community. 

An electronic transmission through a private or 
public communication network indicating a 
request to create a community. 



The prime dispute between the parties turns on XACP’s use of the word “transmission” 

in its proposed construction. It is improper to use the term “transmission” itself in a construction 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



21 





that is supposed to define that very term – “creation transmission.” To do so is completely 

unhelpful to the fact finder. 

1. 

The Plain Meaning of “Transmission” 

Transmission is the noun form of “transmit.” Webster’s defines “transmit” in the 

electronic or computer context as: “To send (a signal), as by wire or radio.” Webster’s II New 

College Dictionary, Houghton Mifflin. Company, 1999, p. 1171 [Ex. C]. The same dictionary 

defines a “transmission” as “[s]omething, as a voice or message, that is transmitted.” Id. The 

plain and ordinary meaning of the term “transmission” therefore refers to the thing that has been 

transmitted or sent. 

XACP argues that the plain meaning proposed by Facebook somehow impermissibly 

narrows a transmission to a “signal.” But that is exactly what a transmission is: a signal that has 

been sent. Facebook is simply embracing the plain meaning of the term. XACP’s attempt to 

define “creation transmission” as “[a]n electronic transmission” is a circular non-definition that 

will not assist the trier of fact in understanding the claim term. 

2. 

The Intrinsic Record Supports Adoption of the Plain Meaning 

The term “creation transmission” is not used anywhere in the specification. There are a 

number of mentions of “transmissions,” but they are all limited to the transmission of invitations 

principally in the form of emails. See Col. 4, lines 54-66, col. 14, lines 11-20, col. 15, lines 32-

38. Each of those references supports the plain meaning of a “transmission” as an electronic 

signal. The phrase “creation transmission” is used in each of the independent claims, yet it is 

completely unsupported in the specification, rendering all such claims invalid for failing to meet 

the written description requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 1. For purposes of claim construction, 

because the term “creation transmission” is not used in the specification, the specification may 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



22 





not be used to alter the plain meaning of the term. 

H. 

“Transmitting” 

Facebook’s Proposed Construction 

XACP’s Proposed Construction 

Electronically sending. 



Electronically connecting; sending out and/or 
communicating by any wireless or wire 
mechanism. 

The word “transmitting” is a common and everyday term that should be given its plain 

and ordinary meaning. Only Facebook’s proposed construction captures it. Webster’s defines 

“transmit” in the electronic and computer context as: “To send (a signal), as by wire or radio.” 

Webster’s II New College Dictionary, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1999, p. 227 [Ex. C]. It is 

obvious that “transmitting” simply means sending. 

XACP’s construction, on the other hand, is a transparent attempt to redefine the everyday 

word “transmitting” to attempt to capture Facebook’s website, by including activities that have 

nothing to do with transmitting. For example, XACP’s construction of “transmitting” would be 

satisfied by merely “electronically connecting” to something, even if the act of connecting never 

resulted in anything being transmitted or sent. Common sense tells us that one does not 

“transmit” something by merely “connecting” to something else. Two things can be “connected” 

to one another even if nothing is being actually transmitted between them. While the act of 

“transmitting” may inherently require the establishment of a connection, transmitting entails the 

further act of actually sending something from one place to another. 

XACP devotes a substantial portion of its brief to quoting portions of the specification, 

but those passages have nothing to do with the construction of the term “transmitting.” Nothing 

in the specification suggests that the plain meaning of “transmitting” should be altered. 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K)

I. 

“Communications Address” 

Facebook’s Proposed Construction 

XACP’s Proposed Construction 

Information that specifies the precise location 
in a computer system or network where a 
communication may be received or sent, such 
as an e-mail address, IP address, URL or 
Internet Relay Chat address. 

The precise location in a computer system or 
network where a communication may be 
received or sent, such as an e-mail address, IP 
address, URL or Internet Replay [sic] Chat 
address. 



The key difference between the competing constructions is that XACP is attempting to 

improperly construe “address” as a location rather than information that directs you to a location. 

1. 

The Plain Meaning of “Address” 

The Microsoft Press dictionary defines “address,” in the computer context, as: “A name 

or token specifying a particular computer or site on the Internet or other network.” Microsoft 

Press Computer Dictionary 17 (4th ed. 1999) [Ex. E]. The name or token could be, for example, 

an e-mail or IP address that directs you to a location, but is not the location itself. An address 

can also include an alias that is converted by the computer into a full address. A simple example 

would be a street address. A street address is information (a name or token) that specifies a 

physical location (e.g. a home) on a street. It is not the location itself, but merely information 

that identifies the location. The same is true for the “virtual” locations in a computer 

environment. An e-mail address is a name or token (information) that specifies a location where 

e-mail can be sent – it is not the actual location itself as XACP contends. 

2. 

The Specification Supports the Plain Meaning of “Communications 
Address” 

The specification makes it clear that a “communications address” is the information that a 

user provides to be used to invite others to join a community. Whenever “communications 

address” is used, it is always followed by the exemplary, explanatory language “such as,”

indicating that there are many possible names or tokens that can provide the appropriate contact 

information. ’629 patent, Col 4, lines 47-55; Col. 12, lines 58-61; Col. 13, lines 45-47; Col. 15, 

lines 33-37. None of the references in the specification indicate that the plain meaning of 

“communications address” should be altered to mean a location, rather than information leading 

to a location. Facebook’s construction, which adopts the plain meaning, should be used. 

J. 

“Application Object” 

Facebook’s Proposed Construction 

XACP’s Proposed Construction 

A computer program or module that directs a 
user to specific information and/or enables a 
user to do something useful, including but not 
limited to JAVA, chat, scheduling, 
invitations, pledging, photo albums, shopping 
carts, instant messaging, navigating, 
searching, addresses, news groups, 
announcements, white boards, calendars, 
video conferencing, video chat, voice chat, e-
mail lists, and/or bulletin boards. 

A computer program or module that may function 
to direct a user to specific information and/or 
enables a user to do something useful, and may 
be for, among other things, JAVA, chat, 
scheduling, pledging, viewing a photo album, a 
shopping cart, instant messaging, navigation, 
searching, addresses, a news group, 
announcements, a white board, a calendar, video 
conferencing, video chat, and/or a bulletin board. 

The main difference between the parties’ proposed constructions of “application object” 

is that XACP’s construction does not require that the “application object” actually do anything. 

It simply identifies a possible function an application object “may,” but is not required to, do. 

XACP’s proposed construction is illusory and should be rejected for the same reason as 

the “creation module,” “receiver module,” “transmission module” and “subscription module” 

definitions previously addressed. There is nothing in the specification or plain meaning of the 

term “application object” that indicates such purely optional behavior. XACP’s proposed 

definition is undermined by the very dictionary definition of “application” cited in its claim 

construction brief: “A program that enables a user to do something useful with the computer, 

such as writing or accounting (as opposed to utilities, programs that help the user maintain the 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



25 





computer).” XACP Br. at 20-21 (citing Webster’s New World Computer Dictionary 23 (10th ed. 

2003) (emphasis added). Under XACP’s proposed construction, the “application object” would 

become any “computer program or module,” without requiring that it perform the actual function 

of an application object. Such an illusory construction will aid no one and should be rejected. 

K. 

“Subscription Object” 

Facebook’s Proposed Construction 

XACP’s Proposed Construction 

An item to which a user subscribes, which 
may comprise, but is not limited to, chat 
content, a publication, a product to purchase, 
a photograph file, web page and/or other item. 

An object that is published and to which a user 
may subscribe, which may comprise, but is not 
limited to, chat content, a publication, a product 
to purchase, a photograph file, web page and/or 
other item. 



As shown above, there are only minor differences between the parties’ constructions of 

“subscription object.” First, Facebook defines a “subscription object” as an “item” whereas 

XACP defines it as an “object.” Facebook used the term “item” to avoid having to use the word 

“object” to define the term “subscription object,” but this does not alter the meaning. Second, 

XACP’s proposed construction attempts to import the limitation of an object “that is published.” 

As with many other terms, XACP’s construction improperly imports limitations from the 

written description into the claims. The specification discusses publication of subscription 

objects merely as a preferred embodiment. See ’629 patent, col. 19, lines 26-30 (“Subscription 

objects may be various objects, such as chat content, a product to purchase, a photograph file, or 

other item, which has been published by another user.”) (emphasis added). There is no basis 

for importing the requirement “that is published” into the definition of a subscription object. 

XACP’s construction is also unsupportable in light of the claims. Claims 5 and 6, for 

example, state: 


PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



26 





The method according to claim 1, further comprising the 

5. 
step of receiving a selection to subscribe to at least one 
subscription object, wherein the at least one subscription object is 
accessed through one of the at least one application object. 
The method according to claim 5, wherein the at least one 
6. 
subscription object is published by at least one of: a) at least one 
other community; b) at least one other user; and c) at least one 
vendor. 

The difference between claim 5 and 6 illustrates that the applicants knew how to specify 

when they wanted to require a subscription object to be “published” and when they did not. 

Under XACP’s proposed construction, the “subscription object” of claim 5 would need to be 

“published,” even though the applicants provided an entirely separate claim to call out that detail. 

Moreover, a construction of “subscription object” that requires it to be published would not make 

sense as applied to Claim 6 because the subscription object would need to be published again 

pursuant to that claim. The absence of a reference to publication in claim 5 and its presence in 

Claim 6 is further reason to reject XACP’s proposed construction. 

L. 

“Subscribe” and “Subscribing” 

Claim term 

Facebook’s Construction 

XACP’s Construction 

Subscribe 

To designate something to be 
interacted with and/or accessed in 
one or more communities. 

Subscribing 

Designating something to be 
interacted with and/or accessed in 
one or more communities. 

Select to be interacted with and/or 
accessed in one or more communities, 
which may comprise, but is not 
limited to, selecting to automatically 
receive updated information, 
applications, functions and/or other 
aspects of one or more communities. 

Selecting to be interacted with and/or 
accessed in one or more communities, 
which may comprise, but is not 
limited to, selecting to automatically 
receive updated information, 
applications, functions and/or other 
aspects of one or more communities. 




PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



27 





There is little substantive difference between the parties’ proposed constructions of 

“subscribe” and “subscribing.” The primary difference is that XACP’s constructions end with 

the text, “selecting to automatically receive updated information, applications, functions and/or 

other aspects of one or more communities.” The passage of the specification on which XACP 

relies states that the subscription system allows a user to receive “updated content objects,” ’629 

patent, col. 19, lines 38-39, but makes no mention of receiving updated “applications, functions 

and/or other aspects of one or more communities.” There is no reason to import this additional 

language into the claim. 

M. 

“Published” 

Facebook’s Proposed Construction 

XACP’s Proposed Construction 

Made available to others. 



Made available for others to interact with and/or 
access in one or more communities. 

The parties agree that the plain and ordinary meaning of “published” includes “made 

available to others,” but XACP is impermissibly attempting to import details from the 

specification into the meaning of this straightforward term. XACP manufactured its proposed 

construction by combining two different examples from the specification, one using the word 

“interact” and another using the term “access,” and improperly importing those into its proposed 

construction. See ’629 patent, Col. 19, lines 33-34, col. 20, lines 53-55. Facebook’s proposed 

construction should therefore be adopted. 

V. 

AGREED CONSTRUCTIONS 

The parties are in agreement on the following terms: 




PALOALTO 85718 v1 (2K) 



28 





Claim Term 

Agreed Construction 

Selecting 

Selection 

Community identification 
information 

The act of choosing one or more things. 

One or more things that have been chosen. 

Information that identifies the community 
being created, which may include, but is not 
limited to, a community name, description, 
search tags, keywords, information about the 
creator, and/or computer information. 

Community information 

Information associated with a community. 

User interface 



The junction between a user and a computer 
program, such as a set of commands or menus 
through which a user communicates with a 
program. 

Facebook respectfully requests that the Court adopt the agreed constructions of these 

terms as set forth in the chart above. 

VI. CONCLUSION 

For the foregoing reasons, Facebook respectfully requests that the Court adopt 

Facebook’s proposed constructions as set forth above.

          Padova, J.
        

          February 29, 2008
        

Plaintiff Cross Atlantic Capital Partners, Inc. (\u201cXACP\u201d) has brought this patent infringement
action concerning U.S. Patent No. 6,519,629 (the \u201c\u2018629 patent\u201d) entitled \u201cSystem for Creating a
Community for Users with Common Interests to Interact In,\u201d against Facebook, Inc., and The
Facebook, LLC (collectively \u201cFacebook\u201d). Currently before the Court are the parties\u2019 claim
construction briefs in which they seek to have the Court construe various claim terms of the patent
pursuant to Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370 (1996). We held a Markman
hearing on February 8, 2008.


          I.
        

          PRINCIPLES OF CLAIM CONSTRUCTION
        

The first step in determining whether a patent has been infringed is construction of \u201cany
disputed terms and limiting expressions in the [asserted claims].\u201d Vivid Tech., Inc. v. Am. Science
& Eng., Inc, 200 F.3d 795, 803 (Fed. Cir. 1999). \u201cClaim construction is a matter of resolution of
disputed meanings and technical scope, to clarify and when necessary to explain what the patentee
covered by the claims, for use in the determination of infringement.\u201d U.S. Surgical Corp. v. Ethicon,



          CROSS ATLANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS, INC. v. FACEBOOK, INC. et al
        

          Doc. 81
        

          Dockets.Justia.com
        

































          -2-
        

Inc., 103 F.3d 1554, 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Construction of a patentee\u2019s claims is a matter of law.
Markman, 517 U.S. at 388-90. In construing claims, a court need not construe all the claims in their
entirety. U.S. Surgical Corp., 103 F.3d at 1568 (\u201cThe Markman decisions do not hold that the trial
judge must repeat or restate every claim term in order to comply with the ruling that claim
construction is for the court.... It is not an obligatory exercise in redundancy.\u201d) Rather, only those
claim terms that are in controversy need to be construed, and only to the extent necessary to resolve
the controversy. Vivid Tech., 200 F.3d at 803.


\u201cClaim interpretation begins with an examination of the intrinsic evidence, i.e. the claims,
the rest of the specification and, if in evidence, the prosecution history.\u201d CCS Fitness, Inc. v.
Brunswick Corp., 288 F.3d 1359, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citing cases). The language of the claim
itself is of primary importance. See Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005)
(noting that the Supreme Court has recognized that the claims are of primary importance); Interactive
Gift Exp., Inc. v. Compuserve Inc., 256 F.3d 1323, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (stating that \u201c[f]irst, we
look to the claim language. Then we look to the rest of the intrinsic evidence . . .\u201d). Words of a
claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning, and the ordinary and customary
meaning of a claim term is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the
art in question at the time of the invention. Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1313. A person of ordinary skill
in the art is deemed to read the claim terms not only in the context of the particular claim, but in the
context of the entire patent, including the specification and the prosecution history. Id.; see also
Medrad, Inc. v. MRI Devices Corp., 401 F.3d 1313, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (\u201cWe cannot look at the
ordinary meaning of the term . . . in a vacuum. Rather, we must look at the ordinary meaning in the
context of the written description and the prosecution history.\u201d). \u201cIn some cases, the ordinary






























          -3-
        

meaning of claim language as understood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even
to lay judges, and claim construction in such cases involves little more than the application of the
widely accepted meaning of commonly understood words.\u201d Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314.


Reliance on the specification, or written description, for guidance as to the meaning of the
claims is entirely appropriate. Id. at 1317. \u201cThe specification \u2018is always highly relevant to the claim
construction analysis. Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a
disputed term.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1315 (quoting Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582
(Fed. Cir. 1996)). The specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the
patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases, the inventor\u2019s
lexicography governs. Id. at 1316. The specification may also reveal an intentional disclaimer, or
disavowal, of claim scope by the inventor, and the inventor\u2019s intention, as expressed in the
specification, is dispositive. Id. Although courts should consider the specification when construing
a claim, a court cannot add \u201climitations appearing only in the specification.\u201d Electro Med. Sys. S.A.
v. Cooper Life Sciences, Inc., 34 F.3d 1048, 1054 (Fed. Cir. 1994); see also Phillips, 415 F.3d at
1323 (\u201c[A]lthough the specification often describes very specific embodiments of the invention, we
have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to those embodiments.\u201d); Teleflex, Inc. v.
Ficosa North Am. Corp., 299 F.3d 1313, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (stating that the district court erred
by importing a limitation from the specification into the claim); Johnson Worldwide Assocs., Inc.
v. Zebco Corp., 175 F.3d 985, 990 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (stating that claim terms cannot be narrowed by
reference to the written description or prosecution history unless the language of the claims invites
reference to these sources). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has
recognized that there is a fine line between reading a claim in light of the specification, and reading

They currently manage four venture funds with over $500 million in total capital under management.

Additionally, they manage $300 million in two co-investment funds for the Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System (PSERS). The first of these Co-Investment Funds, Co-Investment Fund 2000, is a $150 million fund and was followed on in 2005 by another $150 million fund, Co-Investment Fund II.
Their primary investment focus is in the commercialization of patented or specialty know-how in early to mid-stage technology companies. Their funds' historic and expected returns place them in the top decile / quartile of comparable vintage venture capital funds.

As a stable and mature management team, no Partner has less than 5 years of experience within the firm, and the Managing Partner has more than 20 years of investment experience in the firm's focus sectors, stage, and geography and has been a principal in 13 IPOs. As a collective group, the management team leads a focused investment thesis by investing in companies holding patentable technologies or specialty know-how, targeting large market opportunities, and possessing quality management teams. They have a strong, proprietary deal flow derived by our network, their co-investor network, repeat entrepreneurs and CEO's, as well as their established relationships with Silicon Valley Bank, the National Venture Capital Association, the Mid Atlantic Capital Alliance, and the New Jersey Technology Council.
