Biography[edit]
In 1982 Pearson enrolled in Queen's University with the intention of becoming a doctor like both of his parents. To earn money on the side, he ran his own small businesses, painting houses and the like, and subsequently developed an interest in entrepreneurialism. The new business interest ultimately prompted Pearson to change his major.[1] He graduated from Queen's in 1986 with a BScH in life sciences – later returning to earn his MBA in marketing.
Pearson currently resides in Toronto and is married to his wife of 28 years, Sally, with three children, Jeremy, Robyn and Hayley.[2]
Career[edit]
Pearson began his career as a product manager for Quaker Oats in 1988. He then served as a channel marketing manager at Alias before joining current company LoyaltyOne in 1992.
Pearson started his 20-year tenure with the company as a director of sponsor marketing at AIR MILES, Canada's largest coalition loyalty program. He then worked as vice president of sponsor management for the program before eventually becoming AIR MILES president. In this role, Pearson oversaw the development and execution of loyalty and database marketing strategies that build long-term, interactive and value-added relationships with AIR MILES customers.[3]
Today, Pearson serves as the CEO and president of LoyaltyOne and also functions as the president of Alliance Data Loyalty Services. He is a highly regarded expert on enterprise loyalty, retail marketing, coalition marketing and customer relationship management and has been quoted in more than 150 news outlets including The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, BusinessWeek, the Los Angeles Times, MSNBC and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.[4] Pearson is also a regular contributor to COLLOQUY, a loyalty marketing publication owned by LoyaltyOne, at which he also serves on the editorial board. He is also a regular columnist for Fast Company.[5]
Books[edit]
Pearson is the author of the bestselling book The Loyalty Leap: Turning Customer Information into Customer Intimacy as well as The Loyalty Leap for B2B.[4]
The Loyalty Leap landed on best-seller lists in the first week of its release. It ranked at No. 5, No. 3 and No. 10 on the New York Times, USA Today and Wall Street Journal non-fiction best-seller lists, respectively.[6] The book reveals common myths behind the privacy debate and challenges critics who equate data-usage marketing with for-profit spying. It also touches upon the concept of enterprise loyalty and the role front-line employees play in creating relevant offers for customers. Finally, the book shares five principles for using customer data responsibly while being sensitive to privacy concerns - ultimately enabling companies to make the loyalty leap.[7]
The Loyalty Leap for B2B was written as a followup to The Loyalty Leap and was published exclusively as an e-book. Pearson's second book provides the steps to making the loyalty leap in a B2B relationship across three different segments: small businesses, large enterprises and channel marketers. It offers a blueprint for using customer information to support a business’s specific goals and features case studies from American Express, Teradata, Premier Healthcare Exchange and Salesforce.com. In addition, the e-book details six steps to creating a loyalty initiative that will enhance business relationships and improve revenue and productivity.[8]

Overview


Description
For courses in Children’s Literature Methods.

 
A concise, engaging, practical overview of children’s literature that keeps the focus on the books children read.
 
This brief introduction to children’s literature genres leaves time to actually read children’s books. Written on the assumption that the focus of a children’s literature course should be on the actual books that children read, the authors first wrote this book in 1996 as a “textbook for people who don’t like children’s literature textbooks.” Today it serves as an overview to shed light on the essentials of children’s literature and how to use it effectively with young readers, from PreK to 8th grade.
 
The authors use an enjoyable, conversational style to achieve their goal of providing a practical overview of children’s books that offers a framework and background information, while keeping the spotlight on the books themselves. It is the authors’ intention to encourage teachers to develop their own dependable book lists, and to do so they have organized the book lists at the ends of the chapters under five different headings: Fifteen Timeless Gems, Fifteen Gems of the New Millennium, Others We Like, Easier to Read, and Picture Books. The new Ninth Edition includes a poem and learning objectives at the start of each chapter; brief chapter summaries at the ends of chapters; a reorganization of the information from the first and last chapters into a new first chapter, which more clearly explains the importance of reading and how best to help children become lifelong lovers of reading; a new list of favorite titles, the Fifteen Gems of the New Millennium; the addition of picture books as a separate category, rather than integrated within the chapter books; updated examples and new research findings; and a greater emphasis on modern publishing trends.

About the Author(s)
Michael O. Tunnell teaches children’s literature at Brigham Young University and currently serves as chair of the department of teacher education. He has published several professional books, including The Story of Ourselves: Teaching History through Children’s Literature (with Richard Ammon), as well as a variety of journal articles about children’s books and reading. He also writes for young readers. Some of his titles include The Children of Topaz, Mailing May, Wishing Moon, and Candy Bomber: The Story of the Berlin Airlift’s “Chocolate Pilot.” He has twice served on the award selection committee for the John Newbery Medal, the oldest and most prestigious children’s book prize.
 
James S. Jacobs began his career happily teaching English in grades 7 through 12. Next he taught at a junior college where, to his dismay, he was assigned to teach a children’s literature course. He discovered a new love and life path and returned to graduate school for a degree in children’s literature. Since then he has taught it at Brigham Young University. He interrupted his university life to gain experience in an elementary classroom, teaching fourth grade for two years at a U.S. Army school in Germany. His academic writing focuses on Lloyd Alexander, and he has written one picture book for children.
 
Terrell A. Young teaches courses in children’s literature at Brigham Young University. He serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the United States Board on Books for Young People (USBBY) and previously served on the International Reading Association Board of Directors from 2009 to 2012. He has been a member of numerous book award committees. He has published many articles and books about reading and children’s literature and was the 2006 recipient of the International Reading Association Outstanding Teacher Educator in Reading Award.
 
Gregory Bryan completed his Ph.D. at the University of British Columbia. He is now a member of the faculty of education at the University of Manitoba, Canada, where he teaches children’s literature and early and middle years literacy courses. Greg was born and raised in Australia and returns home as often as possible. His books include To Hell and High Water: Walking in the Footsteps of Henry Lawson in which he recounts walking almost 300 miles with his brother in extreme heat as they became the first people ever to recreate the experiences of Greg’s favorite writer, Henry Lawson, during his 1893 trek in Outback Australia. He is currently completing a biography of his favorite picture book illustrator, Paul Goble.

Insurance sounds boring and dreary to most people. Not for us at Pearson Bryan, however. While it is a serious business, we do not see insurance as boring - it is after all the business of keeping people in their homes, from going out of business and getting back on the road – essentially helping people lead normal lives and recover from disaster. This is interesting stuff! We are partnered with the right insurance carrier/s, people we have been doing business with for years. This enables us to comparison shop and gets you (our client) the best deal available. And the best deal is not always about price – but, hey – price is a big factor and we will never stop fighting to get you the best price. We help our clients with all kinds of insurance, but here are the main insurance types our agency focuses on -

Auto insurance – do you know what coverage you have? Most of our clients gloss over when we start talking liability, collision, comprehensive insurance coverages. And why do the limits have to be different based on your specific needs? Rest assured, we understand what is needed to operate a vehicle in and around Raleigh, NC and will handle all the details for you.
Business Insurance – own or operate a business? Do you need insurance before you can execute on a job/contract? Not sure what type of insurance you need? Do you just need the minimum or are you thinking about future exposure to lawsuits and injury claims? Our commercial insurance agents are standing by to help you get the right policy to help your business succeed.
Homeowners insurance – who knows where the value lies in an insurance policy when it comes to something as local-specific as insurance for a structure, building, home in a specific location – your local insurance agent – that’s who! Let us showcase our knowledge of the area in and around Raleigh, NC. You will be confident that you found the best local partner for your insurance needs.
Call us – let’s chat – 919-890-3303
