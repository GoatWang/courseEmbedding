Advanced Catalysts

QSI has patented a process to manufacture high-performance nanocatalysts. These nanocatalysts increase the rate of chemical reactions and, therefore, production efficiency in multi-billion dollar industrial chemical plants.
As much as 90% of all chemical processes utilize catalysts (oil refining, pollution abatement, and production of fuels and chemicals) and nearly 60% of all consumer and industrial products (fertilizers, plastics, pharmaceuticals and batteries) are made using catalysts.






Ammonia Synthesis

QSI’s lead chemical focus is ammonia synthesis, which is critical to the global food supply. More than 80% of ammonia output is used as agricultural fertilizer for food production (supplying 50% of all human protein consumed). The approximately $100 billion USD of ammonia produced annually consumes 1-2% of the world’s energy supply, and nearly 5% of natural gas.
There are hundreds of ammonia plants in operation globally that could run more efficiently, and benefit from QSI’s catalyst accelerator technology.

MAKING BETTER LIVES, FOR TODAY & TOMORROW







The Haber-Bosch Process: Getting Technical
Today, almost all ammonia (NH3) is produced through the 100-year-old Haber-Bosch process. The Haber-Bosch process involves a chemical reaction between hydrogen (H2) and nitrogen (N2). In order to turn these elements into ammonia (NH3), the strong triple bond in the nitrogen molecule and the single bond in the hydrogen molecule must both be broken.

Breaking those bonds requires a tremendous amount of energy. To reduce the amount of energy required, and to improve efficiencies, a catalyst is introduced. A catalyst is a material that helps speed up chemical reactions. Catalytic activity happens on the surface. The greater the surface area of the catalyst, the more efficient or faster the chemical reaction. A fast chemical reaction means lower costs and energy required to produce the reaction. Therefore, the goal is to have a catalyst with a large surface area.
In the manufacture of ammonia, iron is the catalyst of choice. When the iron catalyst is introduced into the ammonia manufacturing process, the nitrogen molecule interacts so strongly with the electrons on the surface of the iron catalyst that the bond between the two atoms in the nitrogen molecule is weakened and eventually breaks. This leaves both nitrogen atoms with three free electrons, enabling each atom to bond to three hydrogen atoms. At the end of the reaction chain, this combination forms ammonia.
Since more than 82% of the ammonia produced annually is used as agricultural fertilizer to significantly improve crop yield, and ammonia fertilizer is responsible for feeding 48% of the world’s population, the Haber-Bosch process has often been called the most important invention of the 20th century (eg., V. Smil, Nature 29 [415], 1999).

Understanding Nano Materials
A nanometer (nm) is one billionth of a meter, or 1,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair.
Simply put, nanotechnology involves the production and use of materials and devices with molecular-scale precision. It requires the control of matter at dimensions of roughly 1-100 nm. These tiny particles can be seen only with the most powerful electron microscopes.
The unique physical, chemical and biological properties of nano materials differ fundamentally from the properties of larger particles. As size decreases, there is a corresponding increase in surface area and surface energy.
Nanotechnology focuses on understanding and creating improved materials, devices and systems to exploit these novel properties.
Using Nanotechnology to Improve the Haber-Bosch Process
At QSI, we’ve leveraged our unique understanding of nanotechnology to develop nano-scale catalysts that accelerate industrial chemical reactions. These are called “nanocatalyst accelerators.” QSI’s nanocatalyst accelerators are applied as a coating to standard catalysts, and improve a catalyst’s efficiency by up to 15% by increasing the surface area of the catalyst.
Think of it this way: A basketball (representing the standard iron catalyst) has a certain surface area. If you cover that basketball with mini basketballs the size of BBs (representing the iron nanocatalyst), you now have the surface area of the basketball PLUS the surface area of thousands of mini basketballs. The total surface area has increased significantly.
QSI’s FeNIX™ iron nanocatalyst accelerators typically measure in the 30-60 nm range. They make the Haber-Bosch process more efficient by increasing the active surface area of standard commercial iron catalysts, thereby lowering the reaction temperature and pressure required for the Haber-Bosch process to occur. As a result, less energy is needed to complete the reaction and create ammonia.
The nanocatalysts that we create through our patented process offer superior properties, including a spherical shape, a controlled oxide layer, a crystalline structure, very large surface area, and consistent particle size. These nanocatalysts yield consistently higher reaction activity and greater efficiency.
Intellectual Property

The patent for QuantumSphere’s gas phase condensation (GPC) process, which is the key to our nanocatalyst production, was awarded October 16, 2007. Its broad claims on the GPC process allow us to produce high surface area catalysts at the nano scale. To date, we have 10 issued patents and 1 patent pending. We have expended a substantive amount of capital and effort in establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, and we will continue to file additional patents where appropriate.
An Automated Process
QuantumSphere’s patented process is safe, environmentally friendly and fully automated. Unlike competitive processes, we’ve removed expensive labor and the potential for human error from the manufacturing equation. Additionally, QSI’s implementation process onsite at industrial chemical facilities requires low supervision and little downtime.
With full automation comes increased production rates and lower labor and conversion costs. Our ability to deliver high-quality nanoscale catalysts in commercial quantities at reasonable prices has enabled industry-leading companies to incorporate our advanced technology into many industrial and consumer products.
Together with our partners, we are making possible the accelerated commercialization and mass market penetration of these new, advanced materials.
Competing Technologies
Synthetic or man-made nanoscale materials were first created in the 1970s using the GPC method. Today, there are dozens of processes for producing nanoscale materials.
Most of these processes are very expensive, require sophisticated and complex equipment, and are labor intensive. In addition, these methods may result in products with inconsistent particle size, distribution, shape and impurities, with little ability to scale up to commercial volume at reasonable cost.
To QSI management’s knowledge, no other company can match the size, purity, uniformity and catalytic activity of QSI products, they cannot deliver in large volumes, and they cannot demonstrate meaningful results in large, near-term commercial applications with compelling economic value propositions.
FeNIX™ Iron Nanocatalyst Accelerators: Commercial Validation

Our high surface area iron nanocatalyst accelerator, with a product name of FeNIX, is designed to increase the efficiency of ammonia production and the bottom line of the industrial chemical plants involved in the $100 billion USD ammonia production industry.
QSI has engaged in strategic programs with multiple top chemicals/catalysts producers around the globe, as well as a number of industry-leading corporations including Swiss-based Casale. Casale S.A. is a global leader in production technologies for ammonia, urea, melamine, methanol, syngas, nitrates and phosphates.
In 2015, together with our partners, we validated FeNIX in two production-scale ammonia plants in China by delivering a consistent 10-15% increase in production output in one plant, and delivering a consistent 15% increase in ammonia production efficiency in the second plant. This important commercial validation is anticipated to help drive early technology adoption in markets outside of China and generate revenues for QSI.

Most of these publications address issues of electron flow in organic molecules. His other works have involved the development of new MRI contrast agents and studies of DNA using a novel chemical force microscopy system.
In 1995, Dr. Kayyem founded Clinical Micro Sensors, now called GenMark Diagnostics, Inc., to commercialize technical innovations he developed while at Caltech. GenMark uses advanced electronics and biochemistry to create electronic detectors of specific DNA sequences. These "biosensors" have been used in the diagnosis of disease, the detection of environmental pathogens and in monitoring food safety. A novel use for these sensors is emerging in the field of personalized medicine, where these sensors are being used to identify genetic signatures in individual patients that can help in the determination of which drug at what dosage is best for this particular individual.
GenMark Diagnostics is emerging as an important player in the new field of applied genomics. The company has 3 FDA approved tests for its XT-8 platform and intends to continue to launch and market new tests in such areas as genetic diseases, cancer, infectious diseases and personalized medicine.
Since 1997, Dr. Kayyem has been awarded 32 U.S. patents in nucleic acid detection technology, all licensed to or owned by Clinical Micro Sensors. The intellectual property describes the bio-electronic detection of DNA and numerous methods and compositions for detecting and analyzing DNA.
Dr. Kayyem serves on various private company boards, including an AIDS gene-therapy company and a Web 2.0 company developing web-based tools for business and personal presentations. He co-produced a soon-to-be completed feature-length film titled "Nobel Son," about a "Cal Sciences" Professor and the kidnapping of his son on the eve of the Professor's receipt of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He is also Executive Producer on "The Ground Truth: After the Killing Ends," a feature-length documentary about the emotional and psychological effects of war on US soldiers. "The Ground Truth" was well received by critics and audiences, including those at the Sundance Film Festival. This film also made the "short list" of Oscar potential nominees in 2006.
Dr. Kayyem serves on the Board of Trustees of Caltech. He recently served on the Board of Trustees of The Art Center College of Design. Finally, in support of his passion for renewable fuels, he is a founding board member of Green Depot, a non-profit organization supporting sustainable transportation. Green Depot seeks to build alternative fueling stations that will provide much-needed distribution points for biodiesel, ethanol and other renewable fuels and also serve as educational centers for those seeking information about energy, climate, pollution and transportation.

Chemistry Nobel Prize Winner, George Olah, Ph.D.




Chemistry Nobel Prize Winner in 1994; currently Director of the University of Southern California's Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute and Distinguished Professor in Organic Chemistry. Dr. Olah served on the QSI Board of Advisors from December 2005 through his retirement in December 2014.
One of the world's preeminent scholars of hydrocarbon chemistry, Professor George Olah received the 1994 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for groundbreaking work on superacids and his observations of carbocations, a fleeting chemical species long theorized to exist but never confirmed. Olah devised a way to "freeze" the chemical process in time, enabling chemists to study their properties. What he found has revolutionized organic chemistry, leading to new discoveries, new fields of research and countless applications. Olah has made significant research contributions to the practical development of improved lead-free gasoline, cleaner high-octane gas and other promising nonpolluting fuels, as well as many chemical processes now used in pharmaceutical and industrial chemistry.
Focus on Fuel Cells - Fuel Cells have long been a research interest of Dr. Olah. His discoveries have led to the development of a new kind of fuel cell, called the direct liquid methanol fuel cell, that is a highly efficient and convenient source of electricity. His most recent research centers on the conversion of two greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane, into useful fuels and products, investigations driven by his long-standing interest in energy and environmental issues. To find new solutions to these pressing issues, Olah is working to develop new, cleaner and renewable energy technologies, based on methanol, to replace diminishing oil reserves while reducing levels of greenhouse gases.
Dr. Olah is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a member of foreign academies and societies. He has published some 1300 scientific papers, 15 books and has been issued some 120 patents. In 2003, he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun of Japan for his continued work promoting chemistry in Japan. In addition he was awarded the Priestly Medal in 2005 from the American Chemical Society.

Leadership
QuantumSphere takes an active leadership role in understanding and managing potential risks and hazards arising from working with nanomaterials. The management of the company provides the vision, the driving force, and resources needed to involve all employees in establishing a safe and healthy workplace environment.
Knowledge
As nanomaterials pose new challenges to understanding, predicting, and managing potential hazards and risks, QuantumSphere conducts periodic worksite analyses that study all working conditions to identify, prevent, and eliminate existing or potential hazards. The results of these studies are shared with all employees under a comprehensive EH&S training program as well as posted in product Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS’s). QuantumSphere also participates in various government funded university research studies dealing with environmental safety and handling concerns. In addition, pertinent data is made available to customers, partners, industry groups, regulatory agencies, universities and community first responders.
Prevention
To prevent any harmful impact to the safety and health of the employees, the community, and the environment, QuantumSphere employs established safety systems including: administrative and engineering controls, personal protective equipment (PPE), safe work practices, preventive maintenance, and emergency preparedness programs.

Catalysts are essential

 to the world’s industrial production

Read More





 
 






Our technologies enable the harmonious pursuit of profits, manufacturing efficiencies, and reduced consumption of our planet's finite resources, making better lives possible for those who live here today, and those who will live here tomorrow.
See How We Innovate












Advanced Catalysts

QSI has patented a process to manufacture high-performance nanocatalysts. These nanocatalysts increase the rate of chemical reactions and, therefore, production efficiency in multi-billion dollar industrial chemical plants.
As much as 90% of all chemical processes utilize catalysts (oil refining, pollution abatement, and production of fuels and chemicals) and nearly 60% of all consumer and industrial products (fertilizers, plastics, pharmaceuticals and batteries) are made using catalysts.






Ammonia Synthesis

QSI’s lead chemical focus is ammonia synthesis, which is critical to the global food supply. More than 80% of ammonia output is used as agricultural fertilizer for food production (supplying 50% of all human protein consumed). The approximately $100 billion USD of ammonia produced annually consumes 1-2% of the world’s energy supply, and nearly 5% of natural gas.
There are hundreds of ammonia plants in operation globally that could run more efficiently, and benefit from QSI’s catalyst accelerator technology.

COSTA MESA, CA (PRWEB)
July 21, 2005 -
Â QuantumSphere, Inc., the leading manufacturer of metallic nanopowders for applications in aerospace, defense, energy, biomedical and other markets demanding advanced material applications, announced the appointment of Kimberly McGrath, Ph.D., to the position of Director of Fuel Cell Research. In this position, Dr. McGrath will leverage her experience in the research and commercialization of fuel cell technology to drive the companyÂs strong track record as a manufacturer and provider of products to a global customer base.
QuantumSphere is the only supplier of the worldÂs highest quality metallic nanomaterials including QSI-nano™ nickel (n-Ni), QSI-nano™ silver, QSI-nano™ copper, QSI- nano™ Ni/Co and other proprietary alloys. These materials will replace platinum as the main catalyst in hydrogen fuel cells and other electrode assemblies and provide a renewable source of power to supply the worldÂs energy needs. 
Dr. McGrath will work with QuantumSphereÂs world-class research team to synthesize and characterize a highly optimized catalyst composition for PEM and DMFC fuel cell anode and cathode electrodes using the companyÂs highly catalytic metallic nanopowders.  As Director of Fuel Cell Research, Dr. McGrath will also tailor catalysts for various cell types and operating temperature regimes and design new fuel cell systems for small, portable applications that will be efficient at room temperature with minimal catalyst loading.
ÂDr. McGrath has years of experience designing catalysts, membranes and components for direct oxidation fuel cells and her energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute is unsurpassed,Â said Kevin Maloney, CEO, QuantumSphere, Inc. ÂShe has extensive knowledge of fuel cell performance evaluation and electrochemical characterization of anode and cathode catalysts. As a result, Dr. McGrathÂs addition will augment a powerful research team as QuantumSphere continues to experience strong customer demand for the companyÂs products that serve the fuel cell market and other areas that leverage our nanopowders for advanced material applications,Â Maloney added.
Prior to QuantumSphere, platinum was widely considered to be the best catalyst for proton exchange membrane fuel cells, such as hydrogen and direct methanol cell (DMFC) in terms of electrical efficiency.  However, platinum is about 1,400% more expensive per gram than QuantumSphereÂs solution. As a result, the company believes its QSI-nano™ materials will replace platinum as the main catalyst in hydrogen fuel cells and other electrode assemblies. As QuantumSphere announces additional customer wins in 2005, the market will realize a decades-long hurdle has been overcome as QuantumSphere, with Dr. McGrath, continues to research, develop, produce and ship alternative catalyst products on a mass scale at a fraction of the cost.
ÂI am delighted to join QuantumSphereÂs highly motivated and seasoned business and technical team,Â said Kimberly McGrath, Ph.D., Director of Fuel Cell Research, QuantumSphere, Inc. ÂIt is a pivotal time in the catalysis industry, especially as it relates to renewable energy sources QuantumSphere will continue to play a pivotal role in providing orders-of-magnitude improvements in catalysts for PEM fuel cells via QuantumSphereÂs superior development and production process. QuantumSphere is a dynamic company with a very tight-knit team of engineers and chemists who come from a variety of backgrounds. This diversity and community environment promotes novel thinking and synergistic concepts not limited to a single facet of science. It is this type free-thinking that is most conducive to major scientific breakthroughs,Â McGrath added.

If their product is so good, why are they having a problem to get just one plant to try it out. Either Casale sucks at selling a product or its just not that appealing to these plants. Something has gotta give.  This company wont last much longer without a contract. Get one plant to sign up and this takes off. However they have many patents and none have done anything so far. Thats the scary part here.  GLTA

Companies
QuantumSphere, Inc.
 






QuantumSphere, Inc. (QSI) has developed, patented and commercially validated a potentially game-changing technology. This technology can help increase process efficiencies in industrial chemical plants around the globe, while decreasing consumption of finite resources such as natural gas and significantly reducing industrial energy costs. Our goal is to help lower the amount of energy required to operate these chemical plants, increase profits, enable them to create more food and fuel for the world’s growing population, and reduce the burden on our planet. In 2015, QSI demonstrated this technology in two industrial ammonia chemical plants in China. QSI’s technology breakthrough resulted in a patent that was issued on March 1, 2016, as well as a commercialization agreement executed on March 8, 2016 with 95-year-old, Swiss-based, industry-leading technology partner Casale, S.A. Nearly 40% of global ammonia and methanol production utilize Casale production technology.

                        About US
                    


The SolutionQuantumSphere has created a way to increase surface area and catalytic activity of existing commercial catalysts. These catalysts are essential for facilitating and accelerating chemical reactions inside the converter of the chemical plant. QSI’s technology has been demonstrated commercially to improve chemical plant efficiency within the ammonia process converter by up to 15%, with no modifications to the plant itself. A 5% increase in catalytic activity can translate to millions in profits, over the life of the catalyst, for a typical-sized ammonia plant.We’ve developed, patented and commercialized our proprietary process to create highly active nanocatalysts that can significantly improve process efficiencies and production output for the nearly 600 relevant industrial ammonia plants worldwide. Ammonia is our lead chemical focus with other high value chemicals in the pipeline.
The Opportunity We SeeA key component to feeding the planet’s population is ammonia, arguably the world’s most critical chemical, which is manufactured through the Haber-Bosch process developed in the early 20th century. Ammonia-based fertilizer is the lifeblood of the agriculture industry, as it dramatically improves crop yields.Ammonia represents a $100 billion industry. It is produced at nearly 600 chemical plants worldwide and is responsible for nearly 5% of annual global natural gas consumption. Nearly 200 million tons of ammonia are produced each year, with more than 80% used to make fertilizer products to support global food supply and population growth.The Value PropositionQSI’s nanocatalyst products can significantly increase plant production efficiency and reduce the consumption of natural gas, which is the main energy input required to run these industrial plants. The result is greater profits and a compelling value proposition worth potentially billions of dollars for the thousands of chemical plants in operation that produce nearly $1 trillion USD of ammonia, methanol and other basic chemicals, annually.





                        Our Team

QuantumSphere, Inc. (OTC Pink: QSIM) is engaged in the development, research, manufacturing, and marketing of metallic nanopowders for chemical use. Shares of the chemical company are rallying 16.28%, through early trading on Tuesday, February 28, 2017. Over the past three months, QuantumSphere, Inc. has seen average daily volume of 9.51 million shares. However, volume of 3.46 million shares or dollar volume of $16,954, has already exchanged hands through the first half-hour of trading on Tuesday.
Shares of QuantumSphere, Inc. are climbing this morning, after the company released details on the market potential for its Ammonia FeNIX Product. Over the past six years, QuantumSphere, Inc. and joint partner, Casale, S.A., have been working on the ammonia product and commercialization. Overall, the ammonia market is a $100 billion market. Here is the full press release detailing of the market for the join venture’s ammonia product:
QuantumSphere, Inc. Press Release:
SANTA ANA, CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 28, 2017 / QuantumSphere, Inc. (OTC PINK: QSIM), a developer and manufacturer of advanced catalyst materials designed to increase process efficiencies and production output in commercial-scale chemical plants, today issued a business and corporate update to its shareholders.
QuantumSphere continues to operate its pilot manufacturing facility in Santa Ana, CA and although the sales process has taken longer than expected, the Company is still active with its partner, Casale, S.A., in pursuing an ammonia plant operator as a customer. The Company is optimistic that its ammonia FeNIX™ product can add significant value to ammonia plant operators and that an install at a live operating plant may occur in 2017. After 14 years of research and development, more than $35 million of invested capital and having worked closely with Casale for the past six years, QuantumSphere believes all of the hard work will result in commercialization; it’s just a matter of when.
2016 was a milestone year for QuantumSphere, as it was issued a key ammonia patent in March 2016 and executed a 10-year commercialization agreement with Casale also in March 2016. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a key patent related to its advanced FeNIX nanocatalyst accelerator technology. The patent covers claims around the application of iron nanocatalysts, applied as a coating onto existing commercial ammonia catalysts, for increased catalytic activity and production efficiency in ammonia synthesis. As of today, QuantumSphere has 10 issued patents.
The Company entered into a multi-year Commercialization Partnership Agreement with Swiss-based Casale S.A. (Casale), pursuant to which the parties agreed to the terms of commercialization of the Company’s QSI-Nano iron catalysts for ammonia synthesis. Casale is restricted from entering into any agreement with any third party for any purpose relating to the use of nano-sized particle based catalysts in ammonia synthesis. Further, during the term, Casale has exclusive rights to commercially market, co-brand and sell the FeNIX product into the ammonia market globally, with the exception of China. The Company is now in the initial commercialization phase with its partner Casale in addressing the market opportunity within the $100 billion annual ammonia market. Per its commercialization agreement, Casale is responsible for the sales and marketing efforts of FeNIX to its existing and prospective customers.
QuantumSphere is currently in sales discussions with multiple ammonia plant operators. A particular focus is on India due to their compelling need and the size of the market (India is the #2 world producer of ammonia after China). “QuantumSphere has generated considerable excitement in India this past year, where the increased output and energy savings that its FeNIX product can provide are particularly critical,” says Bill Collins, Executive Vice President of GRMC, QSI’s representative company in India. “QSI was a featured presenter at India’s most prestigious fertilizer conference and has caught the attention of the “who’s who” of the Indian chemical industry.”
The recent stock activity in QuantumSphere, which has witnessed a dramatic decline in price and significant increase in volume, is a result of debt converting to equity. While it caused a major drop in stock price, the debt conversions have improved the company’s balance sheet. The Company may experience further conversions of debt to equity in the near future. Investors are encouraged to carefully review QuantumSphere’s latest 10-Q filing for details. In this regard, the Company is exploring opportunities related to additional financings, licensing of its technology, and a possible sale of assets pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The Company has had preliminary discussions with multiple parties that have expressed an interest in additional debt financing or acquiring company assets.
