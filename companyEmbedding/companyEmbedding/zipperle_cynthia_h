Humana Inc. Appoints Cynthia H. Zipperle as Chief Accounting Officer






December 15, 2014 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM), one of the nation’s leading health and 
      well-being companies, announced today that it has appointed Cynthia H. 
      Zipperle as Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, 
      effective immediately. Zipperle will report to Senior Vice President and 
      Chief Financial Officer Brian Kane and has responsibility for all 
      accounting functions, the establishment and maintenance of internal 
      accounting controls and enterprise-wide financial reporting to both the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission and state Departments of Insurance.
    


      Zipperle, age 51, has been a part of Humana’s Finance team since joining 
      the company in 1998, with increasing responsibility during her tenure. 
      Prior to joining Humana, she held leadership positions with Aegon 
      (formerly Providian Financial) and Weight Watchers of Kentuckiana after 
      spending the first five years of her career with Coopers & Lybrand (now 
      PricewaterhouseCoopers). Zipperle holds a bachelor’s degree in 
      accounting from Bellarmine University and is a certified public 
      accountant.
    

      Zipperle succeeds Steven E. McCulley, who has been appointed Senior Vice 
      President – Medicare Operations. In his new role, McCulley will have 
      responsibility for multiple operational functions for the company’s 
      senior products business, including actuarial, product development, risk 
      adjustment, prescription drug and Medicare supplement plans and group 
      Medicare business.
    

      “We are extremely pleased to have two proven leaders in these critical 
      positions,” said Bruce D. Broussard, President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of Humana. “We want to ensure our leaders are continually 
      provided opportunities that take advantage of the depth and breadth of 
      their skill sets and broaden the talent pool across the enterprise. Both 
      Cindy and Steve have clearly demonstrated the capabilities needed for 
      these important leadership roles.”
    

      “Steve’s operational depth naturally led to his choice to move into a 
      senior operational role,” said Kane. “His contribution to the Humana 
      Finance area has been unmatched, and I very much look forward to 
      continuing to work with Steve in his new role. I’m also extremely 
      pleased with Cindy’s deep financial knowledge and leadership abilities 
      and am excited to have the opportunity to work with her in this new 
      capacity.”
    

      Humana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Ky., is a leading health and 
      well-being company focused on making it easy for people to achieve their 
      best health with clinical excellence through coordinated care. The

NYSE:HUM 







  "We are extremely pleased to have two proven leaders in these critical        positions" 



LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM), one of the nation’s leading health and 
      well-being companies, announced today that it has appointed Cynthia H. 
      Zipperle as Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, 
      effective immediately. Zipperle will report to Senior Vice President and 
      Chief Financial Officer Brian Kane and has responsibility for all 
      accounting functions, the establishment and maintenance of internal 
      accounting controls and enterprise-wide financial reporting to both the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission and state Departments of Insurance.
    

      Zipperle, age 51, has been a part of Humana’s Finance team since joining 
      the company in 1998, with increasing responsibility during her tenure. 
      Prior to joining Humana, she held leadership positions with Aegon 
      (formerly Providian Financial) and Weight Watchers of Kentuckiana after 
      spending the first five years of her career with Coopers & Lybrand (now 
      PricewaterhouseCoopers). Zipperle holds a bachelor’s degree in 
      accounting from Bellarmine University and is a certified public 
      accountant.
    

      Zipperle succeeds Steven E. McCulley, who has been appointed Senior Vice 
      President – Medicare Operations. In his new role, McCulley will have 
      responsibility for multiple operational functions for the company’s 
      senior products business, including actuarial, product development, risk 
      adjustment, prescription drug and Medicare supplement plans and group 
      Medicare business.
    

      “We are extremely pleased to have two proven leaders in these critical 
      positions,” said Bruce D. Broussard, President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of Humana. “We want to ensure our leaders are continually 
      provided opportunities that take advantage of the depth and breadth of 
      their skill sets and broaden the talent pool across the enterprise. Both 
      Cindy and Steve have clearly demonstrated the capabilities needed for 
      these important leadership roles.”
    

      “Steve’s operational depth naturally led to his choice to move into a 
      senior operational role,” said Kane. “His contribution to the Humana 
      Finance area has been unmatched, and I very much look forward to 
      continuing to work with Steve in his new role. I’m also extremely 
      pleased with Cindy’s deep financial knowledge and leadership abilities 
      and am excited to have the opportunity to work with her in this new 
      capacity.”
    

      Humana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Ky., is a leading health and 
      well-being company focused on making it easy for people to achieve their 
      best health with clinical excellence through coordinated care. The 
      company’s strategy integrates care delivery, the member experience, and 
      clinical and consumer insights to encourage engagement, behavior change, 
      proactive clinical outreach and wellness for the millions of people we 
      serve across the country.

LOUISVILLE, Ky.



(Business Wire)  
      Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM), one of the nation’s leading health and 
      well-being companies, announced today that it has appointed Cynthia H. 
      Zipperle as Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, 
      effective immediately. Zipperle will report to Senior Vice President and 
      Chief Financial Officer Brian Kane and has responsibility for all 
      accounting functions, the establishment and maintenance of internal 
      accounting controls and enterprise-wide financial reporting to both the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission and state Departments of Insurance.
    

      Zipperle, age 51, has been a part of Humana’s Finance team since joining 
      the company in 1998, with increasing responsibility during her tenure. 
      Prior to joining Humana, she held leadership positions with Aegon 
      (formerly Providian Financial) and Weight Watchers of Kentuckiana after 
      spending the first five years of her career with Coopers & Lybrand (now 
      PricewaterhouseCoopers). Zipperle holds a bachelor’s degree in 
      accounting from Bellarmine University and is a certified public 
      accountant.
    

      Zipperle succeeds Steven E. McCulley, who has been appointed Senior Vice 
      President – Medicare Operations. In his new role, McCulley will have 
      responsibility for multiple operational functions for the company’s 
      senior products business, including actuarial, product development, risk 
      adjustment, prescription drug and Medicare supplement plans and group 
      Medicare business.
    

      “We are extremely pleased to have two proven leaders in these critical 
      positions,” said Bruce D. Broussard, President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of Humana. “We want to ensure our leaders are continually 
      provided opportunities that take advantage of the depth and breadth of 
      their skill sets and broaden the talent pool across the enterprise. Both 
      Cindy and Steve have clearly demonstrated the capabilities needed for 
      these important leadership roles.”
    

      “Steve’s operational depth naturally led to his choice to move into a 
      senior operational role,” said Kane. “His contribution to the Humana 
      Finance area has been unmatched, and I very much look forward to 
      continuing to work with Steve in his new role. I’m also extremely 
      pleased with Cindy’s deep financial knowledge and leadership abilities 
      and am excited to have the opportunity to work with her in this new 
      capacity.”
    

      Humana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Ky., is a leading health and 
      well-being company focused on making it easy for people to achieve their 
      best health with clinical excellence through coordinated care. The 
      company’s strategy integrates care delivery, the member experience, and
