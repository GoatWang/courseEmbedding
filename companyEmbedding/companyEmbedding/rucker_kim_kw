Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

‹ Previous ArticleNext Article ›× BACK TO GC ARTICLESOrganizing a Legal Department for Success – Kim K.W. Rucker, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Avon Products
At a session of the 2010 chief legal officer leadership forum, Kim K.W. Rucker, of Avon Products, Inc. delivered a speech on the subject of legal organization in the corporate sector moving forward. Rucker began with a brief overview of Avon, its history, its ethos, and its strategy. Avon, she said, was an $11 billion company, and was the world’s single largest seller of beauty products. Avon, she said, took advantage of the direct-sell channel, which helped them to navigate the changing and sometimes negative economic landscape. They sold to 300 million women in over a hundred countries, which made them one of the world’s largest consumer products firms. The firm, she said, had a deceptively complex business model, despite the prevailing opinion that the business dealings of a makeup company must be fairly simple: “We’re creating a thousand new products a year. So lipstick sounds pretty simple until you put it in that complex mix. Let’s go back to the mission of Avon, the company for women, without being politically incorrect the studies will show 1), our fastest growth is in emerging and developing markets, 2) you give a woman a dollar, she invests it in her family, her children, her extended family and her community.” Rucker believed that the high volume of women employed by her firm made it a more successful firm at investing its money, as male investors, she said would only spent money on “women, liquor, and tobacco.”
A big part of the mission of Avon, she said, was to empower women, and her mission as Avon’s chief legal officer was to create as organized and effective a legal system as possible. To this end, Rucker claimed that she reorganize the company as a kind of matrix, which would match a similar grid system used for the business end of the company. Creating a uniform system that was mutually intelligible between the legal and business sides of the company was essential. Next, Rucker said that she made another organized list of where all of the meetings in the firm were held, which quickly dispelled the notion that the firm’s power was at its offices in New York, The power, Rucker said, was in the field, where people were out every day doing the legwork that made the company run. The goal of the legal department, she said, was to create a situation in which the legal team, with their wide variety of expertise, could enable the business end of the firm: “Instill in your lawyers the ability to think and not feel like a cost center but to say that we are a business enabler. We can be a profit center and we are the bus-crash avoider department. What I noticed is that we didn’t have a way of capturing all of those value adds that were happening all over the legal department in translating them to the business case for the business people. So good things would be happening all over the company, all over the world but it was never getting translated and captured.”
