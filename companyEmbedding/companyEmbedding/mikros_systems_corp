ADEPT®

        Adaptive Diagnostic Electronic Portable Testset is an indispensable tool for the maintenance, alignment, calibration, and error diagnosis of complex electronic systems.      


REQUEST A DEMO












        APPLICATIONS
      
			Phased Array Radars
Rotating Radars
Communications Systems    

      ADEPT(V)3 is the latest version of Mikros' Adaptive Diagnostic Electronic Portable Testset, newly redesigned to add expansion capabilities, replace obsolescent components and improve manufacturability. ADEPT Test Automation Workstations are designed to aid technical personnel in the maintenance, alignment, calibration, and error diagnosis of complex electronic systems. Through the structured collection and analysis of test point measurements on an Equipment Under Test (EUT), ADEPT:

helps to detect and troubleshoot error and out-of-alignment conditions
collects and analyzes maintenance data
supports test automation, condition-based maintenance (CBM), distance support and interactive training
improves system readiness and operational performance
reduces manpower support requirements and life cycle support costs
 





      ADEPT eliminates the need for traditional manuals, paper documentation and discrete test equipment and eases the burden on system maintainers by integrating the required test equipment functionality and automating the testing process. All necessary documentation is stored within ADEPT and presented to the user in a familiar format.

When an instruction in a test procedure calls for the use of a specific embedded test instrument, ADEPT opens the instrument control and display window and sets up the instrument for optimal test point measurement. A “known good” reference is presented to the user along with a pass/fail indication. All operations and measurements are stored for after-action analysis, off-line training, and prognostics analysis for proactive remediation of potential error/out of-tolerance conditions.

ADEPT also features Distance Support capabilities, so that local technicians can benefit from interactive assistance by remote experts in real time.    













About the Technology
ADEPT's open architecture is designed to allow easy integration of various documentation types, and currently supports HTML documents as well as the military's Planned Maintenance System (PMS) and Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM). The test equipment interface is easily extensible to virtually any PXI or USB- connected device. The underlying database is designed for easy consolidation of an unlimited number of standalone ADEPT units. All of these technologies combine to make an extremely flexible platform that can be tailored to your specific needs.
Military and Commercial Significance
ADEPT was initially developed under the Navy’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program to streamline maintenance and troubleshooting on the AN/SPY-1 family of phased array radars. ADEPT systems are currently deployed on all Aegis CG and DDG platforms to support the SPY-1. However, since the system uses commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) instrumentation modules, ADEPT variants can be used to support both preventive maintenance (PMS) and condition-based maintenance (CBM) of other radars and complex electronic systems in military or commercial applications.

Mikros Systems Receives Second Navy Contract and Additional Funding for Radar Condition Based Maintenance Project




















June 12, 2017 09:00 ET

 | Source: Mikros Systems Corp.






PRINCETON, N.J., June  12, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mikros Systems Corporation (OTCQB:MKRS) announced today that it has received a second contract from the United States Navy for development of a new upgrade to Mikros’ ADSSS® (ADEPT Distance Support Sensor Suite) product line. The new award increases existing funding from $1.5 million to $2 million. The new variant of the Company’s flagship Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) product will be applied to the Navy’s AN/SPG-62 radar, part of the mission-critical MK 99 Fire Control System.  This will be the first time Mikros CBM technology, first introduced on the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), has been applied to the Navy’s Aegis Weapons System in the surface combatant fleet. Over 300 radars are currently installed on Navy cruisers and destroyers. Mikros develops and manufactures advanced maintenance systems for the Navy, including the ADEPT® (Adaptive Diagnostic Electronic Portable Testset) Maintenance Automation Workstation and ADSSS.  ADSSS is a network-based system which collects maintenance data in real-time to detect and predict failures in complex distributed systems, such as radars and other Navy combat system elements.  Early detection and prediction of faults is critical to maintaining weapons system readiness. In April, Mikros received a $1.5 million contract from the Navy to extend the capabilities of the ADSSS system to support the MK 99. The new award is a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract which provides an additional $500,000 to further support this effort.   “Working with the United States Navy to customize our ADSSS condition based maintenance solution for use on the Aegis surface combatant fleet marks an important milestone for Mikros Systems,” said Henry Silcock, Mikros Chief Technology Officer.  “Extending our product and service offerings to additional combat systems and ship classes is a critical element of our long term strategic plan and this new contract provides an excellent opportunity for us to prove the value of our condition based maintenance system to another ship class.”  Mikros Systems Corporation is an advanced technology company specializing in the development and production of electronic systems technology for advanced maintenance in military, industrial and commercial applications.  Classified by the U.S. Department of Defense as a small business, its capabilities include technology management, electronic systems engineering and integration, radar systems engineering, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence systems engineering, and communications engineering.    For more information on Mikros, please visit: www.mikrossystems.com.  Important Information about Forward-Looking Statements All statements in this news release other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements which contain our current expectations about our future results.

PRINCETON N.J., July  11, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mikros Systems Corporation (OTCBB:MKRS) announced today that HP Indigo Division has renewed its software support contract for Mikros’ Diagnostic Profiler software for the fifth consecutive year. Mikros supplies two software products, Prognostics Framework® and Diagnostic Profiler®, to several commercial customers for Condition Based Maintenance in various industrial applications. These software products generate recurring revenues when customers renew their software maintenance support contracts on a yearly basis.  Recently, Hewlett Packard Indigo Division, which manufactures large printing presses, has renewed their software license for Mikros Diagnostic Profiler for the fifth year running. Mikros is also working with HP to design new software upgrades to the system.  HP Indigo uses Mikros Diagnostic Profiler to detect errors and maximize system up-time on their printing presses at over 100 installations. HP’s Dan Koran commented: “HP Indigo Division has been partnered with Mikros on an ongoing contract for five years to provide HP an efficient and effective diagnostician tool for our advanced printing presses. Both companies have had a great relationship and continue to work together. We look forward to continuing the working relationship and other endeavors.” Tom Meaney, Mikros President and CEO stated that, “First, these orders represent a major vote of confidence from our commercial customers.  Second, they indicate that there is significant potential for recurring revenue streams and lasting relationships as we support both hardware and software products in real world applications for commercial customers.  We thank our current customers for their continuing support, and believe that life-cycle support of our product lines will continue to be a successful and profitable enterprise.” Mikros Systems Corporation is an advanced technology company specializing in the development and production of electronic systems technology for advanced maintenance in military, industrial and commercial applications.  Classified by the U.S. Department of Defense as a small business, its capabilities include technology management, electronic systems engineering and integration, radar systems engineering, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence systems engineering, and communications engineering.  For more information on Mikros, please visit: www.mikrossystems.com.Important Information about Forward-Looking Statements All statements in this news release other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements which contain our current expectations about our future results.
