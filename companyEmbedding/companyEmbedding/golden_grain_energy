The company currently produces approximately 115 million gallons of ethanol annually at a plant in Mason City, Iowa. Owned by more than 900 members, the majority of who are Iowa farmers, Golden Grain Energy is committed to being a strong partner in the local community, a key player in the regional economy and a leader in Iowa’s ethanol industry. We employ 48 individuals in rewarding professional careers and purchase approximately 42 million bushels of corn annually from producers and grain dealers. In addition to ethanol, Golden Grain Energy produces distiller’s grains and non-food grade corn oil, providing a feed source for local livestock producers or the Biodiesel Industry.
Golden Grain Energy strives to help meet the growing national demand for domestic biofuels, which are the key components of our nation’s efforts to reduce reliance on foreign oil and improve air quality around the country.

Golden Grain Energy, L.L.C. Unit Bulletin Board
This bulletin board allows you to post your interest in buying or selling the units of Golden Grain Energy, L.L.C. (the “Company”).
Information posted on the bulletin board will help you identify persons who have an interest in selling units of the Company’s membership interest that you want to buy, or in buying units you may be willing to sell.
Minimum Transfer:  There is a minimum unit transfer limitation of one thousand (1,000) units in any one transaction.  Transferors may not transfer less than 1,000 units without permission from the GGE board of directors.  Any Transferor who wishes to transfer less than 1,000 units in any one transaction must first obtain the permission of the GGE board of directors by contacting the board of directors in writing at the address listed above.  The minimum transfer limitation applies to all types of transfers except involuntary transfers by operation of law.
Here are the steps required for interested parties to sell or buy units:


The buyer and seller agree on the terms of the transaction – the number of shares involved and the price.

The seller completes the “Assignment” section on the back of the unit certificate(s).
The seller sends the completed certificate(s) and the Unit Transfer Application to the Company.
Authorized members of the Company’s board of directors approve the transfer if required.
The Company issues a new certificate (more than one, if the buyer is retaining some of the units represented by the old certificate).  New certificates are mailed to the appropriate parties once Golden Grain Energy receives notice that the transfer has closed.

Recipient of 2005 USDA Value Added Producer grant.

Continued Innovation Drives Iowa’s Golden Grain Energy
When Golden Grain Energy (GGE) LLC began its trek into building an ethanol production facility, the industry was just gaining steam. That was in 2002. 

With State of Iowa assistance through its Value Added Agriculture Products and Processes Financial Assistance Program (VAAPFAP) and because the facility would be part of an enterprise zone, the Mason City area’s entrepreneurs constructed the fifth ethanol plant in the state and the first in north central Iowa. 

Production began in December 2004. In 2005, a Value Added Producer Grant (VAPG) award of $150,000 helped GGE purchase some of the 16 million bushels of corn needed for the 40 million gallon facility and “added value to corn for its members,” according to the USDA.
 
“It was a risk,” Walt Wendland, President and CEO of GGE, said of those early years. He remembers that initial investment period with a small chuckle. “We were told we needed to encourage people to invest enough that it will make a difference in their lives. Many were small investments at $10,000 and wouldn’t make much difference. Some at $100,000 knew it would make a difference.” For all investors, it has paid off. 

Fagen Inc., from Granite Falls, Minnesota, and ICM from Colwich, Kansas, were hired to design and build the plant. Fagen will continue to handle future building projects. “These companies were very supportive early in this venture by agreeing not to exceed the prices they gave. ICM and Fagen probably construct 65 to 75 percent of the dry ethanol plants,” said Wendland.

This year the company is putting out over 100 million gallon. GGE also sells the by-product dried distillers grains (DDGS) to national and international markets and markets the wet distillers grains locally. 

Now there are 29 ethanol plants in Iowa, accounting for more than 30 percent of U.S. ethanol production, according to the state’s Iowa Caucus 2008 website. Yet GGE has steadily grown and, by aligning with new technologies in renewable fuels, is looking at expanding further with new products.

The original ethanol plant was a $60 million venture. A plant expansion in 2007 cost $54 million. “We are leaving our footprint in the industry,” Wendland noted. 

That footprint, he explained, means having a large, positive influence on Iowa agriculture and farms by making use of 40 million bushels of area corn that once was exported. “Corn is staying here and adding jobs. We’ve brought some real qualified local people back to Mason City.” The plant currently employs 44 people.

Stability to farmers is also part of the footprint. Wendland recalled the period following the 1980s, when farmers were carrying over large amounts of grain and the price was influenced largely by foreign markets. He said GGE has helped create a more stable market for grain in the region. Farmers have done well since supply and demand have come into balance. An added benefit, “Young people are excited about agriculture again.” 

Up to this point, Wendland said his company has been able to manage well. But new challenges are on the horizon. Among those:

Risk management, which is becoming a critical factor in the ethanol industry. Profitability can come and go on a daily basis in renewable fuels.
Increased competition. Wendland said his company has less debt and better infrastructure than many plants of comparable size. This helps GGE to be a low-cost producer.
An ethanol production stream that has outpaced demand. He noted that GGE is at an advantage by having a strong balance sheet.

He predicted that newer startups will face a more difficult time, in part because lenders may feel the “appetite for these renewable fuels has been satisfied.” He said he knows of five anticipated ethanol plants in the area that recently failed to achieve financing. 

Yet Wendland is comfortable with the industry and said his company can ride out the waves as it continues to look at new opportunities in the renewable fuels industry. He envisions ways to continue to expand on the solid infrastructure of GGE and develop new opportunities by integrating new technologies.

“It is all part of becoming a major biorefinery rather than just an ethanol plant,” he said. “We are always looking ahead and studying new ventures.” For example, along with Alliant Energy, GGE is keeping watch over development of microwavable distillers grain drying.
