Who We Are

Rogue Disposal Company History and Important Facts
We’re more than just your waste management company; we’ve been your neighbor, providing innovative solid waste and recycling services for over 73 years.
Rogue Disposal & Recycling Inc. co-founders Tony Boitano and Charles Bottjer in front of a 1950 white open top truck with a 14-cubic-yard panel body.
Rogue Disposal has been a part of the community since 1938 — founded by Anthony Boitano, grandfather of present CEO, Stephen Gambee.
We have over 40 drivers on route providing solid waste and recycling collection for residential, commercial, and industrial customers, as well as providing medical waste collection and on-site confidential document destruction.
80 percent of our customers also utilize commingle recycling service and 36% subscribe to curbside yard debris recycling service. Each year, our operation collects approximately 33,000 tons annually.  Commingling and yard debris recycling have allowed us to double our recycling volume.
Rogue Disposal & Recycling coordinates and co-sponsors the Household Hazardous Waste event each spring (2013 was our 22nd annual event). The two-day drop-off event collects and safely disposes of around 60,000 pounds of hazardous waste.
Rogue Transfer & Recycling Facts
Located at 8001 Table Rock Road, the transfer station opened to the public in January of 1999. The facility processes 200 to 600 customers each day of operation with an average of 233 tons per day transferred to Dry Creek Landfill. The recycle depot accepts 17 different items, including yard debris, which was added in July, 2001. In August of 2005 our pay station/Table Rock Coffee Company opened.
Rogue Material Recovery Facts

Started processing recyclables at this facility in 1998. Materials are stored, loaded and shipped to processors.
Residential and commercial commingle—30 tons per day
Commercial newsprint and magazines—25 tons per week
Commercial corrugated cardboard—120 tons per week

Landfill Facts
Dry Creek Landfill opened in 1974. In 1998 the unlined portion of the landfill was closed and covered. Prior to that, construction began on cell #2, a fully lined facility with an engineering design that exceeds restrictive environmental standards imposed by the U.S. EPA. All necessary permits were obtained to accept municipal solid waste.
The liner system includes layers of 60-mil-thick textured HDPE material, low permeability soil and a leachate (rain water that filters through the trash) collection and removal system. Each lined cell has approximately three years capacity and costs approximately $380,000 per acre. When a cell has reached capacity, it is covered with a system similar to the liner and costs approximately $350,000 per acre to close. The landfill has an active methane gas collection and control system in place and we have opened the landfill gas-to-energy facility.
Dry Creek Landfill’s projected operational life exceeds 100 years under any scenario.
Dry Creek Landfill is a regional facility and is currently accepting waste from five different counties. On average, Dry Creek Landfill accepts 900 tons of solid waste per day.
ROGUE Compost Site Facts
The compost site was permitted in 2002. Compost volume has increased from 3000 to over 15,000 tons in 2012. The end product is tested quarterly and has consistently received the Seal of Testing Assurance by the U.S. Compost Council and is approved for use in organic gardens and farms by the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI). Rogue premium compost is sold by the bag at Rogue Transfer & Recycling. It is made from a recycled all-natural blend of leaves, grass, natural vegetation, plant prunnings, brush and woody material—entirely of recycled yard debris from the Rogue Valley.

 NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- Which insiders are selling and buying chunks of stocks?  Below are lists of the top 10 open-market insider purchases and sales filed at the Securities and Exchange Commission Monday as ranked by dollar value. Company executives and directors are in the best position to assess the attractiveness of their firms' shares, and here is how many of them are voting their wallets!
