At Solovis, we recognize our employees by personally investing in them and providing a rewarding corporate culture centered around growth, training, and an opportunity to shape the future of our product.
The Position
We’re looking for several Operations Analysts to help fill out our team in both our Charlottesville and Dallas locations. Operations Analysts have the opportunity to join a newly formed group responsible for providing Solovis clients with ongoing support related to data and reporting. This new service evolved out of an increasing number of requests from clients who loved the output of the Solovis application, but did not have the internal staffing expertise to handle the relevant inputs. Job duties focus on interpreting and normalizing data, providing back-office services, and leading ongoing data support for a client post-implementation. Additional duties include:

Tracking direct investments, SMA’s and brokerage account holdings.
Assist with loading additional data sets to support client reporting and dashboard creation.
Develop new business processes with clients to streamline data aggregation and loading.

You’ll start by going through a “boot camp” where you’ll learn about our software and the investment industry. Then you’ll spend your days working in spreadsheets and client portals so you need to be the kind of person who takes pride in receiving and reviewing large datasets and then re-organizing them to produce a neat, accurate portfolio model in our system.
People who love this job:

Love details
Are at ease with numbers
Enjoy data analysis and can identify information by categorizing, estimating, reorganizing differences or similarities, and detecting changes in circumstances or events
Quickly become familiar with investment reporting including back office / accounting and front office / performance, exposure, liquidity, etc.

Are comfortable working on their own or in a team environment
Want a job where they can learn new things every day
Live in or are willing to relocate themselves to Charlottesville, VA or Dallas, TX.

Operations Analysts

Up to two years of experience, a related degree, may have had an internship in a related business like an endowment or investment manager.
Strong interpersonal skills, be self-motivated, have a strong desire to learn, and be adaptable to a fast paced, ever-changing environment

Senior Operations Analysts

The attributes listed above for the Analyst.
Two or more years’ relevant job experience or academic experiences working with large data sets (in disciplines for which extreme attention to detail and problem solving is critical.)

Solovis is a revolutionary new SaaS platform offering a multi-asset class portfolio management and reporting solution for foundations, endowments, pensions, OCIOs, and family offices. Our firm is on a mission to set a new industry standard for performance, exposure, and portfolio analysis. The key to that success is to continue disrupting the industry with transformational technology designed specifically for limited partners. Since our co-founders started the company in 2013, Solovis has grown from a two-man operation to more than 40 employees with offices in Charlottesville, VA and Dallas, TX. And we’re not done growing yet. We expect to add at least 20 more new employees this year. At Solovis, we recognize our employees by personally investing in them and providing a rewarding corporate culture centered around growth, training, and an opportunity to shape the future of our product.
The Position
We’re looking for several Data Analysts to help fill out our team in both our Charlottesville and Dallas locations. Data Analysts make up a critical component of our client implementation team, as Solovis clients need good historical data in order to maximize the power of the Solovis platform.  Our Data Analysts embrace the challenge of analyzing, interpreting, transforming and loading large data-sets. They are responsible for complex data analysis and problem solving, project organization and documentation, and client support and training. Additional duties include:

Managing multiple projects, responsibilities and competing priorities.
Creating and maintaining comprehensive project documentation.


Participating in weekly client meetings.
Presenting data findings and working with other members of the Implementation team to identify and implement strategies that will address tactical and strategic client goals.
Analyzing and communicating client’s business and reporting requirements.
Assisting with client reporting and dashboard creation.

You’ll start by going through a “boot camp” where you’ll learn about our software and the investment industry. Then you’ll spend your days working in spreadsheets; extracting, segmenting, and interpreting financial data. You need to be the kind of person who takes pride in receiving a large mass of messy data and producing a neat, accurate portfolio model in our system.
People who love this job:

Love details.
Are at ease with numbers.
Quickly become familiar with investment reporting including back office / accounting and front office / performance, exposure, liquidity, etc.


Are forward-thinking and able to identify gaps in requests and how that may impact future decisions.

Can apply industry knowledge to data problems.
Learn quickly and thrive in a fast-faced environment.
Are disciplined and creative enough to follow a checklist without being constrained by it.
Are comfortable working on their own or in a group setting.
Want a job where they can learn new things every day.
Live in or are willing to relocate themselves to Charlottesville, VA or Dallas, TX.

Up to three years of experience.
May have had an internship in a related business like an endowment or investment manager.
Strong interpersonal skills, be self-motivated, have a strong desire to learn, and be adaptable to a fast paced, ever-changing environment.
Strong Excel skills (there will be a test!)
