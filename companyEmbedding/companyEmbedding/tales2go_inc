Listening to books read by storytellers and actors serves as a model for how to read fluently and with expression. Tales2Go has also allowed struggling readers to access higher level texts in their reading classes. Students also improve their sight word vocabulary and comprehension when they listen to an audio book while following along in the print version of the book. Tales2Go has motivated students to read more and has helped students develop positive attitudes about reading."  Cathy Potter, School Librarian, Falmouth, ME- "Very Useful.  I am a teacher and use this with my 4th Grade students.  They love the variety of stories."  jonathanwylie- "A Mom Must-Have! My two boys (ages 7 and 9) love this app! We listen in the car as we travel, during dinner and before bed. Both the boys and I like the vast variety of stories to choose from and the fact it is so user-friendly" CuteBoyMom- Tales2Go is a fantastic resource for Homeschool families. We love listening eveywhere, kitchen table, car and even in bed before bedtime. Love tales2go."  R. Nichol- "LOVE this app!  As a special education teacher I really appreciate the ability to access audio books/stories for students.  As a person I really love the flexibility to listen to books while I work, drive, and relax.  This is a fantastic app."  Jeubank- "Great app!  My whole family and I listened to Encylopedia Brown in the car today (what a blast from the past) and it worked perfectly.  Lots of great content for all ages... I definitely recommend giving it a shot." whitemencantjumpSubscriptions Options:1 Month Subscription for $9.99, automatically renewed until cancelled.1 Year Subscription for $99.99, does not automatically renew.SUBSCRIBERS' AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FEATURE: For all automatic renewal subscriptions, your credit card will be charged every month for another month's subscription until you change your preferences in your account settings.

Great selection of stories, poor execution

    We love the choices of stories, but there is one major flaw. The app does not save your spot in the book if the app is closed. There is an option to place a bookmark, but if the device is accidentally shut off or if the battery dies, (or if you forget to remove the last book mark and place a new one) your spot in the story is lost. Plus, every time you open the app, you have to find your story and then find your place. It doesn't even have a "currently playing" section. My kids and I find this really frustrating. This seems like it could be easily fixed. Other audiobook apps have this feature.

Why is exposure to sophisticated spoken words so important?




Oral language drives vocabulary acquisition and retention, which is a key component of reading proficiency. Yet most students lack repeated exposure to sophisticated spoken words. As a result, most students do not have a large enough vocabulary to be proficient readers, which explains why nearly two-thirds of all U.S. 4th graders struggle with reading.


 






 

























How Tales2go can help.
Tales2go makes it easy and cost-effective to surround students with spoken sophisticated words, in school and at home, by streaming over six thousand audio book titles from leading publishers to school-owned andÂ BYOD devices. Students love listening to a good story, well told by a professional narrator.
Tales2go is used as a literacy tool to develop vocabulary, fluency and comprehension skills in a growing number of schools and districts across the U.S., including Los Angeles USD, Broward County Public Schools, Berkeley USD and Heartland AEA. Tales2go can also be purchased by individual families.
