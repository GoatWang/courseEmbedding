Equal Sector Strategy Investing -  An Equal Sector Strategy is a strategy that delivers exposure to the US Large Cap Equity market by investing equal proportions in sectors of S&P 500.  


 









Performance is historical and does not guarantee future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment returns/principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Most recent month-end performance is available in the Performance topic. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Sector SPDRs are subject to risk similar to those of stocks including those regarding short selling and margin account maintenance. All ETFs are subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. Sector ETF products are also subject to sector risk and non-diversified risk, which will result in greater price fluctuations than the overall market.
The charts are standard price and volume charts. Volume on the horizontal axis with volume in green on up days (periods of time) and in red on down days (periods of time). Price movement can be found on the vertical axis.
Market price returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times.

As of June 24, 2002 the Select Sector SPDR Trust instituted the following changes: The Basic Industries Select Sector SPDR Fund changed its name to the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund. The Consumer Services Select Sector SPDR Fund changed its name to the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund. The Cyclical/Transportation Select Sector SPDR Fund changed its name to the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund.
Select Sector SPDR shareholders are subject to risks similar to those of holders of other sector stock portfolios. One primary consideration is that the general level of stock prices may decline, and thus the value of Select Sector SPDRs may decline. A Select Sector SPDR also may be adversely affected by the performance of the specific sector or group of industries upon which it is based. You can expect that shares in a Select Sector SPDR will move up or down in value with the value of its related Select Sector Index. In addition, the overall depth and liquidity of the secondary market in these shares may fluctuate.
Although Select Sector SPDRs are designed to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield performance of their related Select Sector Indexes, the Funds of The Select Sector SPDR Trust may not be able to exactly replicate the performance of the Select Sector Indexes because of expenses and other factors.
Over time, the stock holdings of each Select Sector SPDR may be rebalanced to reflect changes in the composition of its related index. A Select Sector SPDR would incur transaction costs and other expenses as a result of rebalancing. Furthermore, a Select Sector SPDR would realize capital gains or losses from the sale of securities in a rebalancing.
Net long-term capital gains, if any, will be distributed to shareholders as capital gains distributions at least annually.
From a tax standpoint, you should be aware that the Select Sector SPDR Trust is structured as a regulated investment company, and that dividend distributions may not be characterized entirely as ordinary income. You may wish to consult your tax advisor in this regard.

                    Purchase XLU
                










The Select Sector SPDR Utilities (XLU) can be bought or sold throughout the trading day on the NYSE Arca and trade just like shares of stock. Orders are entered in the share amount you wish to purchase (or sell) using the trading symbol.
A single Select Sector SPDR share represents ownership in one of ten portfolios of The Select Sector SPDR Trust. Just as a typical round lot for stock is 100 shares, a round lot for a Select Sector SPDR is 100 shares. Select Sector SPDR trade in round lots as well as odd (i.e., less than 100).
Select Sector SPDR pricing is continuous during market trading hours. You will always be able to obtain up-to-the-minute share prices from your Financial Advisor.



About This Fund

        The Utilities Index primarily provides companies that produce, generate, transmit or distribute electricity or natural gas. The component companies include Exelon Corp., Southern Co., and Dominion Resources Inc.

Performance is historical and does not guarantee future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment returns/principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Most recent month-end performance is available in the Performance topic. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Sector SPDRs are subject to risk similar to those of stocks including those regarding short selling and margin account maintenance. All ETFs are subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. Sector ETF products are also subject to sector risk and non-diversified risk, which will result in greater price fluctuations than the overall market.
The charts are standard price and volume charts. Volume on the horizontal axis with volume in green on up days (periods of time) and in red on down days (periods of time). Price movement can be found on the vertical axis.
Market price returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times.

We will not transfer your personal information to any non-Select Sector SPDR entity for commercial purposes. If you provide your e-mail address, you may receive e-mail from us.

As of June 24, 2002 the Select Sector SPDR Trust instituted the following changes: The Basic Industries Select Sector SPDR Fund changed its name to the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund. The Consumer Services Select Sector SPDR Fund changed its name to the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund. The Cyclical/Transportation Select Sector SPDR Fund changed its name to the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund.
Select Sector SPDR shareholders are subject to risks similar to those of holders of other sector stock portfolios. One primary consideration is that the general level of stock prices may decline, and thus the value of Select Sector SPDRs may decline. A Select Sector SPDR also may be adversely affected by the performance of the specific sector or group of industries upon which it is based. You can expect that shares in a Select Sector SPDR will move up or down in value with the value of its related Select Sector Index. In addition, the overall depth and liquidity of the secondary market in these shares may fluctuate.
Although Select Sector SPDRs are designed to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield performance of their related Select Sector Indexes, the Funds of The Select Sector SPDR Trust may not be able to exactly replicate the performance of the Select Sector Indexes because of expenses and other factors.
Over time, the stock holdings of each Select Sector SPDR may be rebalanced to reflect changes in the composition of its related index. A Select Sector SPDR would incur transaction costs and other expenses as a result of rebalancing. Furthermore, a Select Sector SPDR would realize capital gains or losses from the sale of securities in a rebalancing.
Net long-term capital gains, if any, will be distributed to shareholders as capital gains distributions at least annually.
From a tax standpoint, you should be aware that the Select Sector SPDR Trust is structured as a regulated investment company, and that dividend distributions may not be characterized entirely as ordinary income. You may wish to consult your tax advisor in this regard.

Sector SPDRs are subject to risk similar to those of stocks including those regarding short selling and margin account maintenance. All ETFs are subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. Sector ETF products are also subject to sector risk and non-diversified risk, which will result in greater price fluctuations than the overall market.

As of June 24, 2002 the Select Sector SPDR Trust instituted the following changes: The Basic Industries Select Sector SPDR Fund changed its name to the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund. The Consumer Services Select Sector SPDR Fund changed its name to the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund. The Cyclical/Transportation Select Sector SPDR Fund changed its name to the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund.
Select Sector SPDR shareholders are subject to risks similar to those of holders of other sector stock portfolios. One primary consideration is that the general level of stock prices may decline, and thus the value of Select Sector SPDRs may decline. A Select Sector SPDR also may be adversely affected by the performance of the specific sector or group of industries upon which it is based. You can expect that shares in a Select Sector SPDR will move up or down in value with the value of its related Select Sector Index. In addition, the overall depth and liquidity of the secondary market in these shares may fluctuate.
Although Select Sector SPDRs are designed to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield performance of their related Select Sector Indexes, the Funds of The Select Sector SPDR Trust may not be able to exactly replicate the performance of the Select Sector Indexes because of expenses and other factors.
Over time, the stock holdings of each Select Sector SPDR may be rebalanced to reflect changes in the composition of its related index. A Select Sector SPDR would incur transaction costs and other expenses as a result of rebalancing. Furthermore, a Select Sector SPDR would realize capital gains or losses from the sale of securities in a rebalancing.
Net long-term capital gains, if any, will be distributed to shareholders as capital gains distributions at least annually.
From a tax standpoint, you should be aware that the Select Sector SPDR Trust is structured as a regulated investment company, and that dividend distributions may not be characterized entirely as ordinary income. You may wish to consult your tax advisor in this regard.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index (DJSHMBT) measures U.S companies in the home construction sector that provide a wide range of products and services related to homebuilding, including home construction and producers, sellers and suppliers of building materials, furnishings and fixtures and also home improvement retailers. The Index may include large-, mid- or small-capitalization companies. One cannot directly invest in an Index. bi>

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
