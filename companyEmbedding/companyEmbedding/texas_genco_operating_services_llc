We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting
underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately
$       million, or approximately $       million if the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional shares in full. Texas Genco Inc. will use
the proceeds from this offering to purchase       newly issued membership units
from Texas Genco Holdings LLC, or       membership units if the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full. We intend to use
all of these net proceeds, including any net proceeds received upon the exercise
by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares, to pay
special distributions to our existing equityholders.


The ERCOT market is highly competitive. We have approximately 80
competitors that include generation companies affiliated with Texas-based
utilities, independent power producers, municipal and co-operative generators,
owners of co-generation plants and wholesale power marketers. We are an
independent power producer, which means that we generate power. Generation
companies affiliated with utilities are power producers that are affiliated with
utilities. Municipal and co-operative generators also generate power but use
most of it to deliver power to their municipal or co-operative power customers.
Owners of co-generation plants produce power primarily for their own
consumption. Wholesale power marketers do not own generation; rather they buy
power from generators or other market participants and resell it to retail
providers or other market participants. These competitors compete with each
other and us by buying and selling wholesale power in the ERCOT market, entering
into bilateral contracts and/or selling to aggregated retail customers.

     Competition in the ERCOT market is affected by, among other factors, the
amount of generation and transmission capacity in the market. As of
September 30, 2004, our plants, including our share of STP, provided
approximately 14% of the aggregate net generation capacity serving the ERCOT
market. According to ERCOT, the independent system operator for the electric
market that services 85% of the electric demand in Texas, we are the
second-largest generation company within the ERCOT market and the largest owner
of power plants in the ERCOT market's Houston Zone based on total capacity. We
participate in three zones in the ERCOT market, which we believe benefits our
solid-fuel baseload plants and is a source of competitive advantage for our
business. Our competition is based primarily on price but we also may compete
based on product flexibility. Product flexibility means, for example, that
rather than selling power for delivery 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a
year, we can shape the product for a customer's needs, such as selling power for
delivery only during the peak hours of consumption. Our gas-fired units allow us
to design and sell products for customers who have an obligation to meet load
and need to shape their power purchase to match their load as it increases and
decreases. The ERCOT market has had a very significant period of development  
of new power plants since January 2000 and hence currently has reserve margins 
that have exceeded 25% according to information published by ERCOT. Most of 
these plants were new combined cycle natural gas-fired plants and have not 
affected the dispatch of our solid-fuel baseload plants. We do not expect the 
growth of the generation supply in the ERCOT market to continue at the rate it 
has since 2000. According to data published by the Public Utility Commission 
of Texas, 2004 was the last year expected to see such growth, with about 2,500 
MW added last year, and approximately 33% of previously announced new generation 
capacity, equivalent to 17,801 MW, has been canceled or postponed since 2001.


Company Description
We are a wholesale electric power generation company engaged in the
ownership and operation of a diverse portfolio of power plants in the state of
Texas. According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the independent
system operator for the electric market that services 85% of the electric


 demand
in Texas, we are the second-largest generation company within that market and
the largest owner of power plants in the Houston zone of that market based on
total generation capacity. We sell power and related products to wholesale
purchasers such as retail electric providers, power trading organizations,
municipal utilities, electric power co-operatives and other power generation
companies.

     We currently own 48 operating generation units at nine power generation
plants, including an undivided 44.0% interest in two nuclear generation units at
South Texas Project Electric Generating Station. Our generation plants are
diversified across fuel sources, technology and geographic regions within the
Electric Reliability Council of Texas market. The substantial majority of our
revenues and cash flows are realized from the sale of power from eight units at
our three solid fuel (coal, lignite and uranium) power plants - W. A. Parish,
Limestone and South Texas Project Electric Generating Station. Because
generation units are generally dispatched in order of lowest cost and
approximately 73% of the net generation capacity in our market is from
higher-cost natural gas-fired units, we expect these eight baseload units to
operate nearly 100% of the time they are available.

     Our management team has implemented a strategy of creating a stable base of
operating cash flows through a combination of forward fixed price power sales,
natural gas price swap agreements (which have the effect of hedging the price we
would receive for additional future power sales and therefore our revenues), and
forward solid fuel and fuel transportation purchases. As of August 19, 2005, we
had hedged the price we will receive for approximately 82% of the power that we
expect to generate at our solid-fuel baseload units from 2005 through
2009-including 74% under fixed price power sales contracts and 8% using natural
gas price swap agreements. These forward power sales and natural gas price swap
agreements, combined with sales and price swaps in 2010, represent approximately
$7.5 billion in total future revenues. In addition, we had contracted to
purchase at future dates under fixed price contracts (with
contractually-specified price adjustments) enough solid fuel to provide for
approximately 83% of our expected generation from our solid-fuel baseload plants
from 2005 through 2009.

     We believe that the stable cash flows generated by this combination of
forward power sales and natural gas price swap agreements and forward solid fuel
and fuel transportation purchases create a strong platform for growth in our
equity value, initially through reducing the level of debt in our capital
structure and ultimately through additions to our generation business in Texas
and expansion into other attractive markets. In addition, our portfolio of
natural gas-fired units that serve the Houston market provides opportunities for
us to capture additional revenues through offering capacity or similar products
to retail electric providers and others, selling power at prevailing market
prices during periods of peak demand and providing ancillary services in support
of system reliability.

     As of June 30, 2005, the aggregate net generation capacity of our portfolio
of operating assets was 10,939 MW, of which 5,220 MW represented the generation
capacity of our solid-fuel baseload plants. Our three low-cost and efficient
solid-fuel baseload plants produced 84% of our total megawatt hours sold for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2005, giving pro forma effect to the acquisitions
of our generation plants (including our acquisition of an additional 13.2%
undivided interest in South Texas Project Electric Generating Station) and generated 
a substantial majority of our revenues and cash flow. See "Business-Our Generation
Plants" for more information about our portfolio of generation plants. For the
twelve months ended June 30, 2005, giving pro forma effect to the acquisitions
of our generation plants (other than our acquisition of an additional 13.2%
undivided interest in South Texas Project Electric Generating Station, which is
accounted for as an asset acquisition and therefore is not included in the pro
forma statement of operations) and the related financings, and to the corporate
reorganization we will undertake in connection with this offering as if these
transactions had occurred on July 1, 2004, we had revenues of $2,347.8 million,
income before minority interest of $       and net income of $       . 
Recent Initiatives

     Since we signed definitive documentation in July 2004 to acquire Texas
Genco Holdings, Inc. from CenterPoint Energy, Inc. our new management team has
undertaken a variety of initiatives to materially enhance the value of our
business, including:

        º executing new forward power sales and natural gas price swap
          agreements at attractive prices that we expect will generate an
          additional $6.1 billion of revenues through 2010;

        º implementing initiatives that we expect will reduce annual operation
          and maintenance expenses after fiscal 2005 by approximately
          $130 million as compared to our pro forma operation and maintenance
          expenses of $529 million, which includes approximately $30 million of
          annual expenses for our additional 13.2% ownership interest in the
          South Texas Project Electric Generating Station acquired May 19, 2005,
          for the twelve months ended June 30, 2005, through a reduction in the
          workforce, the assumption of services previously provided by
          CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and Reliant Energy, Inc., the elimination of
          one-time restructuring costs and the suspension of operations of
          uneconomic natural gas-fired units;

        º effecting the acquisition, funded from cash on the balance sheet, of
          an additional 338 MW of ownership interest in South Texas Project
          Electric Generating Station; and

        º selling non-core assets.
