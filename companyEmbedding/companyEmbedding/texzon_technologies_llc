Technology
The Texzon Wireless Power™ system represents a paradigm shift in the science of electromagnetics.






WHAT IT IS
Our Texzon Wireless Power™ system allows the Earth itself to be used for clean, safe and efficient transfer of power between any two points on the globe, wirelessly. The system represents a paradigm shift in the science of electromagnetics.
Today’s power distribution system of wired grids is fragile and aging.  The transition to a global wireless system utilizing the Zenneck surface wave is a breakthrough that will effectively “cut the cord” between power generation facilities and the local distribution grids.  This breakthrough will significantly enhance energy surety, reliability, and resiliency of the world’s electrical distribution systems.
HOW IT WORKS
Texzon Technologies has developed a system of patent-pending processes and equipment to efficiently launch the Zenneck surface wave. Currently, our research and commercialization efforts are focused on energy transfer and communications, but we recognize that this technology has the potential to impact numerous sectors of the economy.
A Zenneck Surface Wave is an electromagnetic wave that uses the surface of the earth as a waveguide enabling it to carry communications signals or electrical power efficiently over long distances.
This wireless power system will employ a “transmitter probe,” located near a power generation plant, to launch a Zenneck carrier wave.  Receiver antennae will be positioned appropriately around the world to receive the signal and download the power into a local microgrid or conventional grid architecture.
The wave is impervious to weather effects such as lightning or geomagnetic disturbance or electromagnetic pulses (EMP), including those associated with a nuclear detonation.  Unlike a wired grid, the Zenneck wave cannot be physically attacked and cyber attacks would be challenged to target or cause cascading failures to a wireless system.
When launched, the Zenneck Surface Wave literally envelops the planet like a balloon, enabling transmitter probes to be placed anywhere power can be generated and receivers to be placed anywhere power is needed.
THE HISTORY OF THE ZENNECK SURFACE WAVE
Jonathan Zenneck (1871-1959) was one of the first known scientists to study electromagnetic wave propagation over the surface of the earth. With Zenneck surface waves, electrical power is directed along the earth’s surface, in much the same way that electrical power is directed through conventional transmission lines using electromagnetic waves. In the early years of the twentieth century, two theories of electromagnetic wave theory co-existed:  classic Hertzian radiated waves (ground waves) which are transmitted via conventional antennae on a line of sight path and dissipate over a distance into space.  And Zenneck Surface Waves which use the surface of the earth as a waveguide and travel at high levels of efficiency but had yet to be experimentally observed. Our technology uses only surface waves (guided surface waves), and not ground waves (radiated waves).
SAFE AND SECURE
When the power industry looks at safety, they focus on two key factors: the potential for shock, and the local RF field strengths. Texzon Wireless Power™ systems meet the most stringent standards for both.
Shock Hazard
Zenneck Surface Waves don’t deliver a shock for the same reason radio station signals don’t shock you. To create a shock, there must be a difference in voltage (or potential difference) between two points to overcome the resistance inherent in the material between the points. Your head and feet are a good example. Due to the low field strengths created by Texzon Wireless Power™ systems (much like broadcast radio or television), the voltage potential between them is not enough to create a shock hazard. In contrast, when you touch an electrical wire, the voltage potential between the wire and your feet can be extremely high, meaning current will flow and energy will be dissipated through you. This is why great care should always be used when working on traditional electrical wiring. Only through the use of precisely designed receivers can energy be transferred through Zenneck surface waves.
Field Intensity

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) have strict guidelines for RF exposure levels. These standards have been in place for decades. Those limits are more than ten times what will be produced by commercial Texzon Wireless Power™ systems.
COMMERCIALIZATION AND PATENTS
Texzon Technologies has over 60 U.S. patents pending and 20+ international patents pending for this wireless technology. Additional patent applications are in development and more are expected.

60+ US Patents filed to-date (Wireless Power & Communications).
19+ International Patents filed to-date.
1st Set of Enabling Patents (Transmit/Receive) filed in 97 Countries.

Uses - Texzon Texzon































Uses







The Texzon Wireless Power™ system will improve the quality of life for people everywhere by enabling the delivery of affordable electricity throughout the world. Below are some initial applications; we expect the list to grow along with the technology.
Electricity Distribution
Our technology will enable true global access to electricity, particularly benefiting the 1.7 billion people who still don’t have it. Clean, safe, reliable, and affordable wireless power systems will remedy this, enabling necessities like hot meals, advanced medical treatment, and pure drinking water for people in the developing world. Electricity is the foundation for realizing growth and prosperity in the developing world, and introducing it to communities without electricity would help boost economies around the world.
Disaster Relief
What if affected communities had access to electricity immediately after Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, the earthquakes in Haiti and Japan, and the tsunamis in Thailand and Sumatra? Thousands of lives could have been saved. Our technology will allow for electricity to be delivered immediately to disaster areas, transforming the scope and efficiency of relief efforts.
Industrial Power
Reliable electricity is the lifeblood of the global economy. The Texzon Wireless Power™ system will connect the world’s energy resources with those who need them with a fraction of the environmental impact of current technologies. In the case of renewable energy, prime locations for generation are often not in close enough proximity to the end user, and building traditional transmission infrastructure is not economically viable. We can overcome these problems through the use of Texzon Wireless Power systems. Imagine solar farms in the world’s uninhabited deserts providing electricity to the world’s most populous cities. Or if wind farms that operate most efficiently at night (when energy use is lowest) sending  power to parts of experiencing peak daytime use. Green energy CAN be truly economical.
Reducing Outages
Natural and manmade events can result in long-term and wide-spread disruptions of the electrical grid. Texzon Wireless Power™ systems will harden the system by providing alternative energy sources when they’re needed, as well as help bypass reliance on the aging transmission infrastructure.
The wave is impervious to weather effects such as lightning or geomagnetic disturbance or electromagnetic pulses (EMP), including those associated with a nuclear detonation.  Unlike a wired grid, the Zenneck wave cannot be physically attacked and cyber attacks would be challenged to target or cause cascading failures to a wireless system.  And obviously, a wireless grid would never get old, eliminating the problems related to the advanced age of today’s infrastructure.

Texzon































For over 100 years, scientists and industry leaders have searched for a way to safely transport electricity over long distances without the use of conventional wires or cabling…
That search is over.


Texzon Wireless Power™ systems utilize a long theorized but never successfully demonstrated terrestrially, electromagnetic phenomena known as the Zenneck surface wave.
The technology has wide ranging applications for communications as well as energy delivery.
Energy can be safely delivered to any point on the earth with very high efficiency from anywhere in the world.
Clean, safe and reliable, wireless power brings a valuable resource to parts of the world that don’t have consistent access to necessities like potable water and life saving medical treatment.








Our
Mission




Our mission is to bring “light to the world” in a safe, environmentally conscious and reliable manner, improving living conditions across the globe.

1.2 billion people – 17% of the global population – did not have access to electricity in 2013
Without electricity, basic needs (food, shelter, clothing, health care, personal care, transportation and education) are often not sufficiently met.






Safety
First




Simply meeting the industry safety standards is not enough. Texzon Technologies seeks to make long range power transmission safer than ever.
The power and communications sectors have established a series of standards to ensure safety for the communities they serve. Texzon Technologies will not only meet these standards but will continue to search for ways, through the use of our Texzon Wireless Power™ systems, to improve upon them.





Environmental
Impact




Texzon Wireless Power™ systems will make it possible to bring more of the world’s renewable resources onto the global market, making green energy truly viable.

Wind, solar and geothermal currently represents only 5.7% of global electricity generation.
Much of the world’s renewable energy is “stranded” due to the cost of moving it from where it is available to where it is needed. Texzon Wireless Power™ systems will enable the cost-effective delivery of green energy anywhere on the planet.

GLOBAL ISSUES
Energy DistributionThe power line transmission and distribution system is aging and in disrepair.Power Line Transmission IssuesExperts widely agree that failures of the power-transmission system are a nearly unavoidable product of a collision between the physics of the system and the economic rules that regulate it.
In the United States, decades-old power transmission lines are aging and in need of repairAn investment in the trillions in transmission and distribution is required to meet current demandDifficult access to renewable sources of power and distance are factors in exorbitant transmission line construction costsThe Texzon Wireless Power™ Solution
After decades of research, the scientists and engineers at Texzon Technologies™ are finally turning theory into reality with Texzon Wireless Power™ systems. This achievement marks a paradigm shift in the science of energy and electromagnetics and opens the door to the reality of commercial power delivery around the globe without the need for transmission lines.202 N I-35 Suite C

About Us


Our Company

Since 2002, Texzon Utilities has been one of the nation’s leading aggregators of electricity. In 2008, Texzon was recognized in Entrepreneur Magazine as one of the “Hot 100″Fastest Growing Businesses in America. Inc.
