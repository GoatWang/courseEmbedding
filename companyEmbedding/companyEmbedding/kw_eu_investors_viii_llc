The changes fostered by the technology revolution change dramatically economic and social life. Innovation can create significant opportunities for companies willing and determined to anticipate these changes, while skillfuly exploit them to the benefit of sustainable growth.

The acceleration of innovation is further amplified by the improving quality and bandwidth of these connections.

The new consortium will accelerate crop breeding to meet global food demand 20-50 years in the future.

Inspiring a passion for science in the next generation

 December 17th, 2015  With the “ Explore Agriculture Science” program, the  KWS Gateway Research Center (GRC) started a new and exciting initiative to promote students’ interest in science and agriculture.   With the opening of the GRC in early 2015, Derek Bartlem and his team sought an opportunity to make a difference in the local community. To meet that goal, the GRC team built a three-session program, where high school students could actively participate in panels, exercises, and discussions, while getting to know the industry and some KWS professionals.  The program aims to help students from diverse backgrounds in the St. Louis community learn more about, and be inspired by, science and agriculture. The KWS GRC team took on a mentoring role and explored the St. Louis bioscience ecosystem with the students through hands-on exploratory activities. In the final session on November 12, students worked on the KWS “Agriculture Sciences Innovation Challenge,” in which they applied their new skills to solve problems that are regularly encountered by Plant Science researchers. All of the GRC scientists contributed to the Challenge by creating scenarios that described problems they had actually experienced in their own careers; these scenarios were compiled into a game by Lorelei Davis. To play the game, the students needed to work with each other and consult with the GRC scientists in problem-solving and team-building activities. The program allowed KWS to engage with the community in a way that was exciting and meaningful for KWS professionals both in St. Louis and, via teleconference, in Einbeck. Not only did this program meet the needs of 16-, 17-, and 18-year-olds looking for real-world experience in the science industry, it also engaged KWS employees who want to share their passion and spark an interest in the next generation of researchers. To implement the program, KWS partnered with Diversity Awareness Partnership, a leading non-profit organization, and BioSTL who supported KWS’ establishment in St. Louis and work to create and reinforce strong business-to-business connections. This initiative follows the KWS core mission and promotes engagement between KWS and the community. The “Explore Agriculture Science” program is a celebration of KWS’ first year in St. Louis and highlights how the GRC is making an impact through the way KWS does business. KWS GRC plans to offer the program on an annual basis.     About KWS*  KWS is one of the world’s leading plant breeding companies. In fiscal 2014/15, 4,700 employees in 70 countries generated net sales of € 986 million and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of € 113 million. A company with a tradition of family ownership, KWS has operated independently for some 160 years. It focuses on plant breeding and the production and sale of seed for corn, sugarbeet, cereals, potatoes, rapeseed and sunflowers. KWS uses leading-edge plant breeding methods to continuously improve yield and resistance to diseases, pests and abiotic stress. To that end, the company invested € 174 million last fiscal year in research and development, 17.7 percent of its net sales.

KWS and Monsanto Extend Partnership to Develop Next-Generation Sugarbeet Technology

 October 21st, 2015  Partnership combines advanced plant breeding, additional options for managing tough weeds.   KWS SAAT SE and Monsanto Company announced today an extension of their partnership that will focus on helping U.S. and Canadian sugarbeet growers manage tough-to-control weeds. The new technology will seek to deliver tolerance to three different herbicides — glyphosate, glufosinate and dicamba — and is expected to be commercially available in the middle of the next decade, pending regulatory approvals. Combining the strengths of two industry leaders in plant breeding and crop management solutions, this announcement marks the second collaboration between the two companies and would represent the next generation of weed control technology in sugarbeets. KWS and Monsanto partnered on the initial introduction of Roundup Ready® Sugarbeets, providing North American farmers with a valuable weed management tool and resulting in the fastest adoption of any biotech crop to date. Nicolas Wielandt, head of the Sugarbeet Division for KWS: “As a leader in sugarbeet development for almost 160 years, KWS is committed to improving productivity by bringing new technologies and innovation to sugarbeet growers. We are happy to expand the toolbox for the farmer as additional solutions for weed control are needed. We expect that this technology will increase the efficiency of sugarbeet cultivation and help to secure the competitiveness of the crop. Our intention is to make this technology available for all seed suppliers by license agreements.” Doug Rushing, Sugarbeet Industry Affairs lead for Monsanto: “Since its adoption in 2007, Roundup Ready® Sugarbeets have helped farmers lower inputs and decrease their impact on the environment by reducing the number of times they have to drive over their fields to apply herbicides. Extending this partnership with KWS illustrates how we’re constantly collaborating to help bring new solutions to farmers, and it shows the importance of working with others to be proactive in weed resistance management.” “We welcome the development of new tools to help sugarbeet growers manage weeds on their farms,” adds John Snyder, president, American Sugarbeet Growers Association. “Our farmers are among the best in the world at producing sugar and our future depends on the ability to apply new production technology in our cropping systems.”  About Monsanto Company  Monsanto is committed to bringing a broad range of solutions to help nourish our growing world. We produce seeds for fruits, vegetables and key crops – such as corn, soybeans, and cotton – that help farmers have better harvests while using water and other important resources more efficiently. We work to find sustainable solutions for soil health, help farmers use data to improve farming practices and conserve natural resources, and provide crop protection products to minimize damage from pests and disease. Through programs and partnerships, we collaborate with farmers, researchers, nonprofit organizations, universities and others to help tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges.
