               Company: Capital Southwest Corporation
Job Details
               Capital Southwest is a Dallas-based publicly traded business development company ("BDC"), with approximately $775 million in assets. On December 2, 2014, Capital Southwest announced its intent to separate into two public companies through the spin-off of certain of its assets into a diversified industrial growth company, CSWI, and to refocus the BDC on lending to strong middle market companies. As a result, Capital Southwest is currently active in the market executing its new investment strategy concentrating on investments ranging from $5 million to $20 million in senior "unitranche" debt, second lien and subordinated debt, as well as equity co-investments in support of the acquisition and growth of middle market companies. The control companies that will be contributed by Capital Southwest to CSWI in connection with the spin-off are actively seeking growth through add-on acquisitions. Since Capital Southwest's formation in 1961, it has always sought to invest in companies with strong management teams and sound financial performance. As a public company, Capital Southwest is fortunate to have the flexibility to be creative in its financing structures and to invest to support the growth of its portfolio companies over long periods of time.
