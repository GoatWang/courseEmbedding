        Joseph L. Bower
	
Emeritus Professor

 
Print Entire ProfileMore

JOSEPH L. BOWER, Donald K. David Professor Emeritus, has been a leader in general management at Harvard Business School for 51 years. He also served on the faculty of the Harvard Kennedy School during its first decade.  He has served in many administrative roles including Senior Associate Dean.  An expert on corporate strategy, organization, and leadership, he has devoted much of his teaching and research to challenges confronting corporate leaders in today’s rapidly changing hyper-competitive conditions. Professor Bower has been active in the development of institutions and programs. Between 1968 and 73 he helped establish the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Vienna, Austria. In 1978, he founded the Program for Senior Managers in Government as a joint program of Harvard Business School and the School of Government; and in 1995 he founded the General Manager Program at Harvard Business School. He was deeply involved in the efforts to build the new joint MBA-MPP degree program offered by the Business School and the Kennedy School of Government.
Presently, he is co-leading a project on The Future of Market Capitalism. The first result of the project was a book co-authored with Dutch Leonard and Lynn Paine, titled Capitalism at Risk: Rethinking the Role of Business, published October 2011 by Harvard Business Press. Based on three years of work and interviews around the world, the book draws on discussions with business leaders to identify ten potential disruptors of the global market system. Presenting examples of companies already making a difference, the authors explain how business must serve both as innovator and activist--developing corporate strategies that effect change at the community, national, and international levels.
Bower is the author or coauthor many articles, some 200 case studies and videos and more than a dozen books: The CEO Within: Why Inside-Outsiders Are The Key To Succession Planning was published in November 2007 by HBS Press and was a Financial Times to 10 for that year; From Resource Allocation to Strategy (with C. Gilbert) was published in 2005 by Oxford University Press, and won the Best Book award in 2006 from “Strategy + Management.” .
Professor Bower has also consulted widely on problems of succession, strategy and organization with companies here and abroad. He is a director of Anika Therapeutics, Inc., Loews Corporation, and New America High Income Fund. He is a life trustee of the New England Conservatory of Music and has served on many other company and non-profit boards.
Professor Bower is a graduate of Harvard University AB '59 magna cum laude, MBA '61 a Baker Scholar with high distinction, DBA '63.  Married to Elizabeth Potter, he lives in Cambridge, has two children, two step-children, five grandchildren, and 3 step-grandchildren.Print Entire ProfileLess









Capitalism at Risk: Rethinking the Role of Business
The spread of capitalism worldwide has made people wealthier than ever before. But capitalism's future is far from assured. The global financial meltdown of 2008 nearly triggered another Great Depression, economies in Europe are still teetering, and powerful forces-income inequality, resource depletion, and mass migrations from poor to rich countries, to name just a few-pose serious threats to continued prosperity. How can the future of capitalism be secured? And who should spearhead the effort? Many observers point to government. But in Capitalism at Risk, the authors argue otherwise. While they agree that governments must play a role, they maintain that businesses should lead the way. Indeed, for enterprising companies, the current threats to market capitalism present vital opportunities. Drawing on discussions with business leaders around the world, the authors argue that companies must stop seeing themselves as bystanders and instead develop innovative business strategies that address the disruptors, produce profitable growth, and strengthen institutions at the community, national, and international levels.  


















The CEO Within
Why Inside Outsiders Are The Key To Succession Planning
With rising CEO turnover, companies are increasingly looking outside for qualified candidates. Sure, externally recruited CEOs bring fresh perspectives and connections. But they lack the in-depth knowledge of the company s culture and history that they need to succeed. Result? Many deliver disappointing performances.
Companies can avoid this scenario, contends Joseph Bower in The CEO Within. Drawing on a decade s research (including interviews with leading CEOs) and experience managing the succession process, Bower explains how companies can develop a cohort of internal candidates one of whom may be suited to the increasingly demanding CEO role. The key? Groom inside-outsiders. These leaders view their role through the lens of someone who just bought the company unencumbered by the cognitive and emotional baggage that comes from a long tenure in the organization. But they also leverage the knowledge they ve accumulated about the company s people, suppliers and customers, and future direction.
Placed squarely at the intersection of succession planning and leadership development, this book describes the distinguishing attributes of the inside-outsider and reveals how to recruit, nurture, and promote this special type of leader. With a healthy supply of qualified internal candidates, companies get the leadership they need when they need it.


















The Corporate Leader
How Corporate Managers Contribute Value
In today's economic climate, corporate leaders in multidivisional and multinational companies face a uniquely broad set of challenges. While putting in place the systems, relationships, and strategies that foster business unit success, you also must lead the business as a whole, optimizing financial strategy in a turbulent global economy, generating synergies across units, and creating opportunities beyond the current business. The Corporate Leader explores this multifaceted role in depth, helping you balance competing demands while maintaining the big-picture focus that positions your organization for future success.

“Political Engagement by Corporations Derives from and is Focused on Seeking Monopolistic Power”

Posted on March 9, 2017 by ProMarket writers



In this installment of ProMarket’s new interview series, Harvard Business School professor emeritus Joseph Bower shares some thoughts on rent-seeking, politics, and the role of corporations and governments in the market. “The neo-classical model simply does not comprehend the modern corporation.”
 

 


On March 3-4, the Stigler Center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, along with Harvard Business School and Oxford University, hosted a conference in Chicago to answer the following questions: Should the economic theory of the firm be modified? And if so, how?
 
The standard (economic) theory of the firm is silent on the role firms can play in shaping the rules of the game under which they operate. In reality, many firms lobby politicians and try to capture regulators in order to modify the rules of the game in their favor. Some scholars have argued that the resources devoted to these activities are relatively so small that they are likely to have insignificant effects, and/or that regardless of how much firms invest in political activities, in a well-functioning democracy there are countervailing forces that effectively level the playing field. Other scholars have noted that the resources firms devote to shaping the rules of the game to their own advantage are sufficiently large and their effects sufficiently important to warrant a rethinking of the standard economic theory of the firm. Which of these two views has more empirical support? If the latter, should the economic theory of the firm be modified? If so, how, and is the potential fix better or worse than the existing problem?
 
The following interview with Harvard Business School professor emeritus Joseph Bower is part of an interview series with influential scholars who are addressing these issues in their work. You can view all previous installments here.

 
Joseph Bower
Joseph Bower is the Donald K. David Professor Emeritus at Harvard Business School. He is a leading expert on corporate strategy, organization, and leadership. During his storied career, which spans five decades, Bower has focused his teaching and research on the challenges confronting corporate leaders in a rapidly changing, hyper-competitive environment.
 
As one of the leaders of a project on The Future of Market Capitalism, Bower co-authored the book Capitalism at Risk: Rethinking the Role of Business (Harvard Business Review Press, 2011) with his HBS colleagues Herman “Dutch” Leonard and Lynn Paine. He has also consulted with many companies in the U.S. and abroad on issues related to succession, strategy and organization.
 
In a brief interview with ProMarket, Bower shared some thoughts on rent-seeking, politics, and the role of corporations and governments in the market. 
 
Q: The neoclassical theory of the firm does not consider political engagement by corporations. How big of an omission do you think this is?
 
There has been extensive writing about the power and scope of corporations going back at least to Edward Mason and Carl Kaysen. In a chapter I wrote,1)Bower, Joseph L. “The Managerial Estate.” Chap. 8 in The U.S. Business Corporation, An Institution in Transition, edited by John R. Meyer and James M. Gustafson, 149–168. Cambridge, MA: Ballinger Publishing Company, 1988 I explored the role of large corporations in terms of their impact on factors other than the product market. Echoing Kaysen I emphasized location, employment, product line choices, vendors that because of their scale and scope give firms powers far beyond those conceived in the neo-classical model and unconstrained by traditional notions of price competition. The neo-classical model simply does not comprehend the modern corporation.
 
But if we are talking about a theory carefully constructed on a set of axioms, the theory really can’t consider political engagements. The essence of the neo-classical theory is the constraint on choice imposed by given and widely shared technology and competitive markets for resources and vendors. Political engagement derives from and is focused on seeking monopolistic power. The various theories of monopolistic competition are instructive but fall far short of the standard sought by neoclassical theory.
 
Q: To what extent is political engagement by corporations responsible for the current populist discontent?
 
Only in a limited way. Both Galbraith (countervailing power) and Raymond Bauer (competition among lobbying powers) note that, to a significant degree, corporate power is less powerful than it would appear. More important is the power of banks, which since the 19th century have played a central role in American life. Trump is closer to Jackson, but whether he will act to cut back the power of financial institutions is doubtful. 
 
Q: The World Economic Forum has called for “reimagining” and “reforming” capitalism. To what extent is this need for reform the result of disruption brought by technological change, globalization, and immigration, and to what extent is it the effect of rent-seeking and regulatory capture?
 
An important question but almost impossible to attack empirically. Basically, both need attention. The essential weaknesses of capitalism and neo-classical theory are:
 
Labor is thought to be a resource that prefers leisure to work. When the price of labor is high enough, individuals withhold their effort. But in modern society, work is the source of standing in society, and at higher ends of the market, workers appear to prefer work—almost as an addiction they seek more and more wealth. Try to fit that kind of behavior on a single labor supply curve.
 
With globalization, prices have really become a problem since different legal systems imply different pricing of all kinds of public goods. These differences are highly significant when it comes to the consequences of trade.
 
Q: Some people describe Donald Trump’s economic policies as “corporatism.” Are you more worried by Trump’s interference in the market economy or by companies’ ability to subvert markets’ rules?
 
We don’t know what will be Trump’s policies. I would say that contemporary Republican policies are corporatist, whatever that means. Trump’s decisions do not flow from policy—they are impulsive and transactional in intent.

Description

Joseph Wolf is widely considered the most accomplished bird artist working in London during the mid 19th century. When he arrived in England in 1848, he was already an established wildlife painter in Western Europe. Born in Germany, Wolf began his career as a lithographer’s apprentice. At age 19, he was commissioned by Eduard Rüppell at the Frankfurt Museum to illustrate his book on African birds. This led to commissions from the Darmstadt Museum and the prominent ornithologist Hermann Schlegel, for Traité de Fauconnerie and a work on birds of Japan. At this point, Wolf who was only 20 years old, moved to Leiden and sharpened his skills at the art school there. When he came to England, he began working in the natural history department of the British Museum, illustrating George Robert Gray’s Genera of Birds. He also attracted the interest of the animal painter Sir Edward Landseer, who arranged for Wolf to exhibit at the Royal Academy. He was the first significant bird artist to publish illustrations in scientific journals, dozens of which appeared in the Proceedings and Transactions of the Zoological Society of London and The Ibis, the journal of the British Ornithologists’ Union. Other important bird books to which he contributed were John Gould’s The Birds of Asia (1850-1883) and The Birds of Great Britain (1862-73). He also illustrated important travel books by David Livingstone, Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace. Perhaps Wolf’s crowning achievements were the plates for Daniel Giraud Elliott’s 1873 monographs on the Phasianeidae (pheasants) and Paradiseida (birds of paradise). Wolf’s favorite subjects were birds of prey. His explorations of how the subtle colorations of their plumage related to their environment influenced other artists. His long and successful career as a natural history painter also encouraged others to enter that field.
Joseph Smit was a Dutch lithographer of natural history subjects. His first commission was by the ornithologist Hermann Schlegel at the Leiden Museum. He is perhaps best known for his lithographs after Joseph Wolf, including Philip Sclater’s Zoological Sketches (1861-67) and Daniel Giraud Elliott’s 1873 monographs on the Phasianeidae (pheasants) and Paradiseida (birds of paradise). He also contributed plates to the Catalogue of the Birds in the British Museum (1874-1898) and Lord Lilford’s Coloured Figures of the Birds of the British Islands.
Condition: Lithographs generally very good with the usual overall light toning, wear. Some with light cockling as mounted to original title card. Title card with the usual overall toning and wear, some with scattered marginal staining, short tears, and/or bending of corners, all to be matted out.

The Desperate Escape of Joe Bowers



 Joseph Bowers, 210-AZ



											Joe Bowers, an inmate considered criminally insane by many of his fellow inmates on the Rock, would make national headlines with a desperate act that for over a half century has been called an escape by some and suicide by others.
										

											Joseph Bowers was by all accounts a desperado and loner, unable to come to terms with the conditions of Alcatraz. Imprisoned during the toughest and most strict era on Alcatraz, Bowers, serving a 25-year sentence for Postal Mail Robbery that netted a mere sixteen dollars and thirty eight cents. He held an expansive criminal record and as one report highlighted: “If at large, he probably would engage again in criminal activities and constitute a serious menace to the public safety and society.” He had claimed, and it was also supported in belief by fellow inmates that his crimes had resulted from a lacking ability to support himself. He claimed that he was completely desperate and out of funds, hungry and mostly unable to afford food or proper lodging.
										

											In a 1933 summary report, his background was noted:
										


												“On this man it has been impossible to get any dependable information. He states that it is represented to him that he was born of parents who were members of a travelling circus on February 18, 1897, at El Paso, Texas, was immediately deserted by his parents, and was raised by circus people who were travelling about and with whom he has lost all contact, so that he has been unable to establish his birth as an American Citizen. Claims to have worked in Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Russia, Buenos Aires, Mexico, Cuba, and other places principally as an interpreter, as he claims to speak six languages.
											

												He came to the office complaining that he thought his sentence too severe, that he was in his present trouble due only to the fact that he had been unable to get work, and wanted to know if there was any manner in which he could establish his citizenship so that he could get pass-ports to foreign countries, as he said he never had any trouble finding steady employment, but did have some trouble because he did not have proper passports when in foreign countries.”
											




											Bowers arrived at Alcatraz on September 4, 1934, in one of the first groups, and it quickly became obvious that he didn’t fit the archetypical model of the standard Rock inmate. While imprisoned at McNeil Island, a federal penitentiary located in the Puget Sound of Washington State, he was a considered “unpredictable and at high risk resulting from being emotional unstable.”
										

											Warden Johnston later wrote: “I did not class him with the shrewd gangsters with whom he associated in prison. He was a weak-minded man with a strong back who would get peace of mind by exercising his body.” The Rule-of-Silence was in its most strict form, and within only six months of his imprisonment, Bowers was already showing signs of significant mental strain. He attempted suicide, but the resident physician didn’t feel Bowers was making a serious attempt on his life. A memo to the director described the attempt:
										


												DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
												
												UNITED STATES PENITENTIARY
												
												ALCATRAZ ISLAND, CALIFORNIA
												
												March 25, 1935
											

												Director
												
												Bureau of Prisons
												
												Washington, D.C
												


												Attention: Dr. F. Lovell Bixby
												
												Assistant Director
												
												Re: Joe Bowers, Number 210-AZ
											

												About 7:30 A.M. on March 7, 1935, Joe Bowers, 210-AZ, cut the skin of his throat by breaking his eye glasses and using a piece of the broken glass: the cut was about three inches long, there was very little loss of blood , and he was given immediate medical attention.
											

												He has been in the hospital since that time and we have had Doctor Twitchell , Consultant Psychiatrist, make examination and report. Copy of Dr. Hess' report to me with copy of Dr. Twitchell's report to Dr. Hess in this case enclosed for your information.
											

												Sincerely yours,
												
												J.A. Johnston
												
												Warden

									Edward Twitchell, the prison psychiatrist citing to Chief Medical Officer George Hess, who would later become the resident physician of an ailing Al Capone, wrote about the attempt:
								


										March 22, 1935
										
										Subject: Joe Bower, Number 210
										
										Dr. George Hess, Chief Medical Officer,
										
										U. S. Penitentiary, Alcatraz, California.
										


										Dear Dr. Hess:
									

										The more I listened to Bower, the less belief I had in him. He has been watched now for months and no epileptic seizures have been noted, although he insists that he has them.
									

										The recent attempts at suicide have been theatrically planned and have resulted in very little damage to him. Had he been a determined suicide he had good opportunity to make a success of it. Hence, I believe the unsuccessful attempts were for the purpose of gaining opinion favorable to him. Like so many of his kind it must be admitted at first that he is not a normal individual but he is not so crazy as he is trying to make out.
									

										It is a well recognized fact that many an individual who is insane endeavors to make out his insanity worse than it really is for the purpose of gaining some end. Bower, while an abnormal individual, is not truly insane in my opinion and is pretending a mental disturbance for some purpose.
									

										Yours very truly,

										Warden Johnston,
										
										Institution,
									

										For your information I am transmitting a copy of the latest Psychiatric report on Joe Bowers, number 210. It is my opinion that we have carefully observed this man and have given him every possible consideration.
									

										My conclusions in the case are that the man is not insane to the degree that he is trying to make us believe and that I am in perfect accord with Doctor Twitchell's belief that he has some purpose in view.
									

										I see no particular reason for keeping Bowers in the hospital any longer, however I shall do whatever you think best about the matter.
									

										Respectfully;
									

										/s/ George Hess, A.A. Surgeon
										
										Chief Medical Officer.
									


									Bowers was assigned to the incinerator detail only a month prior to his escape by flight. The incinerator detail was considered a difficult and unpopular work assignment by the general inmate population. It was hard and laborious work, sorting metals and burning the prison waste. Working alone and having to endure the cold weather elements of the San Francisco Bay, Bowers would soon break. The inmates assigned to the incinerator detail passed time slowly. Under constant watch by the Road Tower officer, Bowers could only dream of his freedom, as tour boats passed the island in close enough distance where faint laughs could be heard over a seagull screech.
								

									On April 26, 1936, Bowers could serve no one time on Alcatraz. Some inmates called it suicide, while others were convinced he was simply trying to climb up to grab garbage wedged in the chain link fence. Another account claimed he was climbing to feed a seagull, but what is clear is Bowers ignored the forceful signals to halt. At approximately 11:20 AM, just as the signal for the inmate to return to their cells and prepare for lunch, Bowers started walking towards the industries building and then charged the fence, making his ascent.
								

									The official officer accounts where documented as follows:
								



									Bowers was only 40 years of age when he fell to the violent rifle fire of E.F. Chandler. In his testimony to a Coroner’s jury panel, Chandler stated: “Bowers was over the deadline. He knew what he was doing, and I couldn’t go get him without wings.” As many historians still debate the sanity of Bowers and whether or not his flight over the fence was a true attempt at freedom. But as one former correctional officer pointed out to help make sense of the tragedy and determine whether or not his intent to escape was real, he stated most aptly, that regardless of what Bower’s intent was, whether to escape, feed a bird or collect garbage, when he was finally struck by a bullet, “he fell over the fence and onto the side of freedom. Where he fell says it all...”
