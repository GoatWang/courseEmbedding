They come in a wide range of designs and shapes, so you have to do your research to find a timepiece that suits your personal style. The sheer number of watches available at Walmart can make it difficult to choose the perfect one, but by paying attention to some essential factors, you can be sure your pick is right. With Every Day Low Prices, you can treat yourself or someone you love to a lovely watch no matter the occasion. Watch styles Both men s and women s watches come in various styles; some are suitable for sports activities, whereas others make great accessories for a business outfit. When shopping for a new timepiece, begin by considering how you intend to use your watch. Sport watches: These watches have a chunkier, rugged style and are built to resist a high level of strain. they're often water-resistant and may have extra functions such as heart monitors, pedometers or stopwatches for measuring lap times. Dress watches: Dress watches are elegant and modest, often featuring an analog dial and a smart case in gold plating or stainless steel. These timepieces offer a classic look and are often investment pieces that you can wear for years to come. Fashion watches: Mixing function with style, fashion watches use various materials and colors to create timepieces that you can easily coordinate with different outfits. Opt for an innovative dial shape or a vibrant color for an accessory that can make you stand out from the crowd. Children s watches: Designed specifically for little wrists, children s watches are often colorful and perfect to help your little one with learning to tell the time. they're also sturdy enough to withstand all kinds of everyday knocks. Movements All watches have a mechanism inside that keeps the time, and this is called a movement. Even though the main function of the mechanism is to tell the time, you can also find watches with extra features such as showing the date or day of the week. Some models even track the phases of the moon or come with an alarm function. The main types of watch movements are: Mechanical: Employing a classic type of movement, mechanical movement watches have a spring inside that's wound up and release the stored energy gradually to move a wheel every second. These watches need regular winding to keep going. Battery/Quartz: The most popular movement type for modern watches, battery movement uses a combination of battery and quartz crystal to keep the watch going. These watches are extremely accurate and only require you to change the battery every couple of years. Automatic: Also known as self-winding watches, automatic models are similar to hand-wound watches, with the difference consisting in the fact that the watch winds itself up whenever it moves, so if you wear it every day, it will keep itself wound up. Solar-powered: The main advantage of owning a solar-powered watch is that you never have to replace the battery. These watches use a photovoltaic cell that converts light into electricity. Dials and faces Watch dials come in numerous shapes, and the hour display is also different from one model to another. Round dials are quite common, but you can also choose a watch with an oval or rectangular dial. Hours are generally denoted by Arabic numerals, but you may also opt for Roman numerals, or simply for watches that only have lines to indicate hours for a contemporary look. Watches with sub-dials for a stopwatch or for displaying the date or day of the week are also available. Straps The most common types of straps to choose for your timepiece include leather straps, metal bracelets and fabric straps. Each of these may have decorations or printed effects or may come in a simple, monochromatic design. Leather straps are classic and easy to adjust, whereas metal bracelets are generally found on dress watches. Water resistance Water resistance is measured in water pressure, and most manufacturers list the scale of water resistance in ATMs (atmospheres). As a rule of thumb, 10 meters is equivalent to 1 ATM of pressure; if a watch indicates a 5ATM water resistance, it can be fully submerged into water up to 50 meters.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349563, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Walmart wants to make the process as easy and joyous as possible with our gorgeous selection of wedding and rings/3891_540912_1228349'>engagement rings. In this section, you'll find all the jewelry options you need to pop the question in style. We offer classic and modern engagement rings in a range of different style and budget ranges so you can find just the right token of your love to present as you ask the love of your life for his or her hand in marriage. Whether you're a traditional couple or you tend to do things your own way, we have ring styles and budget options to suit your unique needs. From glamorous sparklers to subtle bands, you can get the right ring for the perfect person, all at Every Day Low Prices.Engagement ring stylesWith so many ring styles available, it can feel overwhelming to choose at first. Luckily, once you understand what your options are, it's much easier to make a choice that'll suit your fiancee to be.Solitaire ringsSolitaire rings are named because they feature a solitary stone. If your intended has a simple, traditional personal style and prefers modest fashion choices, this may be the right option. Solitaire rings are elegant and subtle, and if you're on a limited budget, they can be a nice way of getting a larger stone on your fiancee's finger.Three-stone ringsAs the name implies, three-stone rings have three stones featured rather than just one. All three can be of the same size, shape and color, but often, the central stone is larger, with the two stones on the sides serving as accents. If you want to get a traditional ring with a slight twist, you can opt for a clear center stone with colored side stones. These rings put a little bit more flash on the wearer's finger, making them a great choice for traditional ladies with a little bit of a glamorous side.Halo ringsThe halo setting is a fairly modern development, and it's one of the most glamorous, luxurious settings available. These rings feature a central stone surrounded by a tight border, or "halo," of smaller stones. Halo rings are often round in shape, but you can find square and rectangular halo settings too. These rings have an ornate feel and a lot of sparkle, making them the right choice for a glamorous lady who loves to sparkle.Bridal setsNo matter what engagement ring style you choose, it's nice to pick out a ring that comes with a matching wedding ring. Bridal sets include both the engagement ring and wedding band, and they're designed to fit together perfectly as a matching set. This results in a more comfortable ring combination that many wearers prefer. Women who have small fingers in particular can benefit from this style because it tends to take up less space on the finger.Wedding bandsIf you'd rather purchase your wedding band separately, we do offer a wide variety of different styles to choose from. We even have some matching styles so both members of the couple can have a coordinated set of rings to wear after saying their vows. Wedding bands can be simple, plain circles of fine metal, or they can have details like engraving, raised textures, inlaid stones or contrasting inlaid material such as ceramic or wood. If you want to go for the traditional look, opt for a plain band. If you want to inject some personality into your wedding band choice, you'll have plenty of options to consider in Walmart's Wedding and Engagement Rings section, including some flashy styles with inlaid stones and those with subtler looks thanks to a contrasting metal or texture.Promise ringsA promise ring is a way of making a big commitment to the person you love without taking the full step of getting engaged. This ring can be part of a promise that people make to each other or as a step in a relationship with two people who aren't quite ready for marriage but know they want to be together forever. Promise rings can also be a placeholder for a couple who want to get a more expensive engagement ring but don't have the budget for it yet. Walmart offers simple, elegant promise rings that can serve the right purpose for you if you fall into any of the categories described here.Metal and stone optionsNo matter what kind of ring you're considering, it's important to understand your options. If you aren't familiar with different kinds of stones and metals, this should help you find your bearings and make the right decision.Diamond vs. cubic zirconiaThese are both clear stones, but cubic zirconia has a different chemical structure than diamonds do. Cubic zirconia isn't as hard or as rare as diamond, making it more affordable. If you want the traditional engagement ring look, these are the two primary stones to consider, although white sapphires and moissanite also make great choices with plenty of sparkle.Alternative stonesYou can also opt for stones like sapphire, ruby, emerald or amethyst for an engagement ring. These colorful stones add unique flair to any ring.White vs. Yellow goldWhite gold has a silvery look, while yellow gold is the traditional gold color. Both are considered strong, high-quality metals, and they're a great choice for both traditional and alternative ring styles. White gold is typically made of a gold-and-zinc alloy that's a bit more durable than yellow gold, particularly yellow gold in the higher-karat ranges of 18k and up.Alternative metalsModern engagement rings and wedding bands can also be made from lightweight but durable and affordable materials like tungsten or titanium. While most engagement rings are made from gold, you can find some styles that use more modern metals, especially for simple wedding bands.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349569, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
