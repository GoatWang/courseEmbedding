				Alexander			

Alexander Peyrer
Vice President, Product Development EMEA
Graz, Austria
In 2009, Alexander started working for ecofinance. He particularly liked that he had the opportunity to work on new international banking projects. The negotiations and client meetings were usually held in the respective countries and Alexander enjoyed travelling.
After the merger of Reval and ecofinance in 2010, Alexander was promoted to Team Lead and eventually Director, Product Management. Then in 2015, Alexander became Vice President, Product Development EMEA. He is no longer directly involved in the actual product conception, instead he oversees the Product Development team in Graz.
On the day to day, Alexander values teamwork, but also stresses the importance of individual responsibilities and contributions because he believes that success comes from the combination of all three. As a manager, Alexander places importance on creating a work environment that promotes inventive and fresh ideas. He develops personal relationships with all of his reports to encourage their confidence.

				Reynaldo			

Reynaldo
Implementation Consulting Manager, Professional Services
Vancouver BC, Canada
At Thomson Reuters, Reynaldo worked with Reval on a shared client. At the time, most of Reval’s teams were “risk guys” and they were looking for someone with expertise in cash services. In 2011, Rey was Reval’s first Vancouver employee and he had to build a team in Canada. Now, he manages a team of seven. While it isn’t possible to learn how to be jolly, Rey has some excellent advice to those new to implementation consulting. First, Rey believes that impeccable customer service skills are crucial. “You need to be confident, empathetic, and honest.”
Currently, Rey is working on 10 projects. He said the dynamics of the Professional Services team has changed over the past year. “We are a team on a mission, all working together for successful implementations.” Being on a consulting team goes beyond the eight to five work day, but Rey has mastered juggling his projects, prioritizing, and managing his time both professionally and personally. If he needs to go watch his son’s badminton tournament, then he plans accordingly. “If you work hard you also plan hard!”

				Aayushi			

Aayushi
Manager, Software Engineering
Gurgaon, India
After joining in 2007, Aayushi watched Reval’s India entity grow from 10-15 employees to over 100 employees. After working for four years in Reval’s India office, Aayushi went on international assignment to New York for about a year and a half. She returned to the India office and became a Team Lead. What began as a small team with 2 direct reports rapidly grew into a 10-person team. In 2014, Aayushi was promoted to Manager, Software Engineering. As a manager, Aayushi said her philosophy is simple- she treats her team as equals. She gives them freedom and avoids micromanaging.
Personally, Aayushi is a self-described workaholic. She loves to be challenged and is motivated by meeting deadlines and delivering the expected product, whether it’s for a client or a colleague. In software engineering, it’s important to keep up with the rapidly changing technology so Aayushi is always reading and learning more to try and stay one step ahead.
