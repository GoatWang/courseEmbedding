						It's simple and inexpensive to purchase extended warranties and one of the smartest ways to protect your investment.

					
					
					Furniture can be

BEAVERTON, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Leupold & Stevens, Inc. is pleased to announce that Bruce Pettet has 
      been named chief executive officer and president of the U.S. sports 
      optics manufacturer. His start date will be March 17, 2014.
    


      A proven brand-builder, Pettet brings a wealth of experience and a track 
      record of success in marketing products and brands to a wide consumer 
      audience.
    

      “We’re excited by Bruce’s passion for growth, as well as his expertise 
      in building global brands,” said Jim Clark, chairman of the Leupold & 
      Stevens, Inc., board of directors. “As we continue to expand as a 
      company, his vision and experience will be invaluable in helping build 
      on Leupold’s reputation for best-in-class quality and service.”
    

      As the President and CEO of Collective International, LLC, Pettet built 
      a portfolio of successful brands that are sold in more than 100 
      countries worldwide. In addition to his success reenergizing and 
      building Collective’s Airwalk brand, Pettet also created a company 
      culture that was recognized as one of Denver’s top companies to work for.
    

      "Leupold is a fantastic brand with an outstanding reputation in the 
      market," Pettet said. "I'm excited to help build on their recent success 
      and ensure that Leupold & Stevens, Inc. remains the premier U.S. 
      manufacturer of sporting optics."
    

      Prior to joining Airwalk, Pettet was the President and CEO of Brooks 
      Sports, Inc., a premium running company located in Bothell, Wash. He has 
      also served as chairman of the board of Famous Brands International 
      (Mrs. Fields and TCBY yogurt brands).
    

      Pettet has been named one of the Marketing 100 by Advertising Age 
      magazine, a designation of the top marketers in the country, and 
      Sporting Goods Business named him an “Industry Pacesetter.”
    

      Outside of the office, Pettet is an avid hunter and outdoorsman. A 
      member of Safari Club International, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, and 
      the National Rifle Association, he shares Leupold’s collective values of 
      conservation and responsible hunting practices.

      employs over 600 people in its state-of-the-art manufacturing facility

Two Matches on One DVD
 
Ethan Andrews vs Colt Stevens

Young Colt made a small splash in his debut against Dash
Decker, even though he lost the match and had his new pair of $200 sunglasses
smashed to smithereens by the big guy. For most of the match he was dominated
by the imposing muscles and steel will of one of the most formidable opponents
on the roster. Dash overpowered Colt in his debut, but the teen wrestler and
MMA fighter did show signs of advanced wrestling and MMA skills, as he twisted
and tortured Dash�s prized physique when he was on top. So the rookie has shown
signs of promise. But, in this match he takes on another opponent that has made
a living out of beating up on the muscle boys and rookies. And these days,
Ethan is oozing even more confidence after teaming with Gage Cardona in a 2 on
1 beating of the muscle stud fratboy Alex Waters, and then teaming with Gage
again for the Green Team as they surprisingly defeated and humiliated the Dream
Team of Alex and Dash. In light of the current events, Colt certainly is going
to have his hands full with resident street punk and bad boy Ethan. With the
influx of MMA and other contact sports included on the resumes of many of the
wrestlers, it�s inevitable that there is debate in the locker room as to which
of the other arts can have a greater impact in the wrestling ring. Colt has
professional MMA experience, so naturally the sly teen thinks this will work to
his advantage. While Ethan has been training in boxing over the past year and
has added this to his growing list of combat sports experience in his arsenal.
Round one begins with the two of them sizing each other up and debating the MMA
vs boxing advantage. The sly teen is no slouch when it comes to head games
either, as he works on psyching Ethan out by flexing his teen muscles in his
face. Ethan smiles at this ploy, since he�s sporting his own sizzling hot, lean
muscled body and has dominated much bigger muscles than the teenager is
flexing. The street punk strikes first with repeated jabs to the teen�s abs,
then flips him to the mat and stretches the blond boy out in a seated
surfboard. Colt may have thought he had some quickness, but he�s being
out-quicked at the onset. Ethan transitions the hold to a leg scissors,
squeezing Colt�s blond locks while he taunts him. He allows the MMA fighter to
get to his feet, then connects with a flurry of jabs to his abs as he�s pushed
back against the ropes. The street punk bad boy loves to attack his opponent�s
abs, and he�s using the same game plan on the rookie. He suplexes Colt to the
mat and delivers a few more shots to his teen abs. Ethan then drags Colt over
to the ropes so that he can choke him out, then locks a texas cloverleaf
leglock on Colt�s lanky legs exerting extreme pressure on his lower back. Ethan
asks him to tap, but Colt�s been in the cage before and it�s much too early for
him to submit. Both guys get to their feet and Colt goes on offense, he choke
slams Ethan to the mat, using his size advantage on the street punk. Colt
starts displaying his arsenal of holds on Ethan; clamping on a tight leg lock,
then cinching a figure four around his throat as he pounds away at the bad
boy�s pec. The blond rookie drags Ethan up to his feet by his hair, and then
whips him across the ring and connects with is size 11 white boot square on his
chest. This sends the bad boy crumbling to the mat. Colt connects with a few of
his own ab punches as Ethan is sprawled on the mat, then he egotistically
struts around the ring flexing his own teenage biceps for his fans. This turns
out to be a rookie mistake, as it provides Ethan time to recover, and reverse
the momentum. When Colt attempts to connect with another boot to Ethan�s ripped
midsection, the bad boy�s quick enough to grab Colt�s leg before it lands and
takes the teen rookie to the mat. Once Ethan has him on the mat, he starts an
assault on the rookie�s legs; he stomps his hamstrings, then makes him agonize
in a figure four leg lock, then sends him reeling with a wicked clothesline.
The bad boy has things in control as he hoists Colt up over his shoulders, then
power bombs him to the mat. Colt is wincing in pain as he cries out �my back,
my back�. Ethan pulls him to his feet, laces his wiry teen body through the
ropes, pulls back on his arms into to surfboard and really starts applying the
pressure. You have to think Colt�s never experienced this hold in an MMA match,
so as much as he tries to fight it, Ethan continues to amp up the pressure
until the blond rookie is forced to scream out �I give up�. Colt dangles in the
ropes in pain before the bad boy pulls him back into the ring by his blond
beiber style hair, places his black boot on his stomach, and flexes his
baseball sized biceps in conquest of round one.
 Round two starts with Colt admitting �that was a good round,
I�ll give you that, but it was a round not a fight�. Ethan just smiles at the
teenager�s attempt at intimidation, and then Colt pulls out something from
behind the corner turnbuckle pad. Seems the rookie stashed a pair of 4 ounce
MMA gloves in the corner just in case he needed an advantage. Colt proceeds to
put on the gloves while Ethan explains �boxing is a sweet science while MMA is
nothing but caged animals�. This doesn�t sit well with the sly teen as he
retorts �don�t ever say that again� before the two lock up. Colt strikes with
several knees to Ethan�s ripped abs, tosses him to the mat, lifts him up to
suplex him back to the mat, then locks on a leg scissors around the street
punk�s throat wanting to squeeze the life out of him. Colt has seemed to find a
groove and he continues to throw, toss, and flip Ethan�s lean muscled body
around the ring at will. He lifts the bad boy to his feet only to drop kick him
back into the turnbuckle. Ethan is slumped in the corner, and as the sly teen
pulls him to his feet and begins to parade him around the ring, Ethan reverses
the action with an atomic knee drop that sends shivers up the blond teen�s
spine. Colt winces in pain holding his ass as he lay face down on the mat. Will
bad boy Ethan run the young rookie through his vast array of punishing holds
and impose his will on the cage fighter to chalk up another victory? Or can the
sly teen regain his senses and turn this ring into his cage and rely on his MMA
experience and size advantage to trap the punk in a MMA submission to even this
match at one round a piece? Colt has shown signs of brilliance, but will that
be enough to claim a victory. All the sensational and stimulating action leads
up to a knock out finish!

Bruce Ballard vs Blake Keller




Bruce has caused quite a stir since making his debut match
here at Rock Hard. He�s been an instant fan favorite with his movie star face
and shredded bodybuilder physique. He was able to notch a victory in his first
match against fellow rookie Tyson Matthews, and gave seasoned veteran Austin
Cooper all that he could handle in his second match, before succumbing to a
horrific finishing hold that Austin needed to pull out of his bag of tricks to
thwart off the potential upset. Bruce is determined to make the Rock Hard ring
his own �house of Bruce� as he works his way up through the roster in his climb
to the top. In this match, he takes on a tall titian rookie by the name of
Blake Keller. Blake is a towering 6�2� and 215 lbs of beef and muscle. He
brings an athletic background and is an emerging fitness model, though he has
limited wrestling experience. These two guys have bumped into one another on
the fitness modeling circuit, and come from the same region of the country, so
they do have some history before entering into this challenge today. Bruce is in
�beast mode� for this match, entering the ring in military camouflage shorts
and black boots. He pumps up his arms in the corner before slipping off the
camo to reveal his signature black and blue square cut trunks, putting on a
show for his fans. Across the ring, Blake is clad in burgundy square cuts and
white boots which highlight his golden brown tan, not impressed with the
bodybuilder�s pre-match antics. Round one opens with Bruce explaining the parts
of the ring to the rookie, saying �this is the turnbuckle, this is the ropes,
and this is the floor, you�ll be down there a lot�. Bruce muscles the newbie to
the mat and stomps him on the back, proclaiming �what I say, the bigger they
are the harder they fall�. Bruce lifts the tall titan to his feet to suplex him
across the ring, then continues to attack Blake�s back with more stomps before
grinding his knee into the small of his back. The chosen one, Bruce, has
quickly been gaining confidence since stepping into the ring and his confidence
is soaring in this match. He lifts big Blake into a reverse bearhug showing
who�s got the real muscle in this match. Bruce drops him to the mat, flexes his
ripped body in adoration of his work, then wraps his massive thighs around
Blake�s waist and begins choking the big boy out. Bruce then works over Blake�s
abs in the corner, but when he attempts to whip him into the opposite
turnbuckle, Blake reverses the hold and Bruce�s ripped body is the one that
ends up in the opposite turnbuckle. The tall titan senses an opening and goes
on the attack. He uses his considerable height advantage to his benefit,
lifting the bodybuilder up and over his shoulder then dropping him to the mat.
Blake appears to know some moves as he grabs Bruce�s wrist and ankle and begins
to stretch his prized muscles to the limit. Bruce screams out in pain as Blake
drives his size 12 whit boot right through his ribcage. Blake isn�t afraid to
inflict the pain as he asks the chosen one if he likes that? He then
transitions the hold to a reverse leg lock and Bruce has got to be wondering
how this rookie knows these kinds of moves. Blake is in control and loving it.
He cranks on the leg lock, making the ripped bodybuilder suffer some more. But
Bruce has been down this road before, he�s able to fend off the big boy�s
attack then regains the momentum when he ducks under an attempted clothesline.
Bruce hoists Blake up over his shoulders then dumps him to the mat. He strikes
the tall titan with a heavy fist to the back, then places him in a camel clutch
variation inflicting more pain on Blake�s back. The charming ripped bodybuilder
then chokes his opponent out over the rope, setting him up to finish him off.
Bruce sets Blake up to stretch his long legs out in a spladle, directly
attacking the tall titan�s height advantage. Bruce exerts his massive muscles
stretching the big boy�s lanky long legs out and splitting his crotch to its
limits.  He compels Blake to submit by
crying out �I give to Bruce� to bring an end to round one. Bruce celebrates by
flexing his glorious, ripped biceps over his suffering foe. 
 
Round two opens with Bruce asking �how�s that groin feel?�
with a sly grin on his face, and telling Blake he looks like a rookie who eats
lots of cookies, a direct reference to the tall titan�s lack of abs. The ripped
bodybuilder takes the early control with a stomp of his boot to Blake�s gut,
then floors him with a clothesline and heart punch that immediately floors the
rookie. But, Blake showed promising signs of skill in the first round and he�s
able to quickly change the momentum in this round. He starts an attack on the
good looking bodybuilder; first with a boston crab variation then transitioning
to a rear leg lock which has Bruce groaning and squirming on the mat searching
for any way to escape. The big boy Blake has Bruce firmly in his control and
isn�t letting up. He pulls the bodybuilder to his feet, then laces his glorious
muscles through the ropes, placing his boot squarely in Bruce�s back and begins
pulling back on his massive arms in a standing surfboard. Watching the
bodybuilder�s fantastic physique suffer while stretched out in the ring ropes
is spectacular site, every one of his muscles stretched out in pain! When Bruce
doesn�t submit, Blake pulls into the ring and into a headlock, taking a moment
to pose his own impressive bicep while he�s in control of the ripped
bodybuilder. The tall titan continues dishing out the punishment by wrapping
his long legs around Bruce�s trim waist and squeezes the life out of him. Bruce
seems to be worn out by the onslaught attack, and Blake doesn�t waste any more
time. He flips Bruce over into a boston crab, and using his long legs to
leverage even more pressure on his back, it isn�t long before Bruce is
screaming out a submission. The rookie flexes his own impressive muscles over
the fallen bodybuilder, knowing he just tied this match up at one round
each. In round three will fan favorite,
ripped bodybuilder be able to regain control of the big boy rookie and squeeze
a victory out of him using his spectacular muscles? Or, can the rookie, tall
titan Blake continue to demolish and pick apart the bodybuilder�s piping hot
body and commence his wrestling career with an improbable upset win in his
debut match?
