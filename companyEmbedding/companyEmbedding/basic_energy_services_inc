Oil and Gas Stock Roundup: M&A and Bullish Data Sends Oil Stocks Soaring
Oil rallied 5%, which helped fuel 15%+ rallies in Halcon Resources, Weatherford International, Resolute Energy, Noble Corp, and Basic Energy Services.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Jul 14, 2017 at 5:42PM
            
            





What happened
After dipping 4% and closing below $45 per barrel last week, crude came roaring back this week. Thanks to a one-two punch of supply issues in Nigeria and a report that demand growth accelerated in the second quarter, crude prices rose more than 5% this week and closed above $46 per barrel. 
That rally in the oil market, along with some company specific news, sent oil stocks bounding higher. According to data from S&P Market Intelligence, several oil stocks scored double-digit gains this week. Leading the way were Halcon Resources (NYSE:HK), Weatherford International (NYSE:WFT), Resolute Energy (NYSE:REN), Noble Corp (NYSE:NE), and Basic Energy Services (NYSE:BAS).

So what
Halcon Resources led the charge, surging a remarkable 57% on the week after the driller announced that it sold its entire Bakken shale position for $1.4 billion in cash. That deal marks the culmination of a dramatic transformation for Halcon Resources, which recently emerged from bankruptcy. The transaction will accomplish two things. First, the cash infusion will enable the driller to pay off nearly all its high-cost legacy debt. In fact, the company will have a net cash position after the deal closes. Second, it will transform the company into a high-growth, Permian Basin-focused driller, with it on pace to nearly double its production from that play by year-end. That cash-rich balance sheet when combined with a fast-growing position in America's top shale play has investors growing bullish on Halcon's prospects. 
Meanwhile, oilfield service stocks Weatherford International, Noble Corp, and Basic Energy Services all rallied more than 15% this week thanks to the rebound in oil prices as well as bullish commentary by analysts at Instinet. The research firm put out a report with nine reasons to be optimistic about oilfield services, which it sees making a comeback later this year. One of the reasons Instinet's analysts are bullish on the sector is that the oil market needs more than $40 oil to stay in balance, suggesting that oil could continue heading higher, which would drive demand for the services these companies provide. In addition to that, Noble Corp released its fleet status report this week, noting that it won a contract to drill one well later this year. While not a huge deal, it will keep that rig working for three more months. 
Finally, shale driller Resolute Energy also rallied 15% this week, driven by the move in oil. After going on a stunning run last year thanks to rising oil prices, the company's stock has slumped in 2017 along with those prices as well as renewed balance sheet concerns after it tacked on $125 million of high-yield debt to finance an acquisition. While the company hopes to reduce its leverage later this year by finding a buyer for one of its legacy properties, it needs higher oil prices to keep its growth engine humming along. This week's data suggests that those rising prices just might be on the horizon. 





Now what
The one move that clearly stood out was Halcon Resources. Investors loved that the company has completed a dramatic transformation, which positions it to deliver high-return growth in the coming years even at lower oil prices. That makes it an interesting stock to keep an eye on because it could have much more upside if its drilling program in the Permian delivers the results the company believes that it can.

Basic Energy Services (BAS) Stock Tanking Amid Lower Oil Prices









Rachel Graf




Aug 19, 2015 1:59 PM EDT













 




























































 NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Basic Energy Services  (BAS) stock is down by 13.37% to $4.21 in afternoon trading on Wednesday, following an unexpected increase in U.S. oil stockpiles. Oil prices fell to six-year lows today after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) released data that showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 2.6 million barrels last week, compared to analysts' estimates of a supply decline of 777,000 barrels, according to Reuters. The EIA report "got everybody by surprise," Scott Shelton, broker at ICAP PLC, told The Wall Street Journal. "I don't see anything good in this report." Crude oil (WTI) is falling 4.72% to $40.61 per barrel this afternoon, while Brent crude is down 3.97% to $46.87 per barrel, according to the CNBC.com index. Basic Energy Services, based in Fort Worth, Texas, provides well site services to oil and natural gas drilling and producing companies in the United States. Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates BASIC ENERGY SERVICES INC as a Sell with a ratings score of D. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: "We rate BASIC ENERGY SERVICES INC (BAS) a SELL. This is driven by multiple weaknesses, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its deteriorating net income, disappointing return on equity, poor profit margins, weak operating cash flow and generally high debt management risk."

					Full Description



Basic Energy Services, Inc., incorporated on January 7, 2003, provides a range of well site services in the United States to oil and natural gas drilling and producing companies, including completion and remedial services, fluid services, well servicing and contract drilling. The Company's segments include Completion and Remedial Services, Fluid Services, Well Servicing and Contract Drilling. The Company's operations are managed regionally and are concentrated in the United States onshore oil and natural gas producing regions located in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Wyoming, North Dakota, Colorado, Utah, Montana, West Virginia, California, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Its operations are focused on liquids-rich basins, as well as natural gas-focused shale plays characterized by prolific reserves. It has a presence in the Permian Basin and the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Marcellus shales.Completion and Remedial ServicesThe Company's Completion and Remedial Services segment operates its fleet of pumping units, a range of rental equipment and fishing tools, coiled tubing units, snubbing units, thru-tubing, air compressor packages specially configured for underbalanced drilling operations, cased-hole wireline units and nitrogen units. The Company operates approximately 290 pumping units, with over 444,000 of horsepower capacity, to conduct a range of services designed to stimulate oil and natural gas production or to enable cement slurry to be placed in or circulated within a well. It also operates approximately 40 air compressor packages, including foam circulation units, for underbalanced drilling, over 35 snubbing units, over 15 coiled tubing units and over 10 wireline units for cased-hole measurement and pipe recovery services. Its pumping services business focuses primarily on lower horsepower cementing, acidizing and fracturing services markets. Its rental and fishing tool business provides a range of specialized services and equipment that is utilized on a non-routine basis for both drilling and well servicing operations. Drilling and well servicing rigs are equipped with a range of tools to complete routine operations under normal conditions for projects in the geographic area in which they are employed.The Company's Coiled tubing services involve the use of a continuous metal pipe spooled on reel for oil and natural gas well interventions, including wellbore maintenance, nitrogen services, thru-tubing services, and formation stimulation using acid and other chemicals. Its snubbing service business utilizes specialized equipment to run or remove pipe and other associated downhole tools into a wellbore. Its snubbing services are utilized for both routine and non-routine workover, completion and remedial activities. Cased-hole wireline services typically utilize a single truck equipped with a spool of wireline that is used to lower and raise a range of specialized tools in and out of a cased wellbore. The tools can be used to measure pressures and temperature, as well as the condition of the casing and the cement that holds the casing in place. Other applications for wireline tools include placing equipment in or retrieving equipment from the wellbore, or perforating the casing and cutting off pipe that is stuck in the well so that the free section can be recovered.Fluid ServicesThe Company's Fluid Services segment provides oilfield fluid supply, transportation, storage and construction services. The services are required in most workover, completion and remedial projects and are routinely used in daily producing well operations. Its fluid services segment utilizes its fleet of approximately 1,050 fluid service trucks and related assets, including specialized tank trucks, storage tanks, water wells, disposal facilities, water treatment, and construction and other related equipment. Each fluid service truck is equipped to pump fluids from or into wells, pits, tanks and other storage facilities. The assets provide, transport, store and dispose of a range of fluids, as well as provide well site construction and maintenance services. Its services include the transportation of fluids used in drilling and workover operations and of salt water produced as a by-product of oil and natural gas production; the sale and transportation of fresh and brine water used in drilling and workover activities; the rental of portable frac tanks and test tanks used to store fluids on well sites; the recycling and treatment of wastewater, including produced water and flowback, to be reused in the completion and production process; the operation of company-owned fresh water and brine source wells and of non-hazardous wastewater disposal wells, and the preparation, construction and maintenance of access roads, drilling locations, and production facilities. Its fluid services segment has a base level of business volume related to the regular maintenance of oil and natural gas wells. Its fluid service trucks are used to transport the flowback produced as a result of the fracturing operations from the well site to disposal wells.The Company owns approximately 85 salt water disposal wells. Its fluid service trucks transport the fluids that are disposed of in the salt water disposal wells. Its network of fresh and brine water stations, particularly in the Permian Basin where surface water is generally not available, is used to supply water necessary for the drilling and completion of oil and natural gas wells. Its fluid storage tanks can store over 500 barrels of fluid and are used by oilfield operators to store various fluids at the well site, including fresh water, brine and acid for frac jobs, flowback, temporary production and mud storage. It transports the tanks on its trucks to well locations that are usually within a 50-mile radius of its nearest yard. Frac tanks are used during various phases of the life of a producing well. It utilizes various water treatment methods in order to treat produced water and flowback that is transported to one of several treatment locations throughout its geographic footprint. It utilizes a fleet of power units, including dozers, trenchers, motor graders, backhoes and other heavy equipment used in road construction. In addition, it owns rock pits in some markets in its Rocky Mountain operations.Well ServicingThe Company's Well Servicing segment includes a range of services performed with a mobile well servicing rig, also referred to as a workover rig, and ancillary equipment. Its rigs and personnel provide the means for hoisting equipment and tools into and out of the well bore, and its well servicing equipment and capabilities also facilitate other services performed on a well. Its well servicing segment services include maintenance work involving removal, repair and replacement of down-hole equipment and returning the well to production after the operations are completed; hoisting tools and equipment required by the operation into and out of the well, or removing equipment from the well bore, to facilitate specialized production enhancement and well repair operations performed by other oilfield service companies, and plugging and abandonment services when a well has reached the end of its productive life. Its well servicing segment also includes the manufacturing and sale of new workover rigs through its subsidiary, Taylor Industries, LLC. Its fleet includes approximately 420 well servicing rigs, including over 220 newbuilds. Its well servicing rigs operate from facilities in Texas, Wyoming, Oklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico, Louisiana, Colorado, California, Arkansas, Utah, Montana, Kansas, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It provides well service rigs, equipment and crews to its customers for the maintenance services. Its other services include pulling the rods, tubing, pumps and other downhole equipment out of the well bore to identify and repair a production problem. In addition to periodic maintenance, producing oil and natural gas wells require repairs or modifications called workovers. Workover services include extensions of existing wells to drain new formations either through perforating the well casing to expose additional productive zones not previously produced, deepening well bores to new zones or the drilling of lateral well bores. New well completion services involve the preparation of newly drilled wells for production. It provides well service rigs to assist in this completion process. Well servicing rigs are also used in the process of permanently closing oil and natural gas wells. Plugging and abandonment work can be performed with a well servicing rig along with wireline and cementing equipment.Contract DrillingThe Company's Contract Drilling segment employs drilling rigs and related equipment to penetrate the earth to a desired depth and initiate production. It owns and operates approximately 10 land drilling rigs, which are deployed in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. A land drilling rig generally consists of engines, a draw works, a mast, pumps to circulate the drilling fluid (mud) under various pressures, blowout preventers, drill string and related equipment. The engines power the different pieces of equipment, including a rotary table or top drive that turns the drill string, causing the drill bit to bore through the subsurface rock layers.The Company competes with Key Energy Services, Inc., Superior Energy Services Inc., C&J Energy Services Ltd., Forbes Energy Services Ltd. and Pioneer Energy Services Corp.

FORT WORTH, Texas, Dec. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Basic Energy Services, Inc. (NYSE:    BAS) ("Basic" or the "Company") today announced that the Company received approval to list its new common stock with the new CUSIP number 06985P 209 (the "New Common Shares") on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the same NYSE ticker symbol "BAS" as the existing shares of the Company's issued common stock (the "Existing Shares"), in conjunction with its anticipated emergence from chapter 11 reorganization in accordance with the First Amended Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Basic Energy Services, Inc. and its Affiliated Debtors (as confirmed, the "Prepackaged Plan") that was confirmed on December 9, 2016 by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. 


The Company currently anticipates emerging from bankruptcy on December 23, 2016 (the "Effective Date").  The stockholders of record at the close of business on the Effective Date will be entitled to receive New Common Shares and warrants with the CUSIP number 06985P 118 (the "Warrants") in accordance with the Prepackaged Plan. In addition, participants in the Company's previously announced rights offering (the "Rights Offering') who have properly exercised their rights pursuant thereto, and/or are backstop parties to the Rights Offering, will also receive New Common Shares on the Effective Date.  All Existing Shares (with the CUSIP number 06985P 100) will be cancelled after the close of business on the Effective Date, and the New Common Shares and Warrants will be issued at such time.
Assuming emergence on the Effective Date of December 23, 2016, trading in the New Common Shares is expected to commence on December 27, 2016, under the ticker symbol "BAS," which is the same trading symbol used for the Company's common stock previously listed on the NYSE.  The Warrants will not be listed on the NYSE or any other exchange at this time.
Because the Company will retain the ticker symbol "BAS" after the effective date of the Prepackaged Plan, holders of Existing Shares, and brokers, dealers and agents effecting trades in Existing Shares, and persons who expect to receive New Common Shares or effect trades in New Common Shares, should take note of the anticipated cancellation of the Existing Shares and issuance of New Common Shares, and the two different CUSIP numbers signifying the Existing Shares and the New Common Shares, in trading or taking any other actions in respect of shares of the Company that trade under the "BAS" ticker.
Pro Forma Ownership Summary
As previously disclosed, under the Prepackaged Plan, pre-petition holders of the Company's unsecured notes will receive 14,925,000 New Common Shares, representing approximately 57.8% of the New Common Shares after giving effect to shares issuable in connection with the rights offering and before giving effect to the shares issuable under the management incentive plan (the "MIP") and the Warrants.  The pre-petition Basic stockholders will receive 75,000 New Common Shares, or an equivalent of an approximate 1-for-570.093480 reverse stock split, and Warrants to purchase 2,066,598 New Common Shares, or approximately 1 Warrant for each 20.689564 Existing Shares (each based on approximately 42.8 million Existing Shares issued and outstanding and subject to rounding).  
The table below summarizes the new ownership structure of Basic.

 Note: Final share allocations may vary slightly from the amounts set forth above due to rounding in accordance with the Prepackaged Plan. 






 (1)   Shares issued pursuant to rights offering contemplated by the Prepackaged Plan and a deemed conversion.  Includes shares issued to backstop parties as a backstop put premium. 






 (2)   Shares authorized under the MIP include 3,237,671 shares, of which the Company expects to issue time-based restricted stock unit awards ("RSUs") for 809,416 shares and stock option awards for 323,770 shares on the Effective Date vesting in 1/3 tranches on the Effective Date, and the first and second anniversaries of the Effective Date.  From the immediately vested RSUs, the Company anticipates issuing 269,810 shares on the Effective Date.  The remainder of the authorized awards, including 809,416 performance- based RSUs and 323,770 performance-based stock options contemplated by the Prepackaged Plan, may be awarded in the future at the discretion of the Company's board of directors.   






 (3)   The Warrants have an exercise price of $55.25 and a term of seven years. 




The occurrence of the Effective Date is subject to conditions set forth in the Prepackaged Plan, and the Company can make no assurances as to whether the Effective Date will occur on December 23, 2016.
