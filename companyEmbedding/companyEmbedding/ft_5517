Royal Maca - Whole World Botanicals


















































































 
















Royal Maca













What is Maca?

Botanical Name: Uncaria tomentosa
Maca root is a cruciferous root vegetable that grows high in the Andes Mountains of Peru – over 14,000 feet above sea level. It is never eaten raw by the indigenous people in Peru. Note: The botanical name is in dispute in Peru, but the two names (meyenni and peruvianum) do not indicate a separate species.
Traditionally, Maca root is used

To promote sexual health in men and women in all stages of life*
To promote vitality, stamina, energy, and mood balance*
To promote bowel regularity*
To enhance fertility*

Through Scientific Research, Maca root has been shown

Enhance energy, libido, stamina, and sexual function*
Promote hormone balance in men and women by increasing the tissue levels of IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor-1), which is vital in hormone balancing*
Have adaptogenic-like effects appropriate to gender and age*
Promote healthy reproductive function*
Promote healthy endocrine gland function (thyroid, pancreas, adrenal glands, testes, ovaries)*
Increase receptors for neurotransmitter hormones (mood, sleep, cognitive function)*
Support collagen-based structures (bone, muscles, hair, skin, nails)*

What Makes Royal Maca® Royal?
Single-Source, IndigenousTM
Instead of purchasing raw materials from middle-men, WWB does hands-on sourcing in Peru. Whole World Botanicals has partnered with the same five Maca growing communities since 1998! We offer fair trade prices and concern for the well-being of our maca growers and their families.
Our Maca growers plant and harvested according to the phases of the moon and say prayers in the traditional way of millennia – making our products bioenergetic. Ingredient companies are always looking for the cheapest sources, which means their raw materials change every time they buy and the purchaser has no knowledge of where or who the raw materials come from. Even though 70-80% of Maca in the United States is now sourced in China, be assured that Royal Maca® will always be grown and harvested in Peru.
Superior Processing for Maximum Potency

Royal Maca® is organically grown in composted soil and sun-dried after harvest for 6-8 weeks to ensure maximum potency in the Maca roots. Next is the flash-cooking process called “gelatinization” which destroys toxic enzymes found in raw Maca. Our Maca powder concentrate is certified organic, vegan, and gluten-free. The potency translates to smaller doses and a better economic value to the customer.
Specialty Products for Women and Men
No other Maca product on the market offers a variety of specialty hormone-balancing products for women and for men. These special formulations of Royal Maca® products more effectively meet each consumer’s unique health needs.

For Young and Petite or Sensitive Women
For Menstruating Women
For Women at risk for breast cancer
For Women in Peri-menopause
For Women in Post Menopause
For Men of all ages
For Men over the age of 35
For Men at risk for prostate cancer

Well!  We got our plans and began construction about 6 weeks ago! This crazy rainy wintery weather has held us back but we are finally rolling along!  We are so excited to complete our new home!  So far it is looking quaint and cozy!  Wish I could share the pictures as well!

            Durham Drive Description - 5517
          

A wrap around front porch gives sheltered entry and creates a nice place set to the side for a porch swing with plenty of room to actually swing.A formal foyer leads to the family via a study which can double as guest room or 4th bedroom.The 11' tall family and kitchen are wide open and include lots of view and natural light to the rear via french doors and large windows.A nice size utility between the kitchen and garage provides space for not only washer and dryer, but folding area and potentially a sink or freezer space.The master suite has access to the lanai via french doors and has lots of natural light and view.  His and hers walk-in closets buffer the master bath from the bedroom.  An over sized garden tub provides additional decoration space and a seat is included in the shower.Optional basement plans will make use of the stair in the rear adjacent the utility to access the lower level.  For those with no basement needs, this space can  be used for storage.

ManuFacts


When Cole Davis founded Keystone RV in 1996 his vision was clear:  Build a quality RV loaded with features priced thousands less than other RVs on the market.  To accomplish his goal, Cole would recruit and build a strong team, focus on keeping overhead low, and empower the people closest to the customer to make decisions.Within a few short months after opening the doors, Keystone produced its very first camper.  Delivering big on quality, features and value, the public fell in love with it.  A star was born!  As the appetite for the camper increased, new Keystone models were added to satisfy growing customer demand. Along with this tremendous growth came the need for expanded production.  To meet this need more manufacturing plants were built and staffed. From new floor plan designs to patented inventions, Keystone leads the way in product innovation.  One reason is our mission to stay close to the customer.  When talking with campers or visiting dealerships, our sales, product development, and service teams, are always looking for ways to improve the camping experience.  And we don't stop there.Every member of the Keystone family is encouraged to contribute to making our campers absolutely the best possible.  Through something we call Kamp Keystone, our employees camp free of charge at local campgrounds in the Keystone trailers we supply.  Each year hundreds of our production workers, administrative staff and service team enjoy a day (or a week) at Kamp Keystone.  Their evaluation of the experience and the feedback they provide results in continued product improvements.  Ask us if we use our RVs...the answer is YES!

What Makes Royal Break-StoneTM Royal?
Double Strength Extract and Capsules
We call our extracts “double strength” because most other companies do not offer the 1:1 (one part plant material to one part solvent for liquid extracts and the equivalent of one gram of herb in a 400mg capsule). They offer a 1:2 or 1:4 strength, which means two to four times as much solvent as plant material.
Purity
Royal Chanca Piedra liquid extracts are manufactured from purified water with vegetable glycerin. It is prepared from leaves freshly picks and dried especially for Whole World Botanicals. Species identification is authenticated for each lot by thin layer chromatography.
Superior Processing and Testing
The plant material is collected in Peru and manufactured in the United States. Heavy metal content is undetectable in the Royal GraviolaTM liquid extract. Each batch undergoes Fingerprint analysis (IRTLC) and Gas Chromatography (potency testing). How the raw materials are processed is also key to product potency. At WWB, we have complete control over collection, processing, and manufacturing, and bottling. We are committed to the highest standards.
Pleasant Taste
This delicate fern-like plant makes a very pleasant tasting tea. It can be taken on a regular basis for its health enhancing properties. Add a squeeze of lemon, if you like.
Different Formulations
One cup of Royal Chanca Piedra tea, made with one gram (one teaspoon) of dried herb simmered for 15 minutes in 1 ½ cups of water is equal in strength to 30 drops of the liquid extract (one milliliter) or one capsule containing the extract from 400mg of dried herb plus almost 400mg of powdered leaf. They all work equally well.

                    Buy the family pass! My family loves going to this zoo over and over, there is so much to do! One of our favorite exhibits is the giraffes, looking down onto them you can hand-feed them. We also love the Australian Outback where you can go inside and be right next to the kangaroos :D OH and don't forget to see the porcupines in the "live" rainforest on your way out! https://clevelandmetroparks.com/zoo

                    Gosh, where to begin?  Well known for sports, business, dining and night life - there really is a lot to do in Cleveland.  But what about the younger ones?  My children have personally enjoyed the Children's Museum and Great Lakes Science Center.  Both affordable & family friendly.  But one of the all time fav's, that is an annual event, is a day out at the Cleveland Zoo!  The kids love it all but a few of the families most cherished times are climbing around the Yagga Tree & the train ride at Wallaby Walkabout.  Personally (not having the same awesome energy of my kiddo's) I absolutely value & enjoy the free Tram ride!  But regardless which exhibit we linger the longest, we always end every trip saving the Rain Forest for last.  This is where you'll see some of the coolest amphibians, rain forest aviary & the amazing Orangutan
