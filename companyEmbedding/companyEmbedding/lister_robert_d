R.A. Lister Products















 
















 






 
      R.A. Lister Products





 

The R.A. Lister works have produced a huge range of different products 
        throughout its lifetime. After formation in 1867, the company started 
        out making agricultural implements including chaff cutters, corn crushers, 
        oat cleaners, land rollers, horse gears, chain harrows and stone grinding 
        mills. By the 1890s it was manufacturing the Dursley 
        Pedersen Cycle and dairy equipment, especially cream separators which 
        it shipped in volume.
Petrol engines followed in the early 20th century which went on to be 
        a mainstay of the company until diesels began to be produced in 1929. 
        From that time onwards the diesels began to capture the volume markets 
        and the last petrol engines were produced in the 1960s. Other parts of 
        the business that thrived in the early 1900s include the shearing equipment 
        and woodware sections which added a different dimension to the company 
        portfolio.
Today, in 2003, the Lister-Petter company concentrates on diesel engines 
        and generator sets, the shearing business having become a separate business 
        which is fortunately also still located in Dursley.

            pasteurisers, milking machines and cream separators. The woodware 
            department, in which the churns were manufactured, was established 
            in Howard's Mill in 1902 which then became known as the Churn Works.

            furniture covering everything from garden seats, plant tubs, bellows 
            and small coopercraft items, some of which were made from the timber 
            of old battleships. Apart from use within the home they often formed 
            part of the furnishings on large luxurious ocean liners. This example 
            has the words "Saracens Head" carved in the upper panel 
            and probably came from an inn or hotel.

            of products. Made from oiled Burma teak and galvanised steel these 
            baskets were widely used by local authorities.

Joseph Lister
Citation: C N Trueman "Joseph Lister"historylearningsite.co.uk. The History Learning Site, 17 Mar 2015. 24 Jul 2017. 





Joseph Lister is alongside the likes Louis Pasteur, Robert Koch, Alexander Fleming and Edward Jenner in the work he did to further medical knowledge. Joseph Lister did not discover a new drug but he did make the like between lack of cleanliness in hospitals and deaths after operations. For this reason, he is known as the ‘Father of Antiseptic Surgery’.

Lister was born in 1827 and died in 1912. As Professor of Surgery at Glasgow University, he was very aware that many people survived the trauma of an operation but died afterwards of what was known as ‘ward fever’.
Work on ward cleanliness and the link between germs and good post-operative health had already been studied by a Hungarian doctor called Ignaz Semmelweiss. He argued that if a doctor went from one patient to another after doing surgery, that doctor would pass on to the next visited patient a potentially life threatening disease. He insisted that those doctors who worked for him wash their hands in calcium chloride after an operation and before visiting a new patient.
Deaths on the wards Semmelweiss was in charge of fell from 12% to just 1%. But despite this, he came up against the conservatism of those who dominated Hungarian medicine and his findings were ignored. Semmelweiss died in 1865 of blood poisoning.
In 1865, Lister read about the work done by Louis Pasteur on how wine was soured. Lister believed that it was microbes carried in the air that caused diseases to be spread in wards. People who had been operated on were especially vulnerable as their bodies were weak and their skin had been cut open so that germs could get into the body with more ease.
Lister decided that the wound itself had to be thoroughly cleaned. He then covered the wound with a piece of lint covered in carbolic acid. He used this treatment on patients who had a compound fracture. This is where the broken bone had penetrated the skin thus leaving a wound that was open to germs. Death by gangrene was common after such an accident. Lister covered the wound made with lint soaked in carbolic acid. His success rate for survival was very high.
Lister then developed his idea further by devising a machine that pumped out a fine mist of carbolic acid into the air around an operation. The number of patients operated on by Lister who died fell dramatically.
