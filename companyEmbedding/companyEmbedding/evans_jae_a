Get to know JAE Evans




For 10 years while a resident of Los Angeles CA, Jae had a thriving career in the entertainment advertising industry where he designed movie posters and trailer campaigns.  In search for something new and challenging, he migrated to the Northwest and found himself a home at TeamBuilder/John L. Scott. With his obvious knack for marketing, entrepreneurial spirit and genuinely like-able personality, Jae has once again found success, but this time in real estate. With exceptional knowledge in residential, land and investment real estate transactions, Jae brings an honest and hardworking approach to every client and property. Armed with a gift for problem solving and out of the box ideas, success is always close at hand. Successful in life as well, Jae lives in Bellevue with his 10 year-old son, Ethan, and his wife, Tori.






Certifications




 Because of the strong demand, Jae has become one of the few Certified Short Sale Specialists trained to deal with Short Sales, Foreclosures and otherwise Distressed Property.  As a Washington Certified Short Sale Specialist or CSSS, Jae has special training in the complexities of the short sale and or foreclosure process. His expertise allows him help decide whether Short Sale, Bankruptcy, Loan Modification or all three are right for you as well as to negotiate with the lender, find the right buyer, and close the deal before the home goes into foreclosure if that approache deems advisable.  Being in a distressed position when it comes to your home is never pleasant and often frightening. Especially if you don't have the skills and knowledge to cope. Jae has those skills and knowledge and can help make even the most dire situations much more manageable.
