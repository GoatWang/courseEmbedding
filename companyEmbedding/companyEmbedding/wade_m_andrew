Early years and A Wish for Marilynne (2002–2006)[edit]


I wanted a name to go with our style but I didn’t want people to hear the name and say “Oh they’re Christian they’re no good” so I came up with a somewhat neutral name that matched our style.[2]

– Ben Wade, A Wish for Marilynne bassist, on the band's name, 2004
In August 2002, Wade started playing guitar and singing lead vocals[1] in Christian rock/emo band A Wish for Marilynne.[nb 1][2] By September 2003, the band had written seven songs,[nb 2] three of which made it on to a demo tape, that was recorded four months prior.[nb 3][3] In an interview with the Ocala Star-Banner the band said that once they had ten songs they were going to start recording, and Wade said "it's (going to) be a lot better than the demo."[3] By this point, the group had performed a total of twelve shows.[3] The band started recording their album,[4] Poetic Chaos,[5] at Wade's The Wade Studio on May 10, 2004,[4] with a projected release date of June.[5]
In June, the band were booking dates for a summer tour with bands A Midnight and May and There for Tomorrow.[5] The band performed at Easy Street in Ocala, Florida on June 3 with bands Starting Over and A Day to Remember, and at The Masquerade in Ocala, Florida on June 20 with bands Inkblot (Cornerstone '04), Vindicated Youth, and Knox Overstreet.[5] In August, the band said on their website that the album would "be ready by the end of summer".[6] Song songs were uploaded to the band's PureVolume account.[6] In December, the band announced recording had finished and release was soon to follow.[7] In February 2005, the band announced that the album, Poetic Chaos, was to be released on March 18.[8] A release show was held Central Christian Church on the same day, featuring bands There For Tomorrow, A Day to Remember, and Starting Over.[9] Song previews were also made available on the band's MySpace account.[9] In early 2006, the band announced they were no longer together.[10]
Record producer (2004–present)[edit]
By October 2004, The Wade Studio's equipment was the following: Soundcraft Spirit E8 Mixer, Multicom Pro XL - compressor/limiter/gate, Soundtech ST31EQ - 31 band equalizer, Creative I-Trigue L3500 100 watt monitoring system, Edirol MA-10ABK Stereo Powered Monitors, a variety of plugins, Studiologic velocity-sensitive MIDI controller, Cad M177 condenser mic, Nady SCM900 condenser mic, Shure SM57, 3 CAD TSM411 dynamic drum mics, pair of Apex 170 condenser mics, and a CAD KBM412 large-diameter dynamic kick mic.[11]
Wade, along with Drew Russ, under the name Manly Masculine Men[12] recorded the theme song, "Making History", for the web series that was to support A Day to Remember's Common Courtesy (2013) album.[13] "Making History" was released a single, under the name Manly Masculine Men on October 25.[14][15]
Wade taught an online course in guitar production for creativeLIVE on both October 22 and 23.[16]

Early years and A Wish for Marilynne (2002–2006)[edit]


I wanted a name to go with our style but I didn’t want people to hear the name and say “Oh they’re Christian they’re no good” so I came up with a somewhat neutral name that matched our style.[2]

– Ben Wade, A Wish for Marilynne bassist, on the band's name, 2004
In August 2002, Wade started playing guitar and singing lead vocals[1] in Christian rock/emo band A Wish for Marilynne.[nb 1][2] By September 2003, the band had written seven songs,[nb 2] three of which made it on to a demo tape, that was recorded four months prior.[nb 3][3] In an interview with the Ocala Star-Banner the band said that once they had ten songs they were going to start recording, and Wade said "it's (going to) be a lot better than the demo."[3] By this point, the group had performed a total of twelve shows.[3] The band started recording their album,[4] Poetic Chaos,[5] at Wade's The Wade Studio on May 10, 2004,[4] with a projected release date of June.[5]
In June, the band were booking dates for a summer tour with bands A Midnight and May and There for Tomorrow.[5] The band performed at Easy Street in Ocala, Florida on June 3 with bands Starting Over and A Day to Remember, and at The Masquerade in Ocala, Florida on June 20 with bands Inkblot (Cornerstone '04), Vindicated Youth, and Knox Overstreet.[5] In August, the band said on their website that the album would "be ready by the end of summer".[6] Song songs were uploaded to the band's PureVolume account.[6] In December, the band announced recording had finished and release was soon to follow.[7] In February 2005, the band announced that the album, Poetic Chaos, was to be released on March 18.[8] A release show was held Central Christian Church on the same day, featuring bands There For Tomorrow, A Day to Remember, and Starting Over.[9] Song previews were also made available on the band's MySpace account.[9] In early 2006, the band announced they were no longer together.[10]

Early years and A Wish for Marilynne (2002–2006)[edit]


I wanted a name to go with our style but I didn’t want people to hear the name and say “Oh they’re Christian they’re no good” so I came up with a somewhat neutral name that matched our style.[2]

– Ben Wade, A Wish for Marilynne bassist, on the band's name, 2004
In August 2002, Wade started playing guitar and singing lead vocals[1] in Christian rock/emo band A Wish for Marilynne.[nb 1][2] By September 2003, the band had written seven songs,[nb 2] three of which made it on to a demo tape, that was recorded four months prior.[nb 3][3] In an interview with the Ocala Star-Banner the band said that once they had ten songs they were going to start recording, and Wade said "it's (going to) be a lot better than the demo."[3] By this point, the group had performed a total of twelve shows.[3] The band started recording their album,[4] Poetic Chaos,[5] at Wade's The Wade Studio on May 10, 2004,[4] with a projected release date of June.[5]
In June, the band were booking dates for a summer tour with bands A Midnight and May and There for Tomorrow.[5] The band performed at Easy Street in Ocala, Florida on June 3 with bands Starting Over and A Day to Remember, and at The Masquerade in Ocala, Florida on June 20 with bands Inkblot (Cornerstone '04), Vindicated Youth, and Knox Overstreet.[5] In August, the band said on their website that the album would "be ready by the end of summer".[6] Song songs were uploaded to the band's PureVolume account.[6] In December, the band announced recording had finished and release was soon to follow.[7] In February 2005, the band announced that the album, Poetic Chaos, was to be released on March 18.[8] A release show was held Central Christian Church on the same day, featuring bands There For Tomorrow, A Day to Remember, and Starting Over.[9] Song previews were also made available on the band's MySpace account.[9] In early 2006, the band announced they were no longer together.[10]
Record producer (2004–present)[edit]
By October 2004, The Wade Studio's equipment was the following: Soundcraft Spirit E8 Mixer, Multicom Pro XL - compressor/limiter/gate, Soundtech ST31EQ - 31 band equalizer, Creative I-Trigue L3500 100 watt monitoring system, Edirol MA-10ABK Stereo Powered Monitors, a variety of plugins, Studiologic velocity-sensitive MIDI controller, Cad M177 condenser mic, Nady SCM900 condenser mic, Shure SM57, 3 CAD TSM411 dynamic drum mics, pair of Apex 170 condenser mics, and a CAD KBM412 large-diameter dynamic kick mic.[11]
Wade, along with Drew Russ, under the name Manly Masculine Men[12] recorded the theme song, "Making History", for the web series that was to support A Day to Remember's Common Courtesy (2013) album.[13] "Making History" was released a single, under the name Manly Masculine Men on October 25.[14][15]
Wade taught an online course in guitar production for creativeLIVE on both October 22 and 23.[16]

Early years and A Wish for Marilynne (2002–2006)[edit]


I wanted a name to go with our style but I didn’t want people to hear the name and say “Oh they’re Christian they’re no good” so I came up with a somewhat neutral name that matched our style.[2]

– Ben Wade, A Wish for Marilynne bassist, on the band's name, 2004
In August 2002, Wade started playing guitar and singing lead vocals[1] in Christian rock/emo band A Wish for Marilynne.[nb 1][2] By September 2003, the band had written seven songs,[nb 2] three of which made it on to a demo tape, that was recorded four months prior.[nb 3][3] In an interview with the Ocala Star-Banner the band said that once they had ten songs they were going to start recording, and Wade said "it's (going to) be a lot better than the demo."[3] By this point, the group had performed a total of twelve shows.[3] The band started recording their album,[4] Poetic Chaos,[5] at Wade's The Wade Studio on May 10, 2004,[4] with a projected release date of June.[5]
In June, the band were booking dates for a summer tour with bands A Midnight and May and There for Tomorrow.[5] The band performed at Easy Street in Ocala, Florida on June 3 with bands Starting Over and A Day to Remember, and at The Masquerade in Ocala, Florida on June 20 with bands Inkblot (Cornerstone '04), Vindicated Youth, and Knox Overstreet.[5] In August, the band said on their website that the album would "be ready by the end of summer".[6] Song songs were uploaded to the band's PureVolume account.[6] In December, the band announced recording had finished and release was soon to follow.[7] In February 2005, the band announced that the album, Poetic Chaos, was to be released on March 18.[8] A release show was held Central Christian Church on the same day, featuring bands There For Tomorrow, A Day to Remember, and Starting Over.[9] Song previews were also made available on the band's MySpace account.[9] In early 2006, the band announced they were no longer together.[10]
Record producer (2004–present)[edit]
By October 2004, The Wade Studio's equipment was the following: Soundcraft Spirit E8 Mixer, Multicom Pro XL - compressor/limiter/gate, Soundtech ST31EQ - 31 band equalizer, Creative I-Trigue L3500 100 watt monitoring system, Edirol MA-10ABK Stereo Powered Monitors, a variety of plugins, Studiologic velocity-sensitive MIDI controller, Cad M177 condenser mic, Nady SCM900 condenser mic, Shure SM57, 3 CAD TSM411 dynamic drum mics, pair of Apex 170 condenser mics, and a CAD KBM412 large-diameter dynamic kick mic.[11]
Wade, along with Drew Russ, under the name Manly Masculine Men[12] recorded the theme song, "Making History", for the web series that was to support A Day to Remember's Common Courtesy (2013) album.[13] "Making History" was released a single, under the name Manly Masculine Men on October 25.[14][15]
Wade taught an online course in guitar production for creativeLIVE on both October 22 and 23.[16]

When I finally saw Dr. Wade, he was on his phone talking to someone else and left the room several times to finish the phone call. Completely unprofessional and poor patient care overall.

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Conditions TreatedAbscessAcidosisAcute BronchitisAcute Lower Respiratory InfectionAcute PharyngitisAcute Upper Respiratory InfectionAsthmaAutoimmune DiseasesBronchiectasisBronchiolitisBronchitisBronchospasmCOPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)Chronic Pulmonary Heart Diseases (incl.

He was dismissive of my concerns and seemed uninterested in resolving my hand and wrist pain. He made deductions based on his own personal experience which did not seem to be a sound medical conclusion based on fact. I am wondering if he had some sort of bias against me? Will not return.55-Bonnie L Murphy in York, PA | May 05, 2017I was extremely satisfied with Dr. Andrews. He was very professional but still compassionate to my injuries.  He explained every step throughly to my satifaction. I would reccommend him to any one looking for an orthopedic surgeon.55-Michele Kelley in New Cumberland, PA | Apr 26, 2017As a physical therapist, I found myself needing surgery after an accident.  I was always impressed with OSS and their results that I saw in my patients.  I can't say enough about how personal my care was.  Dr. Andrews is excellent and truly cares.  I will be recommending him to anyone that I know as well as my patients.55-Mandy M. in New Cumberland, PA | Mar 23, 2017I have been a patient of Dr. Andrews since October 2016.   He has performed successful trigger finger release & bilateral carpal tunnel surgery on me over a 6 month time span.  Dr. Andrews has always been very pleasant to me and took the time to discuss treatment options & answer questions.  I completely trusted his input regarding my treatment and I'm very happy with the outcome of each surgery!   

I highly recommend Dr. Andrews to anyone dealing with hand issues.45-Linda S Litle in York, PA | May 10, 2016My symptoms were confusing and Dr. Andrews thought my hand trouble was coming from something else....I looked at the medicine I had been taking for my Breast Cancer and suspected that so I stopped taking it and the symptoms lessoned but did not go away so we scheduled a nerve study and found severe carpal tunnel syndrome.  The very morning after my surgery I knew I felt a great difference in my symptoms~  I highly recommend the CTRelease surgery.  Won't wait so long if there is a next time~15Mount Wolf, PA | May 08, 2016He had a horrible bedside manner. He seemed annoyed with me because my daughter is too active. He was cold and the appointment didn't last more than two minutes. 55-Rosemary H. in York, PA | Apr 27, 2016Attentive, responsiven 55York, PA | Apr 27, 2016I appreciate Dr. Andrews straight forward approach with my care and treatment.   55York, PA | Apr 22, 2016Dr. Andrews took in consideration all aspects of my problem. 
Did tests and carefully considered his options. 
In my case I know he can think out of the box.
Dr.  Andrews was very honest of what the out come of my surgery could or not do for me.


55-Linda S. in Red Lion, PA | Mar 31, 2016After reading the post by Annette I was dreading being sent to Dr. Andrews.  I was pleasantly surprised by his attentiveness to my saga regarding my medial epicondylitis and his honesty and thoroughness in explaining my options.  Normally I would not have written a review but I felt that at least one opposing position should be added.15-Annette Doelle in York, PA | Mar 01, 2016I just left Dr. Andrews appointment and it was not pleasant at all.
1. He entered the room and did not introduce himself, smile or ask me why I was there.
2. He then proceeded to examine my hand & wrist while I was already having severe pain. I understand pain is to expected, but his lack of concern for my pain and comfort level was absent.
3. He was offended I did not sign the consent to treat form because I had a question about it.More CommentsHave you seen Dr. Wade Andrews, MD?Leave a Review.Are you Dr. Andrews?Make it easy for patients to share their feedback.

However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Andrews has no media or publications listed.Background Check n/a Malpractice Claims not availableHealthgrades does not collect malpractice information for Pennsylvania.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Andrews' Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices.

Joyce Tielsch, RDN, LDN
Hi my name is Joyce Tielsch and I am a licensed registered dietitian. I received my nutrition degree from the University of Pittsburgh School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. This degree is not my only degree, I also hold a Bachelor’s of Science in Business and Chemistry from Saint Vincent College in Latrobe. An interesting fact about me is that I practiced in the United Kingdom for two years and was very involved in the American Overseas Dietetic Association and sat on the executive board while I lived and practiced in England.
Currently I hold two nutrition roles, my position here with Case Specific and I also work in the dialysis setting. I work with both dialysis patients as well as those patients that are Pre CKD (pre dialysis), I help educate people to prevent or postpone them going on dialysis.
I am a mom with two awesome children, both boys. I completely understand how busy kids can be as they grow and become involved in many activities and how your schedule is often determined by their schedule and their many activities. I enjoy staying active so I can keep up with them. Much of our family time is centered around physical activities that we do together. I also enjoy gardening cooking and entertaining. I am happy when I have a full house or full back yard filled with our family and friend’s laughter.
I love working with children and helping them learn about heathy eating and activities in a fun environment. I believe the same goes for us adults too, we want to have fun. I enjoy working with adults to come up with some fun ways to add physical activity into their lives while also focusing on the right foods for their body and to meet their needs. To many people navigating thru all the information out there on food and nutrition can get confusing and frustrating, I look forward to helping you find your way, your way to better health through learning how food is our source of energy and which portions are just right for you.
One of the reasons I enjoy being a dietitian is that I like to have the sense of helping someone feel better. I love to educate and see that someone can make a small change that I recommend and see a big difference in their health. I truly believe that we can all feel our best if we make some smart nutrition choices.
Joyce is located in the South Hills of Pittsburgh. To schedule a consultation with her, contact her office directly at: 412-275-0099 or email her at joycetielschdietitian@gmail.com
