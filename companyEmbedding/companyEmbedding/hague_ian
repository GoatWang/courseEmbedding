Product Liability Advocate











The Hague Convention: Defending a Japanese Company in U.S. PL Litigation



By Eimi Watanabe on March 17, 2014 Posted in General Litigation 



Japan is currently the fourth-largest U.S. trading partner, exporting on average, $130 billion in goods to the United States each year. More than half of all of those goods are manufactured products in the form of vehicles or machinery, making Japanese companies subject to a significant exposure in the area of U.S. product liability litigation.
The United States and Japan are signatories to The Hague Convention on the International Service of Process.  The application of the Hague Convention in product liability cases brought against Japanese companies has been sharply litigated.

The Hague Convention requires service of a Summons and Complaint on a foreign defendant to be executed through a designated “central authority,” a term that includes the ministries of foreign affairs in signatory countries. Service upon a Japanese company under the requirements of The Hague Convention is expensive and time-consuming. So, plaintiffs’ attorneys will attempt to evade the requirements for Hague service.
Japanese companies that are defendants in U.S. litigation commonly insist on service of the Summons and Complaint by The Hague Convention, and rightfully so.  Despite this long-standing international treaty, courts have eroded the  requirements under the Hague Convention for service of process over foreign companies. Based on the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Schlunk 486 U.S. 694, (1988), plaintiffs typically attempt to serve American subsidiaries as “agents” of their foreign parent companies. Basically, the Schlunk case created an exception to the Hague Convention service requirement. The decision stands for the notion that if there is an “agent” conducting business in a particular state, the plaintiff can serve that “agent.”
Recently, courts have held that the American subsidiaries of Japanese manufacturers are agents of their foreign parents. Two recent California decisions are examples of this.  One is against Yamaha and the other against Panasonic.  Both of these decisions arose out of the same asbestos case.
Some think this is a trend that may eventually undermine the purpose of the Hague Convention altogether. The courts in the cases mentioned above made the determination of whether a subsidiary is an agent based on the facts of each relationship and the specific activities of each subsidiary.  This does not mean Japanese defendants should abandon their rights to service of process under the Hague Convention. Instead, Japanese defendants should continue to object to methods of attempted service that do not comply with the requirements of the Hague Convention.
The recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746 (2014), may also help foreign defendants. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that there is rarely general jurisdiction over a company outside of its domiciled state (i.e., its state of incorporation and/or state where its principal place of business is located). This limitation on general jurisdiction may be used in opposition to a plaintiff’s attempt to serve a U.S. subsidiary of a Japanese company under the rationale that the subsidiary is the “agent” of the Japanese parent company.
An additional factor that has been relied on by plaintiffs’ attorneys in their attempt to avoid the expensive and time-consuming requirements for service on a Japanese company is the fact that Japan did not object to Article 10A of The Hague Convention. Article 10A expressly allows documents to be “sent” by mail. State courts have interpreted this inconsistently, some ruling that Article 10A is limited to sending documents by mail after a Summons and Complaint have been otherwise served, while others have ruled that article 10A allows service of a Summons and Complaint by mail. Japanese defendants need to review this issue in the states where they are named as defendants before deciding whether it is worthwhile to object to service of process that was not executed through a central authority in Japan.

A Passive House and "Sauna Tower" Join a 19th-Century Barn in the Hudson Valley - DwellSubscribeJoinLog InAdd HomeSign Up A Passive House and "Sauna Tower" Join a 19th-Century Barn in the Hudson ValleyAdd toLikeCommentShareBy Heather Corcoran / Published by Dwell – January 24, 2016Recommended by In New York, architecture and interiors firm BarlisWedlick creates an eclectic compound designed to suit a client with an idiosyncratic wish list.The open living-and-bedroom area of Ian Hague’s rural retreat can be divided by a wall that rises from within the master-suite platform. Interior designer Elaine Santos blended her client’s collection of vintage furniture with no-fuss pieces like a Shaker-style bench by Ilse Crawford for De La Espada. The dining chairs are a 1959 design by Arne Hovmand-Olsen for Mogens Kold.Two hours north of New York City, an unusual barn emerges from a hill just off a country road. Its black siding and bright-red window frames hint at the imaginative playground inside. This space, with its rope-railed catwalk and indoor tent, is just one element of the multifaceted getaway architecture and design firm BarlisWedlick Architects designed for fund manager Ian Hague. Farther up the hill sits its counterpoint, a 1,800-square-foot home designed to meet strict Passive House Institute efficiency standards. "I have a practical side, and a much more important whimsical side that most of the time I try to repress," says Hague, whose shock of silver hair offers a sense of gravitas tempered by his shorts and woven-leather espadrilles. His dual nature is represented in the mix of exuberant areas for socializing and more sedate private spaces spread out over a 75-acre parcel protected by the Columbia Land Conservancy. It is also reflected in his working relationship with the design team that has shaped the retreat. "Ian used imagery to communicate an overall sensibility and lifestyle he wanted to achieve," says interior designer Elaine Santos, who encouraged her client to think in abstract terms. "That said, he was also very intuitive in terms of what he selected—it was all based on instinct." The design program was developed over three and a half years, first with a 19th-century barn brought in from a nearby farm and reimagined as a hub for entertaining, filled with colorful rugs and a loft where Hague can work on his balsa-wood model airplanes. Then came the main house, a soothing space that recalls the barn in its volume and shou-sugi-ban cladding. A garage with a green roof, a three-story tower with a sauna at the base, and a natural pool free of chlorine round out the compound. As the architecture and interiors evolved together, the design team looked to Hague’s inspiration images, which ranged from whitewashed interiors to colorful, ladder-filled cottages. "They all spoke to a house that was modern for modern times, not too layered, and cabin-like," Santos recalls. "But what does ‘cabin’ mean? It means warm and cozy, a not-too-precious dwelling; somewhere you can retreat."   Connected to the main house by a narrow bridge, a three-story cedar tower with a sauna at its base recalls a tree house. The screened-in second level includes a table and chairs for enjoying an outdoor meal, while a swing on the tower’s top level provides a perch to take in the surrounding birch trees. The main house is constructed from structural insulated panels from Vermont Timber Frames and clad in charred cedar. The roof panels are by Agway Metals.While the main house serves as a place for quiet contemplation—"a hermitage in the forest," Hague calls it—it’s hardly ascetic. The open living area is outfitted with a mix of substantial pieces meant for lounging and lighter designs that Hague can move around to suit his moods. Nothing, least of all the oversize sofa made of reclaimed wood and upholstered in recycled canvas from Army tents, feels so formal that Hague can’t come in from the woods, grab a beer, and plop right down. A faux sheepskin rug, meanwhile, does double duty as a seating area for the home’s oft-barefoot resident. This casual arrangement is based on clues Santos picked up from Hague’s various collections. "Our investigation happened in a furniture warehouse in New Jersey," Santos explains. "We had these crates opened and it was really easy to see"—from the patina and surface scratches—"that he used everything he owned, which told us a lot." Together, these objects, everything from teak end tables and a Plycraft lounge to a Stickley daybed, presented a "broad range of what ‘modern’ meant to him." The bedding is intentionally simple, without layers of unnecessary pillows, and the "non-headboard headboard," as Santos describes it, is a loose macramé wall hanging by Sally England. The built-in storage wall that defines the space is painted Kendall Charcoal by Benjamin Moore in a matte finish—a shade used on millwork throughout the house. The Isaac brass sconces are from Schoolhouse Electric, and the floor lamp is from Crate & Barrel. The rocker was custom made by Onefortythree in Las Vegas.With this in mind, Santos hit on "neo-Shaker" as a keyword for the project. Everything in the house would need to be functional and inviting to the touch—"warm woods; nothing too coated." In this way, the tactile experience of objects was just as important as their aesthetics: Hague sat in every chair and touched nearly every material the team brought into the house. That’s how, with two sample beams in hand, the original whitewash inspiration fell in favor of a more natural finish. "These very early inspiration images were guidelines, but never did we ever go back to them and just make design decisions," says Santos. "It was a really collaborative design process with him about what felt right." A custom Stickbulb LED lamp hangs above a kitchen island topped by concrete from Get Real Surfaces. The beams are stained with LifeTime from Valhalla Wood Preservatives, which will oxidize the material over time.While the interiors of the house are restrained, the barn is full of energy. Near the wood-burning stove that heats the drafty space in winter, rugs from Hague’s travels are layered on the floor—"a true example of a collected life," Santos says. On the exterior, windows are set off in "a really sexy lipstick red." The specific hue was among Hague’s most direct requests on a list that also included a fireman’s pole to lead from the barn to an apartment downstairs.  While the house is a private sanctuary, the barn is a gathering place, especially in summer. On its lower level, a studio apartment recalls the main house with its Intus windows oriented to maximize solar gain.Altogether, the rural compound feels tailor-made for its owner and his many whims. "I really do use both spaces," Hague says of the split-personality property. "I feel like I’ve neglected one if I spend too much time at the other."   In the master bathroom, the cement floor tiles are by Mosaic House; the glazed subway tiles are from Daltile; and the trim is honed, vein-cut Montclair Danby marble. The Signature Hardware tub sits in a custom wood cradle designed to match the home’s timber frame; the fixtures are by Waterworks. The Twist stool is from Classic Country in nearby Hudson, New York.Vintage bent plywood stacking chairs by Roland Rainer are purposeful and can be moved to suit any situation.The contractor sourced the brass pole from a fire station in Boston. The surrounding wall is painted in semi-gloss paint in Citrus by Sherwin Williams, a sunny hue the team playfully referred to as Dwell-ow.Using technology to design a home as energy-efficient as possible was a priority for Hague, both from a financial and philosophical standpoint. Along with Passive House certification for the main house, a solar array on the roof of the barn keeps energy use near zero. In fact, the entire property was Net Zero before the addition of the pool, and it may soon generate an energy surplus with the addition of a second solar array at the main house.Achieving such efficiency and maintaining the integrity of the wetlands and woodlands on the property meant more research for both the designers and the resident—just getting approval for the siting of the buildings and the driveway took eight months—but Hague is hardly one to do things half way. "A lot of times couples engage in house-building, like birds. I'm doing this solo, more like a monk," he says of the deeply personal undertaking."Who better than the farmer and the farmer's family to know how most effectively and easily to find efficiency?" says architect Alan Barlis. Regional architecture inspired the barn-life structure of the house, an open volume that aides in efficient heating and cooling of the space.
