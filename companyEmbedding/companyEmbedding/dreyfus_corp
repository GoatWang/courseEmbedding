Dreyfus, established in 1951 and headquartered in New York City, is an American investment manager of investment products and strategies. The company merged with Mellon Financial in 1994, and then became a subsidiary of Bank of New York Mellon when Mellon Financial and The Bank of New York merged in 2007.
As a BNY Mellon company, Dreyfus provides access to its global network of asset managers, delivering investment insight and products — equity, fixed income, global/international and money market mutual funds, separately managed accounts, retirement and cash management strategies, asset allocation solutions and brokerage services. Dreyfus products are delivered through a variety of distribution channels: intermediary (advisor-sold), institutional, and retail direct.
History[edit]
The firm's origin dates back to 1947, when investor Jack Dreyfus founded a brokerage house in New York City named Dreyfus & Co.[2][3]
In 1951, attracted by the concept of mutual funds, Dreyfus & Co. purchased a small management company named John G. Nesbett & Co., Inc. with a small common stock fund called The Nesbett Fund Incorporated. Nesbett & Co. was renamed The Dreyfus Corporation, and The Nesbett Fund became The Dreyfus Fund Incorporated.[2][3]
Going public in 1965, Dreyfus was among the first money management firms to tap into the stock market for additional capital.[2][3]
In 1976, Dreyfus was among the first fund companies to introduce an incorporated tax-exempt municipal bond fund.[2][3]
In 1994, Dreyfus completed its landmark merger with Mellon Bank Corporation, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Mellon Financial Corporation. The merger, a milestone in the history of financial services in the United States, was at the time the largest-ever combination of a bank and mutual fund company.[4][2][3]
On July 1, 2007, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. and Mellon Financial Corporation merged to form a new company The Bank of New York Mellon, one of the world's largest global asset management and serving company. The reach of Dreyfus' distribution capabilities now extends to the resources of BNY Mellon and its exclusive network of institutional asset managers.[2][3]

History[edit]
In 1851, the company was founded in the Alsace region of France by Léopold Dreyfus, the 18-year-old son of a farmer from Sierentz, under the name of his father, Louis Dreyfus. Léopold purchased wheat from local farmers in Alsace and transported it to Basel in Switzerland, 13 kilometres (8 mi) away.[8] Léopold developed a fortune whilst still a teenager through cross border cereal trading. He rapidly diversified across shipping, weapons manufacturing, agriculture, oil and banking, thus establishing one of the wealthiest dynasties in Europe.[9] His descendants still own the company to this day. By the early 20th century, the Louis-Dreyfus family was described as one of the "five great fortunes of France". However, as a Jewish family during the Second World War much of the family assets were confiscated by the Vichy government and some members of the family fled to America.[10]
Leopold Louis-Dreyfus's great-grandson, Gérard Louis-Dreyfus, was chairman of Louis Dreyfus Energy Services, a subsidiary of the group involved in crude-oil trading, gas investments and infrastructure. Gérard is also the father of American actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the Emmy-winning star of Seinfeld. Another branch of the dynasty, based in Paris, was headed by Robert Louis-Dreyfus (who was also the CEO of Adidas) until his death in 2009. It is currently overseen by his widow, Russian-born Margarita Bogdanova Louis-Dreyfus.[11] A third branch of the family's business is headed by Philippe Louis-Dreyfus (born 1945) and is concerned primarily with offshore industrial activities and freight shipping operations.[12]

About Dreyfus

A leading provider of equity, fixed income and money market mutual funds, separately managed accounts, retirement and cash management strategies and asset allocation solutions.












Established in 1951, Dreyfus is among the pioneers of U.S. mutual fund investing with $270 billion in assets under management (as of June 30, 2017), Dreyfus is dedicated to helping meet investor challenges.
As part of BNY Mellon Investment Management, Dreyfus enables U.S. retail investors to access over 140 mutual funds from BNY Mellon’s 13 globally diversified investment boutiques, with investment solutions spanning global, international and domestic equity, fixed income, alternatives, retirement and cash management strategies. Dreyfus also includes Dreyfus Retail Direct and BNY Mellon Cash Investment Strategies, the 8th largest institutional cash manager (iMoneyNet, December 2016).



An Industry Pioneer
In the 1950s, the Dreyfus lion became the symbol of The Dreyfus Corporation. Breaking from traditional "tombstone" mutual fund advertising, the lion made his debut on television emerging from a subway station and striding down Wall Street. Later on, Dreyfus again stepped away from the pack when it published a full-color prospectus as a supplement to The New York Times. These advertisements were so distinctive that they received national press coverage. The lion continues to appear in Dreyfus advertising today and remains one of the most recognizable corporate trademarks in the United States.
 

First mutual fund to launch a retail advertising campaign
Among the first money management firms to go public and tap into the stock market for additional capital
First fund company to introduce an incorporated tax-exempt municipal bond fund
First to offer a short-term high-yield fund
Introduced the mutual fund industry's first simplified prospectus, designed as an investor-friendly summary
Among the first to provide internet trading for Money Market Funds
One of the first of offer institutional priced Money Market Funds
First to make Money Market Fund daily holdings accessible on its website

History
Dreyfus was among the pioneers of mutual fund investing and remains one of the most recognizable names in the business. We have strived to meet the changing needs of investors and investment professionals throughout our history. Today, the Dreyfus asset management philosophy is based on the belief that discipline and consistency are important to investment success. Dreyfus and the lion have come to symbolize the strength of our commitment to quality, performance and client relationships.






1950's - 1960's
1970's - 1980's
1990's
2000's





The firm's origin dates back to 1947, when legendary investor Jack Dreyfus founded a brokerage house in New York City named Dreyfus & Co.
In 1951, attracted by the concept of mutual funds, Dreyfus & Co. purchased a small management company named John G. Nesbett & Co., Inc. with a small common stock fund called The Nesbett Fund Incorporated. Nesbett & Co. was renamed The Dreyfus Corporation, and The Nesbett Fund became The Dreyfus Fund Incorporated.
In the 1950s, the Dreyfus lion became the symbol of The Dreyfus Corporation. In 1957, Dreyfus became the first mutual fund company to launch a retail advertising campaign. Breaking from traditional "tombstone" mutual fund advertising, the lion made his debut on television emerging from a subway station and striding down Wall Street.
Later on, Dreyfus again stepped away from the pack when it published a full-color prospectus as a supplement to The New York Times. These advertisements were so distinctive that they received national press coverage. The lion continues to appear in Dreyfus advertising today and remains one of the most recognizable corporate trademarks in the United States.
Going public in 1965, Dreyfus was among the first money management firms to tap into the stock market for additional capital.





In 1972, Dreyfus moved to the forefront of socially responsible investing by creating The Dreyfus Third Century Fund, Inc. It invests in companies that not only meet traditional investment standards, but also conduct business in a manner that is believed to contribute to a better quality of life.
Always sensitive to changing investor needs, Dreyfus was a leader in the area of money market funds with the launch of Dreyfus Liquid Assets in 1974. Dreyfus focused its sales efforts on the retail market, helping to lay the groundwork for the subsequent tremendous growth of money market funds.
In 1976, Dreyfus was the first fund company to introduce an incorporated tax-exempt municipal bond fund, Dreyfus Municipal Bond Fund.
In 1985, Dreyfus introduced its family of low expense Cash Management Funds. And in the latter half of the 1980s, Dreyfus responded to investor demand by creating its Strategic Funds family, which incorporates sophisticated trading techniques made available to mutual funds by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
Recognizing the increasing availability of dollar-denominated foreign bank deposit instruments, in 1989 we introduced Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund, a money market fund for retail investors that could invest in dollar-denominated foreign money market instruments.





In 1994, Dreyfus completed its landmark merger with Mellon Bank Corporation, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Mellon Financial Corporation. The merger, a milestone in the history of financial services in the United States, was at the time the largest-ever combination of a bank and mutual fund company.
In 1992, Dreyfus launched its first "BASIC" family of funds, designed to offer higher yields through lower operating expenses. And in the fall of 1996, Dreyfus created Dreyfus Short-Term High-Yield Fund, the first of its kind at the time.
In June 1998, Dreyfus introduced the mutual fund industry's first simplified prospectus designed to be an investor-friendly summary of the information contained in the full mutual fund prospectus.
Also in 1998, Mellon Financial Corporation acquired Founders Funds, which became the growth specialist affiliate of The Dreyfus Corporation, and became Dreyfus Founders Funds.





In February 2000, Dreyfus introduced separately managed accounts to further enhance the company's institutional and investment advisory business. This service provides individually managed client portfolios and related investment services through institutional channels such as broker-dealers or financial planners. Fayez Sarofim & Co., the Houston-based asset management firm that also sub-advises several Dreyfus mutual funds, became the first asset manager to work with the Dreyfus separate accounts business.
In January 2007, Dreyfus announced it had dramatically expanded its mutual fund lineup in 2006, adding 10 new offerings launched since December 2005, spanning equity, fixed income, international and global mandates, continuing to build on Dreyfus' long history of product innovation. With the extensive offerings and continued growth in its existing funds, Dreyfus' assets under management were approaching $200 billion. In July 2007, Dreyfus reached that milestone, crossing the threshold of $200 billion in assets under management.
On July 1, 2007, The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation merged to form a new company BNY Mellon, one of the world's largest global asset management and servicing companies.
As part of BNY Mellon Investment Management, one of the world's largest global investment managers, Dreyfus provides unique access to its exclusive and diverse global network of world-class asset managers, delivering powerful investment insight and strategies, including equity, fixed income and money market mutual funds, separately managed accounts, retirement and cash management strategies and asset allocation solutions.

Although a money market fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund.
