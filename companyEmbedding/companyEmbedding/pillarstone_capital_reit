About Pillarstone Capital REIT 








Pillarstone Capital is a Real Estate Investment Company focused on creating shareholder value through acquiring, developing and redeveloping non-retail, commercial real estate properties.
Investment Philosophy

Providing above-average risk-adjusted returns;
Pursuing strategies that benefit from disruptions in the marketplace;
Establishing ownership positions in real estate and related businesses and franchises;
Capturing enhanced value for investors through the acquisition and development of  underappreciated or challenged real estate; and
Partnering with people we trust.

Overview
Pillarstone values its relationships with all stakeholders, including shareholders and employees. With extensive structuring and restructuring experience, deep analytical ability, and real estate capital markets expertise, Pillarstone is well positioned to provide maximum return on and return of investments.
Investment Strategy
To extract intrinsic value and yield top-tier results, Pillarstone targets specific opportunities, asset classes and properties. Pillarstone achieves its growth-oriented ownership potential through recapitalizations, acquisitions, joint ventures, partnerships, and secondary investments and mortgages.
Execution Strategy
Pillarstone invests in people, properties, portfolios and companies that prevail in existing and/or growing markets that have been overlooked, undermanaged, or underperformed to exemplary standards.
Recapitalizations and Special Situations
In appropriate situations, Pillarstone will pursue recapitalizations and other situational investments such as paying-off or paying-down maturing debt, buying out existing ownership from investors, providing capital expenditures and making new investments to undercapitalized situations and acquire and re-zone land for redevelopment.
Primary Investments
Pillarstone’s primary investment thesis involves direct investment in real estate opportunities to outperform the market.
Secondary Investments
Secondary investment interests are also an important part of the Pillarstone business model. These opportunities include equity interests in private real estate ventures, joint ventures, partnerships, portfolios and individual assets from existing investors, lenders and real estate market securities that are trading well below Net Asset Value.
Other Related Information
Founded in 1994, Pillarstone was acquired in 2003 through the acquisition of Stonehaven Trust, which historically acquired and owned real estate with investment portfolios in the U.S.

Pillarstone Capital REIT Completes Acquisition Of 14 Real Estate Assets






GlobeNewswire



Dec 8, 2016 5:17 PM EST













 




























































 HOUSTON, Dec. 08, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pillarstone Capital REIT (OTC:PRLE) ("Pillarstone" or the "Company") today announced that it has acquired 14 real estate assets from Whitestone REIT (NYSE:WSR) ("Whitestone"). Pillarstone has acquired the 14 real estate assets for a total transaction value of approximately $84.0 million from Whitestone, a company affiliated with certain members of Pillarstone's management team and Board of Trustees. Pillarstone Capital REIT Operating Partnership, LP ("OP") will assume approximately $65.9 million of debt associated with the properties, and Whitestone will receive operating partnership units ("OP Units") ¿of the OP valued at approximately $18.1 million 1, comprising approximately 84% of the ownership of the OP. Following the acquisition, it is expected that Whitestone will consolidate the OP on its financial statements due to its significant equity ownership of the OP.  Key Benefits of the Transaction  Positions Pillarstone to pursue new value-enhancing real estate investment opportunities and develop and redevelop the acquired properties. Retains Whitestone's property management and leasing agreements and expertise for two years following the close of the transaction. Whitestone and Pillarstone will own 84% and 16%, respectively, of the OP Units.   Special Committee ProcessThe transaction is the result of an active and extensive process led by Special Committees formed by the Boards of both companies, along with each Special Committee's advisors. Both Special Committees were composed entirely of disinterested, independent trustees. The Pillarstone Special Committee and the Board of Trustees unanimously approved the transaction. "This is a transformative transaction that will allow Pillarstone to focus on specific high-growth markets and capitalize on private and public real estate opportunities," said Dennis Chookaszian, a trustee of Pillarstone and member of Pillarstone's Special Committee. "Through this acquisition, we will have the ability to pursue a number of attractive ROI opportunities, including the potential redevelopment of the acquired assets for multi-family, industrial or office uses."
