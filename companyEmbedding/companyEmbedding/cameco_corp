History[edit]
"Cameco - Canadian Mining and Energy Corporation" was formed in 1988 by the merger and privatization of two crown corporations: the federally owned Eldorado Nuclear Limited (known previously as Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited) and Saskatchewan-based Saskatchewan Mining Development Corporation (SMDC). The name was later shortened to "Cameco Corporation".
The new company was initially owned 62% by the provincial government and 38% by the federal government. The initial public offering (IPO) for 20% of the company was conducted in July, 1991. Government ownership of the company decreased over the next eleven years, with full privatization occurring in February, 2002.
In 1996, Cameco acquired Power Resources Inc., the largest uranium producer in the United States. This was followed in 1998 by the acquisition of Canadian-based Uranerz Exploration and Mining Limited and Uranerz U.S.A., Inc.
In 2012, it acquired a nuclear fuel intermediary Nukem Energy.[4]
Operations[edit]




Head office


Cameco operates uranium mines in North America and Kazakhstan, including McArthur River-Key Lake, the world's largest uranium producer, and Cigar Lake, the world's highest grade uranium mine, both in Saskatchewan. Other operations in Saskatchewan include a mine and mill at Rabbit Lake, currently in care and maintenance.
In the United States, Cameco operates uranium mines in the states of Nebraska and Wyoming through its US subsidiary Cameco Resources Inc. Cameco Resources was formed in 2007 through a restructuring of two wholly owned subsidiaries, Power Resources Inc. (Wyoming) and Crow Butte Resources, Inc. (Nebraska).
In the province of Ontario, Cameco operates a uranium refinery in Blind River and a uranium conversion facility in Port Hope, which has faced opposition from some community groups.[5][6] Through the Bruce Power Limited Partnership (BPLP), Cameco also participates in nuclear power generation in the province.
In 2004, Cameco spun off its gold mining operations in Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and the USA to a newly formed public company, Centerra Gold. Cameco divested its remaining interest in Centerra on December 30, 2009.[7]

In the News[edit]
In January 2011, Cameco participated in the clean up of a ship-board uranium concentrate spill on the MCP Altona that had occurred on December 23, 2010.[8]
In 2011, Cameco signed an agreement with Talvivaara Mining Company whereby Cameco would pay US$60 million to construct a uranium extraction circuit at the Talvivaara nickel-zinc mine in Sotkamo. Talvivaara would then pay back the initial construction costs in the form of uranium concentrate; once the initial costs were paid Cameco would continue to purchase the uranium concentrate at a pricing formula based on market price on the day of delivery.[9]

History[edit]
"Cameco - Canadian Mining and Energy Corporation" was formed in 1988 by the merger and privatization of two crown corporations: the federally owned Eldorado Nuclear Limited (known previously as Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited) and Saskatchewan-based Saskatchewan Mining Development Corporation (SMDC). The name was later shortened to "Cameco Corporation".
The new company was initially owned 62% by the provincial government and 38% by the federal government. The initial public offering (IPO) for 20% of the company was conducted in July, 1991. Government ownership of the company decreased over the next eleven years, with full privatization occurring in February, 2002.
In 1996, Cameco acquired Power Resources Inc., the largest uranium producer in the United States. This was followed in 1998 by the acquisition of Canadian-based Uranerz Exploration and Mining Limited and Uranerz U.S.A., Inc.
In 2012, it acquired a nuclear fuel intermediary Nukem Energy.[4]
Operations[edit]




Head office


Cameco operates uranium mines in North America and Kazakhstan, including McArthur River-Key Lake, the world's largest uranium producer, and Cigar Lake, the world's highest grade uranium mine, both in Saskatchewan. Other operations in Saskatchewan include a mine and mill at Rabbit Lake, currently in care and maintenance.
In the United States, Cameco operates uranium mines in the states of Nebraska and Wyoming through its US subsidiary Cameco Resources Inc. Cameco Resources was formed in 2007 through a restructuring of two wholly owned subsidiaries, Power Resources Inc. (Wyoming) and Crow Butte Resources, Inc. (Nebraska).
In the province of Ontario, Cameco operates a uranium refinery in Blind River and a uranium conversion facility in Port Hope, which has faced opposition from some community groups.[5][6] Through the Bruce Power Limited Partnership (BPLP), Cameco also participates in nuclear power generation in the province.
In 2004, Cameco spun off its gold mining operations in Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and the USA to a newly formed public company, Centerra Gold. Cameco divested its remaining interest in Centerra on December 30, 2009.[7]

In January 2011, Cameco participated in the clean up of a ship-board uranium concentrate spill on the MCP Altona that had occurred on December 23, 2010.[8]
In 2011, Cameco signed an agreement with Talvivaara Mining Company whereby Cameco would pay US$60 million to construct a uranium extraction circuit at the Talvivaara nickel-zinc mine in Sotkamo. Talvivaara would then pay back the initial construction costs in the form of uranium concentrate; once the initial costs were paid Cameco would continue to purchase the uranium concentrate at a pricing formula based on market price on the day of delivery.[9]

In the News[edit]
In January 2011, Cameco participated in the clean up of a ship-board uranium concentrate spill on the MCP Altona that had occurred on December 23, 2010.[8]
In 2011, Cameco signed an agreement with Talvivaara Mining Company whereby Cameco would pay US$60 million to construct a uranium extraction circuit at the Talvivaara nickel-zinc mine in Sotkamo. Talvivaara would then pay back the initial construction costs in the form of uranium concentrate; once the initial costs were paid Cameco would continue to purchase the uranium concentrate at a pricing formula based on market price on the day of delivery.[9]

Cameco Resources is America's largest uranium producer. Our mines in Nebraska and Wyoming provide more than half of America's domestically produced uranium used to generate clean-air electricity at nuclear power plants.

We use an environmentally friendly in situ process for mining. Uranium is produced through wellfields, rather than with open pits or underground shafts. There are no tailings dams or waste rock.

We operate only in areas where the natural groundwater is unsuitable for drinking purposes. Water is continually recycled and carefully monitored by the company. When mining is complete, we restore the water and reclaim the land to pre-mining conditions.

Fabrication Services
Cameco Fuel Manufacturing (CFM) fabricates a wide variety of highly specialized mechanisms used in pressurized light and heavy water reactor components for utility customers around the globe.
Contact Us for more information.
Core reactor components

Calandria Tubes & Calandria Spools
Calandria tubes are a unique pressure vessel, seam-welded tube designed specifically for the CANDU reactor. The calandria tube acts as a secondary pressure containment device in the unlikely event of a pressure tube failure. The calandria tube is considered part of the fuel channel and also adds a degree of structural rigidity to the core.

CFM has manufactured virtually every calandria tube for CANDU reactors world-wide.

The calandria tube spools are short versions of the calandria tube. These are generally used for testing and validation purposes. The two ends of the spool are exactly representative of the ends on a full length calandria tube.
Fuel Channel Annulus Spacers (Garter Springs)
The fuel channel annulus spacer is specific to the design of the CANDU reactor. This spring wound coil is used to separate the outside diameter of the pressure tube from the inside diameter of the calandria tube. The coil is loosely wound to allow for the flow of gas through the annulus.

A Zircaloy tracer wire is strung through the spring which is used to locate the position of the spring along the fuel channel. Once in the core, the location of the spring must be periodically verified.
Guide Tube Assemblies
The guide tube assembly is manufactured from a tubular Zircaloy in-core guide tube and stainless steel out of core section called the guide tube extension.

Guide tubes are tensioned by coil springs at the bottom of the tube which act on couplings attached to the locators.
 
 
Liquid Injection Shutdown System
(LISS) & LISS Nozzles
 
 
The liquid injection shutdown system (LISS) is part of safety shutdown system 2 (SDS2) in the CANDU reactor. The LISS provides for a rapid injection of gadolinium nitrate solution by helium displacement. This liquid solution is injected from an external poison tank into the heavy water in the calandria vessel. 

Many in core components are manufactured to ASME Pressure vessel code standards and precise technical specifications.
Liquid Zone Control Assemblies
The liquid zone control absorbers are the primary devices for controlling reactivity within the CANDU reactor during normal operation.
Six liquid zone control assemblies are positioned vertically throughout the core. In total, there are 14 chambers within the six liquid zone controls (LZC). Some LZC have three chambers while others have two.
The principle for reactivity control is the balancing of helium and light water within tubes welded vertically in the LZC. The LZC are built to ASME Pressure Vessel Code standards and precise technical specifications.
Neutron Flux Detector Assemblies
The neutron flux detector assembly is used to measure the neutron flux density in various regions throughout the core. This assembly can be up to 15 metres long depending on configuration. A connector (shown in the photo) is also available to take the low amperage signal from the neutron flux detector. 
During the last 25 years, CFM has manufactured over 2,000 flux detector assemblies for a wide variety of reactors around the globe.
Shut-off, Control & Adjuster Assemblies
Shutoff rods are manufactured to meticulous quality standards as they are an important part of safety shutdown systems. They are manufactured with a precise amount of cadmium and stainless steel. Control rods themselves form part of the reactor operating system. Finer control of the reactor operation is ensured by control rods.  Adjuster absorber rods (21 in a CANDU 6 reactor) are used for flux shaping, both radially and axially. The adjuster is made of stainless steel.
Complete assemblies for shut-off, control and adjusters are available for CANDU operators.

Reactivity mechanisms


Bellows
The bellows assembly is designed to seal the annular space between the pressure tube and the calandria tube in a CANDU reactor.
Generally the bellows allows for some expansion in each channel while maintaining channel integrity. The bellows allows axial motion of the channels and also supports the torque of the end fitting from the feeder pipe. The bellows material is typically Inconel.


Closure Plugs
Closure plugs are removable units used to seal each end of the fuel channel. This enables access for refuelling by the fueling machine.

The steel closure plug is held in place by lugs that fit into slots on the inside diameter of the end fitting body. The closure plug is sealed by a metal face seal.


Custom Precision Seamless Tube Sizes
CFM specializes in the cold work fabrication (pilgering) of custom seamless Zircaloy tubing. Sizes range from 0.250” (7mm) OD to 2.000” (50mm) outside diameter. The wall thickness can be as low as 0.010" (0.25mm).
Standard tolerances as low as 0.0005” (0.02mm) are common. Higher precision is available upon request.


Drive Mechanism (Gearbox)
We manufacture drive mechanisms which are mounted above the reactor, on the reactivity mechanism deck. It is used to drop and hoist rods into the core. In the case of a shutoff drive mechanism unit, the clutch will release the shutoff rod for very rapid insertion into the core to stop the reaction.

Other drive mechanisms can be utilized for control rods or absorber rods. In this case, the gearbox is slightly different as finer motion controls are required.


Flasks
Small flasks are used as shielding to protect workers from increased radiation as the cobalt adjuster rods are removed from the reactor. The flask is inserted during the rod removal operation and then it is removed after the cobalt adjuster assembly is extracted.
The flasks that CFM manufactures are made of either a depleted uranium or tungsten metal material.


Guide Tubes
The guide tubes are used in a vertical stationary configuration to allow rapid insertion of shutoff rods or adjuster rods. We manufacture guide tubes in two configurations; one with numerous holes or one without holes. In the configuration with holes, approximately 35% of the metal is removed. This minimizes the amount of neutron absorption by the amount of Zircaloy in core. It also precludes voids occurring in the moderator heavy water.

Other guide tubes are manufactured for the neutron flux detector assemblies for protection of the detector from water ingress.


Ion Chambers
The ion chamber unit consists of the ion chamber housing, access tubes and vault wall penetration assembly, shield plugs, ion chamber instruments and cables, and the shutter assembly.

Ion chambers measure the reactor power. They are mounted on the outside of the calandria vessel. The output of the ion chamber is used for reactor control at low power levels. They also give a rate of change of reactor power, which is a shutdown system trip parameter.


Latch Assembly
The latch assembly is a small device located in each fuel channel at the downstream end of the fuel channel.
The purpose of the latch assembly is to prevent the fuel from traveling or moving down the channel. The water flow through each channel exerts a tremendous pressure on each fuel bundle.


Liner Tubes
Liner tubes are used in each fuel channel to guide the fuel and shield plug into the channel. Each fuel channel has two liner tubes. Typically, 410 stainless steel is used as liner tube material.
Perforations in the liner tube provide for a large flow area so that the coolant pressure drop over the liner tube is as small as possible.


Pyle National Connectors for Flux Detectors
The pyle national connector is a device to provide a sealed connection from the flux detector head to another bulkhead. A number of different connector configurations are available, depending upon our customers’ unique application. Differing configurations ensure that SDS1 and SDS2 connectors cannot be incorrectly installed.


Shield Plugs
Shield plugs are installed on every CANDU fuel channel to minimize neutron leakage from the fuel channel. In the case of a downstream to water flow shield plug, the plug also provides axial support to the column of fuel bundles.


Thimbles
Vertical thimbles extend from the top of the calandria up through the reactivity mechanism deck. They enclose the moderator and its cover gas while being immersed in the vault shield water. Metal bellows are welded to the deck penetrations to maintain a seal between the vault shield water and the reactivity mechanism deck. The bellows also permit free vertical movement to accommodate thermal expansion.
Horizontal thimbles extend from the shield wall through the vault wall to the calandria nozzles. These, too, are sealed by metallic bellows.


In-stock Zircaloy metals

Small Quantities of Zircaloy Bar | Rod | Sheet | Tube
CFM always has small quantities of Zircaloy available from stock. All material will have certificates and traceability as it is nuclear grade.

The stock varies from time to time due to availability but if you urgently need small quantities of Zircaloy we will likely have it. Several different Zircaloy grades are available:

ASTM R60804; Zircaloy4, nuclear grade.
ASTM R60802; Zircaloy2, nuclear grade.
ASTM R60904; Zr2.5Nb, nuclear grade.
ASTM R60702; non-nuclear grade.

  

Other services


Complete Non-Destructive Testing Services
CFM employs a variety of non-destructive testing processes to ensure the quality and integrity of our critical pressure vessel components
We perform ultrasonic testing, liquid penetrant testing and radiography on our specialized equipment and can plan, design and perform eddy current testing. We also custom design, build and commission non-destructive testing equipment for clients’ on-site use.


Custom Fabrication - Isotope Transportation Packaging
CFM custom fabricates Co60 isotope transportation packages.
After an extended stay in-reactor, cobalt 60 (Co60) is artificially produced by neutron activation of Co59. Once it is rendered highly active, Co60 is difficult to transport due to the high level of gamma radiation emitted. For this reason, a highly shielded transportation package is required.
We manufacture two types of customized cobalt isotope transport packages licensed by both the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
Co60 is used mainly for sterilization of medical equipment and as a radiation source for medical radiotherapy, industrial radiography, pest insect sterilization as well as food and blood irradiation.


Custom Fabrications - Reactivity Drive Mechanisms
Drive mechanisms are typically used to drop devices into the reactor and retract them from the core. These mechanisms include shut-off rods, or other types of reactivity control devices such as control rods, adjuster absorber rods and cobalt adjuster rods. These devices consist of a radiation prepared servo drive motor, an electromagnetic clutch, a sheave winding system and a damper mechanism.
During regular operation of the reactor, the electro-magnetic clutch is engaged, holding the reactivity mechanisms in position either fully or partially retracted. When activated or during a power loss to the nuclear generating station, the electromagnetic clutch disengages and the reactivity rods are fired into the reactor for a complete shut-down. The damper mechanism allows the rods to decelerate as they reach their final resting position in the reactor.
Associated with drive mechanisms, we also produce sensors used in defining the position of the various control or shut-off rods when fully retracted. These are known as rod-ready indicators.


Oxide Coating Services
Zircaloy is relatively mid-range in terms of hardness and other mechanical properties. To increase abrasion resistance and strength, CFM can provide surface oxide treatment to various grades of nuclear Zircaloy.

The zirconium oxide depth and thickness can vary to meet precise design specifications. The zirconium oxide surface provides an extremely hard and abrasion resistant surface.


Pickling & Passivation
A solution of hydrofluoric acid is used to pickle Zircaloy components. Site specific or overall dimensional control can be achieved by either preferential pickling or overall pickling. Depending upon the amount of metal to be removed, the type of acid bath may be altered. Pickling can also be used for inside surface conditioning of longer length tubing.

Passivation is used to make the metal more "inert." Different acid baths are used to achieve passivation of Zircaloy components.


Polishing
Several different polishing techniques are available, depending upon the technical specifications required by the customer. Typically, the outside diameter will be polished to provide either a specified surface condition or a dimensional requirement. Lengths of tube and bar between one to six metres can be polished on the outside diameter. Shorter lengths can be inside diameter polished.


Seam Welded Precision Tubing
CFM can perform axial and radial welds in tubes up to seven metres long, with outside diameters ranging from 88 mm to 180 mm. Tubes are usually robotically welded, followed by an X-ray or ultrasonic inspection of the weld and tube itself. Liquid penetrant testing can also be performed.

We process uranium into fuel for safe, clean, reliable nuclear power reactors around the world.

Business


The safe processing of uranium ore concentrates into fuel for clean air nuclear power plants is the focus of Cameco’s Fuel Services Division in Ontario, Canada.
Before it can be used to generate electricity, uranium concentrate, or yellowcake as it is commonly referred to, must be further processed. First the uranium concentrate is refined to remove impurities and change its chemical form to uranium trioxide (UO3). This UO3 is then chemically converted into one of two different uranium compounds, uranium dioxide (UO2) or uranium hexafluoride (UF6), depending on the type of reactor to be fuelled. Some of the UO2 is shipped directly to Cameco's fuel manufacturing. In Port Hope and Cobourg, fuel assemblies are constructed for CANDU heavy water reactors. This facility is also a well-known producer of reactor components for reactors around the world. UF6 moves on to enrichment facilities for further processing into fuel for light water nuclear power reactors.
Cameco's fuel services division:

operates the largest commercial refinery in the world,
controls about 20% of the world UF6 conversion capacity, and
is a leading manufacturer of fuel assemblies and reactor components for CANDU heavy water reactors.

History[edit]
"Cameco - Canadian Mining and Energy Corporation" was formed in 1988 by the merger and privatization of two crown corporations: the federally owned Eldorado Nuclear Limited (known previously as Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited) and Saskatchewan-based Saskatchewan Mining Development Corporation (SMDC). The name was later shortened to "Cameco Corporation".
The new company was initially owned 62% by the provincial government and 38% by the federal government. The initial public offering (IPO) for 20% of the company was conducted in July, 1991. Government ownership of the company decreased over the next eleven years, with full privatization occurring in February, 2002.
In 1996, Cameco acquired Power Resources Inc., the largest uranium producer in the United States. This was followed in 1998 by the acquisition of Canadian-based Uranerz Exploration and Mining Limited and Uranerz U.S.A., Inc.
In 2012, it acquired a nuclear fuel intermediary Nukem Energy.[4]
Operations[edit]




Head office


Cameco operates uranium mines in North America and Kazakhstan, including McArthur River-Key Lake, the world's largest uranium producer, and Cigar Lake, the world's highest grade uranium mine, both in Saskatchewan. Other operations in Saskatchewan include a mine and mill at Rabbit Lake, currently in care and maintenance.
In the United States, Cameco operates uranium mines in the states of Nebraska and Wyoming through its US subsidiary Cameco Resources Inc. Cameco Resources was formed in 2007 through a restructuring of two wholly owned subsidiaries, Power Resources Inc. (Wyoming) and Crow Butte Resources, Inc. (Nebraska).
In the province of Ontario, Cameco operates a uranium refinery in Blind River and a uranium conversion facility in Port Hope, which has faced opposition from some community groups.[5][6] Through the Bruce Power Limited Partnership (BPLP), Cameco also participates in nuclear power generation in the province.
In 2004, Cameco spun off its gold mining operations in Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and the USA to a newly formed public company, Centerra Gold. Cameco divested its remaining interest in Centerra on December 30, 2009.[7]

In the News[edit]
In January 2011, Cameco participated in the clean up of a ship-board uranium concentrate spill on the MCP Altona that had occurred on December 23, 2010.[8]
In 2011, Cameco signed an agreement with Talvivaara Mining Company whereby Cameco would pay US$60 million to construct a uranium extraction circuit at the Talvivaara nickel-zinc mine in Sotkamo. Talvivaara would then pay back the initial construction costs in the form of uranium concentrate; once the initial costs were paid Cameco would continue to purchase the uranium concentrate at a pricing formula based on market price on the day of delivery.[9]

In 2004, Cameco spun off its gold mining operations in Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and the USA to a newly formed public company, Centerra Gold. Cameco divested its remaining interest in Centerra on December 30, 2009.[7]

In the News[edit]
In January 2011, Cameco participated in the clean up of a ship-board uranium concentrate spill on the MCP Altona that had occurred on December 23, 2010.[8]
In 2011, Cameco signed an agreement with Talvivaara Mining Company whereby Cameco would pay US$60 million to construct a uranium extraction circuit at the Talvivaara nickel-zinc mine in Sotkamo. Talvivaara would then pay back the initial construction costs in the form of uranium concentrate; once the initial costs were paid Cameco would continue to purchase the uranium concentrate at a pricing formula based on market price on the day of delivery.[9]

History[edit]
"Cameco - Canadian Mining and Energy Corporation" was formed in 1988 by the merger and privatization of two crown corporations: the federally owned Eldorado Nuclear Limited (known previously as Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited) and Saskatchewan-based Saskatchewan Mining Development Corporation (SMDC). The name was later shortened to "Cameco Corporation".
The new company was initially owned 62% by the provincial government and 38% by the federal government. The initial public offering (IPO) for 20% of the company was conducted in July, 1991. Government ownership of the company decreased over the next eleven years, with full privatization occurring in February, 2002.
In 1996, Cameco acquired Power Resources Inc., the largest uranium producer in the United States. This was followed in 1998 by the acquisition of Canadian-based Uranerz Exploration and Mining Limited and Uranerz U.S.A., Inc.
In 2012, it acquired a nuclear fuel intermediary Nukem Energy.[4]
Operations[edit]




Head office


Cameco operates uranium mines in North America and Kazakhstan, including McArthur River-Key Lake, the world's largest uranium producer, and Cigar Lake, the world's highest grade uranium mine, both in Saskatchewan. Other operations in Saskatchewan include a mine and mill at Rabbit Lake, currently in care and maintenance.
In the United States, Cameco operates uranium mines in the states of Nebraska and Wyoming through its US subsidiary Cameco Resources Inc. Cameco Resources was formed in 2007 through a restructuring of two wholly owned subsidiaries, Power Resources Inc. (Wyoming) and Crow Butte Resources, Inc. (Nebraska).
In the province of Ontario, Cameco operates a uranium refinery in Blind River and a uranium conversion facility in Port Hope, which has faced opposition from some community groups.[5][6] Through the Bruce Power Limited Partnership (BPLP), Cameco also participates in nuclear power generation in the province.
In 2004, Cameco spun off its gold mining operations in Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and the USA to a newly formed public company, Centerra Gold. Cameco divested its remaining interest in Centerra on December 30, 2009.[7]

In the News[edit]
In January 2011, Cameco participated in the clean up of a ship-board uranium concentrate spill on the MCP Altona that had occurred on December 23, 2010.[8]
In 2011, Cameco signed an agreement with Talvivaara Mining Company whereby Cameco would pay US$60 million to construct a uranium extraction circuit at the Talvivaara nickel-zinc mine in Sotkamo. Talvivaara would then pay back the initial construction costs in the form of uranium concentrate; once the initial costs were paid Cameco would continue to purchase the uranium concentrate at a pricing formula based on market price on the day of delivery.[9]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
