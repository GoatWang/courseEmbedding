                Winner - Lifetime Achievement. Donald F. Robillard Jr. CFO, Hunt Consolidated Inc. DBJ's CFO of the Year 2014.

                Jake Dean            






When Donald “Don" Robillard was a youngster growing up in Beaumont, Texas, he remembers asking his father who the richest man on earth was.
“At 4 or 5 years old, these are the kind of things you want to know," said the 62-year-old C-level executive, laughing at the memory.

Jake Dean






 


In answering his young son, Robillard's father, a very matter-of-fact attorney with Sun Oil Co., replied, “The richest man on earth is either J. Paul Getty or H.L. Hunt."
Even years later, that response has stuck with Robillard, who grew up in the oil business, later joining Hunt's namesake firm, a company steeped in the oil business, Dallas-based Hunt Consolidated Inc.
That was more than three decades ago for the self-described “completely dedicated" senior vice president and chief financial officer of the company, which boasted a revenue topping $4 billion in 2013, according to Forbes' latest report.
And even though Robillard has 4 billion reasons to stay awake at night, he remembers one simple task: Make sure Hunt Consolidated never runs out of money.
“I never let that get too far from the forefront of my mind," he said. “Without cash or liquidity, a company goes out of business."
How did you get into your industry?
Every meal I've ever eaten came out of the oil business. I started with Hunt Consolidated 31-and-a-half years ago, when it was a very different company. It was much smaller back then, but it has grown exponentially over the years. In 1983, it was a tough job market, but I had two job offers within 10 days. I got a call from the controller from Hunt Oil Co. and they said they needed someone to run the accounting for an international company. Hunt Oil is a legendary company and is part of Texas history.




 


Describe an experience that shaped your future.
When I was hired, the oil industry was in a downturn. We were just gearing up for operations in Yemen, and I volunteered to go there for two years. When I got there, they tested the discovery well, and I ended up staying there almost nine years. I held a number of jobs. Ray (Hunt) was either training me or testing me. In the time I was there, we drilled 500 wells and laid down 250 miles of pipeline over two mountain ranges. It gave me a real sense of accomplishment. We were producing almost a quarter-of-a-million barrels of oil a day. Those are once-in-a-lifetime experiences.

What has been your biggest accomplishment in the past year?
We do a lot of things here, but investing $350 million in Peru's local bond market was one of the largest, if not the largest, bond deals in the country. We have a lot of money invested in Peru, and this allowed us to balance our assets around the world.
Any plans to retire?
The Hunt family hasn't given me any hints so far, and I still get excited when I come to work here. I don't know if I'll ever completely retire. I've saved money, but I enjoy working. It gives me a sense of accomplishment.
