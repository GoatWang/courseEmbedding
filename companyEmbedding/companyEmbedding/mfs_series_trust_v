Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value fluctuate so your units, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than quoted.
		









Important Performance Information





Performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies and waivers in effect during the periods shown. Without such subsidies and waivers the series' performance results would be less favorable. All results assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. The performance is as of the date shown; it may not include the series' entire investment portfolio and is subject to change.
		





Initial Class shares have no sales charge.
		





The returns for the series shown do not reflect the deduction of expenses associated with variable products, such as mortality and expense risk charges, separate account charges, and sales charges imposed by insurance company separate accounts. Such expenses would reduce the overall returns shown. Please refer to the variable product's annual report for performance that reflects the deduction of the fees and charges imposed by insurance company separate accounts.
		





 Withdrawals of earnings or other taxable amounts are subject to income tax and, if made prior to age 59 1/2, may be subject to an additional 10% federal tax penalty. Early withdrawals reduce the death benefit.
		





No representation is made, and no assurance can be given, that any investment's results will be comparable to the investment results of any other product with similar investment objectives and policies, including products with the same investment professional or manager. Differences in portfolio size, investments held, contract and portfolio expenses, and other factors can be expected to affect performance.
		





Important Risk Considerations




The series may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose money on your investment in the series.
		





Stock markets and investments in individual stocks  are volatile and can decline significantly in response to issuer, market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions.
		





Please see the prospectus for further information on these and other risk considerations.

Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value fluctuate so your units, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than quoted.
		









Important Performance Information





Performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies and waivers in effect during the periods shown. Without such subsidies and waivers the series' performance results would be less favorable. All results assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. The performance is as of the date shown; it may not include the series' entire investment portfolio and is subject to change.
		





Initial Class shares have no sales charge.
		





The returns for the series shown do not reflect the deduction of expenses associated with variable products, such as mortality and expense risk charges, separate account charges, and sales charges imposed by insurance company separate accounts. Such expenses would reduce the overall returns shown. Please refer to the variable product's annual report for performance that reflects the deduction of the fees and charges imposed by insurance company separate accounts.
		





 Withdrawals of earnings or other taxable amounts are subject to income tax and, if made prior to age 59 1/2, may be subject to an additional 10% federal tax penalty. Early withdrawals reduce the death benefit.
		





No representation is made, and no assurance can be given, that any investment's results will be comparable to the investment results of any other product with similar investment objectives and policies, including products with the same investment professional or manager. Differences in portfolio size, investments held, contract and portfolio expenses, and other factors can be expected to affect performance.
		





Important Risk Considerations




The series may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose money on your investment in the series.
		





Stock markets and investments in individual stocks  are volatile and can decline significantly in response to issuer, market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions.
		





Investments in growth companies can be more sensitive to the company's earnings and more volatile than the stock market in general.
		





Please see the prospectus for further information on these and other risk considerations.

Before purchasing any variable product, consider the objectives, risks, charges, and expenses associated with the underlying investment option(s) and those of the product itself. For a prospectus, or summary prospectus if available, containing this and other information, contact your investment or insurance professional. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.

LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN 

[Photo of Jeffrey L. Shames]                                                    
Jeffrey L. Shames                                                       

Dear Shareholders,                                                              
It is over a year since the attacks of September 11 dealt a sharp blow to the   
American people and to an already-weak U.S. economy. When the markets seemed    
to be recovering as a new year began, a series of corporate scandals hammered   
at the economy and at investor confidence. As I write this in early fall,       
investors are concerned about a potential war with Iraq and about labor issues  
on West Coast docks, which handle nearly half of all U.S. import/export         
shipping. In the midst of all this, the American consumer has managed almost    
single-handedly to keep the U.S. economy from falling back into recession.      

A RELAY RACE                                                                    
In mid-October, we could describe the state of the U.S. economy as a relay      
race against time involving two runners: the consumer, whose spending has       
fueled the beginning of a recovery, and corporate spending, which has yet to    
contribute much to the recovery. The hope is that corporate spending kicks in   
so that the consumer can pass the baton before running out of steam. At this    
point, we see little visibility, or ability to predict the near-term direction  
of consumer spending or corporate spending and profits. The result is that the  
economy seems to us to be in a holding pattern as we wait for clear signs that  
things are improving.                                                           

REASONS FOR OPTIMISM                                                            
Optimists would point out that wages have been rising over the past year,       
according to the U.S. Labor Department. This, in combination with historically  
low interest rates and inflation, may enable the consumer to keep spending. In  
the corporate arena, our research indicates that business spending overall has  
at least stopped falling and that corporate earnings and spending could trend   
upward next year.                                                               

Pessimists, however, would counter that visibility of corporate profits         
remains very murky, that corporations could resort to further layoffs if        
profits languish, and that the situation with Iraq adds to market uncertainty.  
The fact is that the near-term direction of the market or the economy is        
uncertain. But history has shown that both are cyclical -- downturns have       
always been followed by upturns.                                                

STAYING THE COURSE                                                              
With the economy in a holding pattern and markets extremely volatile, we think  
it's important to remember the familiar investment strategies that we believe   
apply in any market: Think long term. Be diversified. See crises as             
opportunities. That's how we'd describe our approach to this volatile           
environment -- which we think plays to our strength as research-based, bottom-  
up, long-term investors.                                                        

As always, we appreciate your confidence in MFS and welcome any questions or    
comments you may have.                                                          

Respectfully,                                                           

/s/ Jeffrey L. Shames

MANAGEMENT REVIEW AND OUTLOOK 

[Photo of David M. Calabro]

For the 12 months ended September 30, 2002, Class A shares of the fund          
provided a total return of -4.76%, Class 529A shares -4.78%, Class B shares     
-5.38%, Class 529B shares -4.88%, Class C shares -5.43%, Class 529C shares      
-4.87%, and Class I shares -4.50%. These returns assume the reinvestment of     
any dividends and capital gains distributions but exclude the effects of any    
sales charges and compare over the same period with returns of -20.47% and      
8.60%, respectively, for the fund's benchmarks, the Standard & Poor's 500       
Stock Index (the S&P 500) and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index. The     
S&P 500 is a commonly used measure of broad stock market performance. The       
Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index is unmanaged and is composed of all        
publicly issued obligations of the U.S. Treasury and government agencies, all   
corporate debt guaranteed by the U.S. government, all fixed-rate                
nonconvertible investment-grade domestic corporate debt, and all fixed-rate     
securities backed by mortgage pools of the Government National Mortgage         
Association (GNMA), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), and     
the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA). During the same period, the   
average balanced fund tracked by Lipper Inc., an independent firm that reports  
mutual fund performance, returned -9.93%.                                       

Q.  HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE FUND OVER THE PAST           
12 MONTHS?                                                              

A.  The past 12 months have been very difficult for stock investors but not for 
fixed-income investors. The equity markets were negatively influenced in
the fall of 2001 by the aftermath of September 11, then by deteriorating
   economic conditions, corporate accounting scandals, and uncertainties about
war with Iraq. Continuing a trend that had begun in 2001, a company's   
announcement of lower than expected earnings resulted in severe price   
 declines that affected not only its stock, but often its entire industry.
   The bond portion of the portfolio was positively influenced by U.S. Federal
   Reserve board interest rate cuts early in the period and flat rates for the
past six months.                                                        

Q.  THE FUND'S RETURNS WERE BETTER THAN THE S & P 500; WHY IS THAT?             

A.  In our opinion, the fund's outperformance of the benchmark was attributable 
  to the bond portion of the portfolio and to our value focus on stocks with
  solid earnings that are priced below what we think they're worth. Our bond
   holdings, which at the end of the period were at about 42%, provided income
and some stability to the overall portfolio. Value stocks outperformed  
growth stocks over the past 12 months.                                  

Q.  WHAT WERE THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO PERFORMANCE?                          

A.  Energy and financial stocks did the best for us.                            

 Relative to our benchmark, we were overweighted in energy, especially oil
   services and exploration and production companies. Oil prices remained high
   throughout the period, attributable in part to tensions in the Middle East.

Banks and insurance companies were among our most successful financial  
 stocks. The bank stocks we held did well because interest rates were low,
their mortgage business was booming, and there were fewer than expected 
credit problems. After September 11, property and casualty insurers were
able to raise premiums to help cover earlier losses.                    

Q.  WHAT WERE SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT DIDN'T WORK FOR THE FUND?                  

A.  Holdings in pharmaceuticals, utilities, and telecommunications detracted    
from fund performance.                                                  

In our view, Bristol-Myers Squibb best illustrates the woes of the      
 pharmaceutical industry. Although many of its older drugs were coming off
  patent protection, we believed they had many new drugs in development that
 would make up for the ones they'd be losing. Unfortunately, the new drugs
were not approved by federal regulators and the company's earnings      
suffered.                                                               

Our utilities holdings, which included energy generation companies and  
telephone companies, were also disappointing. Calpine, an independent   
company that develops power plants and sells energy, built too much     
generating capacity and accumulated too much debt in the process.       
   Telecommunications companies performed poorly as a result of having created
too much capacity and fierce competition.                               

Q.  WHAT SORT OF OPPORTUNITIES ARE YOU SEEING GOING FORWARD?                    

A.  We're still attracted to the long-term prospects of pharmaceuticals. After  
a year of falling prices, pharmaceutical stocks have been attractively  
 valued in our opinion. Railroad stocks interest us because many have been
   selling at low prices relative to their earnings. These companies have been
generating good yields and they've been making money. We believe they   
should continue to do well when the economy recovers.                   

On the bond side, we favor high-grade corporate bonds in healthcare,    
utilities, and defense industries as well as government agencies and    
mortgage backed issues. We believe that these bonds should do well in   
almost any economic climate and offer us potentially better yields than 
U.S. Treasury securities. (The principal value and interest on Treasury 
securities are guaranteed by the U.S. government if held to maturity.)  

Q.  WHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK GOING FORWARD?                                         

A.  There will be an economic recovery, eventually. We are cautiously           
optimistic about that and own more cyclical stocks as a result. We have 
   found paper and chemical companies to be attractive. In our view, they have
offered competitive dividend yields that we believe will help compensate
  for any near-term uncertainty and their prices should respond quickly when
an economic recovery does occur.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE SUMMARY                                                    

Class A and 529A Share Performance Including Sales Charge takes into account    
the deduction of the maximum 4.75% sales charge. Class B and 529B Share         
Performance Including Sales Charge takes into account the deduction of the      
applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which declines over six     
years from 4% to 0%. Class C and 529C Share Performance Including Sales Charge  
takes into account the deduction of the 1% CDSC applicable to Class C and 529C  
shares redeemed within 12 months. Class I shares have no sales charge and are   
only available to certain institutional investors. CLASS 529A, 529B, AND 529C   
SHARES ARE ONLY OFFERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH QUALIFIED TUITION PROGRAMS.         

Performance for share classes initially offered after the fund's original       
share class (Class A) includes the performance of the fund's Class A shares     
for periods prior to the offering of these share classes. This blended class    
performance has been adjusted to take into account differences in the sales     
load applicable to these share classes, but has not been adjusted to take into  
account differences in class specific operating expenses. Because B, C, 529A,   
529B, and 529C have higher expenses than those of A, performance shown for      
these share classes is higher than it would have been had they been offered     
for the entire period. Because I shares have lower expenses than those of A,    
performance shown for I is lower than it would have been had this share class   
been offered for the entire period.                                             

All performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies and waivers    
in effect during the periods shown; without these, the results would have been  
less favorable. See the prospectus and financial statements for details.        

All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and         
capital gains.                                                                  

There may be additional fees with 529 savings plans. Please see a Participant   
Agreement for further information.                                              

INVESTMENT RETURN AND PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE, AND SHARES, WHEN          
REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST. PAST PERFORMANCE  
IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS, AND THE PERFORMANCE SHOWN DOES NOT REFLECT   
THE DEDUCTION OF TAXES, IF ANY, THAT A SHAREHOLDER WOULD PAY ON FUND            
DISTRIBUTIONS OR THE REDEMPTION OF FUND SHARES.                                 
MARKET VOLATILITY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT SHORT-TERM PERFORMANCE, AND MORE

RISK CONSIDERATIONS                                                             

Investments in foreign and/or emerging market securities may be unfavorably     
affected by interest-rate and currency-exchange-rate changes, as well as by     
market, economic, and political conditions of the countries where investments   
are made. There may be greater returns but also greater risk than with U.S.     
investments.                                                                    

Investments in lower-rated securities may provide greater returns but may have  
greater-than-average risk.                                                      

The portfolio may invest in mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to    
unique interest and maturity risks. When interest rates fall, mortgages may be  
paid early through refinancing, which may shorten the expected maturity of      
these securities. Alternatively, when interest rates rise, mortgages are not    
likely to be paid early, which may lengthen the expected maturity of these      
securities. Therefore, during times of fluctuating interest rates, these        
factors may cause the value of mortgage-backed securities to increase or        
decrease more than those of other fixed-income securities.                      

These risks may increase share price volatility. Please see the prospectus      
for details.

(S) As required, effective October 1, 2001, the fund has adopted the provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide 
    for Investment Companies and began amortizing premium on debt securities. The effect of this change for the year    
    ended September 30, 2002, was to decrease net investment income per share by $0.01, decrease net realized and       
    unrealized losses per share by $0.01, and decrease the ratio of net investment income to average net assets by      
    0.10%. Per share, ratios and supplemental data for periods prior to October 1, 2001, have not been restated to      
    reflect this change in presentation.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(1) Business and Organization                                                   
MFS Total Return Fund (the fund) is a diversified series of MFS Series Trust V  
(the trust). The trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust and is    
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as an open-    
end management investment company.                                              

(2) Significant Accounting Policies                                             
General - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally  
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and        
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and     
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial    
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the         
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The fund    
can invest in foreign securities. Investments in foreign securities are         
vulnerable to the effects of changes in the relative values of the local        
currency and the U.S. dollar and to the effects of changes in each country's    
legal, political, and economic environment.                                     

Investment Valuations - Equity securities listed on securities exchanges or     
reported through the NASDAQ system are reported at market value using last      
sale prices. Unlisted equity securities or listed equity securities for which   
last sale prices are not available are reported at market value using last      
quoted bid prices. Debt securities (other than short-term obligations which     
mature in 60 days or less), including listed issues, are valued on the basis    
of valuations furnished by dealers or by a pricing service with consideration   
to factors such as institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities,  
yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics,  
and other market data, without exclusive reliance upon exchange or over-the-    
counter prices. Short-term obligations, which mature in 60 days or less, are    
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Securities for       
which there are no such quotations or valuations are valued in good faith at    
the direction of the Trustees.                                                  

Repurchase Agreements - The fund may enter into repurchase agreements with      
institutions that the fund's investment adviser has determined are              
creditworthy. Each repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The fund requires  
that the securities collateral in a repurchase transaction be transferred to    
the custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the fund to obtain those         
securities in the event of a default under the repurchase agreement. The fund   
monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the collateral to ensure that its      
value, including accrued interest, is greater than amounts owed to the fund     
under each such repurchase agreement. The fund, along with other affiliated     
entities of Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS), may utilize a       
joint trading account for the purpose of entering into one or more repurchase   
agreements.                                                                     

Foreign Currency Translation - Investment valuations, other assets, and         
liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies are converted each        
business day into U.S. dollars based upon current exchange rates. Purchases     
and sales of foreign investments, income, and expenses are converted into U.S.  
dollars based upon currency exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates   
of such transactions. Gains and losses attributable to foreign currency         
exchange rates on sales of securities are recorded for financial statement      
purposes as net realized gains and losses on investments. Gains and losses      
attributable to foreign exchange rate movements on income and expenses are      
recorded for financial statement purposes as foreign currency transaction       
gains and losses. That portion of both realized and unrealized gains and        
losses on investments that results from fluctuations in foreign currency        
exchange rates is not separately disclosed.                                     

Deferred Trustee Compensation - Under a Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan)   
independent Trustees may elect to defer receipt of all or a portion of their    
annual compensation. Deferred amounts are treated as though equivalent dollar   
amounts had been invested in shares of the fund or other MFS funds selected by  
the Trustee. Deferred amounts represent an unsecured obligation of the fund     
until distributed in accordance with the Plan.                                  

Security Loans - State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street"), as       
lending agent, may loan the securities of the fund to certain qualified         
institutions (the "Borrowers") approved by the fund. The loans are              
collateralized at all times by cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities in an       
amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned. State       
Street provides the fund with indemnification against Borrower default. The     
fund bears the risk of loss with respect to the investment of cash collateral.  

Cash collateral is invested in short-term securities. A portion of the income   
generated upon investment of the collateral is remitted to the Borrowers, and   
the remainder is allocated between the fund and the lending agent. On loans     
collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, a fee is received from the          
Borrower, and is allocated between the fund and the lending agent. Income from  
securities lending is included in interest income on the Statement of           
Operations. The dividend and interest income earned on the securities loaned    
is accounted for in the same manner as other dividend and interest income.      

At September 30, 2002, the value of securities loaned was $830,684,158. These   
loans were collateralized by cash of $867,327,276 which was invested in the     
following short-term obligations:                                               
                                                             IDENTIFIED COST
                                                      SHARES       AND VALUE

Investment Transactions and Income - Investment transactions are recorded on    
the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium   
and discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in       
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All discount is       
accreted for tax reporting purposes as required by federal income tax           
regulations. Dividends received in cash are recorded on the ex-dividend date.   
Some securities may be purchased on a "when-issued" or "forward delivery"       
basis, which means that the securities will be delivered to the fund at a       
future date, usually beyond customary settlement time.                          

Fees Paid Indirectly - The fund's custody fee is reduced according to an        
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by     
the fund. During the period, the fund's custodian fees were reduced by          
$310,816 under this arrangement. The fund has entered into a directed           
brokerage agreement, under which the broker will credit the fund a portion of   
the commissions generated, to offset certain expenses of the fund. For the      
period, the fund's custodian fees were reduced by $140,596 under this           
agreement. These amounts are shown as a reduction of total expenses on the      
Statement of Operations.                                                        

Tax Matters and Distributions - The fund's policy is to comply with the         
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) applicable to regulated      
investment companies and to distribute to shareholders all of its net taxable   
income, including any net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no         
provision for federal income or excise tax is provided. Distributions to        
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The fund distinguishes       
between distributions on a tax basis and a financial reporting basis and only   
distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits are reported in the   
financial statements as distributions from paid-in capital. Differences in the  
recognition or classification of income between the financial statements and    
tax earnings and profits, which result in temporary over-distributions for      
financial statement purposes, are classified as distributions in excess of net  
investment income or net realized gains. Common types of book and tax           
differences that could occur include differences in accounting for currency     
transactions, mortgage-backed securities, real estate investment trusts,        
defaulted bonds, capital losses, and amortization and accretion on debt         
securities.                                                                     

The tax character of distributions declared for the years ended September 30,
2002 and September 30, 2001 was as follows:

                                              ============        ============

During the year ended September 30, 2002, accumulated distributions in excess   
of net investment income decreased by $12,458,115, accumulated net realized     
loss on investments and foreign currency transactions increased by              
$60,530,875, and paid-in capital increased by $48,072,760 due to differences    
between book and tax accounting for mortgage-backed securities, amortization    
and accretion on debt securities, utilization of equalization (a tax basis      
dividends paid deduction from earnings and profits distributed to shareholders  
upon redemption of shares), currency transactions, and capital losses. This     
change had no effect on the net assets or net asset value per share.            

As of September 30, 2002, the components of distributable earnings              
(accumulated losses) on a tax basis were as follows:                            

Undistributed ordinary income              $   6,509,569            
Capital loss carryforward                    (15,563,754)           
Unrealized loss                             (545,881,198)           
Other temporary differences                 (183,871,093)           

For federal income tax purposes, the capital loss carryforward may be applied   
against any net taxable realized gains of each succeeding year until the        
earlier of its utilization or expiration on September 30, 2010.                 

Multiple Classes of Shares of Beneficial Interest - The fund offers multiple    
classes of shares, which differ in their respective distribution and service    
fees. All shareholders bear the common expenses of the fund based on the value  
of settled shares outstanding of each class, without distinction between share  
classes. Dividends are declared separately for each class. Differences in per   
share dividend rates are generally due to differences in separate class         
expenses. Class B and Class 529B shares will convert to Class A and Class 529A  
shares, respectively, approximately eight years after purchase.                 

(3) Transactions with Affiliates                                                
Investment Adviser - The fund has an investment advisory agreement with         
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) to provide overall investment    
advisory and administrative services, and general office facilities.            

Effective January 1, 2002, the management fee is computed daily and paid        
monthly at the following annual rates:

monthly at the following annual rates:

The fund pays the compensation of the Independent Trustees in the form of both  
a retainer and attendance fees and pays no compensation directly to its         
Trustees who are officers of the investment adviser, or to officers of the      
fund, all of whom receive remuneration for their services to the fund from      
MFS. Certain officers and Trustees of the fund are officers or directors of     
MFS, MFS Fund Distributors, Inc. (MFD), and MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC).    
On January 1, 2002, the Trustees terminated the Independent Trustee unfunded    
defined benefit plan for active Trustees and converted it to an unfunded        
retirement benefit deferral plan for active Trustees. Under the new plan, the   
unfunded pension liability was converted into an equivalent value of notional   
shares of the fund that will fluctuate with the performance of the fund.        
Included in Trustees' compensation is a net decrease of $4,212 as a result of   
the change in the fund's pension liability under this plan and a pension        
expense of $12,086 for inactive trustees for the year ended September 30,
2002. Also included in Trustees' compensation is a one-time settlement expense  
of $4,412 and a one-time transition expense of $13,643.

at the following annual percentages of the fund's average daily net assets:

The fund's distribution plan provides that the fund will pay MFD an annual      
percentage of its average daily net assets attributable to certain share        
classes in order that MFD may pay expenses on behalf of the fund related to     
the distribution and servicing of its shares. These expenses include a service  
fee paid to each securities dealer that enters into a sales agreement with MFD  
based on the average daily net assets of accounts attributable to such          
dealers. These fees are calculated based on each class' average daily net       
assets. The maximum distribution and service fees for each class of shares are  
as follows:

The fund and other affiliated funds participate in an $800 million unsecured    
line                                                                            
of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a line of credit agreement.  
Borrowings may be made for temporary financing needs. Interest is charged to    
each fund, based on its borrowings, at a rate equal to the bank's base rate. A  
commitment fee of $80,646 which is based on the average daily unused portion    
of the line of credit is included in miscellaneous expense. The fund had no     
significant borrowings during the year.                                         

(7) Change in Accounting Principle                                              
As required, effective October 1, 2001, the fund adopted the provisions of the  
AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began amortizing  
premium on debt securities. Prior to October 1, 2001, the fund did not          
amortize premium on debt securities. The cumulative effect of this accounting   
change had no impact on total net assets of the fund, but resulted in a         
$4,079,982 increase in cost of securities and a corresponding $4,079,982        
increase in net unrealized depreciation, based on securities held by the fund   
on

The effect of this change for the year ended September 30, 2002 was to          
decrease net                                                                    
investment income by $11,499,279, increase net unrealized depreciation by       
$9,223,074 and decrease net realized losses by $2,276,205. The Statement of     
Changes in Net Assets and Financial Highlights for prior periods has not been   
restated to reflect this change in presentation.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT 

To the Trustees of MFS Series Trust V and Shareholders of MFS Total Return      
Fund:                                                                           

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,           
including the portfolio of investments, of MFS Total Return Fund (one of the    
series comprising MFS Series Trust V) (the "Trust") as of September 30, 2002,   
and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statement  
of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended,    
and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then      
ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the              
responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an   
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our     
audits.                                                                         

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally         
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan  
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the          
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material              
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence            
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our         
procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2002,  
by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; where replies were not        
received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. An audit also    
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates     
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement       
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our     
opinion.                                                                        

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material       
respects, the financial position of MFS Total Return Fund as of September 30,
2002, the results of its operations, the changes in its net assets, and its     
financial highlights for the respective stated periods in conformity with       
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The Trust does not hold annual shareholder meetings for the purpose of electing Trustees, and Trustees are not
elected for fixed terms. This means that each Trustee will be elected to hold office until his or her         
successor is chosen and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement or removal. Each 
officer will hold office until his or her successor is chosen and qualified, or until he or she retires,      
resigns or is removed from office.                                                                            

Messrs. Shames, Ives, Perera and Poorvu, and Ms. Smith have served in their capacity as Trustee of the Trust  
continuously since originally elected or appointed. Messrs. Ballen and Gutow have each served as a Trustee of 
the Trust since August 1, 2001. Messrs. Cohn, Gibbons, Sherratt and Smith, and Ms. O'Neill were elected by    
shareholders and have served as Trustees of the Trust since January 1, 2002. Mr. Parke has served as Trustee  
of the Trust since January 1, 2002.                                                                           

Each of the Trust's Trustees and officers holds comparable positions with certain other funds of which MFS or 
a subsidiary is the investment adviser or distributor and, in the case of the officers, with certain          
affiliates of MFS. Each Trustee serves as a board member of 117 funds within the MFS Family of Funds.         

The Statement of Additional Information contains further information about the Trustees and is available      
without charge upon request, by calling 1-800-225-2606.

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. Each Trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. Each Trust may consist of one or more series and may offer additional series in the future (“Funds”). MFS, a Delaware corporation, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Start Printed Page 62471serves as the investment adviser to each Fund.[1] 

2. Some Funds, including money market Funds that rely on rule 2a-7 under the Act (“Money Market Funds”), may lend money to banks or other entities by entering into repurchase agreements, purchasing other short-term instruments, or, in the case of Funds other than the Money Market Funds, investing in the MFS Institutional Money Market Fund (“IMMF”) pursuant to rule 12d1-1 under the Act. Other Funds may borrow money from the same or similar banks for temporary purposes to satisfy redemption requests, to cover unanticipated cash shortfalls such as a trade “fail” in which cash payment for a security sold by a Fund has been delayed, or for other temporary purposes. Currently, the Trusts have a committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders and uncommitted lines of credit with two separate banks (collectively, the “Loan Agreements”). The Funds also have an overdraft facility with their custodians.
3. If a Fund were to borrow money under a Loan Agreement, the Fund would pay interest on the borrowed cash at a rate which would be higher than the rate that would be earned by other (non-borrowing) Funds on investments in repurchase agreements and other short-term instruments of the same maturity as the bank loan. In addition, while bank borrowings generally can supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails, the borrowing Funds incur commitment fees and/or other charges involved in obtaining a bank loan.
4. Applicants request an order that would permit each Trust to enter into master interfund lending agreements (“Interfund Lending Agreements”) that would permit each Fund to lend and borrow money for temporary purposes directly to and from each other Fund through a credit facility (“Interfund Loan”). Applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would reduce the Funds' borrowing costs and enhance their ability to earn higher interest rates on short-term lendings. Although the proposed credit facility would reduce the Funds' need to borrow from banks, the Funds would be free to establish or renew committed lines of credit or other borrowing arrangements with unaffiliated banks.
5. Applicants anticipate that the credit facility would provide a borrowing Fund with significant savings when the cash position of the Fund is insufficient to meet temporary cash requirements. This situation could arise when redemptions exceed anticipated volumes and certain Funds have insufficient cash on hand to satisfy such redemptions. When a Fund liquidates portfolio securities to meet redemption requests, it often does not receive payment in settlement for up to three days (or longer for certain foreign transactions). The credit facility would provide a source of immediate, short-term liquidity pending settlement of the sale of portfolio securities.
6. Applicants also propose using the credit facility when a sale of securities “fails” due to circumstances such as a delay in the delivery of cash to a Fund's custodian or improper delivery instructions by the broker effecting the transaction. Sales fails may present a cash shortfall if a Fund has undertaken to purchase securities using the proceeds from the securities sold. As a result, the Fund could fail on its intended purchase due to lack of funds from the previous sale, resulting in additional cost to the Fund, or sell a security on a same-day settlement basis, earning a lower return on the investment. Use of the credit facility under these circumstances would enable the Fund to have access to immediate short-term liquidity.
7. While bank borrowings generally can supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails, under the proposed credit facility a borrowing Fund would pay lower interest rates than those offered by banks on short-term loans. In addition, Funds making short-term cash loans directly to other Funds would earn interest at a rate higher than they otherwise could obtain from investing their cash in repurchase agreements. Thus, applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would benefit both borrowing and lending Funds.
8. The interest rate charged to a Fund on any Interfund Loan (“Interfund Loan Rate”) would be the average of the “Repo Rate” and the “Bank Loan Rate,” both as defined below. The Repo Rate on any day would be the highest rate available to a lending Fund from investing in overnight repurchase agreements. The Bank Loan Rate on any day would be calculated by the “Interfund Lending Committee” (as defined below) each day an Interfund Loan is made according to a formula established by each Fund's board of trustees (“Fund Board”) intended to approximate the lowest interest rate at which bank short-term loans would be available to the Funds. The formula would be based upon a publicly available rate (e.g., Federal funds rates and/or Libor), plus an additional spread of basis points and would vary with this rate so as to reflect changing bank loan rates. The initial formula and any subsequent modifications to the formula would be subject to the approval of each Fund Board. Each Fund Board would at least annually review the continuing appropriateness of using the method of calculating the Bank Loan Rate, as well as the relationship between the Bank Loan Rate and current bank loan rates that would be available to the Funds.
9. The credit facility would be administered by investment professionals and administrative personnel from MFS (the “Interfund Lending Committee”). No portfolio manager, including research analysts with portfolio management responsibilities, for any Fund will serve as a member of the Interfund Lending Committee. Under the proposed credit facility, senior members of MFS' investment management team and senior administrative and management personnel (the “Investment Management Committee”) or a portfolio manager for each participating Fund could provide standing instructions to the Interfund Lending Committee that the participating Fund is authorized to participate as a borrower or lender; alternatively, the portfolio manager could provide instructions from time to time as to when the Fund wishes to participate as a borrower or a lender. The Interfund Lending Committee, no more frequently than once daily in the morning of each business day that a transaction is requested under the credit facility pursuant to instructions (an “Interfund Lending Day”), would request and collect data on the uninvested cash and borrowing requirements of all participating Funds from the Funds' custodian. Once it has determined the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand, the Interfund Lending Committee would allocate loans among borrowing Funds without any further communication from a Fund's portfolio managers. Applicants expect there will typically be more available uninvested cash each day than borrowing demand. After the Interfund Lending Committee Start Printed Page 62472has allocated cash for Interfund Loans, MFS' cash desk personnel would invest any remaining cash in accordance with the Funds' investment policies and practices in the ordinary course.
10. The Interfund Lending Committee would allocate borrowing demand and cash available for lending among the Funds on what the Interfund Lending Committee believes to be an equitable basis, subject to certain administrative considerations applicable to all participating Funds, such as the time of filing requests to participate, minimum loan lot sizes, the need to minimize the number of transactions and associated administrative costs, and the amount of the existing borrowings outstanding. To reduce transaction costs, each Interfund Loan normally would be allocated in a manner intended to minimize the number of participants necessary to complete the loan transaction. The method of allocation and related administrative procedures would be approved by each Fund Board, including a majority of trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Fund, as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act (“Independent Fund Board Members”), to ensure that both borrowing and lending Funds participate on an equitable basis.
11. The Interfund Lending Committee would (a) monitor the Interfund Loan Rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the Interfund Loans; (b) limit the borrowings and loans entered into by each Fund to ensure that they comply with the Fund's investment policies and limitations; (c) ensure equitable treatment of each Fund; and (d) directly or through MFS make quarterly reports to each Fund Board concerning any transactions by the Funds under the credit facility and the Interfund Loan Rate charged.
12. MFS, through the Interfund Lending Committee, would administer the credit facility as a fiduciary as part of its duties under the investment management contract with each Fund and provide administrative support pursuant to the administrative services agreement between each Fund and MFS and would receive no additional fee as compensation for its services.
13. No Fund may participate in the credit facility unless: (a) The Fund has obtained shareholder approval for its participation, if such approval is required by law; (b) the Fund has fully disclosed all material information concerning the credit facility in its prospectus and/or statement of additional information (“SAI”); and (c) the Fund's participation in the credit facility is consistent with its investment objectives, limitations and organizational documents.
14. In connection with the credit facility, applicants request an order under (a) section 6(c) of the Act granting relief from sections 18(f) and 21(b) of the Act; (b) section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act granting relief from section 12(d)(1) of the Act; (c) sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act granting relief from sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Act; and (d) under section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit certain joint arrangements.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(a)(3) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, from borrowing money or other property from a registered investment company. Section 21(b) of the Act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person if that person controls or is under common control with the company. Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person, in part, to be any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, the other person. Applicants state that the Funds may be under common control by virtue of having MFS as their common investment adviser and/or by having a common Fund Board and officers.
2. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) provided that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under the Act and with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangements satisfy these standards for the reasons discussed below.
3. Applicants submit that sections 17(a)(3) and 21(b) of the Act were intended to prevent a party with strong potential adverse interests to, and some influence over the investment decisions of, a registered investment company from causing or inducing the investment company to engage in lending transactions that unfairly inure to the benefit of such party and that are detrimental to the best interests of the investment company and its shareholders. Applicants assert that the proposed credit facility transactions do not raise these concerns because: (a) MFS, through the Interfund Lending Committee, would administer the program as a fiduciary; (b) all Interfund Loans would consist only of uninvested cash reserves that the lending Fund otherwise would invest in short-term repurchase agreements or other short-term instruments; (c) the Interfund Loans would not involve a greater risk than such other investments; (d) the lending Fund would receive interest at a rate higher than it could otherwise obtain through such other investments; and (e) the borrowing Fund would pay interest at a rate lower than otherwise available to it under its bank loan agreements. Moreover, applicants believe that the other terms and conditions in the application would effectively preclude the possibility of any Fund obtaining an undue advantage over any other Fund.
4. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, from selling any securities or other property to the company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company. Section 12(d)(1) of the Act generally makes it unlawful for a registered investment company to purchase or otherwise acquire any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section.
5. Applicants state that the obligation of a borrowing Fund to repay an Interfund Loan may constitute a security for the purposes of sections 17(a)(1) and 12(d)(1). Applicants also state that any pledge of assets in connection with an Interfund Loan could be construed as a purchase of the borrowing Fund's securities or other property for purposes of section 17(a)(2) of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if and to the extent such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Applicants contend that the standards under sections 6(c), 17(b), and 12(d)(1)(J) are satisfied for all the reasons set forth above in support of their request for relief from sections Start Printed Page 6247317(a)(3) and 21(b) and for the reasons discussed below. Applicants also state that the requested relief from section 17(a)(2) of the Act meets the standards of section 6(c) and 17(b) because any collateral pledged to secure an Interfund Loan would be subject to the same conditions imposed by any other lender to a Fund that imposes conditions on the quality of or access to collateral for a borrowing (if the lender is another Fund) or the same or less restrictive conditions (in any other circumstance). Any collateral pledged to secure an Interfund Loan will be available solely to secure repayment of such Interfund Loan.
6. Applicants state that, among other things, section 12(d)(1) was intended to prevent the pyramiding of investment companies in order to avoid imposing on investors additional and duplicative costs and fees attendant upon multiple layers of investment companies. Applicants submit that the proposed credit facility does not involve these abuses. Applicants note that there will be no duplicative costs or fees to the Funds or shareholders, and that MFS will receive no additional compensation for its services in administering the credit facility through the Interfund Lending Committee. Applicants also note that the entire purpose of the proposed credit facility is to provide economic benefits for all of the participating Funds and their shareholders.
7. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act prohibits open-end investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank; provided, that immediately after the borrowing, there is asset coverage of at least 300 per centum for all borrowings of the company. Under section 18(g) of the Act, the term “senior security” includes any bond, debenture, note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness. Applicants request relief from section 18(f)(1) to the limited extent necessary to implement the credit facility (because the lending Funds are not banks).
8. Applicants believe that granting relief under section 6(c) is appropriate because the Funds would remain subject to the requirement of section 18(f)(1) that all borrowings of a Fund, including combined interfund and bank borrowings, have at least 300% asset coverage. Based on the conditions and safeguards described in the application, applicants also submit that to allow the Funds to borrow from other Funds pursuant to the proposed credit facility is consistent with the purposes and policies of section 18(f)(1).
9. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, when acting as principal, from effecting any joint transactions in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the Commission. Rule 17d-1(b) provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule, the Commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the company's participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
10. Applicants submit that the purpose of section 17(d) is to avoid overreaching by and unfair advantage to investment company insiders. Applicants believe that the credit facility is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act in that it offers both reduced borrowing costs and enhanced returns on loaned funds to all participating Funds and their shareholders. Applicants note that each Fund would have an equal opportunity to borrow and lend on equal terms consistent with its investment policies and fundamental investment limitations. Applicants therefore believe that each Fund's participation in the credit facility will be on terms that are no different from or less advantageous than that of other participating Funds.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The Interfund Loan Rate will be the average of the Repo Rate and the Bank Loan Rate.
2. On each business day that the Interfund Lending Committee considers whether to use Interfund Loans, the Interfund Lending Committee will compare the Bank Loan Rate with the Repo Rate and will make cash available for Interfund Loans only if the Interfund Loan Rate is: (a) More favorable to the lending Fund than the Repo Rate and, if applicable, the yield of any money market fund approved by the Investment Management Committee as a money market fund in which the lending Fund could otherwise invest; and (b) more favorable to the borrowing Fund than the Bank Loan Rate.
3. If a Fund has outstanding borrowings, any Interfund Loans to the Fund: (a) Will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan; (b) will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral; (c) will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan (and in any event not over seven days); and (d) will provide that, if an event of default by the Fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the Fund, that event of default will automatically (without need for action or notice by the lending Fund) constitute an immediate event of default under the Interfund Lending Agreement entitling the lending Fund to call the Interfund Loan (and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral) and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing Fund.
4. A Fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the proposed credit facility if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total 10% or less of its total assets, provided that if the Fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender, including but not limited to another Fund, the Fund's interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral. If a Fund's total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than 10% of its total assets, the Fund may borrow through the proposed credit facility only on a secured basis. A Fund may not borrow through the proposed credit facility or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after such borrowing would be more than 331/3% of its total assets.
5. Before any Fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may, through additional borrowings, cause its outstanding borrowings from all sources to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund must first secure each outstanding Interfund Loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan. If the total outstanding borrowings of a Fund with outstanding Interfund Loans exceed 10% of its total assets for any other reason (such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions), the Fund will within one business day thereafter: (a) Repay all its outstanding Interfund Loans; (b) reduce its outstanding indebtedness to 10% or less of its total assets; or (c) secure each outstanding Interfund Loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a Start Printed Page 62474market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, at which time the collateral called for by this condition 5 shall no longer be required. Until each Interfund Loan that is outstanding at any time that a Fund's total outstanding borrowings exceeds 10% is repaid or the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund will mark the value of the collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding Interfund Loan at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the Interfund Loan.
6. No Fund may lend to another Fund through the proposed credit facility if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the proposed credit facility to exceed 15% of the lending Fund's current net assets at the time of the loan.
7. A Fund's Interfund Loans to any one Fund shall not exceed 5% of the lending Fund's net assets.
8. The duration of Interfund Loans will be limited to no more than the number of days required to receive payment for securities sold, up to a maximum of seven days. Loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition.
9. The Fund's borrowings through the proposed credit facility, as measured on the day when the most recent loan was made, will not exceed the greater of 125% of the Fund's total net cash redemptions or 102% of sales fails for the preceding seven calendar days.
10. Each Interfund Loan may be called on one business day's notice by a lending Fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing Fund.
11. A Fund's participation in the proposed credit facility must be consistent with its investment objectives and limitations and organizational documents.
12. The Interfund Lending Committee, on each Interfund Lending Day, will calculate total Fund borrowing and lending demand through the proposed credit facility, and allocate loans on an equitable basis among the Funds, without the intervention of any portfolio manager of participating Funds. The Interfund Lending Committee will not solicit cash for loans from any Fund or prospectively publish or disseminate the amount of current borrowing demand to the Investment Management Committee or portfolio managers of the Funds. Once it determines the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand, the Interfund Lending Committee will allocate loans among borrowing Funds without any further communication from a Fund's portfolio managers. If there is more available uninvested cash than borrowing demand on any Interfund Lending Day, any remaining cash will be invested in accordance with the Funds' investment policies and practices in the ordinary course.
13. The Interfund Lending Committee will monitor the Interfund Loan Rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the Interfund Loans and will make a quarterly report to each Fund Board concerning the participation of the Funds in the proposed credit facility and the terms and other conditions of any extensions of credit under the credit facility.
14. Each Fund Board, including a majority of the Independent Fund Board Members, will:
(a) Review, no less frequently than quarterly, each Fund's participation in the proposed credit facility during the preceding quarter for compliance with the conditions of any order permitting such transactions;
(b) Review at least annually the continuing appropriateness of the method used to calculate the Bank Loan Rate; and
(c) Review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of each Fund's participation in the proposed credit facility.
15. In the event an Interfund Loan is not paid according to its terms and such default is not cured within two business days from its maturity or from the time the lending Fund makes a demand for payment under the provisions of the Interfund Lending Agreement, MFS will promptly refer such loan for arbitration to an independent arbitrator who was selected by each Fund Board involved in the loan who will serve as arbitrator of disputes concerning Interfund Loans.[2] 
           The arbitrator will resolve any dispute promptly, and the arbitrator's decision will be binding on both Funds. The arbitrator will submit, at least annually, a written report to each Fund Board setting forth a description of the nature of any dispute and the actions taken by the Funds to resolve the dispute.
16. Each Fund will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transaction by it under the proposed credit facility occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, written records of all such transactions setting forth a description of the terms of the transactions, including the amount, the maturity and the Interfund Loan Rate, the rate of interest available at the time on overnight repurchase agreements and commercial bank borrowings, and such other information presented to the Fund Board in connection with the review required by conditions 13 and 14.
17. MFS, through or on behalf of the Interfund Lending Committee, will prepare and submit to the Fund Board for review an initial report describing how the proposed credit facility will operate and the procedures to be implemented to ensure that all Funds are treated fairly. For each calendar quarter after the commencement of the credit facility, the Interfund Lending Committee will report on the operations of the credit facility at the Fund Board's quarterly meetings.
Each Fund's chief compliance officer (“CCO”), as defined in rule 38a-1(4) under the Act, shall prepare an annual report for its Fund Board each year that the Fund participates in the proposed credit facility, that evaluates the Fund's compliance with the terms and conditions of the application and the procedures established to achieve such compliance. Each Fund's CCO will also annually file a certification pursuant to Item 77Q3 of Form N-SAR as such Form may be revised, amended, or superseded from time to time for each year that the Fund participates in the proposed credit facility, that certifies that the Fund and MFS have established procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the terms and conditions of the order. In particular, such certification will address procedures designed to achieve the following objectives:
(a) That the Interfund Loan Rate is higher than the Repo Rate, but lower than the Bank Loan Rate;
(b) Compliance with the collateral requirements as set forth in the Interfund Loan Borrowing Conditions;
(c) Compliance with the percentage limitations on interfund borrowing and lending;
(d) Allocation of interfund borrowing and lending demand in an equitable manner and in accordance with procedures established by the Fund Board; and
(e) That the interest rate on any Interfund Loan does not exceed the interest rate on any third-party borrowings of a borrowing Fund at the time of the Interfund Loan. Start Printed Page 62475Additionally, each Fund's independent auditors, in connection with their audit examinations of the Fund, will review the operation of the credit facility for compliance with the Interfund Loan Borrowing Conditions and their review will form the basis, in part, of the auditor's report on internal accounting controls in Form N-SAR.
18. No Fund will participate in the proposed credit facility upon receipt of requisite regulatory approval unless it has fully disclosed in its prospectus and/or SAI all material facts about its intended participation.

Jeffrey L. Shames                                                       

Dear Shareholders,                                                              
The current investment and economic environment bears little resemblance to     
last year's. One year ago, global economies were floundering, and the crisis    
in Asia threatened an already weak U.S. economy. Corporate earnings were flat,  
and economists used the word "deflation" for the first time in recent memory.   
Entering 1999, expectations for corporate earnings growth were lowered          
dramatically. In an attempt to foster U.S. growth, the Federal Reserve Board    
(the Fed) lowered interest rates.                                               

As a result, this year the U.S. economy is booming and unemployment is low. Many
corporations are focused on improving their profitability, and investors have   
been rewarded with positive surprises across a variety of industries. Our       
analysts predict that corporate earnings growth for 1999 will average 12% - 15%.

Global economies also are showing signs of strength, and the Asian crisis has   
passed. In fact, Japan's economic woes seem to have reached bottom. Although the
process is in its infancy, some Japanese corporations not only are talking about
restructuring and cost cutting, they also are beginning to take action, looking 
within to become more competitive and improve returns on equity. While still    
lagging the United States, Europe is beginning to restructure and consolidate.  
These signs of international growth have contributed to concerns that the U.S.  
economy now may be too strong. In June, and again in August, the Fed raised     
rates by one-quarter of a percentage point to help ward off the specter of      
inflation.                                                                      

After an unprecedented four years of 20% annual returns in the U.S. equity      
market, we fear that many investors have become accustomed to high returns and  
have lost sight of the risks they take on to achieve them. In the current market
many investors are taking on additional risk - whether through day trading or   
investing in speculative Internet stocks.                                       

Risks are as much a part of the market today as they were one year ago. We      
believe the market remains overvalued, with stocks priced 30% above our         
analysts' earnings projections. And market narrowness has not abated; the top 25
stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index, a popular, unmanaged index 
of common stock total return performance, are still the most overvalued. Such   
extreme overvaluation makes the stock market sensitive to interest-rate news and
any negative earnings surprises. The Year 2000 (Y2K) computer problem is another
factor causing investor concern. While we believe corporate America is well     
prepared to address any Y2K situations that may arise at year-end, no one can   
predict investor behavior. In our opinion, it is investor behavior that has the 
greatest potential to create market volatility.                                 

We believe the best way to address Y2K and other market risks is through our    
continuing commitment to MFS Original Research(R) and our fundamental investment
tenet of long-term investing. Whether markets are up or down, MFS analysts focus
on analyzing industries and visiting companies to determine the long-term       
winners and the prices that will make them attractive opportunities. Because all
companies will not benefit equally from the improving international environment,
bottom-up research remains critical to identifying those that we believe are    
successfully restructuring, consolidating, and gaining market share.            

Changes in market and economic conditions can't be predicted but should always  
be expected. The changes we have seen over the past year only reinforce our     
commitment to long-term planning and investing. We believe volatility helps to  
create opportunity for long-term investors to buy solid companies at attractive 
prices. For this reason, we are continuing to expand our domestic and           
international capabilities to ensure that MFS has primary, in-house research on 
companies worldwide. We believe that we have built the right investment team,   
backed by MFS Original Research, to take advantage of those opportunities for   
our shareholders.                                                               

We appreciate your confidence and welcome any questions or comments you may     
have.                                                                           

Respectfully,

MANAGEMENT REVIEW AND OUTLOOK 

[Photo of David M. Calabro]

For the 12 months ended September 30, 1999, Class A shares of the Fund provided 
a total return of 7.06%, Class B shares 6.43%, Class C shares 6.41%, and Class I
shares 7.43%. These returns assume the reinvestment of any distributions but    
exclude the effects of any sales charges. For the same period, the Standard &   
Poor's 500 Composite Index (the S&P 500), a popular, unmanaged index of common  
stocks total return performance, returned 27.81%. The Lehman Brothers           
Government/Corporate Bond Index (the Lehman Index), an unmanaged,               
market-value-weighted index of U.S. Treasury and government-agency securities   
that excludes mortgage-backed securities, returned -1.62%. According to Lipper  
Analytical Services, Inc., an independent firm that reports mutual fund         
performance, the average balanced fund returned 12.54% during the period.       

Q.  WHAT'S BEHIND THE STOCK MARKET'S STRONG PERFORMANCE OVER THE PAST YEAR?     

A.  We started out with stocks at a low and a lot of fear driving the market.   
   Fortunately, the Federal Reserve Board lowered interest rates at the end of
September 1998 and again in October. That, along with progress overseas,
restored investor confidence, and the market took off. Strong economic  
 growth at home kept the market climbing throughout the winter and spring,
with large-company growth stocks taking the lead. Value stocks lagged   
 considerably and only rebounded briefly last April and May. Growth stocks
    moved back into favor during the summer, but gave up some ground late in the
period as investors worried about valuation levels, earnings            
disappointments, a weaker dollar, and the possibility of higher interest
rates.                                                                  

Q.  WHY HAS IT BEEN SUCH A CHALLENGING TIME FOR VALUE STOCKS -- AND THE FUND?   

A.  Value stocks are usually in mature industries such as energy, financials,   
and industrials that need to be able to raise prices to grow earnings.  
Unfortunately, there really hasn't been any pricing flexibility in the  
 economy during the period. So that has hurt the value names. By contrast,
  growth stocks tend to have proprietary products and high gross margins, so
    they don't really need price increases. Obviously, a balanced fund like ours
  -- which typically has about 40% of its assets in fixed-income investments
and 60% in stocks -- is going to lag when the stock market is favoring  
growth stocks. Our Fund also has a value orientation -- a style we've   
followed for the past 29 years. As a result, we didn't own many top-    
performing technology stocks during the period. But we did have sizable 
investments in weaker sectors like financials and electric utilities. We
    take a long-term approach, however, and stick with our discipline regardless
of what's in favor. Over long periods, the returns on growth and value  
stocks have been very similar.                                          

Q.  WHY DID YOU HOLD ON TO FINANCIALS AND ELECTRIC UTILITIES?                   

A.  We saw good value in financials, especially insurance companies. We focused 
  on companies with strong prospects like Hartford Financial. Here's a solid
company with a strong management team and demonstrated earnings growth. 
Plus, the company looks like a good acquisition candidate in an industry
    where consolidation seems imminent. The stock has been disappointing lately,
but we believe it has strong potential. Chubb is another example of a   
company with good assets that has struggled because of weak pricing. We 
think prices will most likely move up, so we held on. By contrast, we   
  trimmed our stake in electric utilities, which had disappointing earnings.
Since deregulation is taking longer than expected, we decided there were
better opportunities elsewhere.                                         

Q.  WHICH STOCKS WERE AMONG YOUR BEST PERFORMERS DURING THE PERIOD?             

A.  Some of our best returns came from the energy and telecommunications        
   sectors. Rising oil prices, a promising supply/demand outlook, and industry
   consolidation helped boost energy stocks. BP Amoco, our largest investment,
also did well during the period thanks to synergies from its recent Amos
   merger and the prospect of new ones from its purchase of ArCo. Our holdings
    in Mobil, which is being acquired by Exxon, and Coastal Corp., a diversified
energy company, also posted strong gains for the period. In the         
telecommunications sector, stocks continued to benefit from tremendous  
    growth in wireless communications and the Internet. We had sizable stakes in
GTE and Bell Atlantic, both of which did especially well following the  
  announcement of their merger. Sprint was another strong performer. We also
benefited from owning stocks like AlliedSignal, which took off after its
  announced merger with Honeywell; Time Warner, which rebounded as investors
recognized the value of its cable assets; McDonald's, which changed its 
   growth strategy in the United States; and American Express, which continued
to deliver double-digit earnings growth.                                

Q.  WHERE ELSE HAVE YOU FOUND GOOD VALUES?                                      

A.  We're always looking for strong companies that have stumbled. For example,  
    we bought shares of Motorola -- a technology company whose stock was selling
  at a discount due to problems in its cellular handset division and a slump
in semiconductor sales industry wide. The stock has since made a great  
comeback. We also added to natural gas utilities, including Sonat and El
    Paso, which have steady cash flows from their gas pipelines and also benefit
from rising oil prices in their exploration and production businesses.  
    Another area we like is Europe, where corporations are way behind the United
   States in terms of restructuring. As companies like Royal Dutch, SmithKline
Beecham, and Akzo Nobel reorganize and cut costs to compete globally, we
expect to see better earnings growth. By the end of the period, we had  
  drained down our cash and increased our equity stake to 58% of net assets,
up from 52% a year earlier.                                             

Q.  DID YOU MAKE CHANGES ON THE BOND SIDE OF THE PORTFOLIO?                     

A.  Not many. We continued to keep roughly 38% of our net assets in bonds, with 
   about two-thirds of that in corporate bonds and the rest in U.S. Treasuries
  and mortgage-backed securities. We did, however, lower the Fund's duration
 -- an indicator of its sensitivity to changes in interest rates -- to 5.3
  years from 6.2 years. We did this last winter because we expected the bias
   on interest rates to be up. And the shorter a bond's duration, the less its
 price will fall as interest rates rise. To shorten duration, we increased
    our stake in bonds that mature in less than two years. This turned out to be
the right move, given that interest rates did move up during the period.
    Since then, bonds have pretty much stayed within a narrow range as inflation
concerns have battled flat inflation numbers.                           

Q.  WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THE COMING SIX MONTHS?                              

A.  We expect strong, but more moderate, economic growth with few inflation     
worries. There appears to be an upward bias on interest rates, given the
current strength of the U.S. economy and high employment levels. And any
   rise in interest rates would cool off the economy a bit. Regardless of what
happens, we believe the bonds we own should continue to provide the Fund
   with steady income and a measure of downside protection. On the stock side,
we're cautious about the overall market, given how high valuations are. 
   However, we feel the Fund's long-term value focus and bond weighting should
help us over the long term to weather whatever volatility lies ahead.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE SUMMARY                                                    

Class A Share Performance Including Sales Charge takes into account the         
deduction of the maximum 5.75% sales charge. Class B Share Performance Including
Sales Charge takes into account the deduction of the applicable contingent      
deferred sales charge (CDSC), which declines over six years from 4% to 0%. Class
C Share Performance Including Sales Charge takes into account the deduction of  
the 1% CDSC applicable to Class C shares redeemed within 12 months. Class I     
shares have no sales charge and are only available to certain institutional     
investors                                                                       

Class B, C, and I share performance include the performance of the Fund's Class 
A shares for periods prior to their inception (blended performance). Class B and
C blended performance has been adjusted to take into account the CDSC applicable
to Class B and C shares rather than the initial sales charge (load) applicable  
to Class A shares. Class I share blended performance has been adjusted to       
account for the fact that Class I shares have no sales charge. These blended    
performance figures have not been adjusted to take into account differences in  
class-specific operating expenses. Because operating expenses of Class B and C  
shares are higher than those of Class A, the blended Class B and C share        
performance is higher than it would have been had Class B and C shares been     
offered for the entire period. Conversely, because operating expenses of Class I
shares are lower than those of Class A, the blended Class I share performance is
lower than it would have been had Class I shares been offered for the entire    
period.                                                                         

All performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies and waivers,   
without which the results would have been less favorable. Subsidies and waivers 
may be rescinded at any time. See the prospectus for details. All results are   
historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.          

INVESTMENT RETURN AND PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE, AND SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED,
MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO      
GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

Notes to Financial Statements                                                   

(1) Business and Organization                                                   
MFS Total Return Fund (the Fund) is a diversified series of MFS Series Trust V  
(the Trust). The Trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust and is    
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as an open-    
end management investment company.                                              

(2) Significant Accounting Policies                                             
General - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally  
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and        
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and      
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial    
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the         
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Fund    
can invest in foreign securities. Investments in foreign securities are         
vulnerable to the effects of changes in the relative values of the local        
currency and the U.S. dollar and to the effects of changes in each country's    
legal, political, and economic environment.                                     

Investment Valuations - Equity securities listed on securities exchanges or     
reported through the NASDAQ system are reported at market value using last      
sale prices. Unlisted equity securities or listed equity securities for which   
last sale prices are not available are reported at market value using last      
quoted bid prices. Debt securities (other than short-term obligations which     
mature in 60 days or less), including listed issues and forward contracts, are  
valued on the basis of valuations furnished by dealers or by a pricing service  
with consideration to factors such as institutional-size trading in similar     
groups of securities, yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue,     
trading characteristics, and other market data, without exclusive reliance      
upon exchange or over-the-counter prices. Short-term obligations, which mature  
in 60 days or less, are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market     
value. Futures contracts listed on commodities exchanges are reported at        
market value using closing settlement prices. Securities for which there are    
no such quotations or valuations are valued in good faith by the Trustees.      

Foreign Currency Translation - Investment valuations, other assets, and         
liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies are converted each        
business day into U.S. dollars based upon current exchange rates. Purchases and 
sales of foreign investments, income, and expenses are converted into U.S.      
dollars based upon currency exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of
such transactions. Gains and losses attributable to foreign currency exchange   
rates on sales of securities are recorded for financial statement purposes as   
net realized gains and losses on investments. Gains and losses attributable to  
foreign exchange rate movements on income and expenses are recorded for         
financial statement purposes as foreign currency transaction gains and losses.  
That portion of both realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments    
that results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is not        
separately disclosed.                                                           

Deferred Trustee Compensation - Effective July 24, 1999, under a Deferred       
Compensation Plan (the Plan) independent Trustees may elect to defer receipt of 
all or a portion of their annual compensation. Deferred amounts are treated as  
though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of the Fund or     
other MFS funds selected by the Trustee. Deferred amounts represent an unsecured
obligation of the fund until distributed in accordance with the Plan.           

Security Loans - State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street"), as agent,
may loan the securities of the fund to certain brokers (the "Borrowers")        
approved by the Fund. The loans are collateralized at all times by U.S. Treasury
securities in an amount at least equal to the market value of the securities    
loaned. State Street provides the Fund with indemnification against Borrower    
default.                                                                        

At September 30, 1999, the value of securities loaned was $46,589,130. These    
loans were collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities of $49,071,340. On loans  
collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, a fee is received from the          
Borrower, and is allocated between the Fund and State Street. Income from       
securities lending is included in interest income on the Statement of           
Operations. The dividend and interest income earned on the securities loaned    
is accounted for in the same manner as other dividend and interest income.      

Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts - The Fund may enter into forward   
foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a specific      
foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date. Risks may arise upon        
entering into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to 
meet the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value 
of a foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The Fund may enter into      
forward contracts for hedging purposes as well as for non-hedging purposes. For 
hedging purposes, the Fund may enter into contracts to deliver or receive       
foreign currency it will receive from or require for its normal investment      
activities. The Fund may also use contracts in a manner intended to protect     
foreign currency-denominated securities from declines in value due to           
unfavorable exchange rate movements. For non-hedging purposes, the Fund may     
enter into contracts with the intent of changing the relative exposure of the   
Fund's portfolio of securities to different currencies to take advantage of     
anticipated changes. The forward foreign currency exchange contracts are        
adjusted by the daily exchange rate of the underlying currency and any gains or 
losses are recorded as unrealized until the contract settlement date. On        
contract settlement date, the gains or losses are recorded as realized gains or 
losses on foreign currency transactions.                                        

Investment Transactions and Income - Investment transactions are recorded on the
trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All discount is   
accreted for financial statement and tax reporting purposes as required by      
federal income tax regulations. Dividends received in cash are recorded on the  
ex-dividend date. Dividend and interest payments received in additional         
securities are recorded on the ex-dividend or ex-interest date in an amount     
equal to the value of the security on such date.                                

Fees Paid Indirectly - The Fund's custody fee is calculated as a percentage of  
the Fund's month end net assets. The fee is reduced according to an             
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by     
the Fund. During the period, the Fund's custodian fees were reduced by          
$1,084,935 under this arrangement.                                              

Tax Matters and Distributions - The Fund's policy is to comply with the         
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) applicable to regulated      
investment companies and to distribute to shareholders all of its taxable       
income, including any net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no         
provision for federal income or excise tax is provided.                         

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The Fund    
distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial reporting    
basis and requires that only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and  
profits be reported in the financial statements as distributions from paid-in   
capital. Differences in the recognition or classification of income between the 
financial statements and tax earnings and profits, which result in temporary    
over-distributions for financial statement purposes, are classified as          
distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains. During  
the year ended September 30, 1999, $5,119,165 and $185,262 were reclassified to 
accumulated undistributed net realized gain on investments and foreign currency 
transactions and paid-in capital, respectively, from accumulated distributions  
in excess of net investment income due to differences between book and tax      
accounting for currency transactions and mortgage-backed securities. This change
had no effect on the net assets or net asset value per share.                   

Multiple Classes of Shares of Beneficial Interest - The Fund offers multiple    
classes of shares, which differ in their respective distribution and service    
fees. All shareholders bear the common expenses of the Fund based on daily net  
assets of each class, without distinction between share classes. Dividends are  
declared separately for each class. Differences in per share dividend rates are 
generally due to differences in separate class expenses. Class B shares will    
convert to Class A shares approximately eight years after purchase.             

(3) Transactions with Affiliates                                                
Investment Adviser - The Fund has an investment advisory agreement with         
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) to provide overall investment    
advisory and administrative services, and general office facilities. The        
management fee is computed daily and paid monthly at the following annual       
rates:

The Fund pays no compensation directly to its Trustees who are officers of the  
investment adviser, or to officers of the Fund, all of whom receive remuneration
for their services to the Fund from MFS. Certain officers and Trustees of the   
Fund are officers or directors of MFS, MFS Fund Distributors, Inc. (MFD), and   
MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC). The Fund has an unfunded defined benefit plan  
for all of its independent Trustees and Mr. Bailey. Included in Trustees'       
compensation is a net periodic pension expense of $56,051, for the year ended   
September 30, 1999.                                                             

Administrator - The Fund has an administrative services agreement with MFS to   
provide the Fund with certain financial, legal, shareholder servicing,          
compliance, and other administrative services. As a partial reimbursement for   
the cost of providing these services, the Fund pays MFS an administrative fee   
at the following annual percentages of the Fund's average daily net assets:     

First $1 billion                               0.0150%  
Next $1 billion                                0.0125%  
Next $1 billion                                0.0100%  
In excess of $3 billion                        0.0000%  

Distributor - MFD, a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS, as distributor, received   
$1,495,210, for the year ended September 30, 1999, as its portion of the sales  
charge on sales of Class A shares of the Fund.                                  

The Trustees have adopted a distribution plan for Class A, Class B, and Class   
C shares pursuant to Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 as        
follows:                                                                        

The Fund's distribution plan provides that the Fund will pay MFD up to 0.35% per
annum of its average daily net assets attributable to Class A shares in order   
that MFD may pay expenses on behalf of the Fund related to the distribution and 
servicing of its shares. These expenses include a service fee paid to each      
securities dealer that enters into a sales agreement with MFD of up to 0.25% per
annum (0.15% per annum on assets attributable to Class A shares sold prior to   
October 1, 1989) of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Class A 
shares which are attributable to that securities dealer and a distribution fee  
to MFD of up to 0.10% per annum of the Fund's average daily net assets          
attributable to Class A shares. MFD retains the service fee for accounts not    
attributable to a securities dealer, which amounted to $774,152, for the year   
ended September 30, 1999. Fees incurred under the distribution plan during the  
year ended September 30, 1999, were 0.35% of average daily net assets           
attributable to Class A shares on an annualized basis.                          

The Fund's distribution plan provides that the Fund will pay MFD a distribution 
fee of 0.75% per annum, and a service fee of up to 0.25% per annum, of the      
Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Class B and Class C shares. MFD 
will pay to securities dealers that enter into a sales agreement with MFD all or
a portion of the service fee attributable to Class B and Class C shares, and    
will pay to such securities dealers all of the distribution fee attributable to 
Class C shares. The service fee is intended to be consideration for services    
rendered by the dealer with respect to Class B and Class C shares. MFD retains  
the service fee for accounts not attributable to a securities dealer, which     
amounted to $96,537, and $8,867, for Class B and Class C shares, respectively,  
for the year ended September 30, 1999. Fees incurred under the distribution plan
during the year ended September 30, 1999, were 1.00% of average daily net assets
attributable to Class B and Class C shares.                                     

Certain Class A and Class C shares are subject to a contingent deferred sales   
charge in the event of a shareholder redemption within 12 months following      
purchase. A contingent deferred sales charge is imposed on shareholder          
redemptions of Class B shares in the event of a shareholder redemption within   
six years of purchase. MFD receives all contingent deferred sales charges.      
Contingent deferred sales charges imposed during the year ended September 30,
1999, were $46,452, $3,273,481, and $169,201, for Class A, Class B, and Class   
C shares, respectively.                                                         

Shareholder Servicing Agent - MFSC, a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS, earns a   
fee for its services as shareholder servicing agent. The fee is calculated as   
a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets at an effective annual      
rate of 0.10%. Prior to April 1, 1999, the fee was calculated as a percentage   
of the Fund's average daily net assets at an effective annual rate of 0.1125%.

(6) Line of Credit                                                              
The Fund and other affiliated funds participate in a $820 million unsecured     
line of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a line of credit        
agreement. Borrowings may be made to temporarily finance the repurchase of      
Fund shares. Interest is charged to each fund, based on its borrowings, at a    
rate equal to the bank's base rate. In addition, a commitment fee, based on     
the average daily unused portion of the line of credit, is allocated among the  
participating funds at the end of each quarter. The commitment fee allocated    
to the Fund for the year ended September 30, 1999, was $48,353.                 

(7) Financial Instruments                                                       
The Fund trades financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the        
normal course of its investing activities in order to manage exposure to        
market risks such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These  
financial instruments include forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The  
notional or contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment   
the Fund has in particular classes of financial instruments and does not        
necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement  
of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all      
related and offsetting transactions are considered.

At September 30, 1999, the Fund had sufficient cash and/or securities to cover  
any commitments under these contracts.                                          

(8) Restricted Securities                                                       
The Fund may invest not more than 15% of its net assets in securities which     
are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale. At September 30,
1999, the Fund owned the following restricted securities, excluding securities  
issued under Rule 144A, constituting 0.06% of net assets which may not be       
publicly sold without registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The Fund   
does not have the right to demand that such securities be registered. The       
value of these securities is determined by valuations furnished by dealers or   
by a pricing service, or if not available, in good faith by the Trustees.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT 

To the Trustees of MFS Series Trust V and Shareholders of MFS Total Return      
Fund:                                                                           

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including 
the portfolio of investments, of MFS Total Return Fund (one of the series       
constituting MFS Series Trust V) as of September 30, 1999, the related statement
of operations for the year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets   
for the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, and the financial highlights   
for each of the years in the five-year period ended September 30, 1999. These   
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the     
Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these        
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.              

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial       
highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of the securities owned at     
September 30, 1999, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; where     
replies were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial       
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis   
for our opinion.                                                                

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights present      
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MFS Total Return    
Fund at September 30, 1999, the results of its operations, the changes in its   
net assets, and its financial highlights for the respective stated periods in   
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

MFS' YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE 

MFS Investment Management(R), as an investment adviser and on behalf of the MFS 
funds, is committed to the effective use of technology in managing our portfolio
investments, delivering high-quality service to MFS fund shareholders,          
retirement plan participants, and MFS' institutional clients, and supporting the
financial consultants who sell our products. With that in mind, we created a    
separately funded Year 2000 Program Management Office in 1996 comprised of a    
specialized staff reporting directly to MFS senior management.                  

The Year 2000 (Y2K) problem arises because calendar-year fields in computers and
software applications traditionally have used two-digit codes so that, for      
example, the year 1998 is coded as "98," with the "19" being implied. In the    
year 2000, unless necessary corrections have been made, computer applications   
may assume "00" refers to 1900 rather than 2000, thus resulting in systems      
failures or miscalculations. To address this issue, our team of dedicated       
business and technology managers, working with outside experts, is taking steps 
to ascertain the Y2K readiness of MFS' internal systems and is working with our 
external systems vendors to determine whether they expect their systems to be   
ready.                                                                          

MFS recognizes that fund shareholders and institutional clients also are        
concerned about whether the companies whose securities are held in their        
portfolios are addressing Y2K issues. As part of the MFS Original Research(R)   
process of evaluating portfolio investments, one of the many relevant factors   
that MFS' portfolio managers and research analysts may consider is a company's  
Y2K readiness. Each year, MFS' research analysts and portfolio managers conduct 
more than 1,000 on-site meetings with companies whose securities are, or may be,
held in fund and client portfolios, and host an additional 1,500 meetings at    
MFS' headquarters. When assessing the Y2K readiness of these companies, MFS'    
research analysts and portfolio managers may rely upon discussions at these     
meetings as well as SEC disclosure documents and third-party reports.           

Y2K readiness is an enormously complex, worldwide issue. No company or          
institution can guarantee that it will be unaffected by the Y2K issue. While MFS
is taking significant steps to protect the integrity of its internal systems,   
there can be no assurance that these steps will be sufficient to avoid any      
adverse impact on MFS, shareholders of MFS funds, participants in retirement    
plans administered by MFS, or MFS' institutional clients.

Management Office by e-mail at y2k@mfs.com or by letter at 500 Boylston Street,

Cargo Inspection Services - Container Loading Check (CLC)
































 Container Loading Check (CLC) 
 
Container Load Check is the final step in the manufacturing process. Ensure the final details of your product are correct and actual ordered quantity are securely loaded onto your container before signing off and settling final payment.











What is a Container Loading Check (CLC)?
 During a Container Loading Check, your inspector will select boxes at random to confirm each carton bears the quantity of product ordered, the quality matches the specifications and/or approved sample provided by you, and that all packaging material contains the correct barcodes, labeling, and packing materials. The entire container loading process is strictly supervised; ensuring all product paid for makes it on the truck. A CLC reduces risk of damage during shipment for $309 USD. 
 For all inspections, AsiaInspection uses the standard internationally recognized ANSI/ASQC Z1.4 (ISO 2859-1) statistical sampling procedure. These comprehensive criteria cover: functionality, performance, durability, overall appearance, and dimension. Inspection certificates are issued if stipulated in the letter of credit.
