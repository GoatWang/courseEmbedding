Early Views










Man FRM provides commentary on global financial markets and an early indication of hedge fund performance in the previous month.
 


 








FRM Early View - June 2017
June was a mixed month for hedge fund returns, with Equity Long-Short and Relative Value strategies generally performing well on increased single security alpha, while Credit and Global Macro struggled.
Keith Haydon 

FRM Early View - May 2017
May was, broadly speaking, a positive month for hedge fund strategies, although returns continue to be subdued by range-bound markets and a general lack of volatility.
Keith Haydon 

FRM Early View - April 2017
Hedge funds experienced a mixed month in April, as Credit and Equity Long-Short managers generated minor positive returns, Relative Value strategies were mixed and Global Macro strategies generally struggled.
Keith Haydon
