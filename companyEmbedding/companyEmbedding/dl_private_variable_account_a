Explanations, Exercises, Problems and Calculators


























Variable costing versus absorption costing
 Posted in: Variable and absorption costing (explanations) 

 
 



Explain the difference between variable and absorption costing. How unit product cost is computed under two methods?
Variable and absorption are two different costing methods. Almost all successful companies in the world use both the methods. Variable costing and absorption costing cannot be substituted for one another because both the systems have their own benefits and limitations.
These costing approaches are known by various names. For example, variable costing is also known as direct costing or marginal costing and absorption costing is also known as full costing or traditional costing.
The information provided by variable costing method is mostly used by internal management for decision making purposes. Absorption costing provides information that is used by internal management as well as by external parties like creditors, government agencies and auditors etc.
Computation of unit product cost under two methods:
Under absorption costing system, the product cost consists of all variable as well as all fixed manufacturing costs i.e., direct materials, direct labor and factory overhead (FOH). But when variable costing system is used, the fixed cost (both manufacturing and non-manufacturing) is treated as a period or capacity cost and is, therefore, not included in the product cost.
Following exhibition summarizes the difference between variable costing and absorption costing:
Variable versus absorption costing


For further clarification of the concept, consider the following examples:
Example 1
A company manufactures and sells 5000 units of product X per year . Suppose one unit of product X requires the following costs:
Direct materials: $5 per unit
Direct labor: $4 per unit
Variable manufacturing overhead: $1 per unit
Fixed manufacturing overhead: $20,000 per year
The unit product cost of the company is computed as follows:
Absorption Costing: $5 + $4 + $1 + $4* = $14
Variable Costing: $5 + $4 + $1 = $10
* $20,000 / 5,000
Notice that the fixed manufacturing overhead cost has not been included in the unit cost under variable costing system but it has been included in the unit cost under absorption costing system. This is the primary difference between variable and absorption costing.
Example 2
Sunshine company produces and sells only washing machines. The company uses variable costing for internal reporting and absorption costing for external reporting. The data  for the year 2016 is given below:
Direct materials: $150/unit
Direct labor: $45/unit
Variable manufacturing overhead: $25/unit
Fixed manufacturing overhead: $160,000 per year
Fixed marketing and administrative expenses: $110,000 per year
Variable marketing and administrative expenses: $15/unit sold
Company produced and sold 8,000 machines during the year 2016.
Required: Compute the unite product cost under variable costing and absorption costing.
Solution:

*$160,000 / 8,000 Units = $20
Note: Marketing and administrative expenses are period costs and are not relevant in the computation of unit product cost.

I could have used a little more explanation of the variable costing method, however this was useful.

Why is marketing and administrative expenses not relevant in the second example?

Yolly 









they are period cost in both method, not included in the computation of product cost.
Reply 








 


Accounting For Management 









Because they are not incurred to manufacture a product. In example 2, we are computing unit product cost, not net operating income. Read this article:

How about when the unit production and unit sold are different? which one we have to choose to calculate the unit product cost?
Reply 






 


Accounting For Management 









Always units produced. You incur production cost to produce not sell.

can you help me to solve this problem
) Durante Company reported the following information about the production and sale of its only product during the first month of operations:
Selling price per unit	$300
Sales	$480,000
Direct materials used	$220,000
Direct labor	$200,000
Variable factory overhead	$60,000
Fixed factory overhead	$80,000
Variable selling and administrative expenses	$20,000
Fixed selling and administrative expenses	$10,000
Ending inventory, Direct Materials	0
Ending inventory, Work-in-process	0
Ending inventory, Finished Goods	400 units
Under variable costing, the cost of finished goods ending inventory is ________.
Reply 






 


Accounting For Management 









Total units manufactured during the month:
Units sold + units in ending inventory
1,600* + 400
= 2,000
*480,000/300
Variable manufacturing cost:
Direct materials used + Direct labor + Variable factory overhead
220,000 + 200,000 + 60,000
= 480,000
Variable manufacturing cost per unit:
$480,000/2,000 = $240
Cost of finished goods ending  inventory:
400units*$240 = $96,000

How if the budgeted production is 40 000 and the actual production is 50 000. Which one will be use to determine the fix production overhead per unit? is it 300 000/50 000 or 300 000/40 000?

I think variable selling and admin fall in product cost in marginal costing. Correct me if i am wrong.

Nasser Farahat 









Sajjad Badar becaus admin& selling expenses is period costs not product costs,  don,t forget we interest about product cost only that,s mean we compute manofactory expenses to detemine units cost  not admin& selling expenses

I would like to be assisted with the following question:
1. The following budgeted information relates to a manufacturing company for next period:
production 14 000 sales 12000 units and fixed production costs R63000 and fixed selling costs R12000.
the normal level of activity is 14000 units per period.
using an absorption costing, the profit for the next period has been calculated as R36000.
what would be the profit for the next period using marginal costing.
Reply 






 


Accounting For Management 









As the inventory is increasing, the profit under absorption costing would be higher than the marginal costing.
Begining inventory: 0 units
Ending inventory: 14,000 – 12,000 = 2,000 units
Per unit fixed manufacturing cost: 63,000/14,000 = R4.5
Total cost of ending inventory: 2,000*4.5 = R9,000
Profit for the next period under marginal costing: R36,000 – R9,000 = R27,000

Hello,
Is that inventory and COGS under absorption costing are always higher than variable costing? If not, which one is correct statement? And how about fixed overhead expenses? Under which method has always higher fixed overhead expenses?
Thanks

As much as this is useful, 
Can we conclude that in the long run, total costs incurred will be the same under a FIFO method?
I know that using one or the other can maximize net income but my question has to do with the long term nature of the cost.
If anyone can answer this it would be unreal!!
Thanks
