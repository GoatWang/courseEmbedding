CONSUMER ALERT




SOME DATA MAY BE OUT-OF-DATE
TaxBuzz uses basic business information from third-party data providers. We have built our database from these public records and sources. In the process, some of the data may appear out-of-date. We allow business owners to claim their listings to make sure we are showing the most accurate profiles and contact information.
This profile has been flagged as possibly being out-of-date, and it may mean the professional is no longer practicing or has not renewed their Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) with the IRS which is required to prepare and sign tax returns. If this is your business, feel free to claim this listing and update your profile information to bring the profile to live status.










IRS Annual Filing Season Program Participant




This individual is a participant in the IRS's voluntary tax preparer program, which generally includes the passage of an annual testing requirement (1) and the completion of a significant number of hours of continuing education. Preparers satisfying these educational requirements and agreeing to abide by the IRS's rules are allowed to represent clients whose returns they prepared and signed, but only before revenue agents, customer service representatives, and similar IRS employees, including the Taxpayer Advocate Service. This extremely important privilege is not extended to tax preparers who are not attorneys, certified public accountants, or enrolled agents. To be eligible, tax preparers must complete the AFSP requirement every tax year.
(1) In states that have their own program; the annual testing requirement is waived.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the ICTV Brands' Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ernest Kollias. Sir, you may begin.
Ernest Kollias, Jr.
Thank you very much and welcome to our conference call to discuss ICTV Brands' financial results for the quarter ended September 30th, 2016. On the call we have Kelvin Claney, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rich Ransom, our President; and myself, our Chief Financial Officer.
Rich will review the company's business operations as well as give a general update on the recently announced definitive agreement for ICTV to purchase a consumer assets of PhotoMedex Inc. which includes the no!no! brand.
I will review the company's financials and discuss the progress on the announced private placement and Kelvin will give an update on the company's future strategic goals as it relates to the integration of the acquired assets into ICTV's global sales platform. Immediately, thereafter, we’ll take questions from our call participants.
I'd like to take a quick moment to read the Safe Harbor Statement. During the course of this conference call, we will make certain forward looking statements. All statements that address expectations, opinions, or predictions about the future are forward looking statements.
Although they reflect our current expectations and are based on our best view of the industry and of our performance as we see them today, they are not guarantees of future performance. The statements involve a number of risks and assumptions and since those elements can change, we would ask that you interpret them in that light.
We urge you to review ICTV's Form 10-K and other SEC filings for a discussion of the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich Ransom.
Rich Ransom
Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all who have joined us on today's call. On today's call, we will give a general overview of the highlights of the third quarter and our continued process -- progress in expanding our digital marketing platform and expansion of our retail distribution in North America. In addition, we will also discuss the details of two recently announced definitive asset purchase agreements detailed in our October 5th, 2016 8-K filing with the SEC.
Some specific highlights and updates that we will further discuss on this call include the introduction of our new CFO, Ernest P. Kollias, Jr., who was hired on October 6th. Updates on our U.S. direct-to-consumer and retail sales channels, the long-awaited launch of the U.K. market for DermaWand, progress on the new DermaWand unit, further details on the announcement to acquire all the consumer assets of PhotoMedex Inc., which include the no!no! brand, details on the definitive assets purchase agreement to acquire the assets of Ermis Labs, including a previously licensed CoralActives line and a variety of medicated soap bars, and an update on the progress of our net announced private placement of $7 million to fund the announced acquisitions.
One year ago, on our third quarter 2015 conference call, our management team was very honest about the challenges we face as an organization. We laid out a plan to change our strategic direction. We need to stay relevant in the direct-to-consumer space, we were going to have to change our approach to marketing.

Over the last year, our whole team has been focused on building and expanding our digital marketing platform to include a strong focus in programmatic video and display advertising, social media marketing, and email marketing. We also knew that we needed to expand our sales channels beyond the traditional DRTV, drive to call center or direct website model.
I'm pleased to report that ICTV now sells our brands with over 10 major North American retailers that we had previously not worked with this time last year. We have also been talking for several quarters about expanding our marketing platform across the pond. I'm pleased to announce today that ICTV launched DermaWand into the United Kingdom about four weeks ago after spending the better part of the summer building and setting up a sales and distribution platform that mimics what we do in North America.
A major investment has been made by our team over the last year to build ICTV the sales and marketing infrastructure to succeed both now and in the future. As a management team, we continue to assess the challenges we face to take ICTV to the next level of sustained growth and profitability.
The conclusion we have come to is that the company needs more products to feed into the platform so that we can generate substantial sales. This conclusion is what has led to the announcement of -- we believe to be too transformative asset acquisitions that we announced on October 5th.
In a few minutes, we will give you more details on these acquisitions and what we believe it will mean for the future of ICTV and its shareholders. But for now, I would like to hand the call over to our newly appointed CFO, Ernie Kollias, who will introduce himself to you and give an update on the results from the third quarter.
Ernest Kollias, Jr.
Thank you, Rich. It is an honor to join ICTV at such an exciting time. Before getting into the results from the third quarter, I wanted to take a few moments to introduce myself to the ICTV shareholders.
I joined ICTV as the new CFO on October 6th. As you may have read on the 8-K that was filed with the SEC on October 11th, I received my Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Ministration from Drexel University in 1996 and a Master of Science Degree in Taxation from Widener University in 2001. Also in 2001 I form Freedom Financial Advisory and Capital Management Inc., a tax management and financial consulting practice, where I served as the Chief Executive Officer and President.
I'm a certified financial planner professional with over 22 years of experience in growing and developing businesses. I work for various Fortune 100 companies including General Electric, SmithKline Beecham, Pfizer and PNC Bank and have held positions in finance, accounting, international operations, taxation, financial services, and insurance.
I also worked in public accounting for [Indiscernible], McCabe, and Rodman, a globally recognized CPA firm before starting my own business over 15 years ago. My areas of expertise include strategic business planning, capital and asset management, comprehensive financial planning, budgeting, and forecasting, tax management, venture capital, and corporate business structuring. My financial and tax practice has benefited companies that conduct business both domestically and internationally.
I provided services to over 350 companies and 1,200 individuals over the past 15 years. During this time, I've assisted in the establishment of over 300 corporate business entities and structure their tax and accounting practices.
I'm excited about the opportunity to join ICTV as CFO at this transformative time in the company's history. Just before this call, ICTV filed its 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30th, 2016. I would like now to go through a few of the key financial highlights from the quarter.

Revenues for the three months ended September 30th, 2016 were $4.2 million compared to $3.6 million in the prior year quarter and $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2016. We're encouraged by our ability to broaden the company's media footprint as we continue to build out our digital marketing platform and diversify our sales channels with additional e-commerce and retail outlets in the fourth quarter.
Our revenue from brick-and-mortar sales was $78,000 compared to zero dollars in the prior year quarter. While our armor sales revenue for the online marketplaces such as bedbathandbeyond.com and walmart.com amounted $163,000 compared to $15,000 in the prior year quarter.
We're confident that these new revenue streams will continue to grow throughout the remainder of the year and our e-commerce sales will help drive the push to significant in-store placement within North America.
International third-party distributor sales were approximately $865,000 compared to $613,000 in the prior year quarter. As we continue to get our distribution partner selling additional brands such as our Ultimate Pedi, Jidue and Spin Force, we believe sales in this channel will rise in the quarters to come.
The Latino Media Services, LMS Group comprised of distributors from Chile, Argentina, Peru, Columbia, El Salvador, and Ecuador accounted for approximately $247,000 compared to $158,000 in the prior quarter and sales to our third-party distributor located in Mexico, Inova were approximately $389,000 compared to zero dollars in the prior quarter.
We are continuing to work on a new model and marketing campaign for DermaWand as well as further diversifying its international product portfolio in order to grow this segment in the future. Significant quarterly increases include media expense of $238,000, internet marketing costs of $153,000, which were offset by decreases in production expense of $78,000.
Total general and administrative expenses decreased to $1 million from $1.2 million in the prior year quarter as a result of travel expenditure decreases of $15,000, payroll and employee benefit expense decreases of $40,000, consulting expense reductions of $9,000, and stock-based compensation decreases of the $102,000.
Net loss was $262,000 compared to a net loss of $822,000 in the prior year quarter. Earnings per share was a loss of $0.01 as compared to a loss of $0.03 in the comparable prior year quarter.
Adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation, and amortization adjusted EBITDA with a loss of the $140,000 compared to even a loss of $663,000 in the prior year quarter.
For the nine months ended September 30th, 2016, we had positive cash flow from operating activities of $104,000 compared to cash flow used by operating activities of $974,000 for the same period in 2015, a positive swing of $1.078 million.
Adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $470,000 compared to EBITDA loss of $314,000 for the nine months ended September 30th, 2015. We are committed to maintaining appropriate liquidity levels and believe we have a plan in place to do so.
As discussed in the Note 10 of the 10-Q we filed today, on October 4th, 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with PhotoMedex to acquire substantially all of the consumer assets of PhotoMedex and its subsidiaries.
Under the terms of the agreement, ICTV is required to pay a purchase price of $9.5 million consisting of $3 million cash payment on closing, a $2 million cash payment due on the 90th day following the closing and $4.5 million capped royalty based on the future net sales of the acquired product lines.
This asset purchase will include the respective product trademarks, patent, and other intellectual product property along with manufacturing pooling and PhotoMedex's Hong Kong and Brazilian subsidiaries.

ICTV will also receive a minimum of $6 million of GAAP inventory, $3 million of the purchase price has already been deposited into an escrow account that is governed by an escrow agreement among our company PhotoMedex, certain investors in our securities, and the escrow agent, and will be released at the closing of the PhotoMedex acquisition.
We expect to be able to pay the $3 million and the $2 million cash payments out of the proceeds of a private placement of our common stock pursuant to a securities purchase agreement that we entered into with certain investors on October 4th, 2016, relating to the sale of up to $7 million of our common stock at a price of $0.34 per share. This private placement is also discussed in Note 10.
On October 4th, 2016, we delivered to PhotoMedex a letter of credit from the Leo Group that secures our obligation to make the $2 million payment in the event that we do not raise enough capital to cover the $2 million payment from our private placement.
We expect that the following -- the closing of PhotoMedex acquisition and the closing of the acquisition of Ermis Labs, which is also discussed in Note 10, we will begin to generate a higher level of revenues and net income as revenues and income from the sale of these new products are added to our current mix of products.
I'd like to turn the call back over to Rich who will provide further details on these transactions.
Rich Ransom
Thank you, Ernie. I'm going to spend a few minutes giving you an update on the major events of the third quarter and some exciting developments that we've been working on through the first half of the fourth quarter. Then Kelvin and I will give updates on the acquisitions and our plans for integration of the new assets into ICTV's platform.
The third quarter is traditionally the toughest quarter for our direct-to-consumer business and North America as the weather is at its annual peak and many distractions are vying for our target audience's attention.
This summer presented additional distractions [ph] with the Summer Olympics spanning 16 days in August and two weeks of political conventions during late July and early August. The political campaigns definitely had an effect on our media race, which caused us to scale back our television media during the second half of the quarter.
On our second quarter call, I announced that our management team had made the strategic decision to mimic the sales platform we have created in North America in the United Kingdom. During the third quarter, our team worked very hard setting up all the necessary elements to launch a direct-to-consumer marketing campaign in the United Kingdom and we're very pleased to report you today that during the week of October 10th, DermaWand had officially launched in the United Kingdom via digital marketing and print media.
To-date we've spent approximately $28,000 dollars on digital media in the U.K. across Facebook and Google AdWords and approximately $6,200 on print media across three publications.
The total return on the $34,000 in spend has been just over $100,000 in revenue, resulting in a contribution to profit of about $15,000 since we launched in the U.K. The DermaWand is currently selling for £150 pounds, which includes the 20% value-added tax we're required to collect in the net.
We have initially set up to sell DermaWand as a single payment option, unlike North America where we offer a free trial and installment payments. We intend in the future to offer an installment payment option, which will be three payments of £50. Our marketing team is confident this change will result in a higher conversion and a higher media efficiency ratio or MER, which is exciting considering we're already at almost three MER.
In regards to expanding our sales distribution in the U.K., we plan to follow the same model of working with major retailers both online and in-store to give customers more options of where to buy our products.

We also plan to work with live shopping channels. On the last call, I had announced that we had an airdate with IdealWorld, which is one of the major live shopping channels in England.
For a variety of reasons, the September airdate that was announced was postponed. We now have resolved the issues that prevented us from airing and are working on a date to launch DermaWand on ideal shopping in December.
Last item I want to discuss with you today in relation to the third quarter results is our efforts in expanding our retail footprint. North American online retail sales continue to thrive throughout the third quarter. The two most notable are Walmart U.S. and Costco Canada. Walmart launched in the second quarter of this year, but it is striving the third quarter, steadily increasing from selling between 15 to 30 DermaWands a week to consistently selling between 40 to 60 units a week throughout the third quarter.
Walmart has taken notice of this success as -- and as a result, we have been selected to participate in one of their Black Friday, Cyber Monday promotions, which will showcase DermaWand as one of their four selected beauty items in a site-wide campaign selected amongst thousands of other products. We're very excited to see this type of exposure for DermaWand from this retail giant during the most shop time of year.
A little further North in Canada, DermaWand launched on costco.ca in September. Sales started strong out of the gate with 10 to 15 orders per week in the first two weeks. To further promote DermaWand to the Costco members, we have anticipated in their weekly email blast promotions that have increased sales significantly. The most recent blast yielded over 70 orders in one week.
To capitalize on this success, we will be participating in their Black Friday, Cyber Monday promotions that will be paired with another email blast. We expect to easily sell in the triple digits during this promotional period.
The online retail expansion continues to spread as we enter the fourth quarter with multiple brands launching on cvs.com and kohls.com, which is already yielding 40-plus DermaWand orders a week.
We have also been approved to launch on target.com and our hope is to be live with a DermaWand listing before Black Friday.
In addition to the online retail environment, we continue to expand our footprint into traditional brick-and-mortar retail. In October, we began a relationship with the Canadian retail network of over 1,300 Banner pharmacies called McKesson.
By DermaWand being included in the product portfolio of McKesson, each pharmacy can independently order product. In the first month, 15 pharmacies ordered DermaWands, which we consider a great start.
In the U.S., we have now completed production of the in-store retail displays for Bed Bath and Beyond and are just awaiting the order for the exact stores. We expect to have DermaWand placed in 30 stores. If sales are strong in those stores, we would expect Bed Bath and Beyond to begin rolling us out chain-wide in the first half of 2017.
There many other exciting projects that our sales and marketing teams are working on to expand the awareness of our -- and sales of our brands and I wish I had more time to share them all with you, however, at this point in the call, I want to transition to a discussion on the recently announced acquisitions.
As mentioned earlier, on October 5th, ICTV filed an 8-K with the SEC detailing two definitive asset purchase agreements. The first agreement calls for ICTV to purchase the consumer assets of PhotoMedex Inc., trading symbol PHMD. This agreement includes the acquisition of the proprietary products and services that addressed skin diseases and conditions or pain reduction using home-used devices for various indications including hair removal, acne treatment, skin rejuvenation, and lower back pain.

Their products are currently sold and distributed to traditional retail, online, and infomercial outlets and include no!no! hair, no!no! skin, no!no! glow, Made You Look, made you look smooth skin care, Kyrobak and ClearTouch, which is a device that uses photo therapy to treat nail fungus.
In addition to acquiring the intellectual property of the aforementioned brands, as part of the agreement, ICTV will also acquire $6 million of GAAP inventory, meaning that the product is salable and not reserved on PhotoMedex's books. We'll also be acquiring subsidiaries of PhotoMedex in Brazil and Hong Kong.
In the same 8-K I referenced above, we also announced acquisition of all the assets of Ermis Labs Inc. in exchange for 2.5 million shares of ICTV common stock and a 5% cap -- royalty cap at $1.75 million with a minimum guaranteed payment of $175,000 per year.
The assets of Ermis Labs include the patent for our previously licensed acne treatment system branded CoralActives, as well as a variety of formulas for the medicated soap bars that treat conditions such as acne, dermatitis, psoriasis, and dandruff.
As part of the acquisition, ICTV will be acquiring inventory of approximately 60,000 medicated soap bars as well as the web domain medicatedbars.com. Our team believes both of these acquisitions fit perfectly into our marketing and distribution platform.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kelvin who will give you some more specifics as to our plans for these assets.
Kelvin Claney
Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon. I would like to -- I would like that everyone who has joined us -- I'd like to thank everyone who has joined us on the call today.
I'm often amazed when I think about the number of shareholders who have been with us for several years and continue to support our efforts through the good and the tough time that we've had over the years and I sincerely want to thank you for that support.
As Rich referenced above, our earnings call year ago was very difficult as we announced a major shift in our strategy to build a digital platform and expand our distribution channels.
We knew at the time we would need to take a step back to be able to take a giant leap forward. I'm pleased to be able to say to those long-term shareholders that was this announced acquisition -- with these announced acquisitions, I truly believe ICTV is poised to take that giant leap forward.
When we became aware of the opportunity to acquire the no!no! brand from PhotoMedex, it was clear from the beginning that it will be a perfect brand to fit into ICTV's platform. But what also became apparent quickly was that there are several aspects of this field that will be very beneficial to ICTV's current products, particularly DermaWand.
One specific example of this was the operation that PhotoMedex has set up in the United -- has set up in the United Kingdom. Rich and Ernie just got back from a trip to visit their office in the U.K. and they were very impressed with the people and the operation.
Currently, PhotoMedex U.K. generates about £9 million per year across several sales channels that include direct response television and print, traditional bricks-and-mortar retail, and live television home shopping QVC U.K., QVC France, QVC Italy, and QVC Germany begins in early 2017.
Our no!no! hair has sold in major retail outlets in the U.K., including booths [ph] in August. We're highly confident that the team in the U.K. will be able to leverage these relationships to help get DermaWand major retail placement more quickly than ICTV would have been able to do so on its own.
The second part of the trip for Rich and Ernie took them to Israel, as it’s the logistics and research and development teams that were in that area. The guys also very impressed with the talent and knowledge base that existed in Israel, which was not a surprise to any of us. I think it was long admired how their R&D team consistently brings that innovative new versions of the no!no! brand into the market.

For those of you who have followed ICTV for a while are aware, we have struggled to quickly develop in next generation DermaWand unit. Despite our hopes that we expressed on the last call in August that we were only weeks away from building the tooling for DermaWand, we have yet -- we have not yet been able to build that to [Indiscernible] to the challenge of fitting all the components necessary onto the circuit board to meet global rate regulations, while reducing the size of the overall unit.
The good news is that we believe we've solved the issue and are just waiting for one more capacitor which should arrive within 10 days. Assuming it all fits, the tooling of the new unit, I could begin to be manufactured by the end of the month.
With the team in Israel, we're confident that we'll be able to continue to create new products for both no!no! and DermaWand brands that will help ICTV keep both brands relevant in the global marketplace for many years to come.
In addition today to the ways DermaWand and our other brands will benefit from this acquisition, we believe the work our team has done to expand our digital marketing footprint over the last several quarters will boost the sales of the brands we are acquiring.
For instance, to-date PhotoMedex has not had much success in scaling sales through social media with digital programmatic marketing. Our team was highly confident there was a huge untapped audience in the cyberspace that is yet to be exposed to the no!no! brand and that we have built the right platform to be able to reach them.
In regards to email marketing, one of the assets we are acquiring from PhotoMedex that is not gotten much attention as it probably should have is the over 2.7 million customer emails that ICTV will be acquiring between North America and the United Kingdom. While we know what needs to be done to scrub this list and that the actual deliverable list will likely be reduced to the size, we're excited to be able to have so many customers in our DermaWand demographic that we will be able to email special offers to both in the U.S. and U.K. market.
Another area of opportunity with the acquired brands will be to drop them into our North American retail channels. As of right now, the only in-store payment for no!no! -- placement for no!no! is in the U.S. Bed Bath and Beyond chain. Our sales team has already been in discussions with several of our retail partners and they are all very excited about the opportunity to carry the brands we are acquiring.
By having more brands and the pipeline of product that the team will provide, we're confident they will be able to grow our retail sales channel in North America substantially in 2017 and beyond.
I'd now like to now take the last few minutes of my time to discuss our plans regarding the second acquisition we announced on October 5th, which is the acquisition of the assets of Ermis Labs.
Let me first start by giving you a little background of how we -- how this all came about. As many of you know we had a license for one of the products Ermis Labs has develop called CoralActives, which is a patented acne treatment system. In the early part of this year, we were notified that Ermis Labs is the name to be had gone out of business and the assets were acquired by multifamily office out of New Jersey called the Leo Group. Over the spring in summer, ICTV had been in discussions with the Leo Group about how ICTV could potentially be the marketing platform for the Ermis Labs' asset.
In late summer when the PhotoMedex acquisition discussion got serious, we approached the principle of the Leo Group to acquire about the group's interest in participating in the PhotoMedex deal. We all agreed this is a great opportunity to also bring the Ermis Labs assets into ICTV and bring Leo Group and the principles in as a shareholder of ICTV.

We're very excited about the assets we're acquiring from Ermis Labs. Rich has his team have been selling the benzyl peroxide medical medicated soap bars through Amazon over the last year with basically no marketing support and only selling through the Amazon. We sold about 1,500 bars of the last two quarters.
In September ICTV was also approached by dermatology group out of Maryland who wanted to purchase 1,000 bathroom [ph], so we know there's much more marketing potential in the professional market.
We believe with our digital platform, we'll be able to specifically target people suffering from the disorders that these medicated soap bars can help solve. We also know that the retail partners we have are excited to carry the bars not only online but in the stores as well.
Once the deal was announced since we had inventory for CoralActives, our sales team began approaching retailers and several of them are in the process of placing CoralActives on their e-commerce sites including CVS and Walmart.
So, much more could be said about our plans for integration and as we get close to the closing, we will all be sure -- we will be sure to provide frequent updates to you.
So, now I'd like to close by saying that I'm so thankful for the many people that have made it possible for ICTV to be in a position to take this giant step forward to grow our company. A special thanks goes out to those of who have already committed to funds that made the signing of these deals possible.
I also wanted to -- I want to acknowledge our dedicated staffs who have been working long hours preparing for integration, while still expanding the sales channels for DermaWand and other brands.
And to my fellow longtime shareholder, a special thanks for sticking with us through all the ups and downs over the years. The opportunity that is before our company is exciting and this is exactly what we persevered over these years. I'm very confident that these acquisitions will be transformative to our company and to our shareholders.
Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Rich for some closing comments.
Rich Ransom
Thank you, Kelvin, and thank you all again for joining us today. I wanted to add a few closing thoughts as it relates to ICTV posts the closing of these asset acquisitions.
Assuming we close the full $7 million private placement, we anticipate the outstanding shares post-transaction will be just over 51 million shares. We're confident that despite the dilution, the transaction will be accretive to the shareholders of ICTV.
In regards to the closing of the transactions, we are not entirely sure of an exact date as PhotoMedex is still waiting on final approval of their shareholder proxy by the SEC. Once we have more definitive -- a more definitive timetable for closing, we will communicate that to our shareholders.
Finally, as kelvin did, I want to thank all those stakeholders of ICTV that have made it possible for us to be in the position we are today. Our team is committed to making the integration of the assets as quickly and efficiently as possible. I'm extremely optimistic about the future of ICTV and our ability to significantly increase shareholder value both in the coming year and for many years to come.
Thank you again for your participation in the call today. Operator, we'd like to open the call now for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]
And we do have a question from Jason [Indiscernible]. Your line is open.
Rich Ransom
Thank you, Jason.
Unidentified Analyst
First congratulations on the recent deal. It was a pleasure meeting you all at the MicroCap Conference on October 24th. I think new those an exciting opportunity for this company is something I and probably many other investments have been anxiously awaiting. Can you speak to the reasons why PhotoMedex is agreeing to such a tremendous deal?

Ernest Kollias, Jr.
Certainly. And it was great meeting you and everyone else who attended the MicroCap Conference on the 24th and 25th and the one-on-one sessions that followed that Rich and I were able to participate in.
If you followed any of the releases regarding PhotoMedex in recent years, they entered into a few costly acquisitions with extensive financing, most recently one that resulted in a massive selloff, which provided an opportunity for an interested and qualified buyers, such as ICTV, and as you can tell on October 5th, we released the public information with the announcement of the acquisition. So, we were positioned nicely to be able to take advantage of that deal.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, great. Thanks. Any further details you are going to provide regarding your due diligence trip to the U.K. and Israel?
Rich Ransom
I'll step into that. Jason thanks again for the questions and it was great meeting you in Philadelphia in late October. The trip was really -- was really great. We had gotten a lot of due diligence material prior to the signing of the deals. So, we knew all of the financial aspects related to both entities that we visited, but it was really a trip about meeting the people and the U.K. operation, in particular, from a sales standpoint, is very impressive.
It's what we as a company have strived to do in the U.S. and are in the process of doing, but it was great to see it in its full potential as we were able to walk through retail stores, see the no!no! placed on the shelf, see the different materials that they use to present QVC around Europe and it just gave us a real picture and the what the potential is as we bring DermaWand into the United Kingdom directly and it was really exciting. It's a lien team like us, it fits in perfectly to what we're trying to do.
And in Israel that was a very exciting trip in the sense of understanding how the process is done to go through and as Kelvin had mentioned in his comments, we historically have not been a development company.
We've tried to do it with the new DermaWand unit and while we're confident that we are on the precipice of a starting production of that unit, it's been a very hard and painful process.
Seeing the team that's over there and seeing what they've done, I think no!no! hair is in its sixth or seventh version at this point and there's two or three in the pipeline already that haven't hit market. It's just so exciting to think about the future for DermaWand in that respect and know that that the assets we're acquiring are not single products, but they are actually product lines that will be developed over time.
So, obviously, there's a lot of decisions to be made and we're going to make them over the next several weeks before closing, but we're confident that beyond the assets that we've kind of detailed that we're acquiring there's some very, very talented people across the globe that are going to be coming on to the ICTV team.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike [Indiscernible]. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, I had the same question really is what's the catch on the acquisition you're spending was $9.5 million total price, they are giving you $50 million in revenue and $6 million in inventory, I mean pretty much guarantee for free, you just finally got [ph] in the business so bad?
Kelvin Claney
No, Mike, first of all, one of the things that a lot of people ask, is this is a falling knife, is this business over? But we did a lot of due diligence and that's simply not the case. There's huge potential in the business. But if you -- and growth in the business.
I mean without being smart, women's hair just doesn't go away, it's there. So, it’s a massive market. And if you look at the history of the company, they made these really terrible business decisions. I made a lot of money quickly and I made a terrible business of decisions about getting into areas of market that they had no place to be in, Lasik -- chains of Lasik eye chains and then they went into the in-store doctor psoriasis business.

It just wasn't what they should be doing in and then what they were -- what they didn’t bank on, which we have seen sore was a changing landscape of this direct-to-consumer marketing. So, they carried on blindly with their television business and we didn't. We realized what was coming. We made a major change. They didn’t make that change.
So, all of a sudden, TV is not as profitable as south go down, now all of a sudden, it has implications on the loans, their loan get on convents, their loans get called, now they spiral -- they are in debt spiral, they are selling off assets, they buys assets for $120 million. A year later, they are selling them for $30 million.
And it just becomes a domino effect, they didn't take hard decisions as we did a year ago. We cut 20% of our staff. They cut basically no staff and so I don't know what they were thinking. I mean I don't they were thinking. They didn't try to sell their business outright. They lined up a deal that's going to be sold to another public company for $48 million and that deal got sidelined by the SEC, I mean that was a fiasco.
Then they had somebody else come in and make them -- and that's where it really got interesting. Somebody else who they were with in a patent situation with Cayman and we had the opportunity to -- that deal fell apart, we had the opportunity to make an offer and get it. It was as simple as that.
Unidentified Analyst
Are they profitable or its tired itself, because they got so m any different business lines.
Kelvin Claney
Yes Mike, I would refer you to their financial releases. I think they haven't put third quarter out yet, but if you look at their note on the segment reporting in their notes of the financials, you'll see that the consumer asset piece is profitable. And we really dug hard into that because that was -- in part of our due diligence, we really needed to understand hey are we acquiring something that's going to suck cash or not and the business itself is profitable.
Their overhead could not -- it didn’t make enough profit to sustain their overhead and some of the other public company cost and things that they were involved in due to some of their struggles over the last couple years.
The real simple short answer to your question is they were at the end of the line. It was basically either sell these assets or go bankrupt and we were in a position to step in and do what needed to be done to keep them out of bankruptcy. Their public shell will survive this is and I think that's their interest in that.
But I don't really want to speak for them in terms of why they did it, but I think that's the simplest answer of how we're able to get it achieved.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. We wish you the best luck then.
Kelvin Claney
Thanks Mike. We really appreciate it.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. That's all from me.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]
We'll move next to Jason -- I'm sorry Gerry [Indiscernible]. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hey, two general questions. One maybe it's my computer, but I received a notice for the conference call at 4:08, 22 minutes before the call. Is that cause you guys send them out that late or I have a problem?
The second question is, is there -- you guys foresee any impact because the Republicans won in the States versus the Democrats, has that anything to do with the product and supply in demand?
Rich Ransom
I don't know we've got to call in to see if more hair is going to grow.
Ernest Kollias, Jr.
To answer your first question Gerry, we sent out a press release a week ago today announcing call and then the email you got this afternoon was a follow-up with our press release for the third quarter results that had the call details in it as well. So, it was kind of the second reminder.
Unidentified Analyst

Okay. Then my end I got to check my computer. Thank you for the answer.
Kelvin Claney
Gerry, its Kelvin here. Good to hear from you. You're one of our longest time shareholder. Could you do me special favor. Could you send me that really wonderful photographs that you have of the boat on the rocks. I want to -- could you send it, because I lost that and I want to put that on my wall.
Unidentified Analyst
I'm not sure what picture, boat, maybe it's a senior moment here, I don't know what picture of boat, give me little more detail, what boat and what rock?
Kelvin Claney
I'll come back to after the call.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay.
Kelvin Claney
Okay. In terms of your second question Gerry, I'm not sure if I have any insight into whether the election results will affect us. If we go to our 15% tax rate and we start making the profit, we think we can make, it could be very positive.
Unidentified Analyst
Well, no that's a good answer, because it's not like you guys are sitting there behind the scenes of your P&L, your business model has some bearing on the results of election. So, your answer is well, we really don't know, so that means business is usual. Good answer.
Kelvin Claney
Yes.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you.
Kelvin Claney
You got it.
Rich Ransom
Thanks Gerry.
Operator
And we have a follow-up from Jason [Indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst
Hi again guys. Just a question regarding -- I saw that the no!no! has been significant sales with the airlines, specifically I believe it was Hong Kong, you guys planning on taking advantage of that with your other product lines?
Rich Ransom
No, that's a great question, Jason. And I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks there's really so many things we could talk about and just wanted to keep it concise, but the airline business out of Hong Kong is really the reason why that entity is being acquired.
I believe it's about 10 airlines that PhotoMedex has relationships with for the no!no!, and it's not only no!no! hair, but no!no! skin which is their acne device. It was a lot easier to acquire that entity and the -- and those relationships rather than try to transfer them.
And to your question specifically, yes, we have already while in Israel, who kind of oversees that operation, we already began talking about how we could design a package for DermaWand because it's a cart business. On the plane, you have to have a very small box to fit on the cart, so they are already starting to think through how they can prepare that packaging. So, we can present that to the airlines very, very quickly. So, great question.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]
And it appears that we have no -- actually we do have a question from Ken [Indiscernible]. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hey, guys. I'm sorry, I tuned in late, so I have a couple of questions that I don't know if been asked or answered. You presenting at LD Micro in December?
Rich Ransom
That is correct Ken.
Unidentified Analyst
Do you know what time and day?
Rich Ransom
I'll be presenting Wednesday, December 7th at 7:30 AM.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. I look forward to that. And second do you know when you're going to close on the acquisition with PHMD?
Rich Ransom
We did reference that at the end of the prepared remarks. We don't know at this point the exact date. The PhotoMedex is waiting on some comments on their proxy from the SEC, nothing we think is going to be a problem, just basically they have to wait on those comments before they can file a final proxy and proceed with their shareholder vote.
So, it's really dependent upon how long that process takes, but we're still very hopeful that the transaction we'll be able to close hopefully by the end of the year.
Unidentified Analyst
Is there any -- do they have the votes in already or that has to wait for the SEC?

Rich Ransom
They can't begin -- the proxy will be sent out to receive he votes. No, they do not have the votes in yet.
Ernest Kollias, Jr.
They can't send out until they go -- till they answer the deficiencies from the SEC.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Last question, any plans for expanding IR?
Ernest Kollias, Jr.
I mean I think we are expanding IR by attending the conferences we have and we'll continue -- we've been pretty active with putting news out, so we'll continue to do that as well.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. I know you presented at the MicroCap Conference and you deal with a lot of very, very good information there, can you get that on your website?
Ernest Kollias, Jr.
Yes, the exact presentation that was given at the conference is now posted under the Investor Relations section on ictvbrands.com.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. One suggestion and really respectfully made, if you can get the word out to your shareholders and to the markets that it is there, I mean it really was a very good presentation, just filled with information. So, putting it there, on your website, helps but it also helps to advertise the fact that it's there and it's another way of reaching out to the market.
Ernest Kollias, Jr.
Good suggestion. Thank you, Ken.
Unidentified Analyst
All right. Thank you guys. Best of wishes, okay.
Rich Ransom
Thank you, Ken.
Ernest Kollias, Jr.
Thank you, Ken. Appreciate it.
Operator
And that concludes our interview at this time -- or questions I should say.
Rich Ransom
Okay. Well, thank you very much everyone who has participated. The last comment I want to make today is that today is our friend Kelvin's 67th birthday. So, we all wish him a happy birthday and feel free to send him private notes if you could. So, thank you everyone. We'll be back in most likely March with our annual year end conference call. So, thank you again.
Kelvin Claney
Thank you very much.
