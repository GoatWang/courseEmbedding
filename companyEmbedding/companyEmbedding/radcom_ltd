Customer Experience Management
Customer satisfaction is a key factor in retaining customers and preventing churn. RADCOM’s MaveriQ Customer Experience Management (CEM) solution empowers service providers to proactively monitor and improve the customer experience, while using their mobile and fixed networks, and is essential for the smooth transition of their customers when rolling out new services and network technologies.
MaveriQ CEM uses data captured from multiple data sources (network probes, CRM ticketing, billing) for all subscribers 24/7 to create a Quality of Experience (QoE) index that represents the subscriber’s perception of Quality of Experience. This QoE index is calculated for a single subscriber as well as aggregated handsets, applications, geographical locations, network elements, such as MMEs and for application groups, such as APNs. The QoE index forms the basis of RADCOM’s CEM solution and provides service providers with a clear and unified view of their customers’ experience across multiple services such as streaming video, voice quality and web browsing running over a wide range of technologies.
MaveriQ CEM is software-based, allowing service providers to manage the constantly increasing data explosion, without the need to deploy expensive hardware.

RADCOM Announces New Chief Technology Officer and Head of Product
February 6, 2017

Expanding Management Team with Senior Technology Veteran, Rami Amit, previously Director of Engineering at Cisco NFV BU
TEL AVIV, Israel – February 6, 2017 – RADCOM Ltd. (NASDAQ: RDCM), today announced that it has appointed Rami Amit, a telecom industry veteran, to its newly created Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Head of Product position to advance its first mover advantage in the growing market of NFV-ready service assurance. Rami will play a key role in shaping RADCOM’s technology strategy and vision, as the company looks to provide Communication Service Providers (CSPs) with a cost effective, highly scalable, software only solution to assure their customer experience.  
“I’m thrilled to welcome Rami to RADCOM. He brings a unique blend of telecom market knowledge and technological leadership spanning the entire breadth of the telecom industry from telephony, all the way up to network virtualization,” said Yaron Ravkaie, RADCOM’s Chief Executive Officer. ”With proven proficiency in leading product and technological development for large scale top-tier CSP deployments, I’m confident that Rami’s technology leadership will enhance our solution – MaveriQ - as we look to continue and increase our competitive advantage, and bring more value to our customers.”
Prior to RADCOM, Rami was Director of Engineering at Cisco NFV BU, where he was responsible for Cisco's broadband solutions, deployed by many top-tier CSPs. During his tenure at Cisco, Rami led several new products from inception up to worldwide deployment. He was also instrumental in the company’s transition to virtualization and application delivery in the Broadband market. Before Cisco, Rami held several CTO positions; he was the CTO for Jungo, a leading software provider for broadband service providers and founded Surf&Call solutions, which was later acquired by CosmoCom. Furthermore, Rami was the first employee of the VoIP industry pioneer, VocalTec, in which he is considered as one of the early inventors of VoIP leading many of the VoIP technologies and products and innovating with the industry’s first VoIP gateway in addition to many other technological achievements.
“I’m excited and energized to join RADCOM”, said Rami, “the entire telecom industry is in a period of rapid transition to software-based solutions, and I believe RADCOM has a unique and innovative solution that disrupts the traditional service assurance market and delivers real benefits to CSPs as they begin their transition to NFV. I look forward to working with the team to advance our solution, as we enhance our competitive advantage.”
Rami holds an Electrical Engineering Degree from Tel Aviv University.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

Radcom Continues To Add Key Talent In Engineering And Sales Organizations - Radcom Ltd. (NASDAQ:RDCM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Radcom Continues To Add Key Talent In Engineering And Sales OrganizationsFeb. 8.17 | About: Radcom Ltd. (RDCM) Mike Arnold Long only, small-cap, tech, growth at reasonable priceindievestmentsSummaryRadcom announced it hired a new CTO and Head of Product, previously the Director of NFV at Cisco.A review of LinkedIn indicates Radcom has also hired key account directors with key relationships at Verizon. One senior hire came from NetScout, the dominant incumbent competitor for service assurance.Key human capital/talent is leaving incumbent telecom equipment manufacturers precisely at a time when their revenues are generally sagging. The paradigm shift to NFV appears well underway.Mark Twain once wrote: Find out where people are going, and get there first. That advice certainly applies to the field of common stock investing: Successful investors need to develop a unique insight about a subject company, and place a bet ahead of the financial crowd. One way to do that is to follow key human capital/talent in the industry to see where they choose to work. This is beginning to become a key part of my investment thesis in shares of Radcom (NASDAQ:RDCM), a small, pure-play Network Functions Virtualization ("NFV") software vendor that plays in the service assurance space. Essentially, Radcom's product, MaveriQ, is the "eyes" of the network and allows communication service providers ("CSPs") to understand where problems are occurring on the network. On Monday, February 5, Radcom announced it created a new Chief Technology Officer position, and it was filled by Rami Amit who was formerly the Director of NFV at Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). As I pointed out before, Cisco's recent earnings results indicate traditional telecom equipment manufacturers ("TEMs") are struggling with CSPs, and reported double-digit declines in revenue within this customer segment. The point is CSPs want to invest in next-generation architectures - NFV - which allows for network functions to be run in software on top of commodity hardware; the need for purpose-built, proprietary equipment is waning with new technology. At any rate, the new CTO is a pretty heavy-hitting hire for a $200 million market cap and $30 million revenue run-rate disruptor like Radcom. What it tells me is key players like Mr. Amit are willing to take less pay and a better stock option package to be positioned to succeed in the marketplace, and ultimately, to get wealthy. I want to align myself in a situation like this.
 Now for the more enterprising investor like myself, there is even more information regarding key Radcom hires in the sales organization on LinkedIn that haven't been disclosed via a press release. Namely, it appears Radcom added key account directors - Scott Foster and Bernd Heyer - over the last several months. Mr. Foster was formerly of Mavenir Systems, and was the "post-sale customer account owner" for Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Remember too that Radcom's COO Eyal Harari relocated to New York City in late 2016 to prospect for more Tier-1 North American business, and also that Verizon is expected to make a decision on virtual network probes by the end of winter. Mr. Heyer is another interesting hire, in part because he left NetScout (NASDAQ:NTCT) after a 6.5-year stint, Radcom's only real competition in virtual probes, or vProbes, for service assurance. Remember that Radcom scored 100/100 in the AT&T (NYSE:T) lab trial, with the nearest competitor (out of 9) coming in at 70/100. AT&T publicly endorsed Radcom's MaveriQ solution in August 2016, and is actively helping the company market it to other CSPs directly and via its ECOMP platform. One has to believe that Mr. Heyer has pretty good insight in terms of who he believes will be the winner in vProbes, and it is clearly Radcom given he left a much larger company and direct competitor to join the effort. Sales directors, of course, want to market a product they can sell, and consequently, cash the associated commission checks. Studying human incentives at this point is particularly important for the Radcom thesis. On the other hand, the key risk I see as it relates to studying human behavior is a situation where incumbents develop NFV technology that is "good enough" and CSPs decide to go with vendors they already know, rather than the best-in-class technology [i.e., "no one ever got fired for hiring IBM (NYSE:IBM)]. But with continued technology breakthroughs from key players like newly hired CTO Mr. Amit and the strengthening of MaveriQ through a real-world mega deployment at AT&T, this particular risk should be minimized.
 I note that NetScout disclosed a 5-year, $75 million deal on its most recent earnings call for its InfinistreamNG platform to "protect its incumbency," but it isn't clear to me that this is directly comparable to MaveriQ. NetScout's CEO Anil Singhal indicated the deal was highly competitive which doesn't exactly square with the narrative that Radcom's trials are basically devoid of any competition which leads me to believe the NetScout win wasn't part of Radcom's 9 current trials. Amdocs & ECOMP As mentioned before, Amdocs (NYSE:DOX) is a key technology partner for Radcom and was the first system integrator endorsed by AT&T for its openECOMP platform. Amdocs also contributed a good part of the underlying software code for ECOMP, and is not conflicted like other TEMs and integrators like Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) because Amdocs doesn't have a legacy hardware business to protect. To that end, Radcom's MaveriQ solution slots into openECOMP and any deal that Amdocs wins (like AT&T), I'm assuming Radcom will go along for the ride. According to Amdocs' 4Q earnings call, CEO Eli Gelman indicated that Orange (NYSE:ORAN), the first CSP to publicly state it would trial ECOMP, selected Amdocs as its technology integration partner for its Poland network. While I don't expect an Orange deal to be of the size of AT&T (3 years, $50 million, plus add-ons and maintenance), adding another Tier-1 account to Radcom's client roster will only add to the notion that Radcom is in a key position to be the favorite in a winner-take-most scenario for NFV service assurance, particularly for vProbes. Conclusion I'm not advocating RDCM as a buy or sell ahead of earnings next week. I have no idea how investors will react to the headline numbers or progress on new Tier-1 deals. Rather, I do think the flow of impressive talent to Radcom and the shift in the NFV marketplace which finds Tier-1 customers embracing disruptors like Radcom (and shunning traditional TEMs) suggests to me that there is a path to a much bigger valuation for RDCM shares over time.
 While there is certainly risk in RDCM shares, I think the upside more than compensates for any downside risk at the current valuation given the current business which features a very healthy and growing relationship with AT&T and other emerging market CSPs. Only time will tell if this view is correct. But I'm betting that the migration of talent from incumbents to players like Radcom suggests that large, transformational deals with Tier-1 CSPs are also forming in the pipeline. Until then, the next data point on Radcom's evolution comes on the 4Q earnings call on February 14 before the market open and potential product announcements around Mobile World Congress 2017 at the end of February.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
