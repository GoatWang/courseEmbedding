Genesys Enterprise Edition









Fully Featured, Highly Customizable Enterprise Contact Center Edition Available in the Cloud or Your Data Center
As call centers modernize to support omnichannel customer journeys, it is essential for contact center executives to choose scalable management platforms to continue meeting operational demands required for consistent customer experiences. In a large, enterprise contact center, there tends to be an additional layer of complexity to support, especially when managing a spectrum of agent schedules and skill sets, as well as teams in multiple locations.
The Genesys Enterprise Edition has best-in-class capabilities delivered with simplicity to maximize first contact resolution, meet customer SLAs, improve website sales conversions, optimize cross-sell revenue from existing customers and improve customer loyalty. It also improves employee satisfaction and results, and reduces the cost of operations through efficiency gains. All of this is delivered over your customers’ channels of choice, with low customer effort.
The Enterprise Edition is designed for large organizations that require highly scalable and customized call center solutions. With this edition, customers can choose to run their contact center in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid cloud configuration.

With the Genesys Customer Experience Platform you will power optimal customer experiences that deliver consistent, seamless and personalized journey-appropriate experiences across all touchpoints, channels and interactions. By journey-appropriate we mean that the experience delivered, whether via self-service or human-assisted, matches the expectations of your customers, aligning with the stage and type of their present journey. This approach will drive your NPS and Customer Effort scores in the right direction.

Genesys Enterprise Edition









Fully Featured, Highly Customizable Enterprise Contact Center Edition Available in the Cloud or Your Data Center
As call centers modernize to support omnichannel customer journeys, it is essential for contact center executives to choose scalable management platforms to continue meeting operational demands required for consistent customer experiences. In a large, enterprise contact center, there tends to be an additional layer of complexity to support, especially when managing a spectrum of agent schedules and skill sets, as well as teams in multiple locations.
The Genesys Enterprise Edition has best-in-class capabilities delivered with simplicity to maximize first contact resolution, meet customer SLAs, improve website sales conversions, optimize cross-sell revenue from existing customers and improve customer loyalty. It also improves employee satisfaction and results, and reduces the cost of operations through efficiency gains. All of this is delivered over your customers’ channels of choice, with low customer effort.
The Enterprise Edition is designed for large organizations that require highly scalable and customized call center solutions. With this edition, customers can choose to run their contact center in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid cloud configuration. Hybrid cloud options allow you to use your existing telecommunications providers, store sensitive data locally or augment existing Genesys on-premises deployments. This edition delivers the call center you need, integrated with your processes and back-end information systems to support an omnichannel contact center infrastructure.
With the Genesys Customer Experience Platform you will power optimal customer experiences that deliver consistent, seamless and personalized journey-appropriate experiences across all touchpoints, channels and interactions. By journey-appropriate we mean that the experience delivered, whether via self-service or human-assisted, matches the expectations of your customers, aligning with the stage and type of their present journey. This approach will drive your NPS and Customer Effort scores in the right direction.
Key Capabilities
