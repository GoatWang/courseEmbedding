(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the 2016 consolidated audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. When necessary, reclassifications have been made to prior period data throughout the following discussion and analysis for purposes of comparability. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which may be identified by the use of such words as "believe", "expect", "anticipate", "should", "planned", "estimated" and "potential". Examples of forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, estimates with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Unity Bancorp, Inc. that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. These factors include, in addition to those items contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item IA-Risk Factors, as updated by our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, the following: changes in general, economic, and market conditions, legislative and regulatory conditions, or the development of an interest rate environment that adversely affects Unity Bancorp, Inc.'s interest rate spread or other income anticipated from operations and investments.  Overview  Unity Bancorp, Inc. (the "Parent Company") is incorporated in New Jersey and is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Its wholly-owned subsidiary, Unity Bank (the "Bank" or, when consolidated with the Parent Company, the "Company") was granted a charter by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and commenced operations on September 13, 1991. The Bank provides a full range of commercial and retail banking services through 17 branch offices located in Bergen, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Somerset, Union and Warren counties in New Jersey, and Northampton County in Pennsylvania as well as a loan production office in Bergen County, New Jersey. These services include the acceptance of demand, savings, and time deposits and the extension of consumer, real estate, SBA and other commercial credits. The Bank has multiple subsidiaries used to hold part of its investment and loan portfolios and OREO properties.  The company has two other wholly-owned subsidiaries: Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust II and Unity Risk Management, Inc. On July 24, 2006, the Trust issued $10.0 million of trust preferred securities to investors. These floating rate securities are treated as subordinated debentures on the Company's financial statements. However, they qualify as Tier I Capital for regulatory capital compliance purposes, subject to certain limitations. Unity Risk Management, Inc. is the Company's captive insurance company that insures risks to the bank not provided by the traditional commercial insurance market. The Company does not consolidate the accounts and related activity of Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust II, but it does consolidate the accounts of Unity Risk Management, Inc.  Earnings Summary  Net income totaled $3.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to $4.2 million, or $0.44 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Return on average assets and average common equity for the quarter were 1.07% and 12.02%, respectively, compared to 1.54 % and 21.05% for the same period a year ago.  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company repurchased $5.2 million of its outstanding subordinated debentures, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2.3 million on the transaction. This gain is included in noninterest income on the income statement. Net income, excluding the nonrecurring gain on the repurchased subordinated debentures, was $2.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Return on average assets and average common equity for the three months ended March 31, 2016 would have been 1.00% and 13.68%, respectively.  First quarter highlights include:   Savings and noninterest-bearing demand deposits rose 7.2% and 2.2%, respectively, while total deposits increased 3.7% since year-end 2016.   Net interest income increased 15.6% compared to the prior year's quarter due to strong loan growth and increase in interest rate environment.   Net interest margin equaled 3.70% this quarter compared to 3.48% in the prior years' quarter.  The Company's quarterly performance ratios may be found in the table below.   For the three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Net income per common share - Basic (1) $ 0.30 $ 0.45 Net income per common share - Diluted (2) $ 0.30 $ 0.44 Return on average assets 1.07 % 1.54 % Return on average equity (3) 12.02 % 21.05 % Efficiency ratio (4) 59.08 % 50.16 %  The Company's quarterly performance ratios, net of gain on the subordinated debenture repurchase, may be found in the table below. The following table is reported in a format which is not in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP") but is beneficial to the reader and provides better comparability of the Company's performance over both periods.   For the three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Net income per common share - Basic (1) $ 0.30 $ 0.29 Net income per common share - Diluted (2) $ 0.30 $ 0.29 Return on average assets 1.07 % 1.00 % Return on average equity (3) 12.02 % 13.68 % Efficiency ratio (4) 59.08 % 60.56 %  (1) Defined as net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding.  (2) Defined as net income divided by the sum of the weighted average shares and the potential dilutive impact of the exercise of outstanding options.  (3) Defined as net income divided by average shareholders' equity.  (4) Defined as noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income less any gains or losses on securities.  All share information has been adjusted for the 10% stock dividend paid September 30, 2016.  Net Interest Income  The primary source of the Company's operating income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividends earned on earning assets and fees earned on loans, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Earning assets include loans to individuals and businesses, investment securities, interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing demand, savings and time deposits, FHLB advances and other borrowings. Net interest income is determined by the difference between the yields earned on earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities ("net interest spread") and the relative amounts of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company's net interest spread is affected by regulatory, economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates, loan demand, deposit flows and general levels of nonperforming assets.  During the quarter ended March 31, 2017, tax-equivalent net interest income amounted to $10.4 million, an increase of $1.4 million or 15.5 percent when compared to the same period in 2016. The net interest margin increased 22 basis points to 3.70 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to 3.48 percent for the same period in 2016. The net interest spread was 3.46 percent for the first quarter of 2017, a 19 basis point increase compared to the same period in 2016.  During the quarter ended March 31, 2017, tax-equivalent interest income was $12.6 million, an increase of $1.4 million or 12.6 percent when compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was mainly driven by the increase in the balance of average loans:   Of the $1.4 million net increase in interest income on a tax-equivalent basis, $1.1 million of the increase was due to increased average earning assets, and $303 thousand was due to increased yields on the earning assets.   The average volume of interest-earning assets increased $100.7 million to $1.1 billion for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $1.0 billion for the same period in 2016. This was due primarily to a $98.3 million increase in average  loans, primarily commercial, residential mortgage and consumer loans, along with a $1.9 million increase in average investment securities, partially offset by a $738 thousand decrease in federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits.  Total interest expense was $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $15 thousand or 0.7 percent compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was driven by the increased rate on savings and time deposits and the increased volume of borrowed funds and subordinated debentures, partially offset by the decreased volume of time deposits and decreased rate on the borrowed funds and subordinated debentures compared to a year ago:   Of the $15 thousand increase in interest expense, $200 thousand was due to increased rates on savings and time deposits and $130 thousand was due to an increase in the volume of borrowed funds and subordinated debentures, partially offset by $218 thousand due to a reduced volume of time deposits and $201 thousand due to reduced interest rates paid on our borrowed funds and subordinated debentures.   Interest-bearing liabilities averaged $878.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $50.6 million or 6.1 percent compared to the prior year's quarter. The increase in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in savings deposits, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits.   The average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities decreased 4 basis points to 1.02 percent. While the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 2 basis points to 0.83 percent for the first quarter of 2017, the cost of borrowed funds and subordinated debentures decreased 68 basis points to 2.15 percent due to the modification of borrowings with the FHLB over the past year and due to the use of derivative instruments to hedge interest risk. The increase in the cost of deposits was primarily driven by a promotional savings product.  The following table reflects the components of net interest income, setting forth for the periods presented herein: (1) average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity, (2) interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, (3) average yields earned on interest-earning assets and average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, (4) net interest spread, and (5) net interest income/margin on average earning assets. Rates/Yields are computed on a fully tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35 percent.

They are reduced by the nondeductible portion of interest expense, assuming a federal tax rate of 35 percent, as well as all applicable state rates.  (B) The loan averages are stated net of unearned income, and the averages include loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued.  The rate volume table below presents an analysis of the impact on interest income and expense resulting from changes in average volume and rates over the periods presented. Changes that are not due to volume or rate variances have been allocated proportionally to both, based on their relative absolute values.  ? For the three months ended March 31, 2017 versus March 31, 2016 Increase (decrease) due to change in: (In thousands on a tax-equivalent basis) Volume Rate Net Interest income: Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits $ - $ 85 $ 85 FHLB stock 16 25 41 Securities (1 ) 102 101 Loans 1,091 91 1,182 Total interest income $ 1,106 $ 303 $ 1,409 Interest expense: Demand deposits $ 19 $ (3 ) $ 16 Savings deposits 88 129 217 Time deposits (218 ) 71 (147 ) Total interest-bearing deposits (111 ) 197 86 Borrowed funds and subordinated debentures 130 (201 ) (71 ) Total interest expense 19 (4 ) 15 Net interest income - fully tax-equivalent $ 1,087 $ 307 $ 1,394 Decrease in tax-equivalent adjustment 9 Net interest income $ 1,403  Provision for Loan Losses  The provision for loan losses totaled $250 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $200 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Each period's loan loss provision is the result of management's analysis of the loan portfolio and reflects changes in the size and composition of the portfolio, the level of net charge-offs, delinquencies, current economic conditions and other internal and external factors impacting the risk within the loan portfolio. Additional information may be found under the captions "Financial Condition - Asset Quality" and "Financial Condition - Allowance for Loan Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments." The current provision is considered appropriate under management's assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.  Noninterest Income The following table shows the components of noninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016: For the three months ended March 31, (In thousands) 2017 2016 Branch fee income $ 331 $ 333 Service and loan fee income 407 255 Gain on sale of SBA loans held for sale, net 485 308 Gain on sale of mortgage loans, net 637 715 BOLI income 88 94 Net security gains - 94 Gain on repurchase of subordinated debt - 2,264 Other income 256 217 Total noninterest income $ 2,204 $ 4,280  For the three months ended March 31, 2017, noninterest income decreased $2.1 million to $2.2 million, compared to the same period last year. Quarterly noninterest income decreased primarily due to a nonrecurring gain on the repurchase of subordinated debentures during the same period last year. Excluding the nonrecurring gain, noninterest income increased $188 thousand primarily due to higher service and loan fee income and gains on the sale of SBA loans.  Changes in our noninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 vs. 2016 reflect:   Branch fee income remained relatively flat for the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in the prior year.   Service and loan fee income increased due to higher loan processing fees, prepayment and payoff fees.   SBA loans sales during the first quarter of 2017 totaled $6.0 million with a net gain of $485 thousand, compared to $3.5 million in sales and a net gain of $308 thousand in the prior year's quarter. The increase is due to a higher volume of loan sales this quarter compared with the prior year's quarter.   During the quarter, $25.7 million in residential mortgage loans were sold at a gain of $637 thousand, compared to $25.0 million in loans sold at a gain of $715 thousand during the prior year's quarter. Residential mortgage loans are sold as a tool to manage liquidity needs within the bank.   There were no gains on the sale of securities for the quarter, compared to net security gains of $94 thousand during the quarter ended March 31, 2016.   The Company repurchased $5.0 million of its outstanding debentures on February 26, 2016. The subordinated debentures were repurchased at a price of $0.5475 per dollar, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2.3 million on the transaction.   Other income increased in the quarterly period primarily due to increased service charges on visa check cards and rental income.  Noninterest Expense The following table presents a breakdown of noninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016: For the three months ended March 31, (In thousands) 2017 2016 Compensation and benefits $ 4,095 $ 3,549 Occupancy 600 618 Processing and communications 604 644 Furniture and equipment 511 420 Professional services 226 255 Loan collection and OREO expenses 341 72 Other loan expenses 83 104 Deposit insurance 76 160 Advertising 236 241 Director fees 197 135 Other expenses 471 409 Total noninterest expense $ 7,440 $ 6,607  Noninterest expense increased $833 thousand to $7.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.   Occupancy expense decreased $18 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to a decreased rental expense compared to the same period last year.   Processing and communications expenses decreased $40 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017, due to decreases in telephone expenses.   Furniture and equipment expense increased $91 during the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to investment in our technology infrastructure through network and software upgrades that will improve our efficiency and keep our data secure.   Professional service fees decreased $29 thousand for the three months ended March 30, 2017, primarily due to lower legal expense.   Loan collection and OREO costs increased $269 thousand compared to the prior year's quarter due to a loss of $253 thousand on the sale of an OREO property.   Other loan expenses decreased $21 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the prior year's quarter.   Deposit insurance expense decreased $84 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017, due to a lower quarterly assessment resulting from additional equity from a capital raise.   Advertising expense remained relatively flat for the first quarter when compared to the same period last year.   Director fees increased $62 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017.   Other expenses increased $62 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to higher officer and employee training expenses.  Income Tax Expense  For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company reported income tax expense of $1.7 million for an effective tax rate of 34.9 percent, compared to an income tax expense of $2.3 million and an effective tax rate of 34.9 percent for the prior year's quarter.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the 2013 consolidated audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. When necessary, reclassifications have been made to prior period data throughout the following discussion and analysis for purposes of comparability. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which may be identified by the use of such words as "believe", "expect", "anticipate", "should", "planned", "estimated" and "potential". Examples of forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, estimates with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Unity Bancorp, Inc. that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. These factors include, in addition to those items contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item IA-Risk Factors, as updated by our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, the following: changes in general, economic, and market conditions, legislative and regulatory conditions, or the development of an interest rate environment that adversely affects Unity Bancorp, Inc.'s interest rate spread or other income anticipated from operations and investments.  Overview  Unity Bancorp, Inc. (the "Parent Company") is incorporated in New Jersey and is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Its wholly-owned subsidiary, Unity Bank (the "Bank" or, when consolidated with the Parent Company, the "Company") was granted a charter by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and commenced operations on September 13, 1991. The Bank provides a full range of commercial and retail banking services through 15 branch offices located in Hunterdon, Somerset, Middlesex, Union and Warren counties in New Jersey, and Northampton County in Pennsylvania. These services include the acceptance of demand, savings, and time deposits and the extension of consumer, real estate, Small Business Administration and other commercial credits. The Bank has multiple subsidiaries used to hold part of its investment and loan portfolios and other real estate owned ("OREO") properties.  Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust II is a statutory business trust and wholly owned subsidiary of Unity Bancorp, Inc. On July 24, 2006, the Trust issued $10.0 million of trust preferred securities to investors. Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust III is a statutory business trust and wholly owned subsidiary of Unity Bancorp, Inc. On December 19, 2006, the Trust issued $5.0 million of trust preferred securities to investors. These floating rate securities are treated as subordinated debentures on the Company's financial statements. However, they qualify as Tier I Capital for regulatory capital compliance purposes, subject to certain limitations. The Company does not consolidate the accounts and related activity of any of its business trust subsidiaries.  Earnings Summary  Net income available to common shareholders totaled $1.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, a 73.2 percent increase compared to $882 thousand, or $0.11 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Return on average assets and average common equity for the quarter were 0.68% and 10.31%, respectively, compared to 0.67% and 6.11% for the same period a year ago. The continued improvement in our operating results is the product of our strategic initiatives, which include expansion of our in-market loan and deposit relationships, improving credit quality and core earnings growth.  Second quarter highlights include:  × Loan growth of 4.4% since December 31, 2013 across all product lines except SBA 7(a) loans - 9.1% growth in SBA 504 loans, 7.8% in residential mortgage loans, 6.1% in consumer loans and 3.5% growth in commercial loans.  × Noninterest-bearing demand deposit growth of 6.5% since December 31, 2013.  × Core earnings growth - Net interest income increased 7.4% compared to the prior year's quarter due to strong commercial and residential loan portfolio growth.  × Controlled expenses at $6.1 million for each quarter.  × Announced common stock rights offering to provide capital for continued growth.  Net income available to common shareholders totaled $2.8 million, or $0.37 per diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2014, a 68.2 percent increase compared to $1.7 million, or $0.21 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Return on average assets and average common equity for the six month period were 0.64% and 9.70%, respectively, compared to 0.63% and 5.88% for the same period a year ago.  The Company's quarterly and year to date performance ratios may be found in the table below.   For the three months ended For the six months ended June 30, June 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Net income per common share - Basic (1) $ 0.20 $ 0.12 $ 0.37 $ 0.22 Net income per common share - Diluted (1) $ 0.20 $ 0.11 $ 0.37 $ 0.21 Return on average assets 0.68 % 0.67 % 0.64 % 0.63 % Return on average equity (2) 10.31 % 6.11 % 9.70 % 5.88 % Efficiency ratio 70.81 % 72.72 % 71.36 % 73.31 %  (1) Defined as net income adjusted for dividends accrued and accretion of discount on perpetual preferred stock divided by weighted average shares outstanding.  (2) Defined as net income adjusted for dividends accrued and accretion of discount on perpetual preferred stock divided by average shareholders' equity (excluding preferred stock).  Net Interest Income  The primary source of the Company's operating income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividends earned on earning assets and fees earned on loans, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Earning assets include loans to individuals and businesses, investment securities, interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing demand, savings and time deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other borrowings. Net interest income is determined by the difference between the yields earned on earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities ("net interest spread") and the relative amounts of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company's net interest spread is affected by regulatory, economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates, loan demand, deposit flows and general levels of nonperforming assets.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2014, tax-equivalent net interest income amounted to $7.3 million, an increase of $485 thousand or 7.1 percent when compared to the same period in 2013. The net interest margin decreased 17 basis points to 3.49 percent for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, compared to 3.66 percent for the same period in 2013. The net interest spread was 3.31 percent for the second quarter of 2014, a 14 basis point decrease compared to the same period in 2013.  During the three months ended June 30, 2014, tax-equivalent interest income was $9.1 million, an increase of $683 thousand or 8.1 percent when compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was driven by the increase in average loans, partially offset by a lower average yield on the loan portfolio:  × Of the $683 thousand net increase in interest income on a tax-equivalent basis, $921 thousand of the increase was due to increased average earning assets, primarily loans, partially offset by $238 thousand in reduced interest income due to reduced yields on our earning assets.  × The average volume of interest-earning assets increased $91.6 million to $843.7 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared to $752.1 million for the same period in 2013. This was due primarily to an $84.8 million increase in average loans, primarily commercial and residential mortgage loans, and a $22.5 million increase in federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $15.9 million decrease in average investment securities.  × The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 17 basis points to 4.34 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2014 when compared to the same period in 2013. The yield on our loan portfolio declined 16 basis points to 4.87 percent.  Total interest expense was $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of $198 thousand or 12.4 percent compared to the same period in 2013. This increase was driven by the increase in average time deposits, partially offset by lower rates on these deposits compared to a year ago:  × Of the $198 thousand increase in interest expense, $311 thousand of the increase was due to an increase in the volume of average interest-bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, partially offset by a $113 thousand decrease due to the decrease in the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.  × Interest-bearing liabilities averaged $694.0 million for the second quarter of 2014, an increase of $91.5 million or 15.2 percent, compared to the prior year's quarter. The increase in interest-bearing liabilities was a result of an increase in average time deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a decrease in average savings deposits.  × The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 3 basis points to 1.03 percent. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 4 basis points to 0.66 percent for the second quarter of 2014 and the cost of borrowed funds and subordinated debentures increased 2 basis points to 3.51 percent.  During the six months ended June 30, 2014, tax-equivalent net interest income amounted to $14.7 million, an increase of $1.1 million or 7.9 percent when compared to the same period in 2013. The net interest margin decreased 6 basis points to 3.53 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2014, compared to 3.59 percent for the same period in 2013. The net interest spread was 3.35 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2014, a 2 basis point decrease compared to the same period in 2013.  During the six months ended June 30, 2014, tax-equivalent interest income was $18.2 million, an increase of $1.4 million or 8.2 percent when compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was driven by the increase in average loans, partially offset by a lower average yield on the loan portfolio:  × Of the $1.4 million net increase in interest income on a tax-equivalent basis, $1.9 million of the increase was due to increased average earning assets, primarily loans, partially offset by $479 thousand in reduced interest income due to reduced yields on these assets.  × The average volume of interest-earning assets increased $73.5 million to $838.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $765.2 million for the same period in 2013. This was due primarily to an $84.7 million increase in average loans, primarily commercial and residential mortgage loans, and a $1.1 million increase in federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $12.4 million decrease in average investment securities.  × The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 5 basis points to 4.37 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2014 when compared to the same period in 2013. The yield on our loan portfolio declined 20 basis points to 4.86 percent.  Total interest expense was $3.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of $310 thousand or 9.6 percent compared to the same period in 2013. This increase was driven by the increase in average time deposits, partially offset by lower rates on these deposits compared to a year ago:  × Of the $310 thousand increase in interest expense, $606 thousand of the increase was due to an increase in the volume of average interest-bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, partially offset by a $296 thousand decrease due to the decrease in the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.  × Interest-bearing liabilities averaged $693.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of $79.1 million or 12.9 percent, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in interest-bearing liabilities was a result of an increase in average time deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a decrease in average savings deposits.  × The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 3 basis points to 1.02 percent. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 2 basis points to 0.64 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and the cost of borrowed funds and subordinated debentures decreased 1 basis point to 3.50 percent.  Our net interest income continues to be impacted by the sustained low interest rate environment. The Federal Open Market Committee ("FOMC") of the Federal Reserve Board forecasts the overnight federal funds rate will continue to remain at 25 basis points through late 2015. This rate environment has resulted in a tighter net interest margin as our earning assets continue to re-price at lower rates. Partially offsetting these declines are lower funding costs; however, the reduction in yield on earning assets is anticipated to exceed the benefits of further declines in the cost of funds from already low levels.  The following table reflects the components of net interest income, setting forth for the periods presented herein: (1) average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity, (2) interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, (3) average yields earned on interest-earning assets and average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, (4) net interest spread, and (5) net interest income/margin on average earning assets. Rates/Yields are computed on a fully tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 34 percent.

	Item 1.  Business:




	 








	a)


	General




	 




	Unity Bancorp, Inc., (the "Company" or "Registrant"), is a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey to serve as a holding company for Unity Bank  (the “Bank”).  The Company was organized at the direction of the Board of Directors of the Bank for the purpose of acquiring all of the capital stock of the Bank.  Pursuant to the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948 (the "Banking Act"), and pursuant to approval of the shareholders of the Bank, the Company acquired the Bank and became its holding company on December 1, 1994.  The primary activity of the Company is ownership and supervision of the Bank.  The Company also owns 100% of the common equity of Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust II.  The trust has issued $10.3 million of preferred securities to investors. The Company serves as a holding company for its wholly-owned subsidiary, Unity Risk Management, Inc. Unity Risk Management, Inc. is the Bank's captive insurance company that insures risks to the bank not provided by the traditional commercial insurance market.




	 




	The Bank opened for business on September 16, 1991.  The Bank received its charter from the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance on September 13, 1991.  The Bank is a full-service commercial bank, providing a wide range of business and consumer financial services through its main office in Clinton, New Jersey and fifteen additional New Jersey branches located in Edison, Emerson, Flemington, Highland Park, Linden, Middlesex, North Plainfield, Phillipsburg, Scotch Plains, Somerset, Somerville, South Plainfield, Union, Washington and Whitehouse.  In addition, the Bank has one Pennsylvania branch located in Forks Township.  The Bank also operates a loan production office in Bergen County, New Jersey. The Bank's primary service area encompasses the Route 22/Route 78 corridors between the Forks Township, Pennsylvania office and its Linden, New Jersey branch.




	 




	The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 64 Old Highway 22, Clinton, New Jersey 08809, and the telephone number is (800) 618-2265.  The Company’s website address is www.unitybank.com.




	 




	Business of the Company




	 




	The Company's primary business is ownership and supervision of the Bank.  The Company, through the Bank, conducts a traditional and community-oriented commercial banking business and offers services, including personal and business checking accounts, time deposits, money market accounts and regular savings accounts.  The Company structures its specific services and charges in a manner designed to attract the business of the small and medium sized business and professional community, as well as that of individuals residing, working and shopping in its service area.  The Company engages in a wide range of lending activities and offers commercial, Small Business Administration (“SBA”), consumer, mortgage, home equity and personal loans.




	 




	Service Areas




	 




	The Company's primary service area is defined as the neighborhoods served by the Bank's offices.  The Bank's main office, located in Clinton, NJ, in combination with its Flemington and Whitehouse offices, serves the greater area of Hunterdon County.  The Bank's North Plainfield, Somerset and Somerville offices serve those communities located in the northern, eastern and central parts of Somerset County and the southernmost communities of Union County.  The Bank's Scotch Plains, Linden, and Union offices serve the majority of the communities in Union County and the southwestern communities of Essex County.  The offices in Middlesex, South Plainfield, Highland Park, and Edison extend the Company's service area into Middlesex County.  The Bank’s Phillipsburg and Washington offices serve Warren County.  The Bank's Emerson office serves Bergen County. The Bank’s Forks Township office serves Northampton County, Pennsylvania.




	 




	Competition




	 




	The Company is located in an extremely competitive area.  The Company's service area is also serviced by national banks, major regional banks, large thrift institutions and a variety of credit unions.  In addition, since passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the “Modernization Act”), securities firms and insurance companies have been allowed to acquire or form financial institutions, thereby increasing competition in the financial services market.  Most of the Company's competitors have substantially more capital, and therefore greater lending limits than the Company.  The Company's competitors generally have established positions in the service area and have greater resources than the Company with which to pay for advertising, physical facilities, personnel and interest on deposited funds.  The Company relies on the competitive pricing of its loans, deposits and other services, as well as its ability to provide local decision-making and personal service in order to compete with these larger institutions.



















	Employees




	 




	At


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company employed 175 full-time and 19 part-time employees.  None of the Company's employees are represented by any collective bargaining units.  The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good.

	SUPERVISION AND REGULATION




	 




	General Supervision and Regulation




	 




	Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law, and these laws are subject to change.  As an example, in the summer of 2010, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) (discussed below).  These laws and regulations are intended to protect depositors, not stockholders.  To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions.  Any change in the applicable law or regulation may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Company and the Bank.  Management of the Company is unable to predict, at this time, the impact of future changes to laws and regulations.




	 




	General Bank Holding Company Regulation




	 




	General:  As a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, (the "BHCA"), the Company is subject to the regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve Board (the “FRB”).  The Company is required to file with the FRB annual reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries.  Under the BHCA, the Company's activities and those of its subsidiaries are limited to banking, managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries or engaging in any other activity which the FRB determines to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto.




	 




	The BHCA requires, among other things, the prior approval of the FRB in any case where a bank holding company proposes to; (i) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any other bank; (ii) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any bank (unless it owns a majority of such bank's voting shares); or (iii) merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.  The FRB will not approve any acquisition, merger or consolidation that would have a substantially anti-competitive effect, unless the anti-competitive impact of the proposed transaction is clearly outweighed by a greater public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.  The FRB also considers capital adequacy and other financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and the banks concerned, together with the convenience and needs of the community to be served, when reviewing acquisitions or mergers.




	 




	The BHCA also generally prohibits a bank holding company, with certain limited exceptions, from; (i) acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company; or (ii) engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or performing services for its subsidiaries, unless such non-banking business is determined by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto.  In making such determinations, the FRB is required to weigh the expected benefits to the public such as greater convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency, against the possible adverse effects such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices.
























	The BHCA was substantially amended through the Modernization Act.  The Modernization Act permits bank holding companies and banks, which meet certain capital, management and Community Reinvestment Act standards, to engage in a broader range of non-banking activities.  In addition, bank holding companies, which elect to become financial holding companies, may engage in certain banking and non-banking activities without prior FRB approval.  Finally, the Modernization Act imposes certain privacy requirements on all financial institutions and their treatment of consumer information.  The Company has elected to become a financial holding company.




	 




	There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) insurance fund in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default.  Under regulations of the FRB, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy.  The FRB also has the authority under the BHCA to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary upon the FRB's determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.




	 




	Capital Adequacy Guidelines




	 




	In December 2010 and January 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) published the final texts of reforms on capital and liquidity generally referred to as “Basel III.” In July 2013, the FRB, the FDIC and the Comptroller of the Currency adopted final rules (the “New Rules”), which implement certain provisions of Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act. The New Rules replaced the existing general risk-based capital rules of the various banking agencies with a single, integrated regulatory capital framework. The New Rules require higher capital cushions and more stringent criteria for what qualifies as regulatory capital. The New Rules were effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015.




	 




	Under the New Rules, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets:




	 




	•


	Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 4.5% (the “CET1”);




	•


	Tier 1 Capital Ratio (CET1 capital plus “Additional Tier 1 capital”) of 6.0%; and




	•


	Total Capital Ratio (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) of 8.0%.




	 




	In addition, the Company and the Bank will be subject to a leverage ratio of 4% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on the consolidated financial statements).




	  




	The New Rules also require a “capital conservation buffer.” When fully phased in on January 1 2019, the Company and the Bank will be required to maintain a 2.5% capital conservation buffer, which is composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios described above, resulting in the following minimum capital ratios:




	 




	•


	CET1 of 7%;




	•


	Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 8.5%; and




	•


	Total Capital Ratio of 10.5%.




	 




	The purpose of the capital conservation buffer is to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a CET1, Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Capital Ratio above the minimum set forth above but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase equity and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers, based on the amount of the shortfall.  The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level, and it increases by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1 until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019.




	 




	The New Rules provide for several deductions from and adjustments to CET1, which are being phased in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2018. For example, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one of those categories exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.




	 




	Under the New Rules, banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank may make a one-time permanent election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income items in determining regulatory capital ratios. Effective as of January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income items for purposes of determining regulatory capital.
























	While the New Rules generally require the phase-out of non-qualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock, holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, such as the Company, may permanently include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010 in Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature.




	 




	The New Rules prescribe a standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. Depending on the nature of the assets, the risk categories generally range from 0% for U.S. Government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and result in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the New Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.




	 




	Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the New Rules adopt alternatives to credit ratings for calculating the risk-weighting for certain assets.




	 




	Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations, specifying the levels at which an insured depository institution such as the Bank would be considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized,” and providing for certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution. To qualify to engage in financial activities under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, all depository institutions must be “well capitalized.”




	 




	The New Rules also revised the regulations implementing these provisions of FDICIA, to change the capital levels applicable to each designation. Under the New Rules, an institution will be classified as “well capitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent, (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, and (v) meets certain other requirements. An institution will be classified as “adequately capitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent, (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.5%, and (v) does not meet the definition of “well capitalized.” An institution will be classified as “undercapitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0 percent, or (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution will be classified as “significantly undercapitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0 percent, or (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less 3.0%. An institution will be classified as “critically undercapitalized” if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than 2.0 percent. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating.




	 




	General Bank Regulation




	 




	As a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to the regulation, supervision, and control of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the “Department”).  As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and control of the FDIC, an agency of the federal government.  The regulations of the FDIC and the Department affect virtually all activities of the Bank, including the minimum level of capital that the Bank must maintain, the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, the ability of the Bank to expand through new branches or acquisitions and various other matters.




	 




	Insurance of Deposits


	:  The Dodd-Frank Act has caused significant changes in the FDIC’s insurance of deposit accounts. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the FDIC deposit insurance limit to $250 thousand per depositor.




	 




	On February 7, 2011 the FDIC announced the approval of the assessment system mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.  Dodd-Frank required that the base on which deposit insurance assessments are charged be revised from one based on domestic deposits to one based on assets.  The FDIC’s rule to base the assessment on average total consolidated assets minus average tangible equity instead of domestic deposits lowered assessments for many community banks with less than $10 billion in assets and reduced the Company’s costs.




	 














	Dividend Rights


	:  Under the Banking Act, a bank may declare and pay dividends only if, after payment of the dividend, the capital stock of the bank will be unimpaired and either the bank will have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock or the payment of the dividend will not reduce the bank's surplus. Unless and until the Company develops other lines of business, payments of dividends from the Bank will remain the Company’s primary source of income and the primary source of funds for dividend payments to the shareholders of the Company. 









	Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act




	 




	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), enacted on July 21, 2010, significantly changed the bank regulatory landscape and has impacted and will continue to impact the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of insured depository institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things:













	•






	capped debit card interchange fees for institutions with $10 billion in assets or more at $0.21 plus 5 basis points times the transaction amount, a substantially lower rate than the average rate in effect prior to adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act;
















	•






	provided for an increase in the FDIC assessment for depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, increases in the minimum reserve ratio for the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% and changes the basis for determining FDIC premiums from deposits to assets;
















	•






	permanently increased the deposit insurance coverage to $250 thousand and allowed depository institutions to pay interest on checking accounts;
















	•






	created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) that has rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial protection laws that apply to all banks and has broad authority to enforce these laws;
















	•






	provided for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance;
















	•






	changed standards for Federal preemption of state laws related to federally-chartered institutions and their subsidiaries;
















	•






	provided mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer’s ability to repay, restricting variable rate lending by requiring the ability to repay to be determined for variable rate loans by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable rate loan term, and making more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans, new disclosures, and certain other revisions; and
















	•






	created a financial stability oversight council that will recommend to the Federal Reserve increasingly strict rules for capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity.







	The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes new obligations on originators of residential mortgage loans, such as the Bank. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act requires originators to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on documented information that a borrower has a reasonable ability to repay a particular mortgage loan over the long term. If the originator cannot meet this standard, the mortgage may be unenforceable. The Dodd-Frank Act contains an exception from this ability-to-repay rule for “Qualified Mortgages”. A rule issued by the CFPB in January 2013, and effective January 10, 2014, sets forth specific underwriting criteria for a loan to qualify as a Qualified Mortgage. The criteria generally exclude loans that (1) are interest-only, (2) have excessive upfront points or fees, or (3) have negative amortization features, balloon payments, or terms in excess of 30 years. The underwriting criteria also impose a maximum debt to income ratio of 43%, based upon documented and verifiable information. If a loan meets these criteria and is not a “higher priced loan” as defined in FRB regulations, the CFPB rule establishes a safe harbor preventing a consumer from asserting the failure of the originator to establish the consumer’s ability to repay. However, a consumer may assert the lender’s failure to comply with the ability-to-repay rule for all residential mortgage loans other than Qualified Mortgages, and may challenge whether a loan in fact qualified as a Qualified Mortgage.




	Although the majority of residential mortgages historically originated by the Bank would be considered Qualified Mortgages, the Bank has and may continue to make residential mortgage loans that would not qualify. As a result of such rules, the Bank might experience increased compliance costs, loan losses, litigation related expenses and delays in taking title to real estate collateral, if these loans do not perform and borrowers challenge whether the Bank satisfied the ability-to-repay rule upon originating the loan.




	 




	The requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory reforms continue to be implemented.  In addition, as a result of the 2016 election, many commentators believe that some portions of the Dodd-Frank Act may be replaced or amended. It is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact certain provisions and yet-to-be-finalized rules and regulations will have on us, including any regulations promulgated by the CFPB. Financial reform legislation and rules could have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment, and our ability to conduct business. Management will have to apply resources to ensure compliance with all applicable provisions of regulatory reforms, including the Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules, which may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings.

	Item 1A.        Risk Factors:




	 




	Our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our securities can be materially and adversely affected by many events and conditions including the following:




	 




	We have been and may continue to be adversely affected by national financial markets and economic conditions, as well as local conditions.




	 




	Our business and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions in the United States, including factors such as the level and volatility of interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, investor confidence and the strength of the U.S. economy. The deterioration of any of these conditions can adversely affect our securities and loan portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, our capital levels, liquidity and our results of operations.




	 




	In addition, we are affected by the economic conditions within our New Jersey and Pennsylvania trade areas.  Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services primarily to customers in the seven counties in the New Jersey market and one county in Pennsylvania in which we have branches, so any decline in the economy of New Jersey or eastern Pennsylvania could have an adverse impact on us.




	 




	Our loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans, and the value of collateral securing these loans are impacted by economic conditions.   Our financial results, the credit quality of our existing loan portfolio, and the ability to generate new loans with acceptable yield and credit characteristics may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, including declines in real estate values, changes in interest rates, adverse employment conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government.  Although economic conditions in our primary market have fared better than other areas of the United States, we cannot assure you that these conditions will continue to prevail.  We cannot assure you that positive trends or developments discussed in this annual report will continue or that negative trends or developments will not have a significant adverse effect on us.




	 




	A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively impact the real estate market could hurt our business.




	 




	A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, approximately 96 percent of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. Weakness in the real estate market in our primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality. Any future declines in home prices in the New Jersey and Pennsylvania markets we serve also may result in increases in delinquencies and losses in our loan portfolios. Stress in the real estate market, combined with any weakness in economic conditions and any future elevated unemployment levels could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses. In that event, our earnings could be adversely affected.




	 




	Our offering of alternative credit products may expose us to increased lending risks.




	 




	The Dodd-Frank Act imposes new obligations on originators of residential mortgage loans. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act requires originators to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on documented information that a borrower has a reasonable ability to repay a particular mortgage loan over the long term. If the originator cannot meet this standard, the loan may be unenforceable. The Dodd-Frank Act contains an exception from this ability-to-repay rule for “Qualified Mortgages”. A rule issued by the CFPB in January 2013, and effective January 10, 2014, sets forth specific underwriting criteria for a loan to qualify as a Qualified Mortgage. The criteria generally exclude loans that (1) are interest-only, (2) have excessive upfront points or fees, or (3) have negative amortization features, balloon payments, or terms in excess of 30 years. The underwriting criteria also impose a maximum debt to income ratio of 43%, based upon documented and verifiable information. If a loan meets these criteria and is not a “higher priced loan” as defined in Federal Reserve regulations, the CFPB rule establishes a safe harbor preventing a consumer from asserting the failure of the originator to establish the consumer’s ability to repay. However, a consumer may assert the lender’s failure to comply with the ability-to-repay rule for all residential mortgage loans other than Qualified Mortgages.



















	Although the majority of residential mortgages historically originated by the Bank would be considered Qualified Mortgages, the Bank has and may continue to make residential mortgage loans that would not qualify. The Bank has evaluated the impact of the Qualified Mortgage definition and related ability-to-repay rules, as well as other rules recently issued by the by the CFPB related to mortgage origination and servicing, and does not believe it will have any long-term impact on its mortgage loan origination and servicing activities. As a result of such rules, the Bank might experience increased compliance costs, loan losses, litigation related expenses and delays in taking title to real estate collateral, if these loans do not perform and borrowers challenge whether the Bank satisfied the ability-to-repay rule upon originating the loan.




	 




	There is a risk that the SBA will not honor their guarantee.




	 




	The Company has historically been a participant in various SBA lending programs which guarantee up to 90% of the principal on the underlying loan. There is a risk that the SBA will not honor their guarantee if a loan is not underwritten and administered to SBA guidelines. The Company follows the underwriting guidelines of the SBA; however our ability to manage this will depend on our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled employees who have knowledge of the SBA program.




	 




	There is a risk that we may not be repaid in a timely manner, or at all, for loans we make.




	 




	The risk of nonpayment (or deferred or delayed payment) of loans is inherent in commercial banking.  Such nonpayment, or delayed or deferred payment of loans to the Company, if they occur, may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and overall financial condition.  Additionally, in compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, the Company maintains an allowance for loan losses created through charges against earnings.  As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company’s allowance for loan losses was


	$12.6 million


	, or 


	1.29


	 percent of our total loan portfolio and 


	173.82


	 percent of our nonperforming loans.  The Company’s marketing focus on small to medium size businesses may result in the assumption by the Company of certain lending risks that are different from or greater than those which would apply to loans made to larger companies.  We seek to minimize our credit risk exposure through credit controls, which include evaluation of potential borrowers’ available collateral, liquidity and cash flow.  However, there can be no assurance that such procedures will actually reduce loan losses.




	 




	Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.




	 




	Like all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance.  Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect the results of our operations.  Risks within the loan portfolio are analyzed on a continuous basis by management; and, periodically, by an independent loan review function and by the Audit Committee.  A risk system, consisting of multiple-grading categories, is utilized as an analytical tool to assess risk and the appropriate level of loss reserves.  Along with the risk system, management further evaluates risk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions and considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrowers, past and expected loan loss experience and other factors management feels deserve recognition in establishing an adequate reserve.  This risk assessment process is performed at least quarterly and, as adjustments become necessary, they are realized in the periods in which they become known.  The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our control, and these losses may exceed current estimates.  State and federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review our loans and allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in our allowance for loan losses.  Although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable and reasonably estimated losses, we cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for loan losses or that our regulators will not require us to increase this allowance.  Either of these occurrences could adversely affect our earnings.




	 




	We are subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance.




	  




	Net interest income, the difference between interest earned on our interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, represents a significant portion of our earnings.  Both increases and decreases in the interest rate environment may reduce our profits.   Interest rates are subject to factors which are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Reserve Board.  Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest Unity receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) Unity’s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of Unity’s financial assets and liabilities, including the held to maturity and available for sale securities portfolios, and (iii) the average duration of Unity’s interest-earning assets. This also includes the risk that interest-earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest-bearing liabilities, or vice versa (repricing risk), the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period (basis risk), and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability maturities (yield curve risk).



















	The banking business is subject to significant government regulations.




	 




	We are subject to extensive governmental supervision, regulation and control. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and may require substantial modifications to our operations or may cause us to incur substantial additional compliance costs. These laws and regulations are designed to protect depositors and the public, but not our shareholders.  In addition, future legislation and government policy could adversely affect the commercial banking industry and our operations.  Such governing laws can be anticipated to continue to be the subject of future modification.  Our management cannot predict what effect any such future modifications will have on our operations.  In addition, the primary focus of Federal and state banking regulation is the protection of depositors and not the shareholders of the regulated institutions.




	 




	For example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) has resulted in substantial new compliance costs, and may restrict certain sources of revenue. The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law on July 21, 2011.  Generally, the Act is effective the day after it was signed into law, but different effective dates apply to specific sections of the law, many of which will not become effective until various Federal regulatory agencies have promulgated rules implementing the statutory provisions.  Uncertainty remains as to the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, which could have a material adverse impact either on the financial services industry as a whole, or on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things:




	 













	•






	capped debit card interchange fees for institutions with $10 billion in assets or more at $0.21 plus 5 basis points times the transaction amount, a substantially lower rate than the average rate in effect prior to adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act;
















	•






	provided for an increase in the FDIC assessment for depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, increases in the minimum reserve ratio for the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% and changes the basis for determining FDIC premiums from deposits to assets;
















	•






	permanently increased the deposit insurance coverage to $250 thousand and allowed depository institutions to pay interest on checking accounts;
















	•






	created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) that has rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial protection laws that apply to all banks and has broad authority to enforce these laws;
















	•






	provided for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance;
















	•






	changed standards for Federal preemption of state laws related to federally-chartered institutions and their subsidiaries;
















	•






	provided mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer’s ability to repay, restricting variable rate lending by requiring the ability to repay to be determined for variable rate loans by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable rate loan term, and making more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans, new disclosures, and certain other revisions; and
















	•






	created a financial stability oversight council that will recommend to the Federal Reserve increasingly strict rules for capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity.







	 




	In addition, i


	n order to implement


	 Basel III and certain additional capital changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act, on July 9, 2013, the FRB approved, as an interim final rule, the regulatory capital requirements for U.S. bank holding companies, such as us, substantially similar to final rules issued by the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  These new requirements are likely to increase our capital requirements in future periods. See “Supervisions and Regulation – Capital Adequacy Guidelines.”




	 




	These provisions, as well as any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, may impact the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply, and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.




	 




	Our management is actively reviewing the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, many of which are to be phased-in over the next several years, and assessing the probable impact on our operations. However, the ultimate effect of these changes on the financial services industry in general, and us in particular, is uncertain at this time.









	We are subject to changes in accounting policies or accounting standards.




	 




	Understanding Unity’s accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our financial results. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of assets or liabilities and financial results. Unity has identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for loan losses, security valuations and impairments, goodwill and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Under each of these policies, it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions, using different assumptions, or as new information becomes available.














	 




	From time to time, the FASB and the SEC change their guidance governing the form and content of Unity’s external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), such as the FASB, SEC, banking regulators and Unity’s outside auditors, may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Such changes are expected to continue, and may accelerate based on the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board commitments to achieving convergence between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Changes in U.S. GAAP and changes in current interpretations are beyond Unity’s control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how Unity reports its financial results and condition. In certain cases, Unity could be required to apply a new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently (also retroactively) which may result in Unity restating prior period financial statements for material amounts. Additionally, significant changes to U.S. GAAP may require costly technology changes, additional training and personnel, and other expenses that will negatively impact our results of operations.




	 




	Declines in value may adversely impact the investment portfolio.




	 




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had approximately


	$40.6 million


	 and


	$21.0 million


	 in available for sale and held to maturity investment securities, respectively. We may be required to record impairment charges in earnings related to credit losses on our investment securities if they suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. Additionally, (a) if we intend to sell a security or (b) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will be required to recognize an other-than-temporary impairment charge in the statement of income equal to the full amount of the decline in fair value below amortized cost. Factors, including lack of liquidity, absence of reliable pricing information, adverse actions by regulators, or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment could have a negative effect on our investment portfolio and may result in other-than-temporary impairment on our investment securities in future periods.




	 




	Liquidity risk.




	 




	Liquidity risk is the potential that Unity will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding in a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances.




	 




	Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit commitments to borrowers, mortgage and other loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of borrowings, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures.




	 




	Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; principal and interest payments on investment securities; sale, maturity and prepayment of investment securities; net cash provided from operations and access to other funding sources.









	Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to persistent weakness, or downturn, in the economy or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not necessarily specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole.




	 




	We are in competition with many other banks, including larger commercial banks which have greater resources than us.




	 




	The banking industry within the State of New Jersey is highly competitive.  The Company’s principal market area is also served by branch offices of large commercial banks and thrift institutions.  In addition, in 1999 the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act permits other financial entities, such as insurance companies and securities firms, to acquire or form financial institutions, thereby further increasing competition.  A number of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to expend upon advertising and marketing, and their substantially greater capitalization enables them to make much larger loans.  Our success depends a great deal upon our judgment that large and mid-size financial institutions do not adequately serve small businesses in our principal market area and upon our ability to compete favorably for such customers.  In addition to competition from larger institutions, we also face competition for individuals and small businesses from small community banks seeking to compete as “hometown” institutions.  Most of these smaller institutions have focused their marketing efforts on the smaller end of the small business market we serve.









	Future offerings of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our stock.




	 




	In the future, if our or the Bank’s capital ratios fall below the prevailing regulatory required minimums, we or the Bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of common stock or preferred stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both.














	 




	We cannot predict how changes in technology will impact our business.




	 




	The financial services market, including banking services, is increasingly affected by advances in technology, including developments in:




	 




	•


	telecommunications;




	•


	data processing;




	•


	automation;




	•


	Internet-based banking;




	•


	Tele-banking; and




	•


	debit cards/smart cards




	 




	Our ability to compete successfully in the future will depend on whether we can anticipate and respond to technological changes.  To develop these and other new technologies, we will likely have to make additional capital investments.  Although we continually invest in new technology, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources or access to the necessary proprietary technology to remain competitive in the future.




	 




	The Company’s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.




	 




	The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business.  Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company’s customer-relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems.  




	 




	We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as us) and to the risk that our (or our vendors’) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. We maintain a system of comprehensive policies and a control framework designed to monitor vendor risks including, among other things, (i) changes in the vendor’s organizational structure or internal controls, (ii) changes in the vendor’s financial condition, (iii) changes in the vendor’s support for existing products and services and (iv) changes in the vendor’s strategic focus.  In addition we maintain cyber liability insurance to mitigate against any loss incurred.




	 




	While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur; or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.  The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of the Company’s information systems could damage the Company’s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability; any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.




	  




	Our business strategy could be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees and manage our expenses.




	 




	We expect to continue to experience growth in the scope of our operations and, correspondingly, in the number of our employees and customers.  We may not be able to successfully manage our business as a result of the strain on our management and operations that may result from this growth.  Our ability to manage this growth will depend upon our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled employees.    Our success will also depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational and other systems, to manage multiple, concurrent customer relationships and to hire, train and manage our employees.




	 




	Hurricanes or other adverse weather events could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.




	 




	Hurricanes and other weather events can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate.  In addition, these weather events may result in a decline in value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in delinquencies, foreclosures and loan losses.









	Risk of tax reform on deferred tax assets.




	Corporate tax reform has been a key policy initiative of the current administration with noise that the corporate tax rate will decline from 35% down to 15%.  While this is welcome news for most companies, it would result in write-downs of deferred tax assets for many Companies. Unity is at risk of having to write-down its deferred tax assets given a decline in the corporate tax rate.

	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations




	 




	The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes relating thereto included herein.  When necessary, reclassifications have been made to prior period data for purposes of comparability with current period presentation without impacting earnings.  




	 








	Overview




	 




	Unity Bancorp, Inc. (the “Parent Company”) is a bank holding company incorporated in New Jersey and is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.  Its wholly-owned subsidiary, Unity Bank (the “Bank” or, when consolidated with the Parent Company, the “Company”) is chartered by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance.  The Bank provides a full range of commercial and retail banking services through the Internet and its seventeen branch offices located in Hunterdon, Somerset, Middlesex, Union, Bergen and Warren counties in New Jersey, and Northampton County in Pennsylvania as well as a loan production office in Bergen County, New Jersey.  These services include the acceptance of demand, savings, and time deposits and the extension of consumer, real estate, Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and other commercial credits.




	 








	Results of Operations




	 




	Net income totaled $13.2 million, or $1.38 per diluted share for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, compared to $9.6 million, or $1.02 per diluted share for the year ended


	December 31, 2015


	.  The 38.2 percent increase in net income was the product of strategic initiatives and an increase in net interest income due to the expansion of in-market loan and retail deposit relationships.




	 




	Highlights for the year include:




	 













	•






	9.5 percent increase in total loans driven by a 18.8 percent increase in consumer loans, a 9.4 percent increase in commercial loans and a 9.3 percent increase in residential mortgage loans.
















	•






	5.7 percent increase in total deposits with a 20.6 percent increase in savings deposits and a 16.6 percent increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits.
















	•






	Net interest income increased 12.6 percent due to strong loan growth.
















	•






	Net interest margin of 3.58 percent compared to 3.63 percent at prior year end.
















	•






	Continued expense management in 2016.  Expense increases included addition of two new branches in Emerson and Somerville, New Jersey, an expanded commercial loan presence, and investment in technology infrastructure.
















	•






	Credit quality improved primarily due to a 34.0 percent reduction in Other real estate owned ("OREO").












	During the first quarter, the Company repurchased $5.0 million of its outstanding subordinated debentures, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2.3 million on the transaction. This gain is included in noninterest income on the income statement. Net income, excluding the nonrecurring gain on the repurchased subordinated debentures, was $11.7 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net income of $9.6 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, for the prior year. Return on average assets and average common equity for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have been 1.04% and 13.65% respectively, compared to 0.96% and 12.92% for the prior year.

	All net income per common share figures shown above have been adjusted for the 10% stock dividend paid September 30, 2016.


















	Net Interest Income




	 




	The primary source of the Company’s operating income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividends earned on earning assets and fees earned on loans, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.  Earning assets include loans to individuals and businesses, investment securities, interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold.  Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing checking, savings and time deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances and other borrowings.  Net interest income is determined by the difference between the yields earned on earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities (“net interest spread”) and the relative amounts of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  The Company’s net interest spread is affected by regulatory, economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates, loan demand, deposit flows and general levels of nonperforming assets.




	 




	Tax-equivalent net interest income amounted to $38.4 million in


	2016


	, an increase of $4.2 million from $34.1 million in


	2015


	.  The Company’s net interest margin decreased 5 basis points to 3.58 percent in


	2016


	, compared to 3.63 percent in


	2015


	.  The net interest spread was 3.36 percent, a decrease of 6 basis points from 3.42 percent in


	2015


	.




	 


























	During


	2016


	, tax-equivalent interest income was $47.1 million, an increase of $5.3 million or 12.8 percent when compared to


	2015


	.  This increase was driven primarily by the increase in the average volume of loans:




	 













	•






	Of the $5.3 million increase in interest income on a tax-equivalent basis, $4.7 million of the increase was due primarily to the increased volume of earning assets and a $602 thousand increase in yields on average interest-earning assets.
















	•






	The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 5 basis points to 4.40 percent in


	2016


	 when compared to


	2015


	. 
















	•






	The average volume of interest-earning assets increased $131.3 million to $1.1 billion in


	2016


	 compared to $939.2 million in


	2015


	.  This was due primarily to a $99.4 million increase in average loans, primarily commercial, residential mortgage and consumer loans, and a $36.4 million increase in federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $6.0 million decrease in average investment securities.







	 




	Total interest expense was $8.8 million in


	2016


	, an increase of $1.1 million or 14.5 percent compared to


	2015


	.  This increase was driven by the increased volume in borrowed funds and subordinated debentures and time deposits, partially offset by the decreased rates on the borrowed funds and subordinated debentures compared to a year ago:




	 













	•






	Of the $1.1 million increase in interest expense, $1.3 million was due to an increase in the volume of average interest-bearing liabilities, primarily borrowed funds and subordinated debentures and time deposits.
















	•






	The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 1 basis point to 1.04 percent in


	2016


	 when compared to


	2015


	.  While the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 11 basis points to 0.82 percent in 2016, the cost of borrowed funds and subordinated debentures decreased 94 basis points to 2.45 percent due to the modification of borrowings with the FHLB over the past year and additional borrowings at lower rates.
















	•






	Interest-bearing liabilities averaged $837.8 million in


	2016


	, an increase of $92.3 million or 12.4 percent, compared to


	2015


	.  The increase in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in average savings, time deposits and borrowed funds and subordinated debentures.







	 




	The following table reflects the components of net interest income, setting forth for the periods presented herein: (1) average assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity, (2) interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, (3) average yields earned on interest-earning assets and average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, (4) net interest spread, and (5) net interest income/margin on average earning assets.  Rates/yields are computed on a fully tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35 percent in 2016 and 34 percent in 2015.

	Provision for Loan Losses




	 




	The provision for loan losses totaled $1.2 million for


	2016


	, an increase of $720 thousand compared to $500 thousand for


	2015


	.  Each period’s loan loss provision is the result of management’s analysis of the loan portfolio and reflects changes in the size and composition of the portfolio, the level of net charge-offs, delinquencies, current economic conditions and other internal and external factors impacting the risk within the loan portfolio.  Additional information may be found under the captions “Financial Condition - Asset Quality” and “Financial Condition - Allowance for Loan Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments.”  The current provision is considered appropriate based upon management’s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.

	Noninterest income was


	$11.1 million


	 for


	2016


	, a $3.3 million increase compared to


	$7.7 million


	 for


	2015


	.  This increase was primarily due to a nonrecurring gain on the repurchase of subordinated debentures and increased gains on the sale of SBA loans. The Company repurchased $5.2 million of its outstanding debentures on February 26, 2016. The subordinated debentures were repurchased at a price of $0.5475 per dollar, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2.3 million on the transaction. Excluding the nonrecurring gain, noninterest income increased $1.1 million to $8.8 million due to higher gains on the sale of SBA loans and securities, partially offset by lower branch fee income.




	 




	Changes in noninterest income reflect:


















	•






	Branch fee income decreased $251 thousand from the prior year due to lower levels of overdraft fees and service charges from commercial checking accounts.
















	•






	Service and loan fee income increased $34 thousand in 2016 primarily due to increased mortgage servicing income.
















	•






	Net gains on the sale of SBA loans increased $895 thousand to $2.1 million in


	2016


	 due to an increase in the volume of SBA loans sales.  In


	2016


	, $24.7 million in SBA loans were sold compared to $14.1 million in the prior year.
















	•






	During the year, $108.1 million in residential mortgage loans were sold at a gain of $1.6 million compared to $94.3 million in loans sold at a gain of $1.7 million during the prior year. The margin on these sales declined year over year due to product mix.
















	•






	Net gains on the sale of securities totaled $424 thousand and $28 thousand in 2016 and 2015, respectively. For additional information on securities, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

	Other income, which includes check card related income and miscellaneous service charges, totaled $986 thousand and $927 thousand in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increases in Visa check card interchange fees and rental income.

	Noninterest expense totaled


	$27.6 million


	 for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, an increase of $779 thousand when compared to


	$26.9 million


	 in


	2015


	.   




	 




	Changes in noninterest expense reflect:


	 


	 




	 













	•






	Compensation and benefits expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, increased $657 thousand for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, when compared to


	2015


	.  Expenses have risen as we expanded our branch network, lending and support staff. This additional headcount has resulted in higher salary, commission and benefit expense.
















	•






	Occupancy expense decreased $155 thousand in


	2016


	, when compared to


	2015


	, due to the purchase of our Clinton, New Jersey corporate headquarters offset by the opening of Emerson and Somerville branches.
















	•






	Processing and communications remained relatively flat with expenses of $2.4 million and $2.5 million in


	2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.
















	•






	Furniture and equipment expense increased $57 thousand in


	2016


	, due to investment in our technology infrastructure through network and software upgrades that will improve our efficiency and keep our data secure.






































	•






	Professional service fees increased $34 thousand in


	2016


	, primarily due to increased loan review expense due to a larger loan portfolio, partially offset by lower consultant and legal expenses.
















	•






	Loan and OREO expenses decreased $152 thousand in


	2016


	, primarily due to lower property tax and appraisal expense.
















	•






	Deposit insurance expense increased $44 thousand in


	2016


	 when compared to


	2015


	.
















	•






	Advertising expenses increased $65 thousand for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	 in support of our retail and lending sales as well as the branch expansion.
















	•






	Director fees increased $122 thousand in


	2016


	 when compared to


	2015


	.
















	•






	Other expenses increased $123 thousand in


	2016


	, primarily due to increased officer and employee training and provision for commitments.
















	Income Tax Expense




	 




	For


	2016


	, the Company reported income tax expense of $


	7.3 million


	 for an effective tax rate of 35.5 percent, compared to an income tax expense of


	$4.8 million


	 and an effective tax rate of 33.5 percent in


	2015


	.  The Company is subject to a higher tax bracket due to increased earnings in 2016. For additional information on income taxes, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.













	Financial Condition




	 




	Total assets increased


	$105.0 million


	 or 9.7 percent, to


	$1.2 billion


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	, compared to


	$1.1 billion


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	.  This increase was primarily due to increases of $84.5 million in loans, with strong commercial, residential and consumer loan growth, and $17.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease of $9.8 million in securities.  




	 




	Total deposits increased $51.2 million, primarily due to increases of $62.0 million in savings deposits, $30.7 million in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and $15.0 million in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $56.5 million in time deposits. Borrowed funds and subordinated debentures increased $23.8 million to $131.3 million at


	December 31, 2016


	, as term borrowings increased $30.0 million, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in overnight borrowings and $5.2 million in repayment of subordinated debentures.




	 




	Total shareholders’ equity increased $27.8 million from year end


	2015


	, primarily due to net proceeds of $14.4 million from a capital offering and net income from operations, less dividends paid on our common stock. Net income was


	$13.2 million


	 for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, an increase of $3.7 million from the prior year.  Other changes in shareholders’ equity included stock-based transactions of $1.1 million and an other comprehensive gain net of tax of $627 thousand, partially offset by common stock dividends paid in


	2016


	.




	 




	These fluctuations are discussed in further detail in the sections that follow. 













	Securities




	 




	The Company’s securities portfolio consists of available for sale (“AFS”) and held to maturity (“HTM”) investments.  Management determines the appropriate security classification of available for sale or held to maturity at the time of purchase.  The investment securities portfolio is maintained for asset-liability management purposes, as well as for liquidity and earnings purposes.




	 




	AFS securities are investments carried at fair value that may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions or for other business purposes.  Activity in this portfolio is undertaken primarily to manage liquidity and interest rate risk, to take advantage of market conditions that create economically attractive returns and as an additional source of earnings.  AFS securities consist primarily of obligations of U.S. Government sponsored entities, obligations of state and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and other securities.




	 


























	AFS securities totaled


	$40.6 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	, a decrease of


	$12.3 million


	 or 


	23.3%


	, compared to


	$52.9 million


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	.  This net decrease was the result of:




	 













	•






	An increase of $9.3 million from the purchase of one agency note, one corporate bond, one mortgage backed security, one municipal security and five equity holdings, offset by
















	•






	$12.2 million in sales net of realized gains, which consisted of municipal and SBA securities, one corporate bond and thirteen equity or community bank holdings,
















	•






	$8.9 million in principal payments, maturities and called bonds,
















	•






	$270 thousand in net amortization of premiums, and
















	•






	$267 thousand of depreciation in the market value of the portfolio.  At


	December 31, 2016


	, the portfolio had a net unrealized loss of $271 thousand compared to a net unrealized loss of $4 thousand at


	December 31, 2015


	.  These net unrealized losses are reflected net of tax in shareholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive income.












	The weighted average life of AFS securities, adjusted for prepayments, amounted to 5.5 years and 4.0 years at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.   




	 




	HTM securities, which are carried at amortized cost, are investments for which there is the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity.  The portfolio is comprised of obligations of U.S. Government sponsored entities, obligations of state and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and other securities.




	 




	HTM securities were


	$21.0 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	, an increase of


	$2.5 million


	 or


	13.6


	 percent, from year end 


	2015


	.  This net increase was the result of:




	 













	•






	An $11.3 million increase from the purchase of six corporate bonds and one municipal security, partially offset by
















	•






	$6.5 million in sales net of realized gains, which consisted of three corporate bonds,
















	•






	$2.2 million in principal payments and maturities, and
















	•






	$76 thousand in net amortization of premiums.












	The weighted average life of HTM securities, adjusted for prepayments, amounted to 6.9 years and 6.5 years at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.  As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	, the fair value of HTM securities was


	$21.0 million


	 and


	$18.6 million


	, respectively. 









	The Company sold three held to maturity securities due to the regulatory changes from Basel III with regard to investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (subordinate debt). Basel III allows for a bank to invest in subordinated debt of other financial institutions at 100% risk rating with a cap of 10% of adjusted Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1). For levels above 10% there is a corresponding deduction for every dollar in excess of the 10% which is a significant increase in the risk weights for regulatory risk based capital purposes. Such event was isolated, nonrecurring and unusual for the Company.




	 




	The average balance of taxable securities amounted to $61.0 million in


	2016


	 compared to $62.9 million in


	2015


	.  The average yield earned on taxable securities increased 46 basis points to 2.78 percent in


	2016


	, from 2.32 percent in


	2015


	.  The average balance of tax-exempt securities amounted to $7.6 million in


	2016


	 compared to $11.7 million in


	2015


	.  The average yield earned on tax-exempt securities increased 42 basis points to 4.01 percent in


	2016


	, from 3.59 percent in


	2015


	. 




	 




	Securities with a carrying value of $17.7 million and $18.5 million at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	, respectively, were pledged to secure other borrowings and for other purposes required or permitted by law.




	 




	Approximately 78 percent of the total investment portfolio had a fixed rate of interest at


	December 31, 2016


	, compared to 86 percent in


	2015


	.




	 




	For additional information on securities, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 













	Loans




	 




	The loan portfolio, which represents the Company’s largest asset group, is a significant source of both interest and fee income.  The portfolio consists of SBA, SBA 504, commercial, residential mortgage and consumer loans.  Each of these segments is subject to differing levels of credit and interest rate risk.




	 


























	Total loans increased $84.5 million or 9.5 percent to $973.4 million at


	December 31, 2016


	, compared to $889.0 million at year end


	2015


	.  Commercial loans, residential mortgages, consumer loans, and SBA loans increased $43.7 million, $24.6 million, $14.5 million and $4.8 million, respectively, partially offset by a decline of $3.0 million in SBA 504 loans.




	 




	The following table sets forth the classification of loans by major category, including unearned fees, deferred costs and excluding the allowance for loan losses at December 31

	Average loans increased $99.4 million or 12.0 percent from $825.9 million in


	2015


	, to $925.3 million in


	2016


	.  The increase in average loans was due to increases in commercial loans, residential mortgages, consumer and SBA 7(a) loans, partially offset by a decrease in SBA 504 loans.  The yield on the overall loan portfolio increased 2 basis points to 4.83 percent for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, compared to 4.81 percent for the prior year.    




	 




	SBA 7(a) loans, on which the SBA historically has provided guarantees of up to 90 percent of the principal balance, are considered a higher risk loan product for the Company.  These loans are made for the purposes of providing working capital, financing the purchase of equipment, inventory or commercial real estate.  Generally, an SBA 7(a) loan has a deficiency in its credit profile that would not allow the borrower to qualify for a traditional commercial loan, which is why the SBA provides the guarantee.  The deficiency may be a higher loan to value (“LTV”) ratio, lower debt service coverage (“DSC”) ratio or weak personal financial guarantees.  In addition, many SBA 7(a) loans are for start up businesses where there is no historical financial information.  Finally, many SBA borrowers do not have an ongoing and continuous banking relationship with the Bank, but merely work with the Bank on a single transaction.  The guaranteed portion of the Company’s SBA loans is generally sold in the secondary market with the nonguaranteed portion held in the portfolio as a loan held for investment.  




	 




	SBA 7(a) loans held for sale, carried at the lower of cost or market, amounted to $14.8 million at


	December 31, 2016


	,  an increase of $1.7 million from


	December 31, 2015


	.  SBA 7(a) loans held for investment amounted to $42.5 million at


	December 31, 2016


	, an increase of $3.1 million from $39.4 million at


	December 31, 2015


	.  The yield on SBA 7(a) loans, which are generally floating and adjust quarterly to the Prime Rate, was 5.60 percent for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, compared to 5.28 percent in the prior year.









	The guarantee rates on SBA 7(a) loans range from 50 percent to 90 percent, with the majority of the portfolio having a guarantee rate of 75 percent at origination.  The guarantee rates are determined by the SBA and can vary from year to year depending on government funding and the goals of the SBA program.  The carrying value of SBA loans held for sale represents the guaranteed portion to be sold into the secondary market.  The carrying value of SBA loans held for investment represents the unguaranteed portion, which is the Company's portion of SBA loans originated, reduced by the guaranteed portion that is sold into the secondary market.  Approximately $92.6 million and $80.0 million in SBA loans were sold but serviced by the Company at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	, respectively, and are not included on the Company’s balance sheet.  There is no direct relationship or correlation between the guarantee percentages and the level of charge-offs and recoveries on the Company’s SBA 7(a) loans.  Charge-offs taken on SBA 7(a) loans effect the unguaranteed portion of the loan.  SBA loans are underwritten to the same credit standards irrespective of the guarantee percentage.  




	 




	The SBA 504 program consists of real estate backed commercial mortgages where the Company has the first mortgage and the SBA has the second mortgage on the property.  Generally, the Company has a 50 percent LTV ratio on SBA 504 program loans at origination.  At


	December 31, 2016


	, SBA 504 loans totaled


	$26.3 million


	, a decrease of $3.0 million from


	$29.4 million


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	.  The yield on SBA 504 loans was 5.00 percent for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, compared to 4.66 percent in


	2015


	.


























	 




	Commercial loans are generally made in the Company’s marketplace for the purpose of providing working capital, financing the purchase of equipment, inventory or commercial real estate and for other business purposes.  These loans amounted to


	$509.2 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	, an increase of $43.7 million from year end 


	2015


	.  The yield on commercial loans was 4.94 percent for


	2016


	, compared to 4.98 percent in


	2015


	.




	 




	Residential mortgage loans consist of loans secured by 1 to 4 family residential properties.  These loans amounted to


	$289.1 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	, an increase of $24.6 million from year end 


	2015


	.  Sales of mortgage loans totaled $108.1 million for


	2016


	.  Approximately $22.0 million of the loans sold were from portfolio, with the remainder consisting of new production. The yield on residential mortgages was 4.46 percent for


	2016


	, compared to 4.49 percent for


	2015


	. Residential mortgage loans maintained in portfolio are generally to individuals that do not qualify for conventional financing. In extending credit to this category of borrowers, the Bank considers other mitigating factors such as credit history, equity and liquid reserves of the borrower. As a result, the residential mortgage loan portfolio of the Bank includes fixed and adjustable rate mortgages with rates that exceed the rates on conventional fixed-rate mortgage loan products but are not considered high priced mortgages.




	 




	Consumer loans consist of home equity loans, construction loans and loans for the purpose of financing the purchase of consumer goods, home improvements, and other personal needs, and are generally secured by the personal property being purchased.  These loans amounted to


	$91.5 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	, an increase of $14.5 million from


	December 31, 2015


	.  This increase was generated primarily by consumer construction loans, a new product the Company first offered in 2014.  The yield on consumer loans was 4.77 percent for


	2016


	, compared to 4.60 percent for


	2015


	.




	 




	There are no concentrations of loans to any borrowers or group of borrowers exceeding 10 percent of the total loan portfolio and no foreign loans in the portfolio. 




	 




	In the normal course of business, the Company may originate loan products whose terms could give rise to additional credit risk.  Interest-only loans, loans with high LTV ratios, construction loans with payments made from interest reserves and multiple loans supported by the same collateral (e.g. home equity loans) are examples of such products.  However, these products are not material to the Company’s financial position and are closely managed via credit controls that mitigate their additional inherent risk.  Management does not believe that these products create a concentration of credit risk in the Company’s loan portfolio.

	Troubled Debt Restructurings




	 




	Troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) occur when a creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor’s financial condition, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.  These concessions typically include reductions in interest rate, extending the maturity of a loan, other modifications of payment terms, or a combination of modifications.  When the Company modifies a loan, management evaluates the loan for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method, where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs.  If management determines that the value of the modified loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized by segment or class of loan, as applicable, through an allowance estimate or charge-off to the allowance.  This process is used, regardless of loan type, and for loans modified as TDRs that subsequently default on their modified terms.









	At


	December 31, 2016


	, there was one loan totaling


	$153 thousand


	 that was classified as a TDR by the Company and is deemed impaired, compared to seven loans totaling


	$3.3 million


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	.  Nonperforming loans included


	$153 thousand


	 of TDRs as of


	December 31, 2016


	, compared to 


	$293 thousand


	 at 


	December 31, 2015


	.  At


	December 31, 2016


	, TDRs consisted of one SBA held for investment loan which was previously modified back to original terms totaling $153 thousand. Restructured loans that are placed in nonaccrual status may be removed after six months of contractual payments and evidence of the ability to service the debt going forward.  The remaining TDRs are in accrual status since they are performing in accordance with the restructured terms.  There are no commitments to lend additional funds on these loans.  The following table presents a breakdown of performing and nonperforming TDRs by class as of December 31

	Asset Quality




	 




	Inherent in the lending function is credit risk, which is the possibility a borrower may not perform in accordance with the contractual terms of their loan.  A borrower’s inability to pay their obligations according to the contractual terms can create the risk of past due loans and, ultimately, credit losses, especially on collateral deficient loans.  The Company minimizes its credit risk by loan diversification and adhering to strict credit administration policies and procedures.  Due diligence on loans begins when we initiate contact regarding a loan with a borrower.  Documentation, including a borrower’s credit history, materials establishing the value and liquidity of potential collateral, the purpose of the loan, the source of funds for repayment of the loan, and other factors, are analyzed before a loan is submitted for approval.  The loan portfolio is then subject to on-going internal reviews for credit quality, as well as independent credit reviews by an outside firm. 




	 




	The risk of loss is difficult to quantify and is subject to fluctuations in collateral values, general economic conditions and other factors.  In some cases, these factors have also resulted in significant impairment to the value of loan collateral.  The Company values its collateral through the use of appraisals, broker price opinions, and knowledge of its local market.




	 




	Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and OREO.  Nonperforming loans consist of loans that are not accruing interest (nonaccrual loans) as a result of principal or interest being delinquent for a period of 90 days or more or when the ability to collect principal and interest according to the contractual terms is in doubt.  When a loan is classified as nonaccrual, interest accruals discontinue and all past due interest previously recognized as income is reversed and charged against current period income.  Generally, until the loan becomes current, any payments received from the borrower are applied to outstanding principal, until such time as management determines that the financial condition of the borrower and other factors merit recognition of a portion of such payments as interest income.  Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest are not included in nonperforming loans.  Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing generally represent loans that are well collateralized and in a continuing process that are expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status.































	The following table sets forth information concerning nonperforming assets and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest at December 31

	Nonperforming loans were


	$7.2 million


	 at 


	December 31, 2016


	, a $23 thousand decrease from


	$7.3 million


	 at year end


	2015


	.  Since year end


	2015


	, nonperforming loans in the commercial, SBA and SBA 504 segments decreased, partially offset by an increase in nonperforming loans in the consumer loan and residential mortgage segments.  Included in nonperforming loans at 


	December 31, 2016


	 are approximately


	$60 thousand


	 of loans guaranteed by the SBA, compared to


	$288 thousand


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	.  In addition, there were no loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest at


	December 31, 2016


	 or


	December 31, 2015


	.




	 




	OREO properties totaled


	$1.1 million


	 at 


	December 31, 2016


	, a decrease of $541 thousand from


	$1.6 million


	 at year end


	2015


	.  During


	2016


	, the Company took title to six properties totaling $2.5 million that resulted in a charge to the allowance of $559 thousand and a $300 thousand writedown which is included in "Loan costs and OREO expenses".  The Company sold four OREO properties, resulting in a net loss of $71 thousand on the sales.




	 




	The Company also monitors potential problem loans.  Potential problem loans are those loans where information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with loan repayment terms. These loans are not included in nonperforming loans as they continue to perform.  Potential problem loans totaled $1.1 million at


	December 31, 2016


	, a decrease of $1.2 million from $2.3 million at


	December 31, 2015


	. The decrease is due to the removal of three loans totaling $1.8 million as well as the payoff of one loan totaling $391 thousand during the year, partially offset by the addition of nine loans totaling $1.1 million.




	 




	For additional information on asset quality, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



































	Allowance for Loan Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments




	 




	Management reviews the level of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis.  The standardized methodology used to assess the adequacy of the allowance includes the allocation of specific and general reserves.  Specific reserves are made to individual impaired loans, which have been defined to include all nonperforming loans and TDRs.  The general reserve is set based upon a representative average historical net charge-off rate adjusted for certain environmental factors such as: delinquency and impairment trends, charge-off and recovery trends, volume and loan term trends, risk and underwriting policy trends, staffing and experience changes, national and local economic trends, industry conditions and credit concentration changes. 









	When calculating the five-year historical net charge-off rate, the Company weights the past three years more heavily as it believes they are more indicative of future charge-offs.  All of the environmental factors are ranked and assigned a basis points value based on the following scale: low, low moderate, moderate, high moderate, and high risk.  The factors are evaluated separately for each type of loan.  For example, commercial loans are broken down further into commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgages, construction loans, etc.  Each type of loan is risk weighted for each environmental factor based on its individual characteristics. 




	 




	According to the Company’s policy, a loss (“charge-off”) is to be recognized and charged to the allowance for loan losses as soon as a loan is recognized as uncollectable.  All credits which are 90 days past due must be analyzed for the Company's ability to collect on the credit.  Once a loss is known to exist, the charge-off approval process is immediately expedited.




	  




	The allowance for loan losses totaled


	$12.6 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	, compared to


	$12.8 million


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	, with resulting allowance to total loan ratios of


	1.29


	 percent and 


	1.44


	 percent, respectively.  Net charge-offs amounted to 


	$1.4 million


	 for


	2016


	, compared to


	$292 thousand


	 for


	2015


	.  The following table is a summary of the changes to the allowance for loan losses for the past five years, including net charge-offs to average loan ratios for each major loan category:

	In addition to the allowance for loan losses, the Company maintains a reserve for unfunded loan commitments that is maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb estimated probable losses.  Adjustments to the reserve are made through other expense and applied to the reserve which is maintained in other liabilities.  At


	December 31, 2016


	, a $181 thousand commitment reserve was reported on the balance sheet as an “other liability”, compared to a $138 thousand commitment reserve at


	December 31, 2015


	.




	 




	For additional information on the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded loan commitments, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 








	Deposits




	 




	Deposits, which include noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, savings deposits and time deposits, are the primary source of the Company’s funds.  The Company offers a variety of products designed to attract and retain customers, with primary focus on building and expanding relationships.  The Company continues to focus on establishing a comprehensive relationship with business borrowers, seeking deposits as well as lending relationships.

	Total deposits increased $51.2 million to $945.7 million at


	December 31, 2016


	, from $894.5 million at


	December 31, 2015


	.  This increase in deposits was due to increases of $62.0 million, $30.7 million, and $15.0 million in savings deposits, noninterest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits, respectively, partially offset by a $56.5 million decrease in time deposits.




	 


























	The Company’s deposit composition at


	December 31, 2016


	, consisted of 38.5 percent savings deposits, 23.3 percent time deposits, 22.8 percent noninterest-bearing demand deposits and 15.4 percent interest-bearing demand deposits.  This shift in deposit mix from


	December 31, 2015


	 reflects a 4.8 percent increase in savings deposits, a 2.1 percent increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and a 0.8 percent increase in interest-bearing demand deposits, offset by a 7.7 percent decrease in time deposits.









	The increase in savings deposits was primarily due to new savings promotions. The increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits is attributable to growth in commercial customer relationships. Total municipal deposits decreased $25.7 million from prior year end, with a decrease in municipal savings and time deposits, partially offset by an increase in interest-bearing demand deposits.

	Borrowed Funds and Subordinated Debentures




	 




	Borrowed funds consist primarily of fixed and adjustable rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and repurchase agreements.  These borrowings are used as a source of liquidity or to fund asset growth not supported by deposit generation.  Residential mortgages and commercial loans collateralize the borrowings from the FHLB, while investment securities are pledged against the repurchase agreements.




	 




	Borrowed funds and subordinated debentures totaled $131.3 million and $107.5 million at


	December 31, 2016


	 and

	The $23.8 million increase in total borrowed funds and subordinated debentures was due to a $29.0 million increase in FHLB borrowings, partially offset by a $5.2 million decrease in subordinated debentures. Borrowed funds increased $29.0 million from prior year-end due to the addition of two adjustable rate FHLB borrowings totaling $30.0 million, partially offset by reduced overnight borrowings during the


	year ended December 31, 2016


	. The following transactions impacted borrowed funds and subordinated debentures:


















	•






	On February 26, 2016, the Company repurchased $5.2 million of its outstanding subordinated debentures, reducing its outstanding subordinated debt to $10.3 million.  The subordinated debentures were repurchased at a price of $0.5475 per dollar, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2.3 million on the transaction.
















	•






	On July 5, 2016, the Bank purchased a $20.0 million Adjustable Rate Credit ("ARC") FHLB borrowing with a rate of LIBOR plus 0.10%, maturing on February 16, 2017. This borrowing was swapped to a 5 year fixed rate borrowing at 1.048%.
















	•






	The Bank had a $10.0 million FHLB borrowing with a rate of 4.27% maturing on April 5, 2017. On March 23, 2016, the Company modified this $10.0 million FHLB advance into a 4.75 year no-call 1 year (callable quarterly) at a rate of 2.10%.






































	•






	The Bank had a $10.0 million FHLB borrowing with a rate of 3.397% maturing on December 20, 2017. On July 7, 2016, the Company modified this $10.0 million FHLB advance into a 5 year no-call 1 year (callable quarterly) at a rate of 1.80%.
















	•






	The Bank had a $10.0 million ARC FHLB borrowing with a rate of 1.243% that matured on August 16, 2016. This $10.0 million FHLB advance was renewed for an additional six months at a rate of LIBOR minus 0.05%. This borrowing was swapped to a 5 year fixed rate borrowing at 1.103%.
















	•






	The Bank had a $20.0 million ARC FHLB borrowing with a rate of 1.855% that matured on December 7, 2016. This $20.0 million FHLB advance was renewed for an additional six months at a rate of LIBOR minus 0.07%. This borrowing was swapped to a 5 year fixed rate borrowing at 1.730%.












	In December 2016, the FHLB issued a $20.0 million municipal deposit letter of credit in the name of Unity Bank naming the NJ Department of Banking and Insurance as beneficiary. The letter of credit took the place of securities previously pledged to the state for the Bank's municipal deposits.









	At


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had $220.5 million of additional credit available at the FHLB.  Pledging additional collateral in the form of 1 to 4 family residential mortgages, commercial loans and investment securities can increase the line with the FHLB.

	Market Risk




	 




	Based on the Company’s business, the two largest risks facing the Company are market risk and credit risk.  Market risk for the Company is primarily limited to interest rate risk, which is the impact that changes in interest rates would have on future earnings.  The Company’s Risk Management Committee (“RMC”) manages this risk.  The principal objectives of RMC are to establish prudent risk management guidelines, evaluate and control the level of interest rate risk in balance sheet accounts, determine the level of appropriate risk given the business focus, operating environment, capital, and liquidity requirements, and actively manage risk within Board-approved guidelines.  The RMC reviews the maturities and repricing of loans, investments, deposits and borrowings, cash flow needs, current market conditions, and interest rate levels.




	 




	The Company uses various techniques to evaluate risk levels on both a short and long-term basis.  One of the monitoring tools is the “gap” ratio.  A gap ratio, as a percentage of assets, is calculated to determine the maturity and repricing mismatch between interest rate-sensitive assets and interest rate-sensitive liabilities.  A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate-sensitive assets repricing exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities repricing in a designated time period.  A positive gap should result in higher net interest income with rising interest rates, as the amount of the assets repricing exceeds the amount of liabilities repricing.  Conversely, a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate-sensitive assets, and lower rates should result in higher net interest income.




	 




	Repricing of mortgage-related securities are shown by contractual amortization and estimated prepayments based on the most recent 3-month constant prepayment rate.  Callable agency securities are shown based upon their option-adjusted spread modified duration date (“OAS”), rather than the next call date or maturity date.  The OAS date considers the coupon on the security, the time to the next call date, the maturity date, market volatility and current rate levels.  Fixed rate loans are allocated based on expected amortization.




	 


























	The following table sets forth the gap ratio at


	December 31, 2016


	.  Assumptions regarding the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities are critical in determining the projected level of rate sensitivity.  Certain savings and interest checking accounts are less sensitive to market interest rate changes than other interest-bearing sources of funds.  Core deposits such as interest-bearing demand, savings and money market deposits are allocated based on their expected repricing in relation to changes in market interest rates.

	At


	December 31, 2016


	, there was a six-month asset-sensitive gap of $63.4 million and a one-year asset-sensitive gap of $130.0 million, as compared to liability-sensitive gaps of $14.4 million and $2.0 million at


	December 31, 2015


	.  The six-month and one-year cumulative gap to total assets ratios were within the Board-approved guidelines of +/- 20 percent.









	Other models are also used in conjunction with the static gap table, which is not able to capture the risk of changing spread relationships over time, the effects of projected growth in the balance sheet or dynamic decisions such as the modification of investment maturities as a rate environment unfolds.  For these reasons, a simulation model is used, where numerous interest rate scenarios and balance sheets are combined to produce a range of potential income results.  Net interest income is managed within guideline ranges for interest rates rising or falling by 200 basis points.  Results outside of guidelines require action by the RMC to correct the imbalance.  Simulations are typically created over a 12 to 24 month time horizon.  At


	December 31, 2016


	, these simulations show that with a 200 basis point rate increase over a 12 month period, net interest income would increase by approximately $1.8 million, or 4.5 percent.  A 200 basis point rate decline over a 12 month period would decrease net interest income by approximately $2.0 million or 4.9 percent.  These variances in net interest income are within the Board-approved guidelines of +/- 10 percent.




	 




	Finally, to measure the impact of longer-term asset and liability mismatches beyond two years, the Company utilizes Modified Duration of Equity and Economic Value of Portfolio Equity (“EVPE”) models.  The modified duration of equity measures the potential price risk of equity to changes in interest rates.  A longer modified duration of equity indicates a greater degree of risk to rising interest rates.  Because of balance sheet optionality, an EVPE analysis is also used to dynamically model the present value of asset and liability cash flows, with rate shocks of 200 basis points.  The economic value of equity is likely to be different as interest rates change.  Results falling outside prescribed ranges require action by the RMC.  The Company’s variance in the economic value of equity with rate shocks of 200 basis points is a decline of 1.9 percent in a rising rate environment and a decrease of 7.4 percent in a falling rate environment at


	December 31, 2016


	.  At


	December 31, 2015


	, the Company’s variance in the economic value of equity with rate shocks of 200 basis points is a decline of 7.8 percent in a rising rate environment and a decrease of 8.2 percent in a falling rate environment.  The variance in the EVPE at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	 were within the Board-approved guidelines in place at the time of +/- 20 percent.



































	Liquidity




	 




	Consolidated Bank Liquidity




	Liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due.  A bank’s liquidity reflects its ability to meet loan demand, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate opportunities in the marketplace.  The Company’s liquidity is monitored by management and the Board of Directors through a Risk Management Committee (“RMC”), which reviews historical funding requirements, the current liquidity position, sources and stability of funding, marketability of assets, options for attracting additional funds, and anticipated future funding needs, including the level of unfunded commitments.  The goal is to maintain sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements in order to minimize dependence on volatile and potentially unstable funding markets.




	 




	The principal sources of funds at the Bank are deposits, scheduled amortization and prepayments of investment and loan principal, sales and maturities of investment securities, additional borrowings and funds provided by operations.  While scheduled loan payments and maturing investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.  The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows provides detail on the Company’s sources and uses of cash, as well as an indication of the Company’s ability to maintain an adequate level of liquidity.  As the Consolidated Bank comprises the majority of the assets of the Company, this Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is indicative of the Consolidated Bank’s activity.  At


	December 31, 2016


	, the balance of cash and cash equivalents was


	$105.9 million


	,


	an increase


	 of


	$17.7 million


	 from


	December 31, 2015


	.  A discussion of the cash provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities follows. 




	 




	Operating activities provided


	$8.8 million


	 and


	$3.0 million


	 in net cash for the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	.  The primary sources of funds were net income from operations and adjustments to net income, such as the proceeds from the sale of mortgage and SBA loans held for sale, partially offset by originations of mortgage and SBA loans held for sale.




	 




	Investing activities used


	$81.8 million


	 and


	$110.7 million


	 in net cash for the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.  Cash was primarily used to fund new loans, purchase securities, premises and equipment and FHLB stock, partially offset by cash inflows from proceeds from the sales of securities and maturities and pay downs on securities.    




	 













	•






	Securities


	.  The Consolidated Bank’s available for sale investment portfolio amounted to


	$40.6 million


	 and


	$52.9 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	, respectively.  This excludes the Parent Company’s securities discussed under the heading “Parent Company Liquidity” below.  Projected cash flows from securities over the next twelve months are $10.4 million.
















	•






	Loans


	.  The SBA loans held for sale portfolio amounted to


	$14.8 million


	 and


	$13.1 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	, respectively.  Sales of these loans provide an additional source of liquidity for the Company. 
















	•






	Outstanding Commitments


	.  The Company was committed to advance approximately $181.1 million to its borrowers as of


	December 31, 2016


	, compared to $138.3 million at


	December 31, 2015


	.  At


	December 31, 2016


	, $86.4 million of these commitments expire within one year, compared to $51.3 million at


	December 31, 2015


	.  The Company had $4.1 million and $1.8 million in standby letters of credit at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	, respectively, which are included in the commitments amount noted above.  The estimated fair value of these guarantees is not significant.  The Company believes it has the necessary liquidity to honor all commitments.  Many of these commitments will expire and never be funded.












	Financing activities provided


	$90.8 million


	 and


	$66.0 million


	 in net cash for the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively, primarily due to an increase in the Company’s borrowings and deposits and the proceeds from the capital offering, partially offset by the Company’s repayment of borrowings.













	•






	Deposits


	.  As of


	December 31, 2016


	, deposits included $87.0 million of Government deposits, as compared to $112.7 million at year end


	2015


	. These deposits are generally short in duration and are very sensitive to price competition.  The Company believes that the current level of these types of deposits is appropriate.  Included in the portfolio were $82.0 million of deposits from twelve municipalities.  The withdrawal of these deposits, in whole or in part, would not create a liquidity shortfall for the Company.
















	•






	Borrowed Funds


	.  Total FHLB borrowings amounted to $106.0 million and $77.0 million as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.  Third party repurchase agreements totaled $15.0 million as of both


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	.  As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, the Company can borrow additional funds based on the market value of collateral pledged.  At


	December 31, 2016


	, pledging provided an additional $220.5 million in borrowing potential from the FHLB.  In addition, the Company can pledge additional collateral in the form of 1 to 4 family residential mortgages, commercial loans or investment securities to increase this line with the FHLB. 







	 


























	Parent Company Liquidity




	The Parent Company’s cash needs are funded by dividends paid by the Bank.  Other than its investment in the Bank and Unity Statutory Trust II, the Parent Company does not actively engage in other transactions or business.  Only expenses specifically for the benefit of the Parent Company are paid using its cash, which typically includes the payment of operating expenses.




	 




	At


	December 31, 2016


	, the Parent Company had $1.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1 thousand in investment securities valued at fair market value, compared to $466 thousand in cash and cash equivalents and $216 thousand in investment securities at


	December 31, 2015

	Standby letters of credit represent guarantees of payment issued by the Bank on behalf of a client that is used as "payment of last resort" should the client fail to fulfill a contractual commitment with a third party.  Standby letters of credit are typically short-term in duration, maturing in one year or less.




	 




	Time deposits have stated maturity dates.  For additional information on time deposits, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 




	Borrowed funds and subordinated debentures include fixed and adjustable rate borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, repurchase agreements and subordinated debentures.  The borrowings have defined terms and under certain circumstances are callable at the option of the lender. For additional information on borrowed funds and subordinated debentures, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 




	Operating leases represent obligations entered into by the Company for the use of land and premises.  The leases generally have escalation terms based upon certain defined indexes. For additional information on the Company’s operating leases, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 




	Purchase obligations represent legally binding and enforceable agreements to purchase goods and services from third parties and consist primarily of contractual obligations under data processing and ATM service agreements.













	Capital Adequacy




	 




	A significant measure of the strength of a financial institution is its capital base. Shareholders’ equity increased $27.8 million to $106.3 million at


	December 31, 2016


	 compared to $78.5 million at


	December 31, 2015


	, primarily due to $14.4 million in additional capital as a result of the completion of the capital offering on December 8, 2016 for 1,068,400 shares at a weighted average price of $14.04 per share and net income of $13.2 million.  Other items impacting shareholders’ equity included $1.5 million in dividends paid on common stock, $159 thousand in unrealized losses net of tax on available for sale securities, $1.1 million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans, $729 thousand in unrealized gains net of tax on cash flow hedges and $57 thousand in adjustments related to the defined benefit plan. The issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans includes nonqualified stock options and restricted stock expense related entries, employee option exercises and the tax benefit of options exercised.




	 




	For additional information on shareholders’ equity, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


























	 




	Federal regulators have classified and defined capital into the following components: (1) tier 1 capital, which includes tangible shareholders’ equity for common stock, qualifying preferred stock and certain qualifying hybrid instruments, and (2) tier 2 capital, which includes a portion of the allowance for loan losses, certain qualifying long-term debt,  preferred stock and hybrid instruments which do not qualify as tier 1 capital.  Minimum capital levels are regulated by risk-based capital adequacy guidelines, which require the Company and the Bank to maintain certain capital as a percent of assets and certain off-balance sheet items adjusted for predefined credit risk factors (risk-weighted assets).  A bank is required to maintain, at a minimum, tier 1 capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets of 4 percent and combined tier 1 and tier 2 capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets of 8 percent.  In addition, banks are required to meet a leverage capital requirement, which measures tier 1 capital against average assets.  Banks which are highly rated and not experiencing significant growth are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 3 percent while all other banks are expected to maintain a leverage ratio 1 to 2 percentage points higher.  Finally, the Bank is required to maintain a ratio of common equity tier 1 capital, consisting solely of common equity, to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%. The Company is subject to similar requirements on a consolidated basis.




	 




	The following table summarizes the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, as well as the minimum regulatory capital ratios required for the Bank to be deemed “well-capitalized.”  The Company’s capital amounts and ratios reflect the capital decreases described above.

	Forward-Looking Statements




	 




	This report contains certain forward-looking statements, either expressed or implied, which are provided to assist the reader in understanding anticipated future financial performance.  These statements involve certain risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions by management.




	 


























	Factors that may cause actual results to differ from those results expressed or implied, include, but are not limited to those listed under “Item 1A - Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K; the overall economy and the interest rate environment; the ability of customers to repay their obligations; the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; competition; significant changes in tax, accounting or regulatory practices and requirements; and technological changes.  Although management has taken certain steps to mitigate the negative effect of the aforementioned items, significant unfavorable changes could severely impact the assumptions used and have an adverse effect on future profitability.













	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates




	 




	“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  Note 1 to the Company’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.  Management believes the Company’s policies with respect to the methodology for the determination of the other-than-temporary impairment on securities, servicing assets, allowance for loan losses, and income taxes involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments, which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters.  Changes in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations.  These critical policies are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.




	 




	Other-Than-Temporary Impairment




	 




	The Company has a process in place to identify debt securities that could potentially incur credit impairment that is other-than-temporary. This process involves monitoring late payments, pricing levels, downgrades by rating agencies, key financial ratios, financial statements, revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues.  Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concern warrants such evaluation.  This evaluation considers relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest rate-related impairment of a security is other-than-temporary.  Relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the extent and length of time the fair value has been below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events and (4) for fixed maturity securities, the intent to sell a security or whether it is more likely than not the security will be required to be sold before the recovery of its amortized cost which, in some cases, may extend to maturity and for equity securities, the ability and intent to hold the security for a forecasted period of time that allows for the recovery in value.




	 




	Management assesses its intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit losses.  For debt securities that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired with no intent to sell and no requirement to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amount of the impairment is separated into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component) and the amount due to all other factors.  The credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows.  The remaining difference between the security’s fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income.  For debt securities where management has the intent to sell, the amount of the impairment is reflected in earnings as realized losses.




	 




	The present value of expected future cash flows is determined using the best estimate cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit to the security at the date of purchase or the current yield to accrete an asset-backed or floating rate security.  The methodology and assumptions for establishing the best estimate cash flows vary depending on the type of security.  The asset-backed securities cash flow estimates are based on bond specific facts and circumstances that may include collateral characteristics, expectations of delinquency and default rates, loss severity and prepayment speeds and structural support, including subordination and guarantees.  The corporate bond cash flow estimates are derived from scenario-based outcomes of expected corporate restructurings or the disposition of assets using bond specific facts and circumstances including timing, security interests and loss severity.




	 




	For additional information on other-than-temporary impairment, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 


























	Servicing Assets




	 




	Servicing assets represent the estimated fair value of retained servicing rights, net of servicing costs, at the time loans are sold. Servicing assets are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues.  Impairment is evaluated based on stratifying the underlying financial assets by date of origination and term.  Fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics, when available, or based upon discounted cash flows using market-based assumptions.  Any impairment, if temporary, would be reported as a valuation allowance.




	 




	For additional information on servicing assets, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.









	Allowance for Loan Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments




	 




	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management considers adequate to provide for probable loan losses as of the balance sheet date.  The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by net charge-offs.




	 




	The level of the allowance is based on management’s evaluation of probable losses in the loan portfolio, after consideration of prevailing economic conditions in the Company’s market area, the volume and composition of the loan portfolio, and historical loan loss experience.  The allowance for loan losses consists of specific reserves for individually impaired credits and TDRs and reserves for nonimpaired loans based on historical loss factors and reserves based on general economic factors and other qualitative risk factors such as changes in delinquency trends, industry concentrations or local/national economic trends.  This risk assessment process is performed at least quarterly, and, as adjustments become necessary, they are realized in the periods in which they become known.




	 




	Although management attempts to maintain the allowance at a level deemed adequate to provide for probable losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based upon certain factors including changes in market conditions and underlying collateral values.  In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of the Company’s allowance for loan losses.  These agencies may require the Company to make additional provisions based on judgments about information available at the time of the examination.




	 




	The Company maintains an allowance for unfunded loan commitments that is maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb estimated probable losses.  Adjustments to the allowance are made through other expenses and applied to the allowance which is maintained in other liabilities.




	 




	For additional information on the allowance for loan losses and unfunded loan commitments, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 




	Income Taxes




	 




	The Company accounts for income taxes according to the asset and liability method.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates applicable to taxable income for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. If tax reform results in a decline in the corporate tax rates the Company would have to write-down its deferred tax asset.




	 




	Valuation reserves are established against certain deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Increases or decreases in the valuation reserve are charged or credited to the income tax provision.




	 




	When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that ultimately would be sustained.  The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.  The evaluation of a tax position taken is considered by itself and not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.  The portion of benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits would be recognized in income tax expense on the income statement.




	 




	For additional information on income taxes, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.






























	Management’s Report on Internal Control




	Over Financial Reporting




	 




	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our control over financial reporting based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).  Based on our evaluation under the framework, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	 




	Pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	 has not been attested to by RSM US LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, as stated in their report which is included herein.

	Report of Independent Registered Public




	Accounting Firm




	 




	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders




	Unity Bancorp, Inc.




	 




	We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Unity Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (“the Company”) as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Changes in Shareholders’ Equity and Cash Flows for the years then ended.  These Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.




	 




	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Unity Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements








	1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




	 




	Overview




	 




	The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Unity Bancorp, Inc. (the “Parent Company”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Unity Bank (the “Bank” or when consolidated with the Parent Company, the “Company”).  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.




	 




	Unity Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company incorporated in New Jersey and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.  Its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank, is chartered by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance.  The Bank provides a full range of commercial and retail banking services through


	seventeen


	 branch offices located in Bergen, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Somerset, Union and Warren counties in New Jersey and Northampton County in Pennsylvania.  These services include the acceptance of demand, savings, and time deposits and the extension of consumer, real estate, Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and other commercial credits.




	 




	Unity Bank has


	nine


	 wholly-owned subsidiaries: Unity Investment Services, Inc., AJB Residential Realty Enterprises, Inc., AJB Commercial Realty, Inc., MKCD Commercial, Inc., JAH Commercial, Inc., UB Commercial LLC, ASBC Holdings LLC, Unity Property Holdings 1, Inc., and Unity Property Holdings 2, Inc.  Unity Investment Services, Inc. is used to hold and administer part of the Bank’s investment portfolio.  The other subsidiaries hold, administer and maintain the Bank’s other real estate owned (“OREO”) properties. Unity Investment Services, Inc. has one subsidiary, Unity Delaware Investment 2, Inc., which has one subsidiary, Unity NJ REIT, Inc.  Unity NJ REIT, Inc. was added in 2013 to hold loans.




	 




	The Company has


	two


	 wholly-owned subsidiaries: Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust II and Unity Risk Management, Inc. For additional information on Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust II, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unity Risk Management, Inc. is the Company's captive insurance company that insures risks to the bank not provided by the traditional commercial insurance market.




	 




	Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements




	 




	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Amounts requiring the use of significant estimates include the allowance for loan losses, valuation of deferred tax and servicing assets, the carrying value of loans held for sale and other real estate owned, the valuation of securities and the determination of other-than-temporary impairment for securities and fair value disclosures.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 




	10 Percent Stock Dividend Paid









	On September 30, 2016 a


	10 percent


	 stock dividend was paid to all shareholders of record as of September 15, 2016. All share information has been adjusted as necessary to account for this dividend.









	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 




	Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits.




	 




	Securities




	 




	The Company classifies its securities into two categories, available for sale and held to maturity.




	 




	Securities that are classified as available for sale are stated at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are generally excluded from results of operations and are reported as other comprehensive income, a separate component of shareholders’ equity, net of taxes.  Securities classified as available for sale include securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, changes in prepayment risks or for asset/liability management purposes.  The cost of securities sold is determined on a specific identification basis.  Gains and losses on sales of securities are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income on the date of sale.




	 




	Securities are classified as held to maturity based on management’s intent and ability to hold them to maturity.  Such securities are stated at cost, adjusted for unamortized purchase premiums and discounts using the level yield method.




	 


























	If transfers between the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios occur, they are accounted for at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses are accounted for at the date of transfer.  For securities transferred to available for sale from held to maturity, unrealized gains or losses as of the date of the transfer are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of shareholders’ equity.  For securities transferred into the held to maturity portfolio from the available for sale portfolio, unrealized gains or losses as of the date of transfer continue to be reported in other comprehensive income (loss), and are amortized over the remaining life of the security as an adjustment to its yield, consistent with amortization of the premium or accretion of the discount.




	 




	For additional information on securities, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.









	Other-Than-Temporary Impairment




	 




	The Company has a process in place to identify debt securities that could potentially incur credit impairment that is other-than-temporary.  This process involves monitoring late payments, pricing levels, downgrades by rating agencies, key financial ratios, financial statements, revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues.  Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concern warrants such evaluation.  This evaluation considers relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest rate-related impairment of a security is other-than-temporary.  Relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the extent and length of time the fair value has been below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events and (4) for fixed maturity securities, the intent to sell a security or whether it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost which, in some cases, may extend to maturity.




	 




	For debt securities that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired where management has no intent to sell and the Company has no requirement to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amount of the impairment is separated into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component) and the amount due to all other factors.  The credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows.  The remaining difference between the security’s fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income.  For debt securities where management has the intent to sell, the amount of the impairment is reflected in earnings as realized losses.




	 




	The present value of expected future cash flows is determined using the best estimate cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit to the security at the date of purchase or the current yield to accrete an asset-backed or floating rate security.  The methodology and assumptions for establishing the best estimate cash flows vary depending on the type of security.  The asset-backed securities cash flow estimates are based on bond specific facts and circumstances that may include collateral characteristics, expectations of delinquency and default rates, loss severity and prepayment speeds and structural support, including subordination and guarantees.  The corporate bond cash flow estimates are derived from scenario-based outcomes of expected corporate restructurings or the disposition of assets using bond specific facts and circumstances including timing, security interests and loss severity.




	 




	Transfers of Financial Assets




	 




	Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been surrendered.  Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.




	 




	Loans




	 




	Loans Held for Sale




	Loans held for sale represent the guaranteed portion of SBA loans and are reflected at the lower of aggregate cost or market value.  The Company originates loans to customers under an SBA program that historically has provided for SBA guarantees of up to 


	90 percent


	 of each loan.  The Company generally sells the guaranteed portion of its SBA loans to a third party and retains the servicing, holding the nonguaranteed portion in its portfolio.  The net amount of loan origination fees on loans sold is included in the carrying value and in the gain or loss on the sale.  When sales of SBA loans do occur, the premium received on the sale and the present value of future cash flows of the servicing assets are recognized in income.  All criteria for sale accounting must be met in order for the loan sales to occur; see details under the “Transfers of Financial Assets” heading above.




	 


























	Servicing assets represent the estimated fair value of retained servicing rights, net of servicing costs, at the time loans are sold.  Servicing assets are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues.  Impairment is evaluated based on stratifying the underlying financial assets by date of origination and term.  Fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics, when available, or based upon discounted cash flows using market-based assumptions.  Any impairment, if temporary, would generally be reported as a valuation allowance.




	 




	Serviced loans sold to others are not included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Income and fees collected for loan servicing are credited to noninterest income when earned, net of amortization on the related servicing assets.




	 




	For additional information on servicing assets, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 




	Loans Held for Investment




	Loans held for investment are stated at the unpaid principal balance, net of unearned discounts and deferred loan origination fees and costs.  In accordance with the level yield method, loan origination fees, net of direct loan origination costs, are deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the related loans as an adjustment to the loan yield.  Interest is credited to operations primarily based upon the principal balance outstanding. 









	Loans are reported as past due when either interest or principal is unpaid in the following circumstances: fixed payment loans when the borrower is in arrears for two or more monthly payments; open end credit for two or more billing cycles; and single payment notes if interest or principal remains unpaid for 30 days or more.




	 




	Nonperforming loans consist of loans that are not accruing interest as a result of principal or interest being delinquent for a period of 90 days or more or when the ability to collect principal and interest according to the contractual terms is in doubt (nonaccrual loans).  When a loan is classified as nonaccrual, interest accruals are discontinued and all past due interest previously recognized as income is reversed and charged against current period earnings.  Generally, until the loan becomes current, any payments received from the borrower are applied to outstanding principal until such time as management determines that the financial condition of the borrower and other factors merit recognition of a portion of such payments as interest income.  Loans may be returned to an accrual status when the ability to collect is reasonably assured and when the loan is brought current as to principal and interest.




	 




	Loans are charged off when collection is sufficiently questionable and when the Company can no longer justify maintaining the loan as an asset on the balance sheet.  Loans qualify for charge-off when, after thorough analysis, all possible sources of repayment are insufficient.  These include: 1) potential future cash flows, 2) value of collateral, and/or 3) strength of co-makers and guarantors.  All unsecured loans are charged off upon the establishment of the loan’s nonaccrual status.  Additionally, all loans classified as a loss or that portion of the loan classified as a loss is charged off.  All loan charge-offs are approved by the Board of Directors.




	 




	Troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") occur when a creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor’s financial condition, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.  These concessions typically include reductions in interest rate, extending the maturity of a loan, or a combination of both. Interest income on accruing TDRs is credited to operations primarily based upon the principal amount outstanding, as stated in the paragraphs above. 




	 




	The Company evaluates its loans for impairment.  A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  The Company has defined impaired loans to be all TDRs and nonperforming loans.  Impairment is evaluated in total for smaller-balance loans of a similar nature (consumer and residential mortgage loans), and on an individual basis for all other loans.  Impairment of a loan is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, based on a loan’s observable market price or the fair value of collateral, net of estimated costs to sell, if the loan is collateral-dependent.  If the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the Company establishes a valuation allowance, or adjusts existing valuation allowances, with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses.




	 




	For additional information on loans, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 




	Allowance for Loan Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments




	 




	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management considers adequate to provide for probable loan losses as of the balance sheet date.  The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by net charge-offs.  




	 


























	The level of the allowance is based on management’s evaluation of probable losses in the loan portfolio, after consideration of prevailing economic conditions in the Company’s market area, the volume and composition of the loan portfolio, and historical loan loss experience.  The allowance for loan losses consists of specific reserves for individually impaired credits and TDRs, reserves for nonimpaired loans based on historical loss factors adjusted for general economic factors and other qualitative risk factors such as changes in delinquency trends, industry concentrations or local/national economic trends.  This risk assessment process is performed at least quarterly, and, as adjustments become necessary, they are realized in the periods in which they become known.   




	 




	Although management attempts to maintain the allowance at a level deemed adequate to provide for probable losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based upon certain factors including changes in market conditions and underlying collateral values.  In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of the Company’s allowance for loan losses.  These agencies may require the Company to make additional provisions based on judgments about information available at the time of the examination.




	 




	The Company maintains a reserve for unfunded loan commitments at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb estimated probable losses.  Adjustments to the reserve are made through other expenses and applied to the reserve which is classified as other liabilities.




	 




	For additional information on the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded loan commitments, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.









	Premises and Equipment




	 




	Land is carried at cost.  All other fixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The useful life of buildings is not to exceed


	30 years


	; furniture and fixtures is generally


	10 years


	 or less, and equipment is


	3


	 to


	5 years


	.  Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the life of the underlying lease. 




	 




	For additional information on premises and equipment, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 




	Bank Owned Life Insurance




	 




	The Company purchased life insurance policies on certain members of management.  Bank owned life insurance is recorded at its cash surrender value or the amount that can be realized.




	 




	Federal Home Loan Bank Stock




	 




	Federal law requires a member institution of the Federal Home Loan Bank system to hold stock of its district FHLB according to a predetermined formula.  The stock is carried at cost.  Management reviews the stock for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis in the stock.  The stock’s value is determined by the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines.  Management considers such criteria as the significance of the decline in net assets, if any, of the FHLB, the length of time this situation has persisted, commitments by the FHLB to make payments required by law or regulation, the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on the customer base of the FHLB and the liquidity position of the FHLB.




	 




	Other Real Estate Owned




	 




	Other real estate owned is recorded at the fair value, less estimated costs to sell at the date of acquisition, with a charge to the allowance for loan losses for any excess of the loan carrying value over such amount.  Subsequently, OREO is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, as determined by current appraisals.  Certain costs that increase the value or extend the useful life in preparing properties for sale are capitalized to the extent that the appraisal amount exceeds the carry value, and expenses of holding foreclosed properties are charged to operations as incurred.




	 


























	Appraisals




	 




	The Company requires current real estate appraisals on all loans that become OREO or in-substance foreclosure, loans that are classified substandard, doubtful or loss, or loans that are over $


	100,000


	 and nonperforming.  Prior to each balance sheet date, the Company values impaired collateral-dependent loans and OREO based upon a third party appraisal, broker's price opinion, drive by appraisal, automated valuation model, updated market evaluation, or a combination of these methods.  The amount is discounted for the decline in market real estate values (for original appraisals), for any known damage or repair costs, and for selling and closing costs.  The amount of the discount is dependent upon the method used to determine the original value.  The original appraisal is generally used when a loan is first determined to be impaired.  When applying the discount, the Company takes into consideration when the appraisal was performed, the collateral’s location, the type of collateral, any known damage to the property and the type of business.  Subsequent to entering impaired status and the Company determining that there is a collateral shortfall, the Company will generally, depending on the type of collateral, order a third party appraisal, broker's price opinion, automated valuation model or updated market evaluation.  Subsequent to receiving the third party results, the Company will discount the value


	6


	 to


	10 percent


	 for selling and closing costs.




	 




	Income Taxes




	 




	The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification


	("FASB ASC") Topic 740, “Income Taxes,”


	 which prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition of income taxes and provides criteria for the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  ASC 740 also includes guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition of income taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates applicable to taxable income for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  Valuation reserves are established against certain deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Increases or decreases in the valuation reserve are charged or credited to the income tax provision.









	When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that ultimately would be sustained.  The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.  The evaluation of a tax position taken is considered by itself and not offset or aggregated with other positions.  Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.  The portion of benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.




	 




	Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense on the income statement.




	 




	For additional information on income taxes, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 




	Net Income Per Share




	 




	Basic net income per common share is calculated as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the reporting period. 









	Diluted net income per common share is computed similarly to that of basic net income per common share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all potentially dilutive common shares, principally stock options, were issued during the reporting period utilizing the Treasury stock method.  However, when a net loss rather than net income is recognized, diluted earnings per share equals basic earnings per share.









	The amounts reported have been adjusted for the


	10%


	 stock dividend paid on September 30, 2016.




	 




	For additional information on net income per share, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 


























	Stock-Based Compensation




	 




	The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation awards in accordance with


	FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation,”


	 which requires recognition of compensation expense related to stock-based compensation awards over the period during which an employee is required to provide service for the award.  Compensation expense is equal to the fair value of the award, net of estimated forfeitures, and is recognized over the vesting period of such awards.




	 




	For additional information on the Company’s stock-based compensation, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 




	Fair Value




	 




	The Company follows


	FASB ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures,”


	 which provides a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles.




	 




	For additional information on the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 




	Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)




	 




	Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of the change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale that were reported as a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax.




	 




	For additional information on other comprehensive income, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




	 




	Advertising




	 




	The Company expenses the costs of advertising in the period incurred.




	 




	Dividend Restrictions




	 




	Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels that may limit the dividends paid by the Bank to the holding company or by the holding company to the shareholders.









	Operating Segments




	 




	While management monitors the revenue streams of its various products and services, operating results and financial performance are evaluated on a company-wide basis.  The Company’s management uses consolidated results to make operating and strategic decisions.  Accordingly, there is only


	one


	 reportable segment.




	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	 




	ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).”  ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Accounting Standards Codification. The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.




	 




	The accounting changes in this update have been revised to defer the effective date for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and the interim periods within that year.  The FASB has also issued clarification guidance as it relates to principal versus agent considerations for revenue recognition purposes and clarification guidance on other various considerations related to the new revenue recognition guidance. Additionally, during April 2016, the FASB issued further clarification guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing. Early adoption is permitted as of the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements.




	 


























	ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10) – Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.”  ASU 2016-01 addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.  This eliminates the available for sale classification of accounting for equity securities and adjusts the fair value disclosures for financial instruments carried at amortized cost such that the disclosed fair values represent an exit price as opposed to an entry price.  This update requires that equity securities be carried at fair value on the balance sheet and any periodic changes in value will be adjusted through the income statement.  A practical expedient is provided for equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, such that these securities can be carried at cost less any impairment.  For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard.




	 




	ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”. ASU 2016-02 was issued in three parts: (a)


	 Section A


	, “Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification®,” (b)


	 Section B


	, “Conforming Amendments Related to Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification®,” and (c)


	 Section C


	, “Background Information and Basis for Conclusions.” While both lessees and lessors are affected by the new guidance, the effects on lessees are much more significant.  The update states that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from all leases with a term greater than 12 months. The core principle requires the lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments and a "right-of-use" asset. The accounting applied by the lessor is relatively unchanged as the majority of operating leases should remain classified as operating leases and the income from them recognized, generally, on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The standards update also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures. For public business entities, ASC 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. ASC 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASC 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.









	ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." ASU 2016-09 was issued as part of FASB's simplification initiative as a result of its post-implementation review of FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Areas addressed include the accounting for income taxes, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is aimed at reducing the cost and complexity of accounting for share-based payments but will likely result in fluctuations in net income and earnings per share. Under this guidance all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to employee stock compensation will be recognized within income tax expense via a lower effective tax rate, versus previously being recognized in additional paid in capital. For public business entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has applied this change and the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements was immaterial.









	ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." ASU 2016-13 was issued to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with an expected credit loss methodology and requires consideration of a broader range of information to determine credit loss estimates. Financial assets measured at amortized cost will be presented at the net amount expected to be collected by using an allowance for credit losses. Purchased credit impaired loans will receive an allowance account at the acquisition date that represents a component of the purchase price allocation. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses, with such allowance limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. For public business entities, ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements.









	ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." ASU 2016-15 was issued to address diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics. This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments in this update provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues:













	•






	Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs
















	•






	Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing
















	•






	Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination
















	•






	Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims
















	•






	Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, include Bank-Owned Life Insurance Policies
















	•






	Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees
















	•






	Beneficial Interest in Securitization Transactions
















	•






	Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle







	The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoptions of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements.































	ASU 2016-18, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash." ASU 2016-18 was issued to address divergence in the way restricted cash is classified and presented. The amendments in the update require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during a reporting period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. The amendments in this update apply to entities that have restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents and are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230. The amendment says that transfers between cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents are not part of the entity's operating, investing, and financing activities. For public business entities, ASU 2016-18 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoptions of ASU 2016-18 on its consolidated financial statements.









	ASU 2017-04, "Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment." ASU 2017-04 was issued in an effort to simplify accounting in a new standard. The amendments in this update require that an entity perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The amendment states that an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. For public business entities, ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performing on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoptions of ASU 2017-04 on its consolidated financial statements.




	  




	Goodwill




	 




	The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance


	with FASB ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,”


	 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.  Based on a qualitative assessment, management determined that the Company’s recorded goodwill totaling $


	1.5 million


	, which resulted from the 2005 acquisition of its Phillipsburg, New Jersey branch, is not impaired as of


	December 31, 2016


	.

	  Restrictions on Cash




	 




	Federal law requires depository institutions to hold reserves in the form of vault cash or, if vault cash is insufficient, in the form of a deposit maintained with a Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”).  The dollar amount of a depository institution's reserve requirement is determined by applying the reserve ratios specified in the FRB’s Regulation D to an institution's reservable liabilities.  As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company required


	$15 thousand


	 of additional reserves to meet its reserve requirements. As of December 31,


	2015


	 the Company had sufficient vault cash to meet its reserve requirements and no additional reserves were required.




	 




	In addition, the Company’s contract with its current electronic funds transfer (“EFT”) provider requires a predetermined balance be maintained in a settlement account controlled by the provider equal to the Company’s average daily net settlement position multiplied by four days.  The required balance was $


	156 thousand


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	 compared to


	$179 thousand


	 at December 31,


	2015


	.  This balance can be adjusted periodically to reflect actual transaction volume and seasonal factors.

	Unrealized Losses




	 




	The unrealized losses in each of the categories presented in the tables above are discussed in the paragraphs that follow:




	 




	U.S. government sponsored entities and state and political subdivision securities:


	 The unrealized losses on investments in these types of securities were caused by the increase in interest rate spreads or the increase in interest rates at the long end of the Treasury curve. The contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the par value of the investments.  Because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity, the Company did not consider these investments to be other-than temporarily impaired as of


	December 31, 2016


	.  There was no other-than-temporary impairment on these securities at


	December 31, 2015


	.




	 


























	Residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities:  


	The unrealized losses on investments in mortgage-backed securities were caused by increases in interest rate spreads or the increase in interest rates at the long end of the Treasury curve.  The majority of contractual cash flows of these securities are guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC).  It is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price significantly less than the par value of the investment.  Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity, the Company did not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of 


	December 31, 2016


	 or


	December 31, 2015


	.




	 




	Corporate and other securities:


	 Included in this category are corporate debt securities, Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) investments, asset-backed securities, and one trust preferred security.  The unrealized losses on corporate debt securities were due to widening credit spreads or the increase in interest rates at the long end of the Treasury curve and the unrealized losses on CRA investments were caused by decreases in the market prices of the shares.  The Company evaluated the prospects of the issuers and forecasted a recovery period; and as a result determined it did not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of


	December 31, 2016


	 or


	December 31, 2015


	.  The unrealized loss on the trust preferred security was caused by an inactive trading market and changes in market credit spreads.  At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	, this category consisted of one single-issuer trust preferred security.  The contractual terms do not allow the security to be settled at a price less than the par value.  Because the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity, the Company did not consider this security to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of


	December 31, 2016


	 or


	December 31, 2015


	.

	Loans are made to individuals as well as commercial entities.  Specific loan terms vary as to interest rate, repayment, and collateral requirements based on the type of loan requested and the credit worthiness of the prospective borrower.  Credit risk, excluding SBA loans, tends to be geographically concentrated in that a majority of the loan customers are located in the markets serviced by the Bank.  As a preferred SBA lender, a portion of the SBA portfolio is to borrowers outside the Company’s lending area.  However, during late 2008, the Company withdrew from SBA lending outside of its primary trade area, but continues to offer SBA loan products as an additional credit product within its primary trade area.  Loan performance may be adversely affected by factors impacting the general economy or conditions specific to the real estate market such as geographic location and/or property type.  A description of the Company's different loan segments follows:




	 




	SBA Loans:


	  SBA 7(a) loans, on which the SBA has historically provided guarantees of up to 


	90 percent


	 of the principal balance, are considered a higher risk loan product for the Company than its other loan products.  The guaranteed portion of the Company’s SBA loans is generally sold in the secondary market with the nonguaranteed portion held in the portfolio as a loan held for investment.  SBA loans are for the purpose of providing working capital, financing the purchase of equipment, inventory or commercial real estate and for other business purposes.  Loans are guaranteed by the businesses' major owners.  SBA loans are made based primarily on the historical and projected cash flow of the business and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided.




	 




	SBA 504 Loans: 


	 The SBA 504 program consists of real estate backed commercial mortgages where the Company has the first mortgage and the SBA has the second mortgage on the property.  SBA 504 loans are made based primarily on the historical and projected cash flow of the business and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided.  Generally, the Company has a


	50 percent


	 loan to value ratio on SBA 504 program loans at origination.




	 




	Commercial Loans:


	  Commercial credit is extended primarily to middle market and small business customers.  Commercial loans are generally made in the Company’s market place for the purpose of providing working capital, financing the purchase of equipment, inventory or commercial real estate and for other business purposes.  Loans will generally be guaranteed in full or for a meaningful amount by the businesses' major owners.  Commercial loans are made based primarily on the historical and projected cash flow of the business and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided.




	 




	Residential


	 


	Mortgage and Consumer Loans: 


	 The Company originates mortgage and consumer loans including principally residential real estate, home equity lines and loans and consumer construction lines.  Each loan type is evaluated on debt to income, type of collateral and loan to collateral value, credit history and Company relationship with the borrower.




	 


























	Inherent in the lending function is credit risk, which is the possibility a borrower may not perform in accordance with the contractual terms of their loan.  A borrower’s inability to pay their obligations according to the contractual terms can create the risk of past due loans and, ultimately, credit losses, especially on collateral deficient loans.  The Company minimizes its credit risk by loan diversification and adhering to credit administration policies and procedures.  Due diligence on loans begins when the Company initiates contact regarding a loan with a borrower.  Documentation, including a borrower’s credit history, materials establishing the value and liquidity of potential collateral, the purpose of the loan, the source of funds for repayment of the loan, and other factors, are analyzed before a loan is submitted for approval.  The loan portfolio is then subject to on-going internal reviews for credit quality, as well as independent credit reviews by an outside firm.




	 




	The Company's extension of credit is governed by the Credit Risk Policy which was established to control the quality of the Company's loans.  These policies and procedures are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on a regular basis.




	 




	Credit Ratings




	 




	For SBA 7(a), SBA 504 and commercial loans, management uses internally assigned risk ratings as the best indicator of credit quality.  A loan’s internal risk rating is updated at least annually and more frequently if circumstances warrant a change in risk rating.  The Company uses a 1 through 10 loan grading system that follows regulatory accepted definitions.




	 




	Pass:  


	Risk ratings of 1 through 6 are used for loans that are performing, as they meet, and are expected to continue to meet, all of the terms and conditions set forth in the original loan documentation, and are generally current on principal and interest payments.  These performing loans are termed “Pass”.




	 




	Special Mention:  


	Criticized loans are assigned a risk rating of 7 and termed “Special Mention”, as the borrowers exhibit potential credit weaknesses or downward trends deserving management’s close attention.  If not checked or corrected, these trends will weaken the Bank’s collateral and position.  While potentially weak, these borrowers are currently marginally acceptable and no loss of interest or principal is anticipated.  As a result, special mention assets do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.  Included in “Special Mention” could be turnaround situations, such as borrowers with deteriorating trends beyond one year, borrowers in start up or deteriorating industries, or borrowers with a poor market share in an average industry.  "Special Mention" loans may include an element of asset quality, financial flexibility, or below average management.  Management and ownership may have limited depth or experience.  Regulatory agencies have agreed on a consistent definition of “Special Mention” as an asset with potential weaknesses which, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Bank’s credit position at some future date.  This definition is intended to ensure that the “Special Mention” category is not used to identify assets that have as their sole weakness credit data exceptions or collateral documentation exceptions that are not material to the repayment of the asset.




	 




	Substandard: 


	 Classified loans are assigned a risk rating of an 8 or 9, depending upon the prospect for collection, and deemed “Substandard”.  A risk rating of 8 is used for borrowers with well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the orderly liquidation of debt.  The loan is inadequately protected by the current paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any.  Normal repayment from the borrower is in jeopardy, although no loss of principal is envisioned.  There is a distinct possibility that a partial loss of interest and/or principal will occur if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified “Substandard”.  




	 




	A risk rating of 9 is used for borrowers that have all the weaknesses inherent in a loan with a risk rating of 8, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection of debt in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.  Serious problems exist to the point where partial loss of principal is likely.  The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important, reasonably specific pending factors that may work to strengthen the assets, the loans’ classification as estimated losses is deferred until a more exact status may be determined.  Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures; capital injection; perfecting liens on additional collateral; and refinancing plans.  Partial charge-offs are likely.




	 




	Loss: 


	 Once a borrower is deemed incapable of repayment of unsecured debt, the risk rating becomes a 10, the loan is termed a “Loss”, and charged-off immediately.  Loans to such borrowers are considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as active assets of the Bank is not warranted.  This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off these basically worthless assets even though partial recovery may be affected in the future.




	 


























	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, management uses performing versus nonperforming as the best indicator of credit quality.  Nonperforming loans consist of loans that are not accruing interest (nonaccrual loans) as a result of principal or interest being delinquent for a period of 90 days or more or when the ability to collect principal and interest according to the contractual terms is in doubt.  These credit quality indicators are updated on an ongoing basis, as a loan is placed on nonaccrual status as soon as management believes there is sufficient doubt as to the ultimate ability to collect interest on a loan.

	Nonperforming and Past Due Loans




	 




	Nonperforming loans consist of loans that are not accruing interest (nonaccrual loans) as a result of principal or interest being delinquent for a period of 90 days or more or when the ability to collect principal and interest according to the contractual terms is in doubt.  Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest are not included in nonperforming loans and generally represent loans that are well collateralized and in a continuing process expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status.  The risk of loss is difficult to quantify and is subject to fluctuations in collateral values, general economic conditions and other factors.  The improved state of the economy has resulted in a substantial reduction in nonperforming loans and loan delinquencies.  The Company values its collateral through the use of appraisals, broker price opinions, and knowledge of its local market.  In response to the credit risk in its portfolio, the Company has increased staffing in its credit monitoring department and increased efforts in the collection and analysis of borrowers’ financial statements and tax returns.

	.  The average balances are calculated based on the month-end balances of impaired loans.  When the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan is in doubt and the loan is on nonaccrual status, all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method, therefore no interest income is recognized.  The interest recognized on impaired loans noted below represents accruing troubled debt restructurings only and nominal amounts of income recognized on a cash basis for well-collateralized impaired loans.

	Troubled Debt Restructurings




	 




	The Company's loan portfolio includes certain loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”).  TDRs occur when a creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor’s financial condition, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider, unless it results in a delay in payment that is insignificant.  These concessions typically include reductions in interest rate, extending the maturity of a loan, other modifications of payment terms, or a combination of modifications.  When the Company modifies a loan, management evaluates for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method, where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if the loan is collateral-dependent.  If management determines that the value of the modified loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized by segment or class of loan, as applicable, through an allowance estimate or charge-off to the allowance.  This process is used, regardless of loan type, and for loans modified as TDRs that subsequently default on their modified terms.




	 




	TDRs of 


	$153 thousand


	 and 


	$3.3 million


	 are included in the impaired loan numbers as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	, respectively. At


	December 31, 2016


	, there were specific reserves of


	$34 thousand




	on the nonperforming TDR. At


	December 31, 2015


	, there were specific reserves of


	$208 thousand


	 on TDRS,


	$167 thousand


	 on performing TDRs and


	$41 thousand


	 on nonperforming TDRs.  At


	December 31, 2016


	,


	$153 thousand


	 of TDRs were in nonaccrual status, compared to


	$293 thousand


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	.  The decrease during the twelve month period was primarily due to the payoff of five loans and principal paydowns.  As of December 31, 2016, there are no TDRs in accrual status.  There are


	no


	 commitments to lend additional funds on these loans. 




	 




	There were

	 loans modified as a TDR during the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	 or


	2015


	. To date, the Company’s TDRs consisted of interest rate reductions, interest only periods, and maturity extensions.  There has been no principal forgiveness. There were


	no


	 loans modified as a TDR within the previous 12 months that subsequently defaulted at some point during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015. In this case, the subsequent default is defined as 90 days past due or transferred to nonaccrual status.




	 




	Other Loan Information




	 




	Servicing Assets:




	Loans sold to others and serviced by the Company are not included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The total amount of such loans serviced, but owned by outside investors, amounted to approximately


	$137.8 million


	 and


	$118.1 million




	at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.  At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, the carrying value, which approximates fair value, of servicing assets was


	$2.1 million


	 and


	$1.4 million


	, respectively, and is included in Other Assets.  The fair value of SBA servicing assets was determined using a discount rate of


	15 percent


	, constant prepayment speeds ranging from


	15%


	 to


	18%


	, and interest strip multiples ranging from


	2.08%


	 to


	3.80%


	, depending on each individual credit.  The fair value of mortgage servicing assets was determined using a discount rate of


	12 percent


	 and the present value of excess servicing over


	7 years


	.  A summary of the changes in the related servicing assets for the past two years follows:

	Loan Portfolio Collateral:




	The majority of the Company’s loans are secured by real estate.  Declines in the market values of real estate in the Company’s trade area impact the value of the collateral securing its loans.  This could lead to greater losses in the event of defaults on loans secured by real estate.  At both


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, approximately


	96 percent


	 of the Company’s loan portfolio was secured by real estate.




	 








	5. Allowance for Loan Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments




	 




	Allowance for Loan Losses




	 




	The Company has an established methodology to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that assesses the risks and losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  At a minimum, the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed by management on a quarterly basis.  For purposes of determining the allowance for loan losses, the Company has segmented the loans in its portfolio by loan type.  Loans are segmented into the following pools: SBA 7(a), SBA 504, commercial, residential mortgages, and consumer loans.  Certain portfolio segments are further broken down into classes based on the associated risks within those segments and the type of collateral underlying each loan.  Commercial loans are divided into the following three classes: commercial real estate, commercial real estate construction and commercial other.  Consumer loans are divided into two classes as follows:  Home equity and other.




	 




	The standardized methodology used to assess the adequacy of the allowance includes the allocation of specific and general reserves.  The same standard methodology is used, regardless of loan type.  Specific reserves are made to individual impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings (see Note 1 for additional information on this term).  The general reserve is set based upon a representative average historical net charge-off rate adjusted for the following environmental factors: delinquency and impairment trends, charge-off and recovery trends, changes in the volume of restructured loans, volume and loan term trends, changes in risk and underwriting policy trends, staffing and experience changes, national and local economic trends, industry conditions and credit concentration changes.  Within the five-year historical net charge-off rate, the Company weights the past three years more because it believes they are more indicative of future losses.  All of the environmental factors are ranked and assigned a basis points value based on the following scale: low, low moderate, moderate, high moderate and high risk.  Each environmental factor is evaluated separately for each class of loans and risk weighted based on its individual characteristics. 




	 













	•






	For SBA 7(a), SBA 504 and commercial loans, the estimate of loss based on pools of loans with similar characteristics is made through the use of a standardized loan grading system that is applied on an individual loan level and updated on a continuous basis.  The loan grading system incorporates reviews of the financial performance of the borrower, including cash flow, debt-service coverage ratio, earnings power, debt level and equity position, in conjunction with an assessment of the borrower's industry and future prospects.  It also incorporates analysis of the type of collateral and the relative loan to value ratio.
















	•






	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, the estimate of loss is based on pools of loans with similar characteristics.  Factors such as credit score, delinquency status and type of collateral are evaluated.  Factors are updated frequently to capture the recent behavioral characteristics of the subject portfolios, as well as any changes in loss mitigation or credit origination strategies, and adjustments to the reserve factors are made as needed. 







	 




	According to the Company’s policy, a loss (“charge-off”) is to be recognized and charged to the allowance for loan losses as soon as a loan is recognized as uncollectable.  All credits which are 90 days past due must be analyzed for the Company’s ability to collect on the credit.  Once a loss is known to exist, the charge-off approval process is immediately expedited.  This charge-off policy is followed for all loan types.




	 


























	The allocated allowance is the total of identified specific and general reserves by loan category.  The allocation is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future losses may occur.  The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio.  An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses.









	The following tables detail the activity in the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment for the past two years:

	Changes in Methodology:




	The Company did not make any changes to its allowance for loan losses methodology in the current period.




	 




	Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments




	 




	In addition to the allowance for loan losses, the Company maintains a reserve for unfunded loan commitments at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb estimated probable losses.  Adjustments to the reserve are made through other expense and applied to the reserve which is classified as other liabilities.  At


	December 31, 2016


	, a $


	181 thousand


	 commitment reserve was reported on the balance sheet as an “other liability”, compared to a $


	138 thousand


	 commitment reserve at


	December 31, 2015


	.  There were


	no


	 losses on unfunded loan commitments during


	2016


	 or


	2015


	.

	Subordinated Debentures




	 




	At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, the Company was a party in the following subordinated debenture transactions:




	 













	•






	On July 24, 2006, Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust II, a statutory business trust and wholly-owned subsidiary of Unity Bancorp, Inc., issued


	$10.0 million


	 of floating rate capital trust pass through securities to investors due on


	July 24, 2036


	.  The subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or part, prior to maturity but after July 24, 2011.  The floating interest rate on the subordinated debentures is the three-month LIBOR plus


	159


	 basis points and reprices quarterly.  The floating interest rate was


	2.59 percent


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2.18 percent


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	. This has been swapped to a 3 year fixed rate borrowing at


	0.885%


	.
















	•






	On December 19, 2006, Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust III, a statutory business trust and wholly-owned subsidiary of Unity Bancorp, Inc., issued


	$5.0 million


	 of floating rate capital trust pass through securities to investors due on


	December 19, 2036


	.  On February 26, 2016, Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust III, repurchased the $


	5.0 million


	 of floating rate securities, and redeemed


	$155 thousand


	 of the related common equity securities described below.  The subordinated debentures were repurchased at a price of


	$0.5475


	 per dollar, which resulted in a gain of


	$2.3 million


	. The floating interest rate was


	2.06 percent


	 at February 26, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
















	•






	In connection with the formation of the statutory business trusts, the trusts also issued


	$465 thousand


	 of common equity securities to the Company, which together with the proceeds stated above were used to purchase the subordinated debentures, under the same terms and conditions. At December 31, 2016,


	$310 thousand


	 of the common equity securities remained.







	 




	The capital securities in each of the above transactions have preference over the common securities with respect to liquidation and other distributions and qualify as Tier I capital.  Under the terms of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, these securities will continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital as the Company has less than


	$10 billion


	 in assets.  In accordance with


	FASB ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation,”


	 the Company does not consolidate the accounts and related activity of Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust II and Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust III because it is not the primary beneficiary.  The additional capital from each of these transactions was used to bolster the Company’s capital ratios and for general corporate purposes, including among other things, capital contributions to the Bank.




	 




	The Company has the ability to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures for up to


	5 years


	 without being in default.  Due to the redemption provisions of these securities, the expected maturity could differ from the contractual maturity.




	 




	On September 1, 2006, Unity Bank issued an


	$8.5 million


	 unsecured, subordinated Capital Note in favor of the Company in exchange for


	$8.5 million


	 in cash.  The Capital Note is held by the Company for its own account until maturity on


	August 17, 2031


	.  The interest rate on the Capital Note is


	8.75%


	 per annum on the unpaid principal amount until the principal amount of the Capital Note has been satisfied in full. The Capital Note was paid in full in July 2016.

	The Company has a stand alone derivative financial instrument in the form of an interest rate swap agreement, which derives its value from underlying interest rates.  This transaction involves both credit and market risk.  The notional amounts are amounts on which calculations, payments, and the value of the derivative is based.  Notional amounts do not represent direct credit exposures.  Direct credit exposure is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid, if any.  Such difference, which represents the fair value of the derivative instrument, is reflected on the Company’s balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities.




	 


























	The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to this agreement.  The Company controls the credit risk of its financial contracts through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures, and does not expect any counterparties to fail their obligations.  The Company deals only with primary dealers.




	 




	Derivative instruments are generally either negotiated OTC contracts or standardized contracts executed on a recognized exchange.  Negotiated OTC derivative contracts are generally entered into between two counterparties that negotiate specific agreement terms, including the underlying instrument, amount, exercise prices and maturity.




	 




	Risk Management Policies – Hedging Instruments




	The primary focus of the Company’s asset/liability management program is to monitor the sensitivity of the Company’s net portfolio value and net income under varying interest rate scenarios to take steps to control its risks.  On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the effectiveness of entering into any derivative agreement by measuring the cost of such an agreement in relation to the reduction in net portfolio value and net income volatility within an assumed range of interest rates.




	 




	Interest Rate Risk Management – Cash Flow Hedging Instruments




	The Company has FHLB Adjustable Rate Credit (“ARC”) variable rate debt as a source of funds for use in the Company’s lending and investment activities and for other general business purposes.  These debt obligations expose the Company to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates.  If interest rates increase, interest expense increases.  Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest expense decreases.  Management believes it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of its interest payments and, therefore hedges its variable-rate interest payments.  To meet this objective, management enters into interest rate swap agreements whereby the Company receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed interest rate payments during the contract period.




	 




	During the twelve months ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, the Company received variable rate Libor payments from and paid fixed rates in accordance with its interest rate swap agreements.  A summary of the Company’s outstanding interest rate swap agreements used to hedge variable rate debt at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively is as follows:

	At December 31, 2016, the unrealized gains relating to interest rate swaps was recorded as an other asset. At December 31, 2015, the unrealized losses relating to interest rate swaps was recorded as an other liability.  Changes in the fair value of interest rate swap designated as hedging instruments of the variability of cash flows associated with long-term debt are reported in other comprehensive income.

	Facility Lease Obligations




	 




	The Company operates


	seventeen


	 branches,


	three


	 branches are under operating leases and


	fourteen


	 branches are owned. The contractual expiration range on the remaining three leases is between the years 2018 and 2022.

	2016


	 and


	$732 thousand


	 for


	2015


	.  The Company currently accounts for all of its leases as operating leases.  The annual rent is increased each year beginning January 1,


	2017


	 by the increase in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) for the New York Metropolitan area (not to exceed


	1.5 percent


	). In March 2016, the Company purchased its headquarters for


	$4.1 million


	.




	 


























	Litigation




	 




	The Company may, in the ordinary course of business, become a party to litigation involving collection matters, contract claims and other legal proceedings relating to the conduct of its business.  In the best judgment of management, based upon consultation with counsel, the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the Company will not be affected materially by the final outcome of any pending legal proceedings or other contingent liabilities and commitments.




	 




	Commitments to Borrowers




	 




	Commitments to extend credit are legally binding loan commitments with set expiration dates.  They are intended to be disbursed, subject to certain conditions, upon the request of the borrower.  The Company was committed to advance approximately


	$181.1 million


	 to its borrowers as of


	December 31, 2016


	, compared to


	$138.3 million


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	.  At


	December 31, 2016


	,


	$23.5 million


	 of these commitments expire within one year, compared to


	$51.3 million


	 a year earlier.  At


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had


	$4.1 million


	 in standby letters of credit compared to


	$1.8 million


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	.  The estimated fair value of these guarantees is not significant.  The Company believes it has the necessary liquidity to honor all commitments.

	 compared to $


	78.5 million


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	, due primarily to


	$14.4 million


	 in additional capital as a result of the completion of the capital offering on December 8, 2016 for


	1,068,400


	 shares at a weighted average price of


	$14.04


	 and net income of


	$13.2 million


	. Other items impacting shareholders’ equity included


	$1.5 million

	Repurchase Plan




	 




	On October 21, 2002, the Company authorized the repurchase of up to


	10 percent


	 of its outstanding common stock.  The amount and timing of purchases is dependent upon a number of factors, including the price and availability of the Company’s shares, general market conditions and competing alternate uses of funds.  As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had repurchased a total of


	556 thousand


	 shares, of which


	131 thousand


	 shares have been retired, leaving


	153 thousand


	 shares remaining to be repurchased under the plan.  There were

	The Company computes deferred income taxes under the asset and liability method.  Deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences of “temporary differences” by applying enacted statutory tax rates to differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities.  A deferred tax liability is recognized for all temporary differences that will result in future taxable income.  A deferred tax asset is recognized for all temporary differences that will result in future tax deductions subject to reduction of the asset by a valuation allowance.




	 




	The Company had a


	$123 thousand


	 and


	$139 thousand


	 valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to its state net operating loss carry-forward deferred tax asset at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.  The Company’s state net operating loss carry-forwards totaled approximately


	$2.1 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 and expire between 2030 and 2036.




	 




	Included as a component of deferred tax assets is an income tax expense (benefit) related to unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale, a supplemental retirement plan (SERP) and an interest rate swap.  The after-tax component of each of these is included in other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.  The after-tax component related to securities available for sale was an unrealized loss of


	$161 thousand


	 and


	$2 thousand


	 for


	2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.  The after-tax component related to the SERP was an unrealized loss of


	$391 thousand


	 for


	2016


	, compared to


	$448 thousand

	2015


	. The after-tax component related to the interest rate swap was an unrealized gain of

	 for


	2016


	, compared to an unrealized loss of


	$17 thousand

	The Company follows


	FASB ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,”


	 which prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition of income taxes and provides criteria for the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  ASC 740 also includes guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition of income taxes.  The Company did not recognize or accrue any interest or penalties related to income taxes during the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	.  The Company does not have an accrual for uncertain tax positions as of


	December 31, 2016


	 or


	2015


	, as deductions taken and benefits accrued are based on widely understood administrative practices and procedures and are based on clear and unambiguous tax law.  Tax returns for all years


	2012


	 and thereafter are subject to future examination by tax authorities.

	17.  Regulatory Capital




	 




	A significant measure of the strength of a financial institution is its capital base. Federal regulators have classified and defined capital into the following components: (1) tier 1 capital, which includes tangible shareholders’ equity for common stock, qualifying preferred stock and certain qualifying hybrid instruments, and (2) tier 2 capital, which includes a portion of the allowance for loan losses, subject to limitations, certain qualifying long-term debt, preferred stock and hybrid instruments, which do not qualify for tier 1 capital. The Parent Company and its subsidiary Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators. Quantitative measures of capital adequacy include the leverage ratio (tier 1 capital as a percentage of tangible assets), tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (tier 1 capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets), total risk-based capital ratio (total risk-based capital as a percent of total risk-weighted assets), and common equity tier 1 capital ratio.




	 




	Minimum capital levels are regulated by risk-based capital adequacy guidelines, which require the Company and the Bank to maintain certain capital as a percentage of assets and certain off-balance sheet items adjusted for predefined credit risk factors (risk-weighted assets). Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action applicable to banks, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies.




	 




	In September 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, adopted Basel III, which constitutes a set of capital reform measures designed to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of banking organizations worldwide. In order to implement Basel III and certain additional capital changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC approved, as an interim final rule in July 2013, the regulatory capital requirements substantially similar to final rules issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) for U.S. state nonmember banks and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for national banks.




	 




	The interim final rule includes new risk-based capital and leverage ratios that will be phased-in from 2015 to 2019 for most state nonmember banks. The rule includes a new common equity Tier 1 capital (“CET1”) to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the Tier 1 and Total risk-based capital requirements. The interim final rule also raises the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% and requires a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. The required minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets will remain 8.0%. The new risk-based capital requirements (except for the capital conservation buffer) became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015.









	The new rules also include a one-time opportunity to opt-out of the changes to treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) components. By making the election to opt-out, the institution may continue treating AOCI items in a manner consistent with risk-based capital rules in place prior to January 2015. The Bank and the Company have made the election to opt out of the treatment of AOCI on the appropriate March 31, 2015 filings.




	 


























	In addition to the risk-based guidelines, regulators require that a bank or holding company, which meets the regulator’s highest performance and operation standards, maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 percent. For those institutions with higher levels of risk or that are experiencing or anticipating significant growth, the minimum leverage ratio will be proportionately increased. Minimum leverage ratios for each institution are evaluated through the ongoing regulatory examination process.




	 




	The capital ratios for Company and the Bank under the new capital framework are presented in the table below, on the dates indicated.

	401(k) Savings Plan




	 




	The Bank has a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all employees.  Under the Plan, an employee can contribute up to


	80 percent


	 of their salary on a tax deferred basis.  The Bank may also make discretionary contributions to the Plan.  The Bank contributed


	$388 thousand


	 and


	$312 thousand


	 to the Plan in


	2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.




	 




	Deferred Fee Plan




	 




	The Company has a deferred fee plan for Directors and executive management.  Directors of the Company have the option to elect to defer up to


	100 percent


	 of their respective retainer and Board of Director fees, and each member of executive management has the option to elect to defer


	100 percent


	 of their year end cash bonuses.  Director and executive deferred fees totaled


	$120 thousand


	 in


	2016


	 and


	$38 thousand


	 in


	2015


	, and the interest paid on deferred balances totaled


	$34 thousand


	 in


	2016


	 and


	$26 thousand


	 in


	2015


	.


	No


	 fees were distributed in


	2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.




	 




	Benefit Plans




	 




	In addition to the 401(k) savings plan which covers substantially all employees, the Company established in 2015 an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan to provide additional retirement benefits for the President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan to provide additional retirement benefits for key executives.




	 




	On June 4, 2015, the Company approved the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”) pursuant to which the President and CEO is entitled to receive certain supplemental nonqualified retirement benefits.  Effective November 21, 2016, the Company amended Section 10.6 of the SERP which defines the retirement benefit calculation. Upon separation from service after age 66, Mr. Hughes will be entitled to an annual benefit in an amount equal to forty (


	40


	) percent of the average of his base salary for the thirty-six months immediately preceding his separation from service for reasons other than Cause. The retirement benefit shall be adjusted annually thereafter by two (


	2


	) percent. The maximum number of annual payments to Mr. Hughes shall be fifteen (


	15


	).




	 




	The President and CEO commenced vesting to this retirement benefit on January 1, 2014, and shall vest an additional


	3%


	 each year until fully vested on January 1, 2024. In the event that the President and CEO’s separation from service from the Registrant were to occur prior to full vesting, the President and CEO would be entitled to and shall be paid the vested portion of the retirement benefit calculated as of the date of separation from service.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon a Change in Control, and provided that within 6 months following the Change in Control the President and CEO is involuntary terminated for reasons other than “cause” or the President and CEO resigns for “good reason”, as such is defined in the SERP, or the President and CEO voluntarily terminates his employment after being offered continued employment in a positions that is not a “Comparable Position”, as such is also defined in the SERP, the President and CEO shall become


	100%


	 vested in the full retirement benefit.




	 


























	No contributions or payments have been made for the year


	2016


	 or

	On October 22, 2015, the Company entered into an Executive Incentive Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) with key executive officers. The Plan has an effective date of January 1, 2015.




	 




	The Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan.  For any Plan Year, a guaranteed annual Deferral Award percentage of seven and one half percent (


	7.5%


	) of the participant’s annual base salary shall be credited to each Participant’s Deferred Benefit Account. A discretionary annual Deferral Award equal to seven and one half percent (


	7.5%


	) of the participant’s annual base salary may be credited to the Participant’s account in addition to the guaranteed Deferral Award, if the Bank exceeds the benchmarks set forth in the Annual Executive Bonus Matrix. The total Deferral Award shall never exceed fifteen percent (


	15%


	) for any given Plan Year. Each Participant shall be immediately one hundred percent (


	100%


	) vested in all Deferral Awards as of the date they are awarded.




	 




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the company had total expenses of $


	30 thousand


	, compared to $


	150 thousand


	 for the prior year.  The Plan is reflected on the Company’s balance sheet as accrued expenses.




	 




	Certain members of management are also enrolled in a split-dollar life insurance plan with a post retirement death benefit of


	$250 thousand


	.  Total expenses related to this plan were


	$5 thousand


	 in


	2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.




	 








	19.  Fair Value




	 




	Fair Value Measurement




	 




	The Company follows


	FASB ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures,”


	 which requires additional disclosures about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.  Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  In determining fair value, the Company uses various methods including market, income and cost approaches.  Based on these approaches, the Company often utilizes certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and/or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.  These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable inputs.  The Company utilizes techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values.  Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed as follows:




	 


























	Level 1 Inputs













	•






	Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
















	•






	Generally, this includes debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market (i.e. New York Stock Exchange), as well as certain U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government and sponsored entity agency mortgage-backed securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets.







	 




	Level 2 Inputs













	•






	Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. 
















	•






	Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets.
















	•






	Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for the term of the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, credit risks, prepayment speeds or volatilities) or “market corroborated inputs.”
















	•






	Generally, this includes U.S. Government and sponsored entity mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities and derivative contracts.












	Level 3 Inputs













	•






	Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable (i.e. supported by little or no market activity) and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
















	•






	These assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.







	 




	Fair Value on a Recurring Basis




	 




	The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis:




	 




	Securities Available for Sale




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the fair value of the Company's AFS securities portfolio was


	$40.6 million


	.  Approximately




	53 percent


	 of the portfolio was made up of residential mortgage-backed securities, which had a fair value of


	$21.6 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	.  Approximately


	$20.9 million


	 of the residential mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA"), the Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA") or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC").  The underlying loans for these securities are residential mortgages that are geographically dispersed throughout the United States. 




	 




	All of the Company’s AFS securities were classified as Level 2 assets at


	December 31, 2016


	.  The valuation of AFS securities using Level 2 inputs was primarily determined using the market approach, which uses quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and all other relevant information.  It includes model pricing, defined as valuing securities based upon their relationship with other benchmark securities. 




	 




	There were no changes in the inputs or methodologies used to determine fair value during the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, as compared to the year ended


	December 31, 2015


	.

	Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis




	 




	Certain assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).  The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:




	 




	Appraisal Policy




	All appraisals must be performed in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (“USPAP”).  Appraisals are certified to the Company and performed by appraisers on the Company’s approved list of appraisers.  Evaluations are completed by a person independent of Company management.  The content of the appraisal depends on the complexity of the property.  Appraisals are completed on a “retail value” and an “as is value”.









	The Company requires current real estate appraisals on all loans that become OREO or in-substance foreclosure, loans that are classified substandard, doubtful or loss, or loans that are over


	$100,000


	 and nonperforming.  Prior to each balance sheet date, the Company values impaired collateral-dependent loans and OREO based upon a third party appraisal, broker's price opinion, drive by appraisal, automated valuation model, updated market evaluation, or a combination of these methods.  The amount is discounted for the decline in market real estate values (for original appraisals), for any known damage or repair costs, and for selling and closing costs.  The amount of the discount ranges from


	10


	 to


	15


	 percent and is dependent upon the method used to determine the original value.  The original appraisal is generally used when a loan is first determined to be impaired.  When applying the discount, the Company takes into consideration when the appraisal was performed, the collateral’s location, the type of collateral, any known damage to the property and the type of business.  Subsequent to entering impaired status and the Company determining that there is a collateral shortfall, the Company will generally, depending on the type of collateral, order a third party appraisal, broker's price opinion, automated valuation model or updated market evaluation.  Subsequent to receiving the third party results, the Company will discount the value


	6%


	 to


	10%


	 percent for selling and closing costs.




	 




	OREO




	The fair value was determined using appraisals, which may be discounted based on management’s review and changes in market conditions (Level 3 Inputs).  




	 


























	 


	Impaired Collateral-Dependent Loans




	The fair value of impaired collateral-dependent loans is derived in accordance with


	FASB ASC Topic 310, “Receivables.” 


	 Fair value is determined based on the loan’s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral.  Partially charged-off loans are measured for impairment based upon an appraisal for collateral-dependent loans.  When an updated appraisal is received for a nonperforming loan, the value on the appraisal is discounted in the manner discussed above.  If there is a deficiency in the value after the Company applies these discounts, management applies a specific reserve and the loan remains in nonaccrual status.  The receipt of an updated appraisal would not qualify as a reason to put a loan back into accruing status.  The Company removes loans from nonaccrual status when the borrower makes six months of contractual payments and demonstrates the ability to service the debt going forward.  Charge-offs are determined based upon the loss that management believes the Company will incur after evaluating collateral for impairment based upon the valuation methods described above and the ability of the borrower to pay any deficiency.




	 




	The valuation allowance for impaired loans is included in the allowance for loan losses in the consolidated balance sheets.  At


	December 31, 2016


	, the valuation allowance for impaired loans was


	$280 thousand


	, a decrease of


	$562 thousand


	 from


	$842 thousand


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	.

	Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	 




	FASB ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,”


	 requires the disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including those financial instruments for which the Company did not elect the fair value option.  These estimated fair values as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	 have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.  Considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop estimates of fair value.  The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange.  The use of alternative market assumptions and estimation methodologies could have had a material effect on these estimates of fair value.  The methodology for estimating the fair value of financial assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis are discussed above.  




	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of other financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:




	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	For these short-term instruments, the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.




	 




	Securities




	The fair value of securities is based upon quoted market prices for similar or identical assets or other observable inputs (Level 2) or externally developed models that use unobservable inputs due to limited or no market activity of the instrument (Level 3).




	 




	SBA Loans Held for Sale




	The fair value of SBA loans held for sale is estimated by using a market approach that includes significant other observable inputs.




	 




	Loans




	The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current market rates that reflect the interest rate risk inherent in the loan, except for previously discussed impaired loans.




	 


























	Federal Home Loan Bank Stock




	Federal Home Loan Bank stock is carried at cost.  Carrying value approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions of the issues.




	 




	Servicing Assets




	Servicing assets do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices.  The Company estimates the fair value of servicing assets using discounted cash flow models incorporating numerous assumptions from the perspective of a market participant including market discount rates and prepayment speeds.




	 




	Accrued Interest




	The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value.




	 




	Deposit Liabilities




	The fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e. carrying value).  The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current market rates.




	 




	Borrowed Funds and Subordinated Debentures




	The fair value of borrowings is estimated by discounting the projected future cash flows using current market rates.




	 






	Standby Letters of Credit




	At


	December 31, 2016


	, the Bank had standby letters of credit outstanding of


	$4.1 million


	, as compared to


	$1.8 million


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	.  The fair value of these commitments is nominal.









	The table below presents the carrying amount and estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments not previously presented as of December 31
