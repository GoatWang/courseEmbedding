History[edit]
Founded in 1996,[2] Stamps.com was created under the name StampMaster by Jim McDermott, Ari Engelberg and Jeff Green, who at the time were MBA graduate students at UCLA.[3][4] StampMaster was among the first companies to obtain USPS approval for beta testing and introducing Internet postage to the market.

History[edit]
Founded in 1996,[2] Stamps.com was created under the name StampMaster by Jim McDermott, Ari Engelberg and Jeff Green, who at the time were MBA graduate students at UCLA.[3][4] StampMaster was among the first companies to obtain USPS approval for beta testing and introducing Internet postage to the market. The Postal Service began announcing proposals for digital delivery of postage in 1996.[5]
Stamps.com finished its Series A funding in February 1998 with $1.5 million. Series B funding followed in August 1998 with $4.52 million.[6] It had its last round of private financing in February 1999,[7] generating an additional $30 million[6] from investors including former Postmaster General, Marvin Runyon.[5] The company went public in June of the same year[4][8] and raised $55 million in its IPO.[6] Less than six months after its IPO, the company had its secondary public offering.[7] In August 1999, the Postal Service granted permission for Stamps.com to sell its service nationally.[5] Stamps.com purchased IShip.com, a company that compared prices of shipping services, for $305 million in stock or eight million shares, in October 1999.[9][10]

History[edit]
Founded in 1996,[2] Stamps.com was created under the name StampMaster by Jim McDermott, Ari Engelberg and Jeff Green, who at the time were MBA graduate students at UCLA.[3][4] StampMaster was among the first companies to obtain USPS approval for beta testing and introducing Internet postage to the market. The Postal Service began announcing proposals for digital delivery of postage in 1996.[5]
Stamps.com finished its Series A funding in February 1998 with $1.5 million. Series B funding followed in August 1998 with $4.52 million.[6] It had its last round of private financing in February 1999,[7] generating an additional $30 million[6] from investors including former Postmaster General, Marvin Runyon.[5] The company went public in June of the same year[4][8] and raised $55 million in its IPO.[6] Less than six months after its IPO, the company had its secondary public offering.[7] In August 1999, the Postal Service granted permission for Stamps.com to sell its service nationally.[5] Stamps.com purchased IShip.com, a company that compared prices of shipping services, for $305 million in stock or eight million shares, in October 1999.[9][10]
In 2001, Stamps.com named Ken McBride its CEO.[11] The U.S. Postal Service authorized the first market test of PhotoStamps in 2004.[12] In 2005, the company reported $10.4 million in net income.[11] PhotoStamps was re-launched in May 2005 for another year-long test run.[13] The United States Congress amended a law in January 2006 that had prohibited attaching business advertising to postage, effective in May of that year, which cleared the way for businesses to use PhotoStamps.[12] In September 2006, the company launched Photo NetStamps, which combined its previous NetStamps product with PhotoStamps. This combination allowed PhotoStamps to be used with exact postage printed from Stamps.com software.[14] By 2008, Stamps.com had more than 300,000 customers.[15] The company recorded revenues of $38.6 million in 2012.[11]
By 2013, it had approximately 465,000 registered customers.[2] Stamps.com reported $147.3 million in revenue the following year.[16] It acquired ShipStation, a web-based multi-carrier shipping solution based in Austin, Texas, in June 2014 for $50 million and up to 768,900 shares of stock. ShipStation was founded in 2010 and creates tools to import orders from shopping cart platforms for order fulfillment The acquisition made ShipStation an independent subsidiary of Stamps.com operated by its existing management team.[17] In October that same year, Stamps.com acquired ShipWorks, a multi-carrier shipping software company that integrates with shopping cart platforms, for $22 million. ShipWorks continues to operate as an independent, wholly owned subsidiary.[18]
In March 2015, Stamps.com entered into an agreement to acquire Endicia, another internet postage company, from Newell Rubbermaid for approximately $215 million.[19][20] Endicia's products include the DYMO Stamps and PictureItPostage brands.[19]
On June 20, 2016, Stamps.com announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase ShippingEasy, Inc., an Austin, Texas-based company which offers web-based multi-carrier shipping software that allows online retailers and e-commerce merchants to organize, process, fulfill and ship their orders. Stamps.com agreed to acquire ShippingEasy for $55 million in cash, as well as performance-linked equity awards of 87,000 shares of Stamps.com's common stock.[21]
Products[edit]
Online postage[edit]




USPS First Class Package International via stamps.com


Stamps.com's service is a way for small businesses, enterprises and online retailers to print official United States Postal Service stamps and shipping labels with their computer, printer and an Internet connection. Stamps.com sends customers a digital scale to weigh letters and packages to ensure the correct amount of postage is applied to the piece of mail. The amount of postage applied is then deducted from the customer's Stamps.com account. Customers can print postage on envelopes, regular paper or adhesive labels. The system integrates with external address books applications including Outlook and Act!, small business applications such as Microsoft Word and Intuit's QuickBooks, and e-commerce platforms such as eBay and Amazon.com.[22]
PhotoStamps[edit]
Stamps.com also offers a product called PhotoStamps that allows customers to upload personal photographs or logos to be printed on real U.S. postage stamps. PhotoStamps are sold as a sheet of 20 postage stamps.[23]




Stamps.com Corporate headquarters. Los Angeles, California.


Controversy[edit]
While The Smoking Gun successfully ordered PhotoStamps with controversial images,[24] Stamps.com's current policy prohibits images of world leaders or "any material that is vintage in appearance or depicts images from an older era."[25]
Stamps.com's cancellation process requires the customer to call a representative to cancel. Customers are charged their monthly subscription fees at the end of the month, and thus a customer is charged a final payment when canceling the month-to-month service.[26] In 2009, Stamps.com settled a class-action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs alleged unreasonable hold times when they attempted to cancel service over the phone, which resulted in delayed closing of their accounts.[citation needed]

Through their online services, the company allows customers, from individuals to large enterprises, to print postage using standard printers and an Internet connection. Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) operates in a single reportable segment, "Internet Mailing and Shipping Solutions". This segment encompasses the entirety of the company's core postage solutions business and can be broken down into the following five brands:  Stamps.com - USPS mailing and shipping solutions Endicia - USPS mailing and shipping solutions ShipStation - Web-based multi-carrier shipping solutions ShipWorks - Client-based multi-carrier shipping solutions ShippingEasy - web-based multi-carrier shipping solutions  Services: Looking more in depth at the company's services, it is clear that Stamps.com has been attempting to diversify its offerings to support customer demands for other shipping carriers in addition to USPS. Let's take a look at what the targeted customer segments of each brand are and what they add to the overall business.
 Stamps.com is the original service that brought about online postage solutions. Customers pay a monthly subscription service fee and the cost of postage, albeit at a discounted rate when comparing prices directly to USPS. Almost all of the types of envelopes, packages, etc. that USPS offers are supported through the site. Stamps.com also has a variety of features that make it attractive to higher volume shippers and businesses. One of the most important is the ability of the service to automate many aspects of the shipping process including automatic addressing, pre-filled forms, and batch printing. Endicia was acquired by Stamps.com on November 18, 2015 and is one of the few other companies that is also a USPS approved PC Postage company. Stamps.com purchased Endicia in order to expand its offerings for high volume and large enterprise customers. Endicia is the leading provider of high volume USPS shipping solutions due to its database integration, automation support, and high volume shipping software product integration capabilities. ShipStation, which was acquired on June 10, 2014, marked Stamps.com's first foray into supporting other carriers. Over 35 different carriers are supported, including UPS (NYSE:UPS), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), and DHL (private), making the service attractive to customers who avoided Stamps.com limitedness to only USPS. ShipStation is primarily an e-commerce shipping solution and has over 100 partner integrations that allow sellers on sites like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) to directly utilize the service without leaving their platforms. Like ShipStation, ShipWorks, acquired on August 29, 2014, also supports a variety of shipping carriers and has partner integrations. The primary differentiator for this service lies in its support for more complex shipping solutions. As client-based software, solutions to issues such as international customs forms, return shipping labels, etc. are able to easily be handled. Lastly, ShippingEasy is another service focused on e-commerce merchants with support for multiple carriers and partner integrations. ShippingEasy also offers product management support for its customers. This makes the service especially valuable to small businesses that are just starting up.
 Financials: The company's business model results in strong cash flows due to the recurring revenue streams from its subscriptions. Service revenues, defined by the company as revenues derived from subscriptions plans, USPS compensation for waived service fees, and transaction related revenues, comprised 86% of the company's total revenues in 2016. As can be seen in the graph below, total revenues have been seeing strong growth thanks in large part to the company's multiple acquisitions over the years. 

 Furthermore, the number of annual paid customers continues to grow as the churn rate continues to decrease. In 2016, the number of annual paid customers rose to 656,000, representing a 13% year-over-year increase. At the same time, the annual average paid customer churn rate fell to a low of only 3.0%. Stamps.com operates an extremely high margin business due to the digital nature of the services it provides and the lack of significant costs of revenues. Since customers print their own labels and postage, costs associated with printing and ink replacements do not impact the company. In 2016, total gross margin stood at 82.7% according to GAAP standards. With a short interest ratio hovering around 37%, Stamps.com is one of the most highly shorted stocks on the market. Conditions like this create the perfect opportunity for a short squeeze. Amid a newly authorized $90 million share repurchase plan over the next six months, the stock has continued to climb higher recently. For reasons that I will discuss in just a bit, future catalysts could potentially trigger a short squeeze and further add to the buying pressure the company has been facing. 


 Growth Opportunity: As I discussed in my article "How To Play The Future Of Retail", online business and e-commerce is expected to continue growing at a rapid pace going into the future. In 2017, online and non-store sales are expected to triple the growth rate of brick and mortar stores. By 2020, worldwide e-commerce sales are projected to top $4 trillion. 

 The growth of e-commerce will play a critical role in the company's earnings going forward. As more and more shopping is performed online instead of in person, the number of packages that need to be shipped will rise accordingly. While it may be difficult to choose which specific shipping companies will benefit the most from this trend, Stamps.com will benefit regardless. Through the company's diversification efforts, they are no longer dependent on the success of just USPS, but rather shipping carriers as a whole. Stamps.com also has significant room for expansion within the current market. Annual postage printed in dollar terms reached $5.5 billion in 2016 yet represents only 2% of the top four carriers' revenue, as shown in the chart below. 

 According to the Small Business Administration, there are currently 28 million small businesses in the United States. With only 722,000 customers as of Q1'17, the potential customer growth is enormous. Competition: Stamps.com faces competition from a variety of sources. Despite postage for USPS being the core business, USPS also represents one of the company's largest competitors. Customers and businesses that go directly to the post office can pay for postage there, essentially cutting Stamps.com out of the equation. This issue also occurs with other shipping companies that have retail locations, such as UPS, FedEx, and DHL. However, customers who do so stand to pay a higher price than they would on Stamps.com.
 The most direct competitor that Stamps.com faces is Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI), another USPS approved PC postage vendor. In addition to offering a similar service of online postage solutions, Pitney Bowes also sells traditional postage meters. While postage meters can provide an individual or business with a faster processing time, they do not offer the same degree of automation and integration that Stamps.com does. Risks:   E-commerce Platforms: As a greater number of e-commerce platforms begin to emerge online, many may begin to form their own shipping services by integrating directly with carriers. This would essentially cut Stamps.com out as the middleman since customers engaged in the e-commerce business will likely only want to deal with one central platform for their business needs.  USPS Vendor Status Changes: Stamps.com is able to offer discounts to its customers as a result of its USPS approved PC Postage Vendor status. If this status was to be terminated or the discounts associated with the status changed, Stamps.com could be adversely affected.  Economic Downturn: Stamps.com is disproportionally vulnerable to economic downturns compared to the typical business. If a recession were to occur, global shipping would decrease and the company's profits would be hurt immensely.  Conclusion: Due to the company's efforts to diversify its service offerings, Stamps.com is well positioned to experience explosive growth as e-commerce continues to grow. The company has moved away from its reliance on USPS and is now able to benefit from the success of the shipping industry as a whole. Additionally, the relatively small market penetration the company currently has allows for significant expansion. The financial situation is sound and an increasing share price may be beginning to put the massive amount of short sellers on edge. Despite competitive threats, Stamps.com's ability to create value for its customers by saving them time and money will continue to be a primary driving force for years to come.

To start buying postage online, all you need is a printer and a subscription to a PC Postage service such as Stamps.com.  Here's how it works:


			Connect to Stamps.com to buy postage online
Our free software (download here) will connect you via the Internet to your Stamps.com Postage Account. When you print postage, the postage amount will be deducted from your account.


			Input or choose an address from your address book
Stamps.com imports delivery addresses automatically from your MS Outlook, QuickBooks and many other popular address book and contact management software. You can add or edit addresses anytime. You can even print postage directly from MS Word, Outlook and Corel WordPerfect.


			Weigh your package using your free 5 lb. digital scale
Use the free Stamps.com 5 lb. digital scale (just pay shipping and handling) to accurately weigh your envelopes or packages — you'll never overpay or underpay for postage again! The scale connects directly to your PC and integrates seamlessly with the Stamps.com software. If you need to weigh heavier packages you can upgrade to our 35 lb. scale anytime.


			Instantly calculate and print your exact postage
Stamps.com allows you to buy the exact postage amount you need for your letter or package. You can print your postage on standard labels, envelopes or plain paper. In addition, Stamps.com will give you an estimate of the delivery time of all available USPS services, so you can choose the most cost-effective mail class based on your needs. Stamps.com uses the USPS database to validate your delivery address, ensuring fast, accurate delivery. Stamps.com can even send an email to the recipient to inform them that the package is on its way.


			Send it off
Simply apply your Stamps.com postage to your mailpiece and either hand your letters and packages to your Postal Carrier, schedule a USPS pick up, drop them at the Post Office (without standing in line) or put them in a mail collection box. Plus, when a package of 13 oz. or more displays postage printed from Stamps.com, the USPS allows you to bypass the 13 oz. limit restriction and drop it right in a mail collection box!


			Track packages and view history
Stamps.com automatically keeps a detailed record of the postage you print. This makes it easy for you to review your postage spending or to print a report for your files. And, with Stamps.com “one-click package tracking,” there is no need to type long tracking numbers to verify your package delivery.

History[edit]
Founded in 1996,[2] Stamps.com was created under the name StampMaster by Jim McDermott, Ari Engelberg and Jeff Green, who at the time were MBA graduate students at UCLA.[3][4] StampMaster was among the first companies to obtain USPS approval for beta testing and introducing Internet postage to the market. The Postal Service began announcing proposals for digital delivery of postage in 1996.[5]
Stamps.com finished its Series A funding in February 1998 with $1.5 million. Series B funding followed in August 1998 with $4.52 million.[6] It had its last round of private financing in February 1999,[7] generating an additional $30 million[6] from investors including former Postmaster General, Marvin Runyon.[5] The company went public in June of the same year[4][8] and raised $55 million in its IPO.[6] Less than six months after its IPO, the company had its secondary public offering.[7] In August 1999, the Postal Service granted permission for Stamps.com to sell its service nationally.[5] Stamps.com purchased IShip.com, a company that compared prices of shipping services, for $305 million in stock or eight million shares, in October 1999.[9][10]
In 2001, Stamps.com named Ken McBride its CEO.[11] The U.S. Postal Service authorized the first market test of PhotoStamps in 2004.[12] In 2005, the company reported $10.4 million in net income.[11] PhotoStamps was re-launched in May 2005 for another year-long test run.[13] The United States Congress amended a law in January 2006 that had prohibited attaching business advertising to postage, effective in May of that year, which cleared the way for businesses to use PhotoStamps.[12] In September 2006, the company launched Photo NetStamps, which combined its previous NetStamps product with PhotoStamps. This combination allowed PhotoStamps to be used with exact postage printed from Stamps.com software.[14] By 2008, Stamps.com had more than 300,000 customers.[15] The company recorded revenues of $38.6 million in 2012.[11]
By 2013, it had approximately 465,000 registered customers.[2] Stamps.com reported $147.3 million in revenue the following year.[16] It acquired ShipStation, a web-based multi-carrier shipping solution based in Austin, Texas, in June 2014 for $50 million and up to 768,900 shares of stock. ShipStation was founded in 2010 and creates tools to import orders from shopping cart platforms for order fulfillment The acquisition made ShipStation an independent subsidiary of Stamps.com operated by its existing management team.[17] In October that same year, Stamps.com acquired ShipWorks, a multi-carrier shipping software company that integrates with shopping cart platforms, for $22 million. ShipWorks continues to operate as an independent, wholly owned subsidiary.[18]
In March 2015, Stamps.com entered into an agreement to acquire Endicia, another internet postage company, from Newell Rubbermaid for approximately $215 million.[19][20] Endicia's products include the DYMO Stamps and PictureItPostage brands.[19]
On June 20, 2016, Stamps.com announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase ShippingEasy, Inc., an Austin, Texas-based company which offers web-based multi-carrier shipping software that allows online retailers and e-commerce merchants to organize, process, fulfill and ship their orders. Stamps.com agreed to acquire ShippingEasy for $55 million in cash, as well as performance-linked equity awards of 87,000 shares of Stamps.com's common stock.[21]
Products[edit]
Online postage[edit]




USPS First Class Package International via stamps.com


Stamps.com's service is a way for small businesses, enterprises and online retailers to print official United States Postal Service stamps and shipping labels with their computer, printer and an Internet connection. Stamps.com sends customers a digital scale to weigh letters and packages to ensure the correct amount of postage is applied to the piece of mail. The amount of postage applied is then deducted from the customer's Stamps.com account. Customers can print postage on envelopes, regular paper or adhesive labels. The system integrates with external address books applications including Outlook and Act!, small business applications such as Microsoft Word and Intuit's QuickBooks, and e-commerce platforms such as eBay and Amazon.com.[22]
PhotoStamps[edit]
Stamps.com also offers a product called PhotoStamps that allows customers to upload personal photographs or logos to be printed on real U.S. postage stamps. PhotoStamps are sold as a sheet of 20 postage stamps.[23]




Stamps.com Corporate headquarters. Los Angeles, California.


Controversy[edit]
While The Smoking Gun successfully ordered PhotoStamps with controversial images,[24] Stamps.com's current policy prohibits images of world leaders or "any material that is vintage in appearance or depicts images from an older era."[25]
Stamps.com's cancellation process requires the customer to call a representative to cancel. Customers are charged their monthly subscription fees at the end of the month, and thus a customer is charged a final payment when canceling the month-to-month service.[26] In 2009, Stamps.com settled a class-action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs alleged unreasonable hold times when they attempted to cancel service over the phone, which resulted in delayed closing of their accounts.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Founded in 1996,[2] Stamps.com was created under the name StampMaster by Jim McDermott, Ari Engelberg and Jeff Green, who at the time were MBA graduate students at UCLA.[3][4] StampMaster was among the first companies to obtain USPS approval for beta testing and introducing Internet postage to the market. The Postal Service began announcing proposals for digital delivery of postage in 1996.[5]
Stamps.com finished its Series A funding in February 1998 with $1.5 million. Series B funding followed in August 1998 with $4.52 million.[6] It had its last round of private financing in February 1999,[7] generating an additional $30 million[6] from investors including former Postmaster General, Marvin Runyon.[5] The company went public in June of the same year[4][8] and raised $55 million in its IPO.[6] Less than six months after its IPO, the company had its secondary public offering.[7] In August 1999, the Postal Service granted permission for Stamps.com to sell its service nationally.[5] Stamps.com purchased IShip.com, a company that compared prices of shipping services, for $305 million in stock or eight million shares, in October 1999.[9][10]
In 2001, Stamps.com named Ken McBride its CEO.[11] The U.S. Postal Service authorized the first market test of PhotoStamps in 2004.[12] In 2005, the company reported $10.4 million in net income.[11] PhotoStamps was re-launched in May 2005 for another year-long test run.[13] The United States Congress amended a law in January 2006 that had prohibited attaching business advertising to postage, effective in May of that year, which cleared the way for businesses to use PhotoStamps.[12] In September 2006, the company launched Photo NetStamps, which combined its previous NetStamps product with PhotoStamps. This combination allowed PhotoStamps to be used with exact postage printed from Stamps.com software.[14] By 2008, Stamps.com had more than 300,000 customers.[15] The company recorded revenues of $38.6 million in 2012.[11]
By 2013, it had approximately 465,000 registered customers.[2] Stamps.com reported $147.3 million in revenue the following year.[16] It acquired ShipStation, a web-based multi-carrier shipping solution based in Austin, Texas, in June 2014 for $50 million and up to 768,900 shares of stock. ShipStation was founded in 2010 and creates tools to import orders from shopping cart platforms for order fulfillment The acquisition made ShipStation an independent subsidiary of Stamps.com operated by its existing management team.[17] In October that same year, Stamps.com acquired ShipWorks, a multi-carrier shipping software company that integrates with shopping cart platforms, for $22 million. ShipWorks continues to operate as an independent, wholly owned subsidiary.[18]
In March 2015, Stamps.com entered into an agreement to acquire Endicia, another internet postage company, from Newell Rubbermaid for approximately $215 million.[19][20] Endicia's products include the DYMO Stamps and PictureItPostage brands.[19]
On June 20, 2016, Stamps.com announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase ShippingEasy, Inc., an Austin, Texas-based company which offers web-based multi-carrier shipping software that allows online retailers and e-commerce merchants to organize, process, fulfill and ship their orders. Stamps.com agreed to acquire ShippingEasy for $55 million in cash, as well as performance-linked equity awards of 87,000 shares of Stamps.com's common stock.[21]
Products[edit]
Online postage[edit]




USPS First Class Package International via stamps.com


Stamps.com's service is a way for small businesses, enterprises and online retailers to print official United States Postal Service stamps and shipping labels with their computer, printer and an Internet connection. Stamps.com sends customers a digital scale to weigh letters and packages to ensure the correct amount of postage is applied to the piece of mail. The amount of postage applied is then deducted from the customer's Stamps.com account. Customers can print postage on envelopes, regular paper or adhesive labels. The system integrates with external address books applications including Outlook and Act!, small business applications such as Microsoft Word and Intuit's QuickBooks, and e-commerce platforms such as eBay and Amazon.com.[22]
PhotoStamps[edit]
Stamps.com also offers a product called PhotoStamps that allows customers to upload personal photographs or logos to be printed on real U.S. postage stamps. PhotoStamps are sold as a sheet of 20 postage stamps.[23]




Stamps.com Corporate headquarters. Los Angeles, California.


Controversy[edit]
While The Smoking Gun successfully ordered PhotoStamps with controversial images,[24] Stamps.com's current policy prohibits images of world leaders or "any material that is vintage in appearance or depicts images from an older era."[25]
Stamps.com's cancellation process requires the customer to call a representative to cancel. Customers are charged their monthly subscription fees at the end of the month, and thus a customer is charged a final payment when canceling the month-to-month service.[26] In 2009, Stamps.com settled a class-action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs alleged unreasonable hold times when they attempted to cancel service over the phone, which resulted in delayed closing of their accounts.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Founded in 1996,[2] Stamps.com was created under the name StampMaster by Jim McDermott, Ari Engelberg and Jeff Green, who at the time were MBA graduate students at UCLA.[3][4] StampMaster was among the first companies to obtain USPS approval for beta testing and introducing Internet postage to the market. The Postal Service began announcing proposals for digital delivery of postage in 1996.[5]
Stamps.com finished its Series A funding in February 1998 with $1.5 million. Series B funding followed in August 1998 with $4.52 million.[6] It had its last round of private financing in February 1999,[7] generating an additional $30 million[6] from investors including former Postmaster General, Marvin Runyon.[5] The company went public in June of the same year[4][8] and raised $55 million in its IPO.[6] Less than six months after its IPO, the company had its secondary public offering.[7] In August 1999, the Postal Service granted permission for Stamps.com to sell its service nationally.[5] Stamps.com purchased IShip.com, a company that compared prices of shipping services, for $305 million in stock or eight million shares, in October 1999.[9][10]
In 2001, Stamps.com named Ken McBride its CEO.[11] The U.S. Postal Service authorized the first market test of PhotoStamps in 2004.[12] In 2005, the company reported $10.4 million in net income.[11] PhotoStamps was re-launched in May 2005 for another year-long test run.[13] The United States Congress amended a law in January 2006 that had prohibited attaching business advertising to postage, effective in May of that year, which cleared the way for businesses to use PhotoStamps.[12] In September 2006, the company launched Photo NetStamps, which combined its previous NetStamps product with PhotoStamps. This combination allowed PhotoStamps to be used with exact postage printed from Stamps.com software.[14] By 2008, Stamps.com had more than 300,000 customers.[15] The company recorded revenues of $38.6 million in 2012.[11]
By 2013, it had approximately 465,000 registered customers.[2] Stamps.com reported $147.3 million in revenue the following year.[16] It acquired ShipStation, a web-based multi-carrier shipping solution based in Austin, Texas, in June 2014 for $50 million and up to 768,900 shares of stock. ShipStation was founded in 2010 and creates tools to import orders from shopping cart platforms for order fulfillment The acquisition made ShipStation an independent subsidiary of Stamps.com operated by its existing management team.[17] In October that same year, Stamps.com acquired ShipWorks, a multi-carrier shipping software company that integrates with shopping cart platforms, for $22 million. ShipWorks continues to operate as an independent, wholly owned subsidiary.[18]
In March 2015, Stamps.com entered into an agreement to acquire Endicia, another internet postage company, from Newell Rubbermaid for approximately $215 million.[19][20] Endicia's products include the DYMO Stamps and PictureItPostage brands.[19]
On June 20, 2016, Stamps.com announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase ShippingEasy, Inc., an Austin, Texas-based company which offers web-based multi-carrier shipping software that allows online retailers and e-commerce merchants to organize, process, fulfill and ship their orders. Stamps.com agreed to acquire ShippingEasy for $55 million in cash, as well as performance-linked equity awards of 87,000 shares of Stamps.com's common stock.[21]
Products[edit]
Online postage[edit]




USPS First Class Package International via stamps.com


Stamps.com's service is a way for small businesses, enterprises and online retailers to print official United States Postal Service stamps and shipping labels with their computer, printer and an Internet connection. Stamps.com sends customers a digital scale to weigh letters and packages to ensure the correct amount of postage is applied to the piece of mail. The amount of postage applied is then deducted from the customer's Stamps.com account. Customers can print postage on envelopes, regular paper or adhesive labels. The system integrates with external address books applications including Outlook and Act!, small business applications such as Microsoft Word and Intuit's QuickBooks, and e-commerce platforms such as eBay and Amazon.com.[22]
PhotoStamps[edit]
Stamps.com also offers a product called PhotoStamps that allows customers to upload personal photographs or logos to be printed on real U.S. postage stamps. PhotoStamps are sold as a sheet of 20 postage stamps.[23]




Stamps.com Corporate headquarters. Los Angeles, California.


Controversy[edit]
While The Smoking Gun successfully ordered PhotoStamps with controversial images,[24] Stamps.com's current policy prohibits images of world leaders or "any material that is vintage in appearance or depicts images from an older era."[25]
Stamps.com's cancellation process requires the customer to call a representative to cancel. Customers are charged their monthly subscription fees at the end of the month, and thus a customer is charged a final payment when canceling the month-to-month service.[26] In 2009, Stamps.com settled a class-action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs alleged unreasonable hold times when they attempted to cancel service over the phone, which resulted in delayed closing of their accounts.[citation needed]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
