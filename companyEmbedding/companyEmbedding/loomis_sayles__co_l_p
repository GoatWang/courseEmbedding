 Primary Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays US Government/Credit IndexPortfolio ManagementDan Fuss, CFA, CICMatt Eagan, CFAElaine StokesBrian KennedyTotal Fund Assets (as of 6/30/2017): $13.7 billionLipper Category: General Bond FundsMorningstar Category: Multisector BondStrategy Highlights
Value driven, opportunistic approach
Long-term investment horizon
Allocations to out-of-benchmark securities can provide value and diversification
Initial portfolio position in any one holding is typically 0-3%; 5% maximum position size
Investment Strategy
Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings made for investment purposes) in fixed income securities
May invest up to 35% of assets in below investment grade fixed income securities
May invest up to 20% of its assets in equity securities such as common stocks and preferred stocks (with up to 10% of its assets in common stocks)
May invest any portion of its assets in securities of Canadian issuers and up to 20% of assets in foreign securities, including emerging markets
About Risk
Fixed income securities may carry one or more of the following risks: credit, interest rate (as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall), inflation and liquidity. 
Below investment grade fixed income securities may be subject to greater risks (including the risk of default) than other fixed income securities. 
Foreign and emerging market securities may be subject to greater political, economic, environmental, credit, currency and information risks. Foreign securities may be subject to higher volatility than US securities due to varying degrees of regulation and limited liquidity. These risks are magnified in emerging markets.
Currency exchange rates between the US dollar and foreign currencies may cause the value of the fund’s investments to decline.
Equity securities are volatile and can decline significantly in response to broad market and economic conditions.   
Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against a loss.1 As of the most recent prospectus, the investment advisor has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses once the expense cap of the fund has been exceeded. This arrangement is set to expire on 1/31/18. Transfer Agent Fee waivers for Class N are contractual and are set to expire 1/31/18. When an expense cap has not been exceeded, the fund may have similar expense ratios and/or yields. 2The 30-day SEC yield is a standardized calculation, calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share at the end of the period and annualizing the result. A subsidized 30-day SEC yield reflects the effect of fee waivers and expense reimbursements. The SEC yield is not based upon distributions of the fund and actual income distributions may be higher or lower than the 30-day SEC yield amounts. Unsubsidized 30-day SEC yield is calculated using the gross expenses of the fund. Gross expenses do not include any fee waivers or reimbursement.The Bloomberg Barclays US Government/Credit Bond Index includes securities in the Government and Credit Indices. The Government Index includes treasuries (i.e., public obligations of the US Treasury that have remaining maturities of more than one year) and agencies (i.e., publicly issued debt of US Government agencies, quasi-federal corporations, and corporate or foreign debt guaranteed by the US Government). The Credit Index includes publicly issued US corporate and foreign debentures and secured notes that meet specified maturity, liquidity, and quality requirements. Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

            Intensive use of farm machinery will be essential to meet world food demand.

A US investor that backed Amazon when it was a bookseller is bullish about the growth prospects for iconic tractor maker Deere & Co.Loomis, Sayles & Company's growth strategy invests in businesses that are internet trailblazers: it bought Facebook, Visa and Alibaba in their initial public offerings. But it also identifies growth in businesses that are more salt of the earth than Silicon Valley.Only about 10 per cent of companies can sustain their growth more than four years, and only about 1 per cent for 10 years, the fund manager estimates."You put that kind of company that can just get better over time on top of a secular growth engine, those are rare," says Hollie Briggs, who is a Boston-based equity product manager at the firm.

"The shift from brick-and-mortar to online isn't going to be done in another 10 years. When we bought Amazon the penetration rate was low single digits and now it's around 10 [per cent], and that's after 11 years with what has seemed like rapid growth."

Deere was added to the growth strategy last year, having been "in the library" for five years as fears mounted in the market that the company risked having to write down some of its on-balance sheet leases."The opportunity came because a lot of farmers have been leasing their tractors because cash receipts have been low, but they still like their new tractors. So there's a lot of residual value risk on Deere's balance sheet right now," Ms Briggs said. That is an entirely quantifiable risk."Crop yields have been high, and crop receipts are low so sales are low. But that's a short-term headwind. The long-term driver of growth for Deere is the increase in population in the world. It's expected to increase by a third in 2050, and, there's no more arable land."Mechanisation and advanced seeds are two ways of improving the utilisation of existing land.

When Deere reported second-quarter earnings in May, it raised its full-year earnings forecast to $US2 billion ($2.5 billion).The growth strategy also does not own any banks, but does hold American Express. There are no Australian stocks in the portfolio, nor does it invest in Apple ("the downside risk of Apple is not knowable").Holding onto its Amazon position, which it started acquiring at around $US30 a share in 2006, "it's about what's to come, that's the only thing that matters is what's ahead and what the opportunity is", Ms Briggs said.'Relentlessly visionary'

Loomis Sayles doesn't necessarily agree that share prices follow earnings, focusing on cash-flow returns on invested capital."If you're earning above your cost of capital, you're creating shareholder value. If you're earning less than, you're eating up your capital. You can have earnings growth but not be earning above your cost of capital."Regarding the booming Amazon Web Services, or AWS, "you might say it's just luck because we certainly didn't know about it [in 2006] but you might attribute it to the type of management we're looking for," Ms Briggs said, "relentlessly visionary."The scale of Amazon will have an impact on certain competitors as it builds a base in Australia, but not necessarily all of them, she said. Ms Briggs also recalled that in 2006, about 30 per cent of Amazon's stock was targeted by short sellers.

"Everyone was thinking that they were just a bookseller, they didn't have the vision that it was going to be able to expand into other categories."Loomis Sayles (and Jeff Bezos) thought otherwise. The market also responded negatively to Amazon's intention to make essential investments in its interface.Similarly, in its first year, Facebook had $US13 million in mobile-generated revenue; that is now almost $US6 billion. "They recovered quickly, shall we say."The fund manager also owns MercadoLibre, an online marketplace that is the dominant player in many South American countries.

"There are regional differences," Ms Briggs said. MercadoLibre was winning market share, even in Brazil, where the economy is severely challenged."Amazon spent 10 years in China and a lot of money and gained about 1 per cent market share. It isn't a given that in every region they're going to go in and own it."Alibaba has managed to do something even Amazon has not: "The big distinction for Alibaba compared to, say, Amazon in developed markets, is that it's creating new demand."Otherwise in the developed market, online is a take-away game," in that it steals share from bricks-and-mortar retailers.The investment manager emphasises long-term investing. It launched a global growth strategy at the start of 2016 and has not bought or sold a single name outside of adding and trimming positions.Oracle and Cisco, described as "old tech", have been in the portfolio since inception. Its average position size in Amazon has been 6 per cent.

A US investor that backed Amazon when it was a bookseller is bullish about the growth prospects for iconic tractor maker Deere & Co.Loomis, Sayles & Company's growth strategy invests in businesses that are internet trailblazers: it bought Facebook, Visa and Alibaba in their initial public offerings. But it also identifies growth in businesses that are more salt of the earth than Silicon Valley.Only about 10 per cent of companies can sustain their growth more than four years, and only about 1 per cent for 10 years, the fund manager estimates."You put that kind of company that can just get better over time on top of a secular growth engine, those are rare," says Hollie Briggs, who is a Boston-based equity product manager at the firm.

"The shift from brick-and-mortar to online isn't going to be done in another 10 years. When we bought Amazon the penetration rate was low single digits and now it's around 10 [per cent], and that's after 11 years with what has seemed like rapid growth."

Deere was added to the growth strategy last year, having been "in the library" for five years as fears mounted in the market that the company risked having to write down some of its on-balance sheet leases."The opportunity came because a lot of farmers have been leasing their tractors because cash receipts have been low, but they still like their new tractors. So there's a lot of residual value risk on Deere's balance sheet right now," Ms Briggs said. That is an entirely quantifiable risk."Crop yields have been high, and crop receipts are low so sales are low. But that's a short-term headwind. The long-term driver of growth for Deere is the increase in population in the world. It's expected to increase by a third in 2050, and, there's no more arable land."Mechanisation and advanced seeds are two ways of improving the utilisation of existing land.

When Deere reported second-quarter earnings in May, it raised its full-year earnings forecast to $US2 billion ($2.5 billion).The growth strategy also does not own any banks, but does hold American Express. There are no Australian stocks in the portfolio, nor does it invest in Apple ("the downside risk of Apple is not knowable").Holding onto its Amazon position, which it started acquiring at around $US30 a share in 2006, "it's about what's to come, that's the only thing that matters is what's ahead and what the opportunity is", Ms Briggs said.'Relentlessly visionary'

Loomis Sayles doesn't necessarily agree that share prices follow earnings, focusing on cash-flow returns on invested capital."If you're earning above your cost of capital, you're creating shareholder value. If you're earning less than, you're eating up your capital. You can have earnings growth but not be earning above your cost of capital."Regarding the booming Amazon Web Services, or AWS, "you might say it's just luck because we certainly didn't know about it [in 2006] but you might attribute it to the type of management we're looking for," Ms Briggs said, "relentlessly visionary."The scale of Amazon will have an impact on certain competitors as it builds a base in Australia, but not necessarily all of them, she said. Ms Briggs also recalled that in 2006, about 30 per cent of Amazon's stock was targeted by short sellers.

"Everyone was thinking that they were just a bookseller, they didn't have the vision that it was going to be able to expand into other categories."Loomis Sayles (and Jeff Bezos) thought otherwise. The market also responded negatively to Amazon's intention to make essential investments in its interface.Similarly, in its first year, Facebook had $US13 million in mobile-generated revenue; that is now almost $US6 billion. "They recovered quickly, shall we say."The fund manager also owns MercadoLibre, an online marketplace that is the dominant player in many South American countries.

"There are regional differences," Ms Briggs said. MercadoLibre was winning market share, even in Brazil, where the economy is severely challenged."Amazon spent 10 years in China and a lot of money and gained about 1 per cent market share. It isn't a given that in every region they're going to go in and own it."Alibaba has managed to do something even Amazon has not: "The big distinction for Alibaba compared to, say, Amazon in developed markets, is that it's creating new demand."Otherwise in the developed market, online is a take-away game," in that it steals share from bricks-and-mortar retailers.The investment manager emphasises long-term investing. It launched a global growth strategy at the start of 2016 and has not bought or sold a single name outside of adding and trimming positions.Oracle and Cisco, described as "old tech", have been in the portfolio since inception. Its average position size in Amazon has been 6 per cent.
