Conn. broker. Patrick Dennis Terrell, suspended and fined

By Fitapelli Kurta






 


The securities and investment fraud law firm Fitapelli Kurta is interested in speaking to investors who have complaints regarding Connecticut-based broker Patrick Dennis Terrell.
Patrick Dennis Terrell has spent 16 years in the securities industry and was most recently employed by Andrew Garrett, Inc. of Noank, Connecticut. Previous employers include Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. of New London, CT; Wells Fargo Advisors in Mystic, CT; and A.G. Edwards & Sons of Mystic, Ct.
Patrick Terrell, who is currently not a licensed broker, has five disclosures listed in his BrokerCheck report.
In 2015 Patrick Dennis Terrell was sanctioned by FINRA and suspended for one year. FINRA’s complaint alleged that Terrell, while employed by Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., submitted a fabricated personal loan application to a bank. Patrick Dennis Terrell allegedly “created the fabricated monthly statement by taking an actual customer’s account statement and then  inserting his own name and address in place of the customer’s.”
Following the FINRA sanction, Patrick Terrell was discharged from his position at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. Terrell was previously terminated from Wells Fargo, in 2011, following allegations that he signed a customer’s name to an advisory account form.
In 2012 a customer alleged Patrick Dennis Terrell forged account documents. The complaint settled in 2013 for more than $92,000.
In 2001 a customer alleged Patrick Dennis Terrell engaged in unauthorized trading, unsuitable investment recommendations, and churning. The complaint settled in 2002 for more than $6,000.
Churning, is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as the excessive buying and selling of securities with the goal of generating commissions that enrich the broker. Churning can only occur in cases where the broker has formal control over investment decisions in the customer’s account. It is both illegal and unethical.
If you have lost money investing with Patrick Terrell or Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., call 877-238-4175 now for a free consultation. You may entitled to recover your losses. All cases are taken on a contingency fee, which means we do not get paid unless and until you recover money. Our consultations are always free.
Time is of the essence, so do not delay. Call 877-238-4175 now to speak to an attorney for free.
