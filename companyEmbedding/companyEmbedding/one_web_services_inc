  AWS Developer Tools 









  Host code and automatically build, test, and deploy your applications to AWS 















 Create an AWS Account

























The AWS Developer Tools is a set of services designed to enable developers and IT operations professionals practicing DevOps to rapidly and safely deliver software. Together, these services help you securely store and version control your application's source code and automatically build, test, and deploy your application to AWS or your on-premises environment. You can use AWS CodePipeline to orchestrate an end-to-end software release workflow using these services and third-party tools or integrate each service independently with your existing tools.


























Practice Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery 




In today’s world, you need to continually innovate and improve your product to meet your customers’ needs. Frequent application updates help you do this, making software agility and quick time-to-market essential to maintaining your competitive advantage. The faster you can release new features and fix bugs, the quicker you can innovate and respond to customer needs. Continuous integration and continuous delivery are DevOps practices that help you reliably test and release software more frequently.
































 Based on Amazon’s DevOps Practices and Tools 




The AWS Developer Tools are inspired by the same DevOps tools used by Amazon’s internal teams and help you use software development best practices utilized by Amazon. Amazon’s engineering teams function like small startups, with each team responsible for everything from collecting customer feedback and writing requirements to owning the development, test, deployment, and operations of their services. Amazon created developer tools to help its teams independently release updates to their customers quicker and in a "self service" manner.

  Store Code in Private Git Repositories 










  AWS CodePipeline 






  Release Software using Continuous Integration & Delivery 










  AWS CodeBuild 






  Build and Test Code 










  AWS CodeDeploy 






  Automate Code Deployments 













AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service that makes it easy for companies to host secure and highly scalable private Git repositories. CodeCommit eliminates the need to operate your own source control system or worry about scaling its infrastructure. You can use CodeCommit to securely store anything from source code to binaries, and it works seamlessly with your existing Git tools.
For more information visit the AWS CodeCommit product page.  








AWS CodePipeline is a continuous integration and continuous delivery service for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. CodePipeline builds, tests, and deploys your code every time there is a code change, based on the release process models you define. This enables you to rapidly and reliably deliver features and updates. You can easily build out an end-to-end solution by using our pre-built plugins for popular third-party services like GitHub or integrating your own custom plugins into any stage of your release process. 
For more information visit the AWS CodePipeline product page.








AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. With CodeBuild, you don’t need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. CodeBuild scales continuously and processes multiple builds concurrently, so your builds are not left waiting in a queue. You can get started quickly by using prepackaged build environments, or you can create custom build environments that use your own build tools. With CodeBuild, you are charged by the minute for the compute resources you use.
For more information visit the AWS CodeBuild product page.








AWS CodeDeploy is a service that automates code deployments to any instance, including Amazon EC2 instances and servers running on-premises. AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications. You can use AWS CodeDeploy to automate software deployments, eliminating the need for error-prone manual operations, and the service scales with your infrastructure so you can easily deploy to one instance or thousands. 
For more information visit the AWS CodeDeploy product page. 



















  Benefits 


























 Practice DevOps on AWS




The AWS Developer Tools help you practice continuous integration and continuous delivery on AWS. These services help make your software release process fast, automated, and reliable. 















 Get Started Fast




Each service is fully managed in the cloud, meaning there is no need to host, maintain, or scale servers on your own. The AWS Developer Tools are each offered as a service so you can immediately begin developing and deploying applications on AWS. 















 Extensible and Standalone




These services are modular tools that can easily be extended to adapt to your specific needs. Every service has integrations with other AWS services or pre-built integrations with popular third-party developer tools, allowing you to form your own end-to-end software release solution. Additionally, every service can be programmatically accessed using our APIs. 



















 High Availability




The AWS Developer Tools are built on a highly scalable, redundant, and durable architecture, ensuring that your software development projects are accessible when you need them.















Identity and Access 




The AWS Developer Tools are integrated with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), allowing you to assign user-specific permissions to help keep your software delivery tools secure.















 Pay as You Go 




With AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodePipeline, and AWS CodeBuild, you only pay for what you use. AWS CodeDeploy is offered at no additional charge for Amazon EC2 deployments. There are no setup fees or upfront commitments. Visit the pricing page of each service to learn more.

  Cloud Storage with AWS 









  A reliable, scalable, and secure place for your data 















 Get Started with AWS Storage





























Cloud storage is a critical component of cloud computing, holding the information used by applications. Big data analytics, data warehouses, Internet of Things, databases, and backup and archive applications all rely on some form of data storage architecture. Cloud storage is typically more reliable, scalable, and secure than traditional on-premises storage systems. 
AWS offers a complete range of cloud storage services to support both application and archival compliance requirements. Select from object, file, and block storage services as well as cloud data migration options to start designing the foundation of your cloud IT environment.

  Cloud Storage Service Details 




















  Amazon Elastic Block Storage 






  Store and Process Block Data on Persistent Volumes for Amazon EC2 instances 





Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) provides highly available, consistent, low-latency block storage for Amazon EC2. It helps you tune applications with the right storage capacity, performance and cost.
EBS is designed for workloads that require persistent storage accessible by single EC2 instances. Typical use cases include relational and NoSQL databases (like Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL or Cassandra and MongoDB), Big Data analytics engines (like the Hadoop/HDFS ecosystem and Amazon EMR), stream and log processing applications (like Kafka and Splunk), and data warehousing applications (like Vertica and Teradata).
For more information visit the Amazon EBS page.
















  Amazon Elastic File System 






  Store and Share Data in Simple, Scalable File Systems 





Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud.
It delivers a file system interface with standard file system access semantics for Amazon EC2 instances. EFS grows and shrinks capacity automatically, and provides high throughput with consistently low latencies. EFS is designed for high availability and durability, and provides performance for a broad spectrum of workloads and applications, including Big Data and analytics, media processing workflows, content management, web serving, container storage, and home directories.
For more information visit the Amazon EFS page. 
















  Amazon S3 






  Object Store 





Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is object storage designed to store and access any type of data over the Internet.
It is secure, 99.999999999% durable, and scales past tens of trillions of objects. S3 is used for backup and recovery, tiered archive, user-driven content (like photos, videos, music and files), data lakes for Big Data analytics and data warehouse platforms, or as a foundation for serverless computing design. 
For more information, visit the Amazon S3 page.  
















  Amazon Glacier 






  Archive Data in Low-Cost Storage 





Amazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost and highly durable object storage service for long-term backup and archive of any type of data.  
Glacier is a solution for customers who want low-cost storage for infrequently accessed data. It can replace tape for media and entertainment applications, and assist with compliance in highly regulated organizations like healthcare, life science, and financial services. 
For more information visit the Amazon Glacier page.
















  AWS Storage Gateway 






  Hybrid Cloud Storage with Seamless Integration and Optimized Data Transfer 





The AWS Storage Gateway is a software appliance that seamlessly links your on-premises environment to Amazon cloud storage.
It offers local storage with highly optimized connectivity to AWS Cloud storage, and helps with migration, bursting and storage tiering use cases. Replace tape automation without disrupting existing processes, supplement on-premises workloads with storage capacity on demand, or augment existing on-premises storage investments with a cloud tier.
For more information visit the AWS Storage Gateway page. 
















  Data Transfer Services 






  Moving Data Into, and Out of, the AWS Cloud 





Amazon offers a portfolio of data transfer services to migrate data into and out of the AWS cloud. 
These services help you do things like securely and quickly move multi-petabyte archives, accelerate network transfers with existing infrastructure, and capture continuous streaming data from multiple sources.  
For more information visit the Cloud Data Migration page.

  Amazon RDS 






  Managed Relational Database 





Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks, freeing you up to focus on your applications and business. Amazon RDS provides you six familiar database engines to choose from, including Amazon Aurora, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB.
For more information visit the Amazon RDS product page.  
















  Amazon Aurora 






  MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database with 5X performance. 





Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database engine that combines the speed and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases. Amazon Aurora provides up to five times better performance than MySQL with the security, availability, and reliability of a commercial database at one tenth the cost. 
For more information visit the Amazon Aurora product page.
















  Amazon DynamoDB 






  NoSQL Database 





Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. It is a fully managed cloud database and supports both document and key-value store models. Its flexible data model and reliable performance make it a great fit for mobile, web, gaming, ad tech, IoT, and many other applications
For more information visit the Amazon DynamoDB product page.

Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse that makes it simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data using your existing business intelligence tools. You can start small for $0.25 per hour with no commitments and scale to petabytes for $1,000 per terabyte per year, less than a tenth the cost of traditional solutions.
For more information visit the Amazon Redshift product page.
















  Amazon ElastiCache 






  In-Memory Cache 





Amazon ElastiCache makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud.The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases. ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:  Memcached and Redis.
For more information visit the Amazon ElastiCache product page.
















  AWS DMS 






  Database Migration Service 





AWS Database Migration Services (DMS) helps you migrate databases to AWS easily and securely. The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database. The AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from most widely used commercial and open-source databases. The service supports homogenous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle to Amazon Aurora or Microsoft SQL Server to MySQL.
For more information visit the AWS DMS product page.
















  Amazon Cloud Directory 






  Cloud-Native Directory 





 Amazon Cloud Directory enables you to build flexible cloud-native directories for organizing hierarchies of data along multiple dimensions. With Cloud Directory, you can create directories for a variety of use cases, such as organizational charts, course catalogs, and device registries. For example, you can create an organizational chart that can be navigated through separate hierarchies for reporting structure, location, and cost center.
For more information, visit the Amazon Cloud Directory product page.













































Airbnb chose Amazon RDS because it simplifies much of the time-consuming administrative tasks typically associated with databases. Airbnb currently uses Multi-Availability Zone (Multi-AZ) deployment to further automate its database replication and augment data durability. Airbnb was able to complete its entire database migration to Amazon RDS with only 15 minutes of downtime.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) describes both a technology and a company. The company AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon.com and provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments, on a paid subscription basis with a free-tier option available for 12 months. The technology allows subscribers to have at their disposal a full-fledged virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the internet. AWS' version of virtual computers have most of the attributes of a real computer including hardware (CPU(s) & GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory, hard-disk/SSD storage); a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, CRM, etc. Each AWS system also virtualizes its console I/O (keyboard, display, and mouse), allowing AWS subscribers to connect to their AWS system using a modern browser. The browser acts as a window into the virtual computer, letting subscribers log-in, configure and use their virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer. They can choose to deploy their AWS systems to provide internet-based services for their own and their customers' benefit.
The AWS technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world, and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary. Fees are based on a combination of usage, the hardware/OS/software/networking features chosen by the subscriber, required availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Based on what the subscriber needs and pays for, they can reserve a single virtual AWS computer, a cluster of virtual computers, a physical (real) computer dedicated for their exclusive use, or even a cluster of dedicated physical computers. As part of the subscription agreement,[3] Amazon manages, upgrades, and provides industry-standard security to each subscriber's system. AWS operates from many global geographical regions including 6 in North America.[4]
In 2016, AWS comprised more than 70 services spanning a wide range including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things. The most popular include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Most services are not exposed directly to end users, but instead offer functionality through APIs for developers to use in their applications. Amazon Web Services’ offerings are accessed over HTTP, using the REST architectural style and SOAP protocol.
Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm.[5] All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways.

Availability and Topology[edit]




Map showing Amazon Web Services' availability zones within geographic regions around the world.


As of 2017, AWS has distinct operations in the following 16 geographical "regions":[4]

North America (6 regions)

US East (Northern Virginia), where the majority of AWS servers are based[6]
US East (Ohio)
US West (Oregon)
US West (Northern California)
AWS GovCloud (US), based in the Northwestern United States, provided for U.S. government customers, complementing existing government agencies already using the US East Region[7]
Canada (Central)


South America (1 region)

Brazil (São Paulo)


Europe / Middle East / Africa (3 regions)

EU (Ireland)
EU (Frankfurt), Germany
EU (London), United Kingdom


Asia Pacific (6 regions)

Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Japan
Asia Pacific (Seoul), South Korea
Asia Pacific (Singapore)
Asia Pacific (Mumbai), India
Asia Pacific (Sydney), Australia
Asia Pacific (Beijing), China



AWS has announced that 3 new regions (having 7 Availability Zones) will come online throughout 2017 in China, India, and the United Kingdom.[4]
Each region is wholly contained within a single country and all of its data and services stay within the designated region.[3] Each region has multiple "Availability Zones",[8] which consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. Availability Zones do not automatically provide additional scalability or redundancy within a region, since they are intentionally isolated from each other to prevent outages from spreading between Zones. Several services can operate across Availability Zones (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) while others can be configured to replicate across Zones to spread demand and avoid downtime from failures.
As of December 2014, Amazon Web Services operated an estimated 1.4 Million servers across 28 availability zones.[9] The global network of AWS Edge locations consists of 54 points of presence worldwide, including locations in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America.[10]
In 2014, AWS committed to achieving 100% renewable energy usage.[11] In the United States, AWS' partnerships with renewable energy providers include:

Community Energy of Virginia, a solar farm coming online in 2016, to support the US East region.[12]
Pattern Development, in January 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm Fowler Ridge.
Iberdrola Renewables, LLC, in July 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US East.
EDP Renewables, in November 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US Central.[13]
Tesla Motors, to apply battery storage technology to address power needs in the US West (Northern California) region.[12]

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Amazon Web Services




AWS Summit 2013 event in NYC.


The AWS platform was launched in July 2002 to "expose technology and product data from Amazon and its affiliates, enabling developers to build innovative and entrepreneurial applications on their own."[2] In the beginning, the platform consisted of only a few disparate tools and services. Then in late 2003, the AWS concept was publicly reformulated when Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black presented a paper describing a vision for Amazon's retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized, completely automated, and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway. Near the end of their paper, they mentioned the possibility of selling access to virtual servers as a service, proposing the company could generate revenue from the new infrastructure investment.[15] In November 2004, the first AWS service launched for public usage: Simple Queue Service (SQS).[16] Thereafter Pinkham and lead developer Christoper Brown developed the Amazon EC2 service, with a team in Cape Town, South Africa.[17]
Amazon Web Services was officially re-launched on March 14, 2006,[2] combining the three initial service offerings of Amazon S3 cloud storage, SQS, and EC2. The AWS platform finally provided an integrated suite of core online services, as Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black had proposed back in 2003,[15] as a service offered to other developers, web sites, client-side applications, and companies.[1] Andy Jassy, AWS founder and vice president in 2006, said at the time that Amazon S3 (one of the first and most scalable elements of AWS) "helps free developers from worrying about where they are going to store data, whether it will be safe and secure, if it will be available when they need it, the costs associated with server maintenance, or whether they have enough storage available. Amazon S3 enables developers to focus on innovating with data, rather than figuring out how to store it."[2] His quote marks a milestone in the Internet's history, when massive managed resources became available to developers worldwide, allowing them to offer new scalable web-enabled technologies. In 2016 Jassy was promoted to CEO of the division.[18] Reflecting the success of AWS, his annual compensation in 2017 hit nearly $36 million.[19]
To support industry-wide training and skills standardization, AWS began offering a certification program for computer engineers, on April 30, 2013, to highlight expertise in cloud computing.[20]
James Hamilton, an AWS engineer, wrote a retrospective article in 2016 to highlight the ten-year history of the online service from 2006 to 2016. As an early fan and outspoken proponent of the technology, he had joined the AWS engineering team in 2008.[21]
Growth and Profitability[edit]
In November 2010, it was reported that all of Amazon.com's retail sites had been completely moved under the AWS umbrella.[22] Prior to 2012, AWS was considered a part of Amazon.com and so its revenue was not delineated in Amazon financial statements. In that year industry watchers for the first time estimated AWS revenue to be over $1.5 billion.[23]
In April 2015, Amazon.com reported AWS was profitable, with sales of $1.57 billion in the first quarter of the year and $265 million of operating income. Founder Jeff Bezos described it as a fast-growing $5 billion business; analysts described it as "surprisingly more profitable than forecast".[24] In October 2015, Amazon.com said in its Q3 earnings report that AWS's operating income was $521 million, with operating margins at 25 percent. AWS's 2015 Q3 revenue was $2.1 billion, a 78% increase from 2014's Q3 revenue of $1.17 billion.[25] 2015 Q4 revenue for the AWS segment increased 69.5% y/y to $2.4 billion with 28.5% operating margin, giving AWS a $9.6 billion run rate. In 2015, Gartner estimated that AWS customers are deploying 10x more infrastructure on AWS than the combined adoption of the next 14 providers.[26]
In 2016 Q1, revenue was $2.57 billion with net income of $604 million, a 64% increase over 2015 Q1 that resulted in AWS being more profitable than Amazon's North American retail business for the first time.[27] In the first quarter of 2016, Amazon experienced a 42% rise in stock value as a result of increased earnings, of which AWS contributed 56% to corporate profits.[28][29]
With a 50% increase in revenues the past few years, AWS is predicted to have $13 billion in revenue in 2017.[30]
Customer base[edit]

AWS adoption has increased since launch in 2002.


On March 14, 2006, Amazon said in a press release:[2] "More than 150,000 developers have signed up to use Amazon Web Services since its inception."


In June 2007, Amazon claimed that more than 180,000 developers had signed up to use Amazon Web Services.[31]


In November 2012, AWS hosted its first customer event in Las Vegas.[32]


On May 13, 2013, AWS was awarded an Agency Authority to Operate (ATO) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program.[33]


In October 2013, it was revealed that AWS was awarded a $600M contract with the CIA.[34]


During August 2014, AWS received Department of Defense-Wide provisional authorization for all U.S. Regions.[35]


During the 2015 re:Invent keynote, AWS disclosed that they have more than a million active customers every month in 190 countries, including nearly 2,000 government agencies, 5,000 education institutions and more than 17,500 nonprofits.


On April 5 2017, AWS and DXC Technology (formed from a merger of CSC and HPE) announced an expanded alliance to increase access of AWS features for enterprise clients in existing data centers.[36]

Notable customers include NASA,[37] the Obama presidential campaign of 2012,[38] Kempinski Hotels,[39] and Netflix.[40]
Significant service outages[edit]

On April 20, 2011, AWS suffered a major outage. Parts of the Elastic Block Store (EBS) service became "stuck" and could not fulfill read/write requests. It took at least two days for service to be fully restored.[41]


On June 29, 2012, several websites that rely on Amazon Web Services were taken offline due to a severe storm in Northern Virginia, where AWS' largest data center cluster is located.[42]


On October 22, 2012, a major outage occurred, affecting many sites such as Reddit, Foursquare, Pinterest, and others. The cause was a memory leak bug in an operational data collection agent.[43]


On December 24, 2012, AWS suffered another outage causing websites such as Netflix to be unavailable for customers in the Northeastern United States.[44] AWS cited their Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service as the cause.[45]


On February 28, 2017, AWS experienced a massive outage of S3 services in its Northern Virginia data center. A majority of websites which relied on AWS S3 either hung or stalled, and Amazon reported within five hours that AWS was fully online again.[46] No data has been reported to have been lost due to the outage. The outage was caused by a human error made while debugging, that resulted in removing more server capacity than intended, which caused a domino effect of outages.[47]

Charitable work[edit]
In 2017 AWS launched a program in the United Kingdom to help young adults and military veterans retrain in technology-related skills. In partnership with the Prince's Trust and the Ministry of Defence (MoD), AWS will help to provide re-training opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and former soldiers who have left the military. AWS is working alongside a number of partner companies including Cloudreach, Sage, EDF Energy and Tesco Bank.[74]

Amazon Web Services (AWS) describes both a technology and a company. The company AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon.com and provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments, on a paid subscription basis with a free-tier option available for 12 months. The technology allows subscribers to have at their disposal a full-fledged virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the internet. AWS' version of virtual computers have most of the attributes of a real computer including hardware (CPU(s) & GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory, hard-disk/SSD storage); a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, CRM, etc. Each AWS system also virtualizes its console I/O (keyboard, display, and mouse), allowing AWS subscribers to connect to their AWS system using a modern browser. The browser acts as a window into the virtual computer, letting subscribers log-in, configure and use their virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer. They can choose to deploy their AWS systems to provide internet-based services for their own and their customers' benefit.
The AWS technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world, and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary. Fees are based on a combination of usage, the hardware/OS/software/networking features chosen by the subscriber, required availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Based on what the subscriber needs and pays for, they can reserve a single virtual AWS computer, a cluster of virtual computers, a physical (real) computer dedicated for their exclusive use, or even a cluster of dedicated physical computers. As part of the subscription agreement,[3] Amazon manages, upgrades, and provides industry-standard security to each subscriber's system. AWS operates from many global geographical regions including 6 in North America.[4]
In 2016, AWS comprised more than 70 services spanning a wide range including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things. The most popular include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Most services are not exposed directly to end users, but instead offer functionality through APIs for developers to use in their applications. Amazon Web Services’ offerings are accessed over HTTP, using the REST architectural style and SOAP protocol.
Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm.[5] All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways.

Availability and Topology[edit]




Map showing Amazon Web Services' availability zones within geographic regions around the world.


As of 2017, AWS has distinct operations in the following 16 geographical "regions":[4]

North America (6 regions)

US East (Northern Virginia), where the majority of AWS servers are based[6]
US East (Ohio)
US West (Oregon)
US West (Northern California)
AWS GovCloud (US), based in the Northwestern United States, provided for U.S. government customers, complementing existing government agencies already using the US East Region[7]
Canada (Central)


South America (1 region)

Brazil (São Paulo)


Europe / Middle East / Africa (3 regions)

EU (Ireland)
EU (Frankfurt), Germany
EU (London), United Kingdom


Asia Pacific (6 regions)

Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Japan
Asia Pacific (Seoul), South Korea
Asia Pacific (Singapore)
Asia Pacific (Mumbai), India
Asia Pacific (Sydney), Australia
Asia Pacific (Beijing), China



AWS has announced that 3 new regions (having 7 Availability Zones) will come online throughout 2017 in China, India, and the United Kingdom.[4]
Each region is wholly contained within a single country and all of its data and services stay within the designated region.[3] Each region has multiple "Availability Zones",[8] which consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. Availability Zones do not automatically provide additional scalability or redundancy within a region, since they are intentionally isolated from each other to prevent outages from spreading between Zones. Several services can operate across Availability Zones (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) while others can be configured to replicate across Zones to spread demand and avoid downtime from failures.
As of December 2014, Amazon Web Services operated an estimated 1.4 Million servers across 28 availability zones.[9] The global network of AWS Edge locations consists of 54 points of presence worldwide, including locations in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America.[10]
In 2014, AWS committed to achieving 100% renewable energy usage.[11] In the United States, AWS' partnerships with renewable energy providers include:

Community Energy of Virginia, a solar farm coming online in 2016, to support the US East region.[12]
Pattern Development, in January 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm Fowler Ridge.
Iberdrola Renewables, LLC, in July 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US East.
EDP Renewables, in November 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US Central.[13]
Tesla Motors, to apply battery storage technology to address power needs in the US West (Northern California) region.[12]

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Amazon Web Services




AWS Summit 2013 event in NYC.


The AWS platform was launched in July 2002 to "expose technology and product data from Amazon and its affiliates, enabling developers to build innovative and entrepreneurial applications on their own."[2] In the beginning, the platform consisted of only a few disparate tools and services. Then in late 2003, the AWS concept was publicly reformulated when Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black presented a paper describing a vision for Amazon's retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized, completely automated, and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway. Near the end of their paper, they mentioned the possibility of selling access to virtual servers as a service, proposing the company could generate revenue from the new infrastructure investment.[15] In November 2004, the first AWS service launched for public usage: Simple Queue Service (SQS).[16] Thereafter Pinkham and lead developer Christoper Brown developed the Amazon EC2 service, with a team in Cape Town, South Africa.[17]
Amazon Web Services was officially re-launched on March 14, 2006,[2] combining the three initial service offerings of Amazon S3 cloud storage, SQS, and EC2. The AWS platform finally provided an integrated suite of core online services, as Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black had proposed back in 2003,[15] as a service offered to other developers, web sites, client-side applications, and companies.[1] Andy Jassy, AWS founder and vice president in 2006, said at the time that Amazon S3 (one of the first and most scalable elements of AWS) "helps free developers from worrying about where they are going to store data, whether it will be safe and secure, if it will be available when they need it, the costs associated with server maintenance, or whether they have enough storage available. Amazon S3 enables developers to focus on innovating with data, rather than figuring out how to store it."[2] His quote marks a milestone in the Internet's history, when massive managed resources became available to developers worldwide, allowing them to offer new scalable web-enabled technologies. In 2016 Jassy was promoted to CEO of the division.[18] Reflecting the success of AWS, his annual compensation in 2017 hit nearly $36 million.[19]
To support industry-wide training and skills standardization, AWS began offering a certification program for computer engineers, on April 30, 2013, to highlight expertise in cloud computing.[20]
James Hamilton, an AWS engineer, wrote a retrospective article in 2016 to highlight the ten-year history of the online service from 2006 to 2016. As an early fan and outspoken proponent of the technology, he had joined the AWS engineering team in 2008.[21]
Growth and Profitability[edit]
In November 2010, it was reported that all of Amazon.com's retail sites had been completely moved under the AWS umbrella.[22] Prior to 2012, AWS was considered a part of Amazon.com and so its revenue was not delineated in Amazon financial statements. In that year industry watchers for the first time estimated AWS revenue to be over $1.5 billion.[23]
In April 2015, Amazon.com reported AWS was profitable, with sales of $1.57 billion in the first quarter of the year and $265 million of operating income. Founder Jeff Bezos described it as a fast-growing $5 billion business; analysts described it as "surprisingly more profitable than forecast".[24] In October 2015, Amazon.com said in its Q3 earnings report that AWS's operating income was $521 million, with operating margins at 25 percent. AWS's 2015 Q3 revenue was $2.1 billion, a 78% increase from 2014's Q3 revenue of $1.17 billion.[25] 2015 Q4 revenue for the AWS segment increased 69.5% y/y to $2.4 billion with 28.5% operating margin, giving AWS a $9.6 billion run rate. In 2015, Gartner estimated that AWS customers are deploying 10x more infrastructure on AWS than the combined adoption of the next 14 providers.[26]
In 2016 Q1, revenue was $2.57 billion with net income of $604 million, a 64% increase over 2015 Q1 that resulted in AWS being more profitable than Amazon's North American retail business for the first time.[27] In the first quarter of 2016, Amazon experienced a 42% rise in stock value as a result of increased earnings, of which AWS contributed 56% to corporate profits.[28][29]
With a 50% increase in revenues the past few years, AWS is predicted to have $13 billion in revenue in 2017.[30]
Customer base[edit]

AWS adoption has increased since launch in 2002.


On March 14, 2006, Amazon said in a press release:[2] "More than 150,000 developers have signed up to use Amazon Web Services since its inception."


In June 2007, Amazon claimed that more than 180,000 developers had signed up to use Amazon Web Services.[31]


In November 2012, AWS hosted its first customer event in Las Vegas.[32]


On May 13, 2013, AWS was awarded an Agency Authority to Operate (ATO) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program.[33]


In October 2013, it was revealed that AWS was awarded a $600M contract with the CIA.[34]


During August 2014, AWS received Department of Defense-Wide provisional authorization for all U.S. Regions.[35]


During the 2015 re:Invent keynote, AWS disclosed that they have more than a million active customers every month in 190 countries, including nearly 2,000 government agencies, 5,000 education institutions and more than 17,500 nonprofits.


On April 5 2017, AWS and DXC Technology (formed from a merger of CSC and HPE) announced an expanded alliance to increase access of AWS features for enterprise clients in existing data centers.[36]

Notable customers include NASA,[37] the Obama presidential campaign of 2012,[38] Kempinski Hotels,[39] and Netflix.[40]
Significant service outages[edit]

On April 20, 2011, AWS suffered a major outage. Parts of the Elastic Block Store (EBS) service became "stuck" and could not fulfill read/write requests. It took at least two days for service to be fully restored.[41]


On June 29, 2012, several websites that rely on Amazon Web Services were taken offline due to a severe storm in Northern Virginia, where AWS' largest data center cluster is located.[42]


On October 22, 2012, a major outage occurred, affecting many sites such as Reddit, Foursquare, Pinterest, and others. The cause was a memory leak bug in an operational data collection agent.[43]


On December 24, 2012, AWS suffered another outage causing websites such as Netflix to be unavailable for customers in the Northeastern United States.[44] AWS cited their Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service as the cause.[45]


On February 28, 2017, AWS experienced a massive outage of S3 services in its Northern Virginia data center. A majority of websites which relied on AWS S3 either hung or stalled, and Amazon reported within five hours that AWS was fully online again.[46] No data has been reported to have been lost due to the outage. The outage was caused by a human error made while debugging, that resulted in removing more server capacity than intended, which caused a domino effect of outages.[47]

Amazon Web Services (AWS) describes both a technology and a company. The company AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon.com and provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments, on a paid subscription basis with a free-tier option available for 12 months. The technology allows subscribers to have at their disposal a full-fledged virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the internet. AWS' version of virtual computers have most of the attributes of a real computer including hardware (CPU(s) & GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory, hard-disk/SSD storage); a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, CRM, etc. Each AWS system also virtualizes its console I/O (keyboard, display, and mouse), allowing AWS subscribers to connect to their AWS system using a modern browser. The browser acts as a window into the virtual computer, letting subscribers log-in, configure and use their virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer. They can choose to deploy their AWS systems to provide internet-based services for their own and their customers' benefit.
The AWS technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world, and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary. Fees are based on a combination of usage, the hardware/OS/software/networking features chosen by the subscriber, required availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Based on what the subscriber needs and pays for, they can reserve a single virtual AWS computer, a cluster of virtual computers, a physical (real) computer dedicated for their exclusive use, or even a cluster of dedicated physical computers. As part of the subscription agreement,[3] Amazon manages, upgrades, and provides industry-standard security to each subscriber's system. AWS operates from many global geographical regions including 6 in North America.[4]
In 2016, AWS comprised more than 70 services spanning a wide range including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things. The most popular include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Most services are not exposed directly to end users, but instead offer functionality through APIs for developers to use in their applications. Amazon Web Services’ offerings are accessed over HTTP, using the REST architectural style and SOAP protocol.
Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm.[5] All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways.

Availability and Topology[edit]




Map showing Amazon Web Services' availability zones within geographic regions around the world.


As of 2017, AWS has distinct operations in the following 16 geographical "regions":[4]

North America (6 regions)

US East (Northern Virginia), where the majority of AWS servers are based[6]
US East (Ohio)
US West (Oregon)
US West (Northern California)
AWS GovCloud (US), based in the Northwestern United States, provided for U.S. government customers, complementing existing government agencies already using the US East Region[7]
Canada (Central)


South America (1 region)

Brazil (São Paulo)


Europe / Middle East / Africa (3 regions)

EU (Ireland)
EU (Frankfurt), Germany
EU (London), United Kingdom


Asia Pacific (6 regions)

Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Japan
Asia Pacific (Seoul), South Korea
Asia Pacific (Singapore)
Asia Pacific (Mumbai), India
Asia Pacific (Sydney), Australia
Asia Pacific (Beijing), China



AWS has announced that 3 new regions (having 7 Availability Zones) will come online throughout 2017 in China, India, and the United Kingdom.[4]
Each region is wholly contained within a single country and all of its data and services stay within the designated region.[3] Each region has multiple "Availability Zones",[8] which consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. Availability Zones do not automatically provide additional scalability or redundancy within a region, since they are intentionally isolated from each other to prevent outages from spreading between Zones. Several services can operate across Availability Zones (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) while others can be configured to replicate across Zones to spread demand and avoid downtime from failures.
As of December 2014, Amazon Web Services operated an estimated 1.4 Million servers across 28 availability zones.[9] The global network of AWS Edge locations consists of 54 points of presence worldwide, including locations in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America.[10]
In 2014, AWS committed to achieving 100% renewable energy usage.[11] In the United States, AWS' partnerships with renewable energy providers include:

Community Energy of Virginia, a solar farm coming online in 2016, to support the US East region.[12]
Pattern Development, in January 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm Fowler Ridge.
Iberdrola Renewables, LLC, in July 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US East.
EDP Renewables, in November 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US Central.[13]
Tesla Motors, to apply battery storage technology to address power needs in the US West (Northern California) region.[12]

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Amazon Web Services




AWS Summit 2013 event in NYC.


The AWS platform was launched in July 2002 to "expose technology and product data from Amazon and its affiliates, enabling developers to build innovative and entrepreneurial applications on their own."[2] In the beginning, the platform consisted of only a few disparate tools and services. Then in late 2003, the AWS concept was publicly reformulated when Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black presented a paper describing a vision for Amazon's retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized, completely automated, and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway. Near the end of their paper, they mentioned the possibility of selling access to virtual servers as a service, proposing the company could generate revenue from the new infrastructure investment.[15] In November 2004, the first AWS service launched for public usage: Simple Queue Service (SQS).[16] Thereafter Pinkham and lead developer Christoper Brown developed the Amazon EC2 service, with a team in Cape Town, South Africa.[17]
Amazon Web Services was officially re-launched on March 14, 2006,[2] combining the three initial service offerings of Amazon S3 cloud storage, SQS, and EC2. The AWS platform finally provided an integrated suite of core online services, as Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black had proposed back in 2003,[15] as a service offered to other developers, web sites, client-side applications, and companies.[1] Andy Jassy, AWS founder and vice president in 2006, said at the time that Amazon S3 (one of the first and most scalable elements of AWS) "helps free developers from worrying about where they are going to store data, whether it will be safe and secure, if it will be available when they need it, the costs associated with server maintenance, or whether they have enough storage available. Amazon S3 enables developers to focus on innovating with data, rather than figuring out how to store it."[2] His quote marks a milestone in the Internet's history, when massive managed resources became available to developers worldwide, allowing them to offer new scalable web-enabled technologies. In 2016 Jassy was promoted to CEO of the division.[18] Reflecting the success of AWS, his annual compensation in 2017 hit nearly $36 million.[19]
To support industry-wide training and skills standardization, AWS began offering a certification program for computer engineers, on April 30, 2013, to highlight expertise in cloud computing.[20]
James Hamilton, an AWS engineer, wrote a retrospective article in 2016 to highlight the ten-year history of the online service from 2006 to 2016. As an early fan and outspoken proponent of the technology, he had joined the AWS engineering team in 2008.[21]
Growth and Profitability[edit]
In November 2010, it was reported that all of Amazon.com's retail sites had been completely moved under the AWS umbrella.[22] Prior to 2012, AWS was considered a part of Amazon.com and so its revenue was not delineated in Amazon financial statements. In that year industry watchers for the first time estimated AWS revenue to be over $1.5 billion.[23]
In April 2015, Amazon.com reported AWS was profitable, with sales of $1.57 billion in the first quarter of the year and $265 million of operating income. Founder Jeff Bezos described it as a fast-growing $5 billion business; analysts described it as "surprisingly more profitable than forecast".[24] In October 2015, Amazon.com said in its Q3 earnings report that AWS's operating income was $521 million, with operating margins at 25 percent. AWS's 2015 Q3 revenue was $2.1 billion, a 78% increase from 2014's Q3 revenue of $1.17 billion.[25] 2015 Q4 revenue for the AWS segment increased 69.5% y/y to $2.4 billion with 28.5% operating margin, giving AWS a $9.6 billion run rate. In 2015, Gartner estimated that AWS customers are deploying 10x more infrastructure on AWS than the combined adoption of the next 14 providers.[26]
In 2016 Q1, revenue was $2.57 billion with net income of $604 million, a 64% increase over 2015 Q1 that resulted in AWS being more profitable than Amazon's North American retail business for the first time.[27] In the first quarter of 2016, Amazon experienced a 42% rise in stock value as a result of increased earnings, of which AWS contributed 56% to corporate profits.[28][29]
With a 50% increase in revenues the past few years, AWS is predicted to have $13 billion in revenue in 2017.[30]
Customer base[edit]

AWS adoption has increased since launch in 2002.


On March 14, 2006, Amazon said in a press release:[2] "More than 150,000 developers have signed up to use Amazon Web Services since its inception."


In June 2007, Amazon claimed that more than 180,000 developers had signed up to use Amazon Web Services.[31]


In November 2012, AWS hosted its first customer event in Las Vegas.[32]


On May 13, 2013, AWS was awarded an Agency Authority to Operate (ATO) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program.[33]


In October 2013, it was revealed that AWS was awarded a $600M contract with the CIA.[34]


During August 2014, AWS received Department of Defense-Wide provisional authorization for all U.S. Regions.[35]


During the 2015 re:Invent keynote, AWS disclosed that they have more than a million active customers every month in 190 countries, including nearly 2,000 government agencies, 5,000 education institutions and more than 17,500 nonprofits.


On April 5 2017, AWS and DXC Technology (formed from a merger of CSC and HPE) announced an expanded alliance to increase access of AWS features for enterprise clients in existing data centers.[36]

Notable customers include NASA,[37] the Obama presidential campaign of 2012,[38] Kempinski Hotels,[39] and Netflix.[40]
Significant service outages[edit]

On April 20, 2011, AWS suffered a major outage. Parts of the Elastic Block Store (EBS) service became "stuck" and could not fulfill read/write requests. It took at least two days for service to be fully restored.[41]


On June 29, 2012, several websites that rely on Amazon Web Services were taken offline due to a severe storm in Northern Virginia, where AWS' largest data center cluster is located.[42]


On October 22, 2012, a major outage occurred, affecting many sites such as Reddit, Foursquare, Pinterest, and others. The cause was a memory leak bug in an operational data collection agent.[43]


On December 24, 2012, AWS suffered another outage causing websites such as Netflix to be unavailable for customers in the Northeastern United States.[44] AWS cited their Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service as the cause.[45]


On February 28, 2017, AWS experienced a massive outage of S3 services in its Northern Virginia data center. A majority of websites which relied on AWS S3 either hung or stalled, and Amazon reported within five hours that AWS was fully online again.[46] No data has been reported to have been lost due to the outage. The outage was caused by a human error made while debugging, that resulted in removing more server capacity than intended, which caused a domino effect of outages.[47]

Amazon Web Services (AWS) describes both a technology and a company. The company AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon.com and provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments, on a paid subscription basis with a free-tier option available for 12 months. The technology allows subscribers to have at their disposal a full-fledged virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the internet. AWS' version of virtual computers have most of the attributes of a real computer including hardware (CPU(s) & GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory, hard-disk/SSD storage); a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, CRM, etc. Each AWS system also virtualizes its console I/O (keyboard, display, and mouse), allowing AWS subscribers to connect to their AWS system using a modern browser. The browser acts as a window into the virtual computer, letting subscribers log-in, configure and use their virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer. They can choose to deploy their AWS systems to provide internet-based services for their own and their customers' benefit.
The AWS technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world, and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary. Fees are based on a combination of usage, the hardware/OS/software/networking features chosen by the subscriber, required availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Based on what the subscriber needs and pays for, they can reserve a single virtual AWS computer, a cluster of virtual computers, a physical (real) computer dedicated for their exclusive use, or even a cluster of dedicated physical computers. As part of the subscription agreement,[3] Amazon manages, upgrades, and provides industry-standard security to each subscriber's system. AWS operates from many global geographical regions including 6 in North America.[4]
In 2016, AWS comprised more than 70 services spanning a wide range including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things. The most popular include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Most services are not exposed directly to end users, but instead offer functionality through APIs for developers to use in their applications. Amazon Web Services’ offerings are accessed over HTTP, using the REST architectural style and SOAP protocol.
Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm.[5] All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways.

Availability and Topology[edit]




Map showing Amazon Web Services' availability zones within geographic regions around the world.


As of 2017, AWS has distinct operations in the following 16 geographical "regions":[4]

North America (6 regions)

US East (Northern Virginia), where the majority of AWS servers are based[6]
US East (Ohio)
US West (Oregon)
US West (Northern California)
AWS GovCloud (US), based in the Northwestern United States, provided for U.S. government customers, complementing existing government agencies already using the US East Region[7]
Canada (Central)


South America (1 region)

Brazil (São Paulo)


Europe / Middle East / Africa (3 regions)

EU (Ireland)
EU (Frankfurt), Germany
EU (London), United Kingdom


Asia Pacific (6 regions)

Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Japan
Asia Pacific (Seoul), South Korea
Asia Pacific (Singapore)
Asia Pacific (Mumbai), India
Asia Pacific (Sydney), Australia
Asia Pacific (Beijing), China



AWS has announced that 3 new regions (having 7 Availability Zones) will come online throughout 2017 in China, India, and the United Kingdom.[4]
Each region is wholly contained within a single country and all of its data and services stay within the designated region.[3] Each region has multiple "Availability Zones",[8] which consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. Availability Zones do not automatically provide additional scalability or redundancy within a region, since they are intentionally isolated from each other to prevent outages from spreading between Zones. Several services can operate across Availability Zones (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) while others can be configured to replicate across Zones to spread demand and avoid downtime from failures.
As of December 2014, Amazon Web Services operated an estimated 1.4 Million servers across 28 availability zones.[9] The global network of AWS Edge locations consists of 54 points of presence worldwide, including locations in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America.[10]
In 2014, AWS committed to achieving 100% renewable energy usage.[11] In the United States, AWS' partnerships with renewable energy providers include:

Community Energy of Virginia, a solar farm coming online in 2016, to support the US East region.[12]
Pattern Development, in January 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm Fowler Ridge.
Iberdrola Renewables, LLC, in July 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US East.
EDP Renewables, in November 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US Central.[13]
Tesla Motors, to apply battery storage technology to address power needs in the US West (Northern California) region.[12]

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Amazon Web Services




AWS Summit 2013 event in NYC.


The AWS platform was launched in July 2002 to "expose technology and product data from Amazon and its affiliates, enabling developers to build innovative and entrepreneurial applications on their own."[2] In the beginning, the platform consisted of only a few disparate tools and services. Then in late 2003, the AWS concept was publicly reformulated when Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black presented a paper describing a vision for Amazon's retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized, completely automated, and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway. Near the end of their paper, they mentioned the possibility of selling access to virtual servers as a service, proposing the company could generate revenue from the new infrastructure investment.[15] In November 2004, the first AWS service launched for public usage: Simple Queue Service (SQS).[16] Thereafter Pinkham and lead developer Christoper Brown developed the Amazon EC2 service, with a team in Cape Town, South Africa.[17]
Amazon Web Services was officially re-launched on March 14, 2006,[2] combining the three initial service offerings of Amazon S3 cloud storage, SQS, and EC2. The AWS platform finally provided an integrated suite of core online services, as Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black had proposed back in 2003,[15] as a service offered to other developers, web sites, client-side applications, and companies.[1] Andy Jassy, AWS founder and vice president in 2006, said at the time that Amazon S3 (one of the first and most scalable elements of AWS) "helps free developers from worrying about where they are going to store data, whether it will be safe and secure, if it will be available when they need it, the costs associated with server maintenance, or whether they have enough storage available. Amazon S3 enables developers to focus on innovating with data, rather than figuring out how to store it."[2] His quote marks a milestone in the Internet's history, when massive managed resources became available to developers worldwide, allowing them to offer new scalable web-enabled technologies. In 2016 Jassy was promoted to CEO of the division.[18] Reflecting the success of AWS, his annual compensation in 2017 hit nearly $36 million.[19]
To support industry-wide training and skills standardization, AWS began offering a certification program for computer engineers, on April 30, 2013, to highlight expertise in cloud computing.[20]
James Hamilton, an AWS engineer, wrote a retrospective article in 2016 to highlight the ten-year history of the online service from 2006 to 2016. As an early fan and outspoken proponent of the technology, he had joined the AWS engineering team in 2008.[21]
Growth and Profitability[edit]
In November 2010, it was reported that all of Amazon.com's retail sites had been completely moved under the AWS umbrella.[22] Prior to 2012, AWS was considered a part of Amazon.com and so its revenue was not delineated in Amazon financial statements. In that year industry watchers for the first time estimated AWS revenue to be over $1.5 billion.[23]
In April 2015, Amazon.com reported AWS was profitable, with sales of $1.57 billion in the first quarter of the year and $265 million of operating income. Founder Jeff Bezos described it as a fast-growing $5 billion business; analysts described it as "surprisingly more profitable than forecast".[24] In October 2015, Amazon.com said in its Q3 earnings report that AWS's operating income was $521 million, with operating margins at 25 percent. AWS's 2015 Q3 revenue was $2.1 billion, a 78% increase from 2014's Q3 revenue of $1.17 billion.[25] 2015 Q4 revenue for the AWS segment increased 69.5% y/y to $2.4 billion with 28.5% operating margin, giving AWS a $9.6 billion run rate. In 2015, Gartner estimated that AWS customers are deploying 10x more infrastructure on AWS than the combined adoption of the next 14 providers.[26]
In 2016 Q1, revenue was $2.57 billion with net income of $604 million, a 64% increase over 2015 Q1 that resulted in AWS being more profitable than Amazon's North American retail business for the first time.[27] In the first quarter of 2016, Amazon experienced a 42% rise in stock value as a result of increased earnings, of which AWS contributed 56% to corporate profits.[28][29]
With a 50% increase in revenues the past few years, AWS is predicted to have $13 billion in revenue in 2017.[30]
Customer base[edit]

AWS adoption has increased since launch in 2002.


On March 14, 2006, Amazon said in a press release:[2] "More than 150,000 developers have signed up to use Amazon Web Services since its inception."


In June 2007, Amazon claimed that more than 180,000 developers had signed up to use Amazon Web Services.[31]


In November 2012, AWS hosted its first customer event in Las Vegas.[32]


On May 13, 2013, AWS was awarded an Agency Authority to Operate (ATO) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program.[33]


In October 2013, it was revealed that AWS was awarded a $600M contract with the CIA.[34]


During August 2014, AWS received Department of Defense-Wide provisional authorization for all U.S. Regions.[35]


During the 2015 re:Invent keynote, AWS disclosed that they have more than a million active customers every month in 190 countries, including nearly 2,000 government agencies, 5,000 education institutions and more than 17,500 nonprofits.


On April 5 2017, AWS and DXC Technology (formed from a merger of CSC and HPE) announced an expanded alliance to increase access of AWS features for enterprise clients in existing data centers.[36]

Notable customers include NASA,[37] the Obama presidential campaign of 2012,[38] Kempinski Hotels,[39] and Netflix.[40]
Significant service outages[edit]

On April 20, 2011, AWS suffered a major outage. Parts of the Elastic Block Store (EBS) service became "stuck" and could not fulfill read/write requests. It took at least two days for service to be fully restored.[41]


On June 29, 2012, several websites that rely on Amazon Web Services were taken offline due to a severe storm in Northern Virginia, where AWS' largest data center cluster is located.[42]


On October 22, 2012, a major outage occurred, affecting many sites such as Reddit, Foursquare, Pinterest, and others. The cause was a memory leak bug in an operational data collection agent.[43]


On December 24, 2012, AWS suffered another outage causing websites such as Netflix to be unavailable for customers in the Northeastern United States.[44] AWS cited their Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service as the cause.[45]


On February 28, 2017, AWS experienced a massive outage of S3 services in its Northern Virginia data center. A majority of websites which relied on AWS S3 either hung or stalled, and Amazon reported within five hours that AWS was fully online again.[46] No data has been reported to have been lost due to the outage. The outage was caused by a human error made while debugging, that resulted in removing more server capacity than intended, which caused a domino effect of outages.[47]

Amazon Web Services (AWS) describes both a technology and a company. The company AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon.com and provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments, on a paid subscription basis with a free-tier option available for 12 months. The technology allows subscribers to have at their disposal a full-fledged virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the internet. AWS' version of virtual computers have most of the attributes of a real computer including hardware (CPU(s) & GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory, hard-disk/SSD storage); a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, CRM, etc. Each AWS system also virtualizes its console I/O (keyboard, display, and mouse), allowing AWS subscribers to connect to their AWS system using a modern browser. The browser acts as a window into the virtual computer, letting subscribers log-in, configure and use their virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer. They can choose to deploy their AWS systems to provide internet-based services for their own and their customers' benefit.
The AWS technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world, and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary. Fees are based on a combination of usage, the hardware/OS/software/networking features chosen by the subscriber, required availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Based on what the subscriber needs and pays for, they can reserve a single virtual AWS computer, a cluster of virtual computers, a physical (real) computer dedicated for their exclusive use, or even a cluster of dedicated physical computers. As part of the subscription agreement,[3] Amazon manages, upgrades, and provides industry-standard security to each subscriber's system. AWS operates from many global geographical regions including 6 in North America.[4]
In 2016, AWS comprised more than 70 services spanning a wide range including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things. The most popular include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Most services are not exposed directly to end users, but instead offer functionality through APIs for developers to use in their applications. Amazon Web Services’ offerings are accessed over HTTP, using the REST architectural style and SOAP protocol.
Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm.[5] All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways.

Availability and Topology[edit]




Map showing Amazon Web Services' availability zones within geographic regions around the world.


As of 2017, AWS has distinct operations in the following 16 geographical "regions":[4]

North America (6 regions)

US East (Northern Virginia), where the majority of AWS servers are based[6]
US East (Ohio)
US West (Oregon)
US West (Northern California)
AWS GovCloud (US), based in the Northwestern United States, provided for U.S. government customers, complementing existing government agencies already using the US East Region[7]
Canada (Central)


South America (1 region)

Brazil (São Paulo)


Europe / Middle East / Africa (3 regions)

EU (Ireland)
EU (Frankfurt), Germany
EU (London), United Kingdom


Asia Pacific (6 regions)

Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Japan
Asia Pacific (Seoul), South Korea
Asia Pacific (Singapore)
Asia Pacific (Mumbai), India
Asia Pacific (Sydney), Australia
Asia Pacific (Beijing), China



AWS has announced that 3 new regions (having 7 Availability Zones) will come online throughout 2017 in China, India, and the United Kingdom.[4]
Each region is wholly contained within a single country and all of its data and services stay within the designated region.[3] Each region has multiple "Availability Zones",[8] which consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. Availability Zones do not automatically provide additional scalability or redundancy within a region, since they are intentionally isolated from each other to prevent outages from spreading between Zones. Several services can operate across Availability Zones (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) while others can be configured to replicate across Zones to spread demand and avoid downtime from failures.
As of December 2014, Amazon Web Services operated an estimated 1.4 Million servers across 28 availability zones.[9] The global network of AWS Edge locations consists of 54 points of presence worldwide, including locations in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America.[10]
In 2014, AWS committed to achieving 100% renewable energy usage.[11] In the United States, AWS' partnerships with renewable energy providers include:

Community Energy of Virginia, a solar farm coming online in 2016, to support the US East region.[12]
Pattern Development, in January 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm Fowler Ridge.
Iberdrola Renewables, LLC, in July 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US East.
EDP Renewables, in November 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US Central.[13]
Tesla Motors, to apply battery storage technology to address power needs in the US West (Northern California) region.[12]

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Amazon Web Services




AWS Summit 2013 event in NYC.


The AWS platform was launched in July 2002 to "expose technology and product data from Amazon and its affiliates, enabling developers to build innovative and entrepreneurial applications on their own."[2] In the beginning, the platform consisted of only a few disparate tools and services. Then in late 2003, the AWS concept was publicly reformulated when Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black presented a paper describing a vision for Amazon's retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized, completely automated, and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway. Near the end of their paper, they mentioned the possibility of selling access to virtual servers as a service, proposing the company could generate revenue from the new infrastructure investment.[15] In November 2004, the first AWS service launched for public usage: Simple Queue Service (SQS).[16] Thereafter Pinkham and lead developer Christoper Brown developed the Amazon EC2 service, with a team in Cape Town, South Africa.[17]
Amazon Web Services was officially re-launched on March 14, 2006,[2] combining the three initial service offerings of Amazon S3 cloud storage, SQS, and EC2. The AWS platform finally provided an integrated suite of core online services, as Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black had proposed back in 2003,[15] as a service offered to other developers, web sites, client-side applications, and companies.[1] Andy Jassy, AWS founder and vice president in 2006, said at the time that Amazon S3 (one of the first and most scalable elements of AWS) "helps free developers from worrying about where they are going to store data, whether it will be safe and secure, if it will be available when they need it, the costs associated with server maintenance, or whether they have enough storage available. Amazon S3 enables developers to focus on innovating with data, rather than figuring out how to store it."[2] His quote marks a milestone in the Internet's history, when massive managed resources became available to developers worldwide, allowing them to offer new scalable web-enabled technologies. In 2016 Jassy was promoted to CEO of the division.[18] Reflecting the success of AWS, his annual compensation in 2017 hit nearly $36 million.[19]
To support industry-wide training and skills standardization, AWS began offering a certification program for computer engineers, on April 30, 2013, to highlight expertise in cloud computing.[20]
James Hamilton, an AWS engineer, wrote a retrospective article in 2016 to highlight the ten-year history of the online service from 2006 to 2016. As an early fan and outspoken proponent of the technology, he had joined the AWS engineering team in 2008.[21]
Growth and Profitability[edit]
In November 2010, it was reported that all of Amazon.com's retail sites had been completely moved under the AWS umbrella.[22] Prior to 2012, AWS was considered a part of Amazon.com and so its revenue was not delineated in Amazon financial statements. In that year industry watchers for the first time estimated AWS revenue to be over $1.5 billion.[23]
In April 2015, Amazon.com reported AWS was profitable, with sales of $1.57 billion in the first quarter of the year and $265 million of operating income. Founder Jeff Bezos described it as a fast-growing $5 billion business; analysts described it as "surprisingly more profitable than forecast".[24] In October 2015, Amazon.com said in its Q3 earnings report that AWS's operating income was $521 million, with operating margins at 25 percent. AWS's 2015 Q3 revenue was $2.1 billion, a 78% increase from 2014's Q3 revenue of $1.17 billion.[25] 2015 Q4 revenue for the AWS segment increased 69.5% y/y to $2.4 billion with 28.5% operating margin, giving AWS a $9.6 billion run rate. In 2015, Gartner estimated that AWS customers are deploying 10x more infrastructure on AWS than the combined adoption of the next 14 providers.[26]
In 2016 Q1, revenue was $2.57 billion with net income of $604 million, a 64% increase over 2015 Q1 that resulted in AWS being more profitable than Amazon's North American retail business for the first time.[27] In the first quarter of 2016, Amazon experienced a 42% rise in stock value as a result of increased earnings, of which AWS contributed 56% to corporate profits.[28][29]
With a 50% increase in revenues the past few years, AWS is predicted to have $13 billion in revenue in 2017.[30]
Customer base[edit]

AWS adoption has increased since launch in 2002.


On March 14, 2006, Amazon said in a press release:[2] "More than 150,000 developers have signed up to use Amazon Web Services since its inception."


In June 2007, Amazon claimed that more than 180,000 developers had signed up to use Amazon Web Services.[31]


In November 2012, AWS hosted its first customer event in Las Vegas.[32]


On May 13, 2013, AWS was awarded an Agency Authority to Operate (ATO) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program.[33]


In October 2013, it was revealed that AWS was awarded a $600M contract with the CIA.[34]


During August 2014, AWS received Department of Defense-Wide provisional authorization for all U.S. Regions.[35]


During the 2015 re:Invent keynote, AWS disclosed that they have more than a million active customers every month in 190 countries, including nearly 2,000 government agencies, 5,000 education institutions and more than 17,500 nonprofits.


On April 5 2017, AWS and DXC Technology (formed from a merger of CSC and HPE) announced an expanded alliance to increase access of AWS features for enterprise clients in existing data centers.[36]

Notable customers include NASA,[37] the Obama presidential campaign of 2012,[38] Kempinski Hotels,[39] and Netflix.[40]
Significant service outages[edit]

On April 20, 2011, AWS suffered a major outage. Parts of the Elastic Block Store (EBS) service became "stuck" and could not fulfill read/write requests. It took at least two days for service to be fully restored.[41]


On June 29, 2012, several websites that rely on Amazon Web Services were taken offline due to a severe storm in Northern Virginia, where AWS' largest data center cluster is located.[42]


On October 22, 2012, a major outage occurred, affecting many sites such as Reddit, Foursquare, Pinterest, and others. The cause was a memory leak bug in an operational data collection agent.[43]


On December 24, 2012, AWS suffered another outage causing websites such as Netflix to be unavailable for customers in the Northeastern United States.[44] AWS cited their Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service as the cause.[45]


On February 28, 2017, AWS experienced a massive outage of S3 services in its Northern Virginia data center. A majority of websites which relied on AWS S3 either hung or stalled, and Amazon reported within five hours that AWS was fully online again.[46] No data has been reported to have been lost due to the outage. The outage was caused by a human error made while debugging, that resulted in removing more server capacity than intended, which caused a domino effect of outages.[47]

Compute[edit]

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is an IaaS service providing virtual servers controllable by an API, based on the Xen hypervisor. Equivalent remote services include Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine and Rackspace; and on-premises equivalents such as OpenStack or Eucalyptus.
Amazon Elastic Beanstalk provides a PaaS service for hosting applications, equivalent services include Google App Engine or Heroku or OpenShift for on-premises use.
Amazon Lambda (AWS Lambda) runs code in response to AWS internal or external events such as http requests, transparently providing the resource required.[48] Lambda is tightly integrated with AWS but similar services such as Google Cloud Functions and open solutions such as OpenWhisk are becoming competitors.

Networking[edit]

Amazon Route 53 provides a scalable Managed DNS service providing Domain Name Services.
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) creates a logically isolated set of AWS resources which can be connected using a VPN connection. This competes against on-premises solutions such as OpenStack or HPE Helion Eucalyptus used in conjunction with PaaS software.
AWS Direct Connect provides dedicated network connections into AWS data centers.
Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances.
AWS Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) provides up to 20Gbit/s of network bandwidth to an Amazon EC2 instance.[49]

Launched
March 2006; 11 years ago (2006-03)[1][2]


Amazon Web Services (AWS) describes both a technology and a company. The company AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon.com and provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments, on a paid subscription basis with a free-tier option available for 12 months. The technology allows subscribers to have at their disposal a full-fledged virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the internet. AWS' version of virtual computers have most of the attributes of a real computer including hardware (CPU(s) & GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory, hard-disk/SSD storage); a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, CRM, etc. Each AWS system also virtualizes its console I/O (keyboard, display, and mouse), allowing AWS subscribers to connect to their AWS system using a modern browser. The browser acts as a window into the virtual computer, letting subscribers log-in, configure and use their virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer. They can choose to deploy their AWS systems to provide internet-based services for their own and their customers' benefit.
The AWS technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world, and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary. Fees are based on a combination of usage, the hardware/OS/software/networking features chosen by the subscriber, required availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Based on what the subscriber needs and pays for, they can reserve a single virtual AWS computer, a cluster of virtual computers, a physical (real) computer dedicated for their exclusive use, or even a cluster of dedicated physical computers. As part of the subscription agreement,[3] Amazon manages, upgrades, and provides industry-standard security to each subscriber's system. AWS operates from many global geographical regions including 6 in North America.[4]
In 2016, AWS comprised more than 70 services spanning a wide range including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things. The most popular include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Most services are not exposed directly to end users, but instead offer functionality through APIs for developers to use in their applications. Amazon Web Services’ offerings are accessed over HTTP, using the REST architectural style and SOAP protocol.
Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm.[5] All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways.

Availability and Topology[edit]




Map showing Amazon Web Services' availability zones within geographic regions around the world.


As of 2017, AWS has distinct operations in the following 16 geographical "regions":[4]

North America (6 regions)

US East (Northern Virginia), where the majority of AWS servers are based[6]
US East (Ohio)
US West (Oregon)
US West (Northern California)
AWS GovCloud (US), based in the Northwestern United States, provided for U.S. government customers, complementing existing government agencies already using the US East Region[7]
Canada (Central)


South America (1 region)

Brazil (São Paulo)


Europe / Middle East / Africa (3 regions)

EU (Ireland)
EU (Frankfurt), Germany
EU (London), United Kingdom


Asia Pacific (6 regions)

Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Japan
Asia Pacific (Seoul), South Korea
Asia Pacific (Singapore)
Asia Pacific (Mumbai), India
Asia Pacific (Sydney), Australia
Asia Pacific (Beijing), China



AWS has announced that 3 new regions (having 7 Availability Zones) will come online throughout 2017 in China, India, and the United Kingdom.[4]
Each region is wholly contained within a single country and all of its data and services stay within the designated region.[3] Each region has multiple "Availability Zones",[8] which consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. Availability Zones do not automatically provide additional scalability or redundancy within a region, since they are intentionally isolated from each other to prevent outages from spreading between Zones. Several services can operate across Availability Zones (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) while others can be configured to replicate across Zones to spread demand and avoid downtime from failures.
As of December 2014, Amazon Web Services operated an estimated 1.4 Million servers across 28 availability zones.[9] The global network of AWS Edge locations consists of 54 points of presence worldwide, including locations in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America.[10]
In 2014, AWS committed to achieving 100% renewable energy usage.[11] In the United States, AWS' partnerships with renewable energy providers include:

Community Energy of Virginia, a solar farm coming online in 2016, to support the US East region.[12]
Pattern Development, in January 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm Fowler Ridge.
Iberdrola Renewables, LLC, in July 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US East.
EDP Renewables, in November 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US Central.[13]
Tesla Motors, to apply battery storage technology to address power needs in the US West (Northern California) region.[12]

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Amazon Web Services




AWS Summit 2013 event in NYC.


The AWS platform was launched in July 2002 to "expose technology and product data from Amazon and its affiliates, enabling developers to build innovative and entrepreneurial applications on their own."[2] In the beginning, the platform consisted of only a few disparate tools and services. Then in late 2003, the AWS concept was publicly reformulated when Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black presented a paper describing a vision for Amazon's retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized, completely automated, and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway. Near the end of their paper, they mentioned the possibility of selling access to virtual servers as a service, proposing the company could generate revenue from the new infrastructure investment.[15] In November 2004, the first AWS service launched for public usage: Simple Queue Service (SQS).[16] Thereafter Pinkham and lead developer Christoper Brown developed the Amazon EC2 service, with a team in Cape Town, South Africa.[17]
Amazon Web Services was officially re-launched on March 14, 2006,[2] combining the three initial service offerings of Amazon S3 cloud storage, SQS, and EC2. The AWS platform finally provided an integrated suite of core online services, as Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black had proposed back in 2003,[15] as a service offered to other developers, web sites, client-side applications, and companies.[1] Andy Jassy, AWS founder and vice president in 2006, said at the time that Amazon S3 (one of the first and most scalable elements of AWS) "helps free developers from worrying about where they are going to store data, whether it will be safe and secure, if it will be available when they need it, the costs associated with server maintenance, or whether they have enough storage available. Amazon S3 enables developers to focus on innovating with data, rather than figuring out how to store it."[2] His quote marks a milestone in the Internet's history, when massive managed resources became available to developers worldwide, allowing them to offer new scalable web-enabled technologies. In 2016 Jassy was promoted to CEO of the division.[18] Reflecting the success of AWS, his annual compensation in 2017 hit nearly $36 million.[19]
To support industry-wide training and skills standardization, AWS began offering a certification program for computer engineers, on April 30, 2013, to highlight expertise in cloud computing.[20]
James Hamilton, an AWS engineer, wrote a retrospective article in 2016 to highlight the ten-year history of the online service from 2006 to 2016. As an early fan and outspoken proponent of the technology, he had joined the AWS engineering team in 2008.[21]
Growth and Profitability[edit]
In November 2010, it was reported that all of Amazon.com's retail sites had been completely moved under the AWS umbrella.[22] Prior to 2012, AWS was considered a part of Amazon.com and so its revenue was not delineated in Amazon financial statements. In that year industry watchers for the first time estimated AWS revenue to be over $1.5 billion.[23]
In April 2015, Amazon.com reported AWS was profitable, with sales of $1.57 billion in the first quarter of the year and $265 million of operating income. Founder Jeff Bezos described it as a fast-growing $5 billion business; analysts described it as "surprisingly more profitable than forecast".[24] In October 2015, Amazon.com said in its Q3 earnings report that AWS's operating income was $521 million, with operating margins at 25 percent. AWS's 2015 Q3 revenue was $2.1 billion, a 78% increase from 2014's Q3 revenue of $1.17 billion.[25] 2015 Q4 revenue for the AWS segment increased 69.5% y/y to $2.4 billion with 28.5% operating margin, giving AWS a $9.6 billion run rate. In 2015, Gartner estimated that AWS customers are deploying 10x more infrastructure on AWS than the combined adoption of the next 14 providers.[26]
In 2016 Q1, revenue was $2.57 billion with net income of $604 million, a 64% increase over 2015 Q1 that resulted in AWS being more profitable than Amazon's North American retail business for the first time.[27] In the first quarter of 2016, Amazon experienced a 42% rise in stock value as a result of increased earnings, of which AWS contributed 56% to corporate profits.[28][29]
With a 50% increase in revenues the past few years, AWS is predicted to have $13 billion in revenue in 2017.[30]
Customer base[edit]

AWS adoption has increased since launch in 2002.


On March 14, 2006, Amazon said in a press release:[2] "More than 150,000 developers have signed up to use Amazon Web Services since its inception."


In June 2007, Amazon claimed that more than 180,000 developers had signed up to use Amazon Web Services.[31]


In November 2012, AWS hosted its first customer event in Las Vegas.[32]


On May 13, 2013, AWS was awarded an Agency Authority to Operate (ATO) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program.[33]


In October 2013, it was revealed that AWS was awarded a $600M contract with the CIA.[34]


During August 2014, AWS received Department of Defense-Wide provisional authorization for all U.S. Regions.[35]


During the 2015 re:Invent keynote, AWS disclosed that they have more than a million active customers every month in 190 countries, including nearly 2,000 government agencies, 5,000 education institutions and more than 17,500 nonprofits.


On April 5 2017, AWS and DXC Technology (formed from a merger of CSC and HPE) announced an expanded alliance to increase access of AWS features for enterprise clients in existing data centers.[36]

Notable customers include NASA,[37] the Obama presidential campaign of 2012,[38] Kempinski Hotels,[39] and Netflix.[40]
Significant service outages[edit]

On April 20, 2011, AWS suffered a major outage. Parts of the Elastic Block Store (EBS) service became "stuck" and could not fulfill read/write requests. It took at least two days for service to be fully restored.[41]


On June 29, 2012, several websites that rely on Amazon Web Services were taken offline due to a severe storm in Northern Virginia, where AWS' largest data center cluster is located.[42]


On October 22, 2012, a major outage occurred, affecting many sites such as Reddit, Foursquare, Pinterest, and others. The cause was a memory leak bug in an operational data collection agent.[43]


On December 24, 2012, AWS suffered another outage causing websites such as Netflix to be unavailable for customers in the Northeastern United States.[44] AWS cited their Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service as the cause.[45]


On February 28, 2017, AWS experienced a massive outage of S3 services in its Northern Virginia data center. A majority of websites which relied on AWS S3 either hung or stalled, and Amazon reported within five hours that AWS was fully online again.[46] No data has been reported to have been lost due to the outage. The outage was caused by a human error made while debugging, that resulted in removing more server capacity than intended, which caused a domino effect of outages.[47]

One-to-One Marketing on the Web









By Martha Rogers, Ph.D













WRITE A COMMENT



















CREDIT: 














The Peppers and Rogers Group is online at Marketing 1to1.



In the old days of the Internet--that would be 1995 and 1996--almost every new Web site attracted curious surfers. But that was before the number of sites on the Web exploded, and today it can take weeks (even months) just to get a popular search engine such as Yahoo! to record your existence. Getting your site to pop up at the top of a search is almost impossible.
Too many businesses, small and large, expect their Web site to be a source of new customers. But why does a random prospect deserve more attention than your loyal customers?
Instead, it's far easier to use the Internet to work with your current customers. You already interact in some way with your clientele through product deliveries, invoices, telephone calls, mailings, training, or product support. Adding a Web site to your roster of communication methods lets you reinforce your one-to-one service in a supercharged way.
Consider the example of Kids 'R' Kids, a rapidly growing daycare center based in Marietta, Ga.
The Kids 'R' Kids center, which cares for 130 children ages six weeks to twelve years old, uses the Web to let clients watch their children during the day.
Owner Elaine Kamienny installed 13 video cameras from ParentNet's KinderCam system throughout her center, and gave parents access to a special area on the Web to be able to see what their kids are doing at any given moment. Images are refreshed every five seconds, with plans for a real-time system soon.
Kamienny doesn't charge extra for this added service, instead citing it as "another example that we are a center of influence." She estimates that about 80% of parents access daycare images over the Web and she believes it helps them feel more connected to their kids.
Kids 'R' Kids recognized the real power of the Web, which is to develop deeper relationships with the customers it already has.
In fact, the Web provides the most cost-efficient method ever invented for interacting with customers. Even when you're sleeping, your Web site can be gathering information about the needs of individual customers and helping to satisfy those needs.
Every business can use the Web to focus on their existing customers. Here are a few ways:


Create a personal Web page for each valuable customer and log their purchases automatically on your site. Include all purchases, whether in-person, over the phone, or online. Then, invite customers to visit "their" sites and record their impressions of the products. An example: Wine Spectator Online, which includes a Personal Wine List feature. Services like this help customers keep track of their preferences over time, making it easier for a company to do a better job of suggesting other products a customer might enjoy.
Establish a "Tell Us What You Think" sneak preview section on your Web site to show off new products. Ask your customers for feedback and use it to better understand their needs and preferences. Marshall Industries, a $1 billion electronics wholesaler, has been doing this since 1994. Technology has advanced since then-- while costs have come down--to make similar solutions feasible for smaller companies.
Create a password-protected site that enables clients to see work in progress and log their comments online. Design studios and small ad agencies, in particular, can benefit from this because it's more efficient to put the work in a central location than to E-mail or snail mail it to several different people. Plus, this kind of system lets everyone see how others have reacted and whose comments are missing. An example: Rage Systems, a multimedia design company started three years ago, uses Lotus Domino software to allow round-the-clock collaboration between the firm's artists, technicians, programmers and clients.

Features like these will allow you to avoid having your site become a mundane spot on the Web. Face it: using the Web solely to post static pictures and copy--what some call "brochureware"--is like using television to broadcast a script of a TV show instead of the show itself.

Whichever ways your company chooses to use the Web, be sure you're using it to talk with customers, rather than at them.
Don Peppers and Martha Rogers are authors of the best-selling The One to One Future: Building Relationships One Customer at a Time. An excerpt of their second book, Enterprise One to One, appeared in the January 1997 issue of Inc. Peppers, Rogers, and Bruce Kasanoff are all partners in the Peppers and Rogers Group, based in Stamford, Conn.
The company's Web site Marketing 1to1 offers detailed information about one-to-one marketing techniques.
