Title: Notes on the effect of dose uncertainty













            The apparent dose-response relationship between amount of exposure to acute radiation and level of mortality in humans is affected by uncertainties in the dose values. It is apparent that one of the greatest concerns regarding the human data from Hiroshima and Nagasaki is the unexpectedly shallow slope of the dose response curve. This may be partially explained by uncertainty in the dose estimates. Some potential effects of dose uncertainty on the apparent dose-response relationship are demonstrated.

                Hi. The display is operating abnormally. That is usually symptom of a communication error between two internal boards:Attachments are only available to registered users.Register HereFirst try disconnecting the fridge from mains for five or ten minutes. After restart the fridge may:restart working normally if there is no fault and temperature is in range;display an error code if there is no fault and temperature is too low;stay with 88 88 on display, that usually means that there is a fault.If after cutting power you get abnormal display, then reset can be attempted switching in and out of test mode. This is done power freeze and fridge at the same time for 8 seconds, as shown in following picture:Attachments are only available to registered users.Register HereIf it starts, the diagnostic test will check internal parts. Different segments of the display will light up alternatively to signal that the test is taking place. After running the test, the unit may operate properly or display an error code (one or more segments lit).The test mode is canceled turning the appliance off and back on again (disconnect power).If after the power surge you still get the 88 88 for longer than two minutes, then there is a communication fault. In that case the test mode usually does not start. The following page, extracted from Samsung technical documentation for RSG5, shows the instructions to troubleshoot communication faults. If needed I can provide more detailed instructions. The job involves disassembling and testing internal parts, therefore must be done by a qualified technician:Attachments are only available to registered users.Register HereTry first disconnecting power. If that does not work try starting the test. If still no luck, then there is a problem with the electronic boards. In that case the unit must be repaired. In that case a repair can be booked using the links shown at the right hand side of the product page on Samsung support website.  Samsung will send a technician free of charge if the fridge is less than two years old. An online quote from a third party service can be obtained here.Please start disconnecting power and let me know how it goes.

"I'd like to thank vaporbeast and especially Samantha who helped me get through the age verification,I'm 73,and also help when UPS dropped my vape mail at the wrong house..I got it OK..She is a real asset to that company..Also the great service with my order of coils and a Triton Mini..The triton mini is,for me, a real step up from the nautilus mini I have used for 5 years...My old lungs can only do sort of a combo direct and MTL hits,but the mini works great either way..I will get all my vape gear from you,I will try some liquid from you soon,I like a slightly sweet tobacco..Thanks again"–Robert CSee All Reviews


"I want to Thank Vapor Beast (Phillip) for their awesome customer service!! I am a new customer, and I had an order that seemed to disappear thanks to usps..Phillip was very helpful and prompt..He made everything very easy and made sure I was satisfied even though it wasn't Vapor Beasts fault..I will definitely continue to do business with Vapor Beast..Plus their prices are great!!!!

"Hi Tod
My name is Lauren and I work for a vape store. I wanted to tell you how impressed my boss and I are with one of your representatives, Roy Oelschlager. He always keeping us up to date on the newest products, is always in a good mood when he calls us. He even made sure to call us today even though he is home sick. There are not that many employees who would go the extra mile that he does. If I ever have a question about a product for a customer, Roy is the first person that I call. He truly is an awesome employee.

"I would like to thank Jordan Wark for going above & beyond for our order today. We went back & forth quit a few times over the phone today... he waited patiently to get our order placed. After calling each other several times & Jordan calling my crew several times, Jordan impressed me even more by placing a 3 way call with him, my bank, & myself. After that conversation my order confirmation came through in a speedy fashion. Jordan impresses me & my crew every time we speak with him! Jordan is most definitely the main reason I purchase from Vapor Beast. As my businesses expand & grow quickly, Jordan is always a simple call away to get us going. Jordan is very reliable, punctual, & caring about my crew, my merchandise, & me. Jordan is the only vendor that I feel this way about. Simply because he is the only salesperson that treats me as well as he does. 
Thank you Tod for putting Jordan in charge of my region! He most definitely has our businesses synced very well!!
Sincerely,
"–Tracy S.See All Reviews


"I just wanted to tell you how AMAZING Cameron has been to me! I use to use multiple companies and I've NEVER been treated so well by a wholesaler like he treats me, and I assume how he treats everyone. I now only use vapor beast for the last year and have never been happier. The guy is one of a kind and very caring and loves his job. 

Just thought I'd give the guy some good feedback and high five him for me when you see him; tell him don't get a big head.   Tell him that's from me.  Lol.  "–Chad H.See All Reviews

It is wonderful to see such a dedicated employee, and comforting to me to know I have a representative that works so hard each day to make sure his clients have not only the best products available to them, but the best knowledge of the industry as well. I am proud to have Jordan as my representative and you should be proud to have him representing your company. He is a bright star with a very bright future in this industry.

Everything he has suggested has sold extremely well. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Jordan Wark is a huge asset to your company and I don't know where we'd be without him.

Just wanted to share with you how much we have appreciated Cam the past year. We just celebrated our first year in business on Saturday. He has been with us since the beginning. He is always available to answer all our questions and definitely makes sure to go the extra mile to make sure we are satisfied with our service. I can’t say enough great things about how much we have enjoyed him being our rep and go to person. He’s professional but still super fun and friendly. It doesn’t get much better than Cam. Just wanted to let you know because too many times supervisors get the complaints and not the good feedback. Wishing Vapor Beast continued success from Ohio!
 
Praying for many more years of vaping!

"This was my first major vaping purchase through an online vendor..up until this point I had only ordered juice online, and avoided the brick and mortar stores in my area like the plague...so when my year and a half old Ileaf/Nautilus gave up the ghost I turned to the internet for my new setup. After tons of research, VaporBeast had the best pricing/availability, and even through in an awesome sticker and a gorilla bottle on top of free shipping ( which could have been a bit snappier, but I'm impatient and that isn't their fault). Thanks a bunch guys! The sticker looks great on my computer tower. "–Dan U.See All Reviews

After almost a month, everything is sorted out and I have my order. This would have been an absolute nightmare with any other company. But you guys made it as painless as possible. It took awhile, but all of your customer service people went the extra mile for me. If only Fed Ex and the USPS were as conscientious! Thank you again!

Now as far as your products and pricing they can not be beat. Vapor beast has saved me a lot of money.I have spent a considerable amount of time on the internet price matching and no other company even comes close.

My name is George P. and I am one of the principles my vape shop, which is organized in Long Island, NY. Although we've only recently opened our doors for business, I firmly believe that our partnership with Vapor Beast has greatly attributed to our rapid and palpable success and it's especially because of the support and guidance of our account executive, Alex Valenzuela. Alex has always been available to us, without exception, to help us make intelligent decisions for our business. Regardless of the obstacle, Alex's patience and tenacity has made the difference for us. We wanted to express our sincere gratitude for all of his efforts and let you know that you have an exceptional client manager in him."–George P.See All Reviews


"Hey Mr. Campbell, I recently moved to Cincinnati from Chicago to run a smoke shop.   In doing so I met a representative of yours named Cameron Webb. Now keep in mind the only thing I knew about mods and tanks was that it produces vape when you inhale it. My second day on the job Cam told me if I had any questions or concerns to call him. Well, I most definitely did so and may have even abused that privilege. 
 He has been very helpful to the point where I'm taking time out of my busy day to write this email. I've called him with questions even when he was off the clock.  Not to mention he's even coached me through a couple sales.   Just wanted to let you know that he has been very helpful in every way possible. Have a great day.

He is always great to recommend new products and help to match prices from my other vendors. I actually got a call from him today, on a Saturday, to follow up on an order I am placing. That floored me! None of my other vendors would ever go that far as to take care of a customer. I am very impressed with him and the great service he provides me every single time I call in. He is a great asset to your company and, even though I'd hate to lose him as my rep, he deserves a raise or promotion. I can't say enough about Caleb and the level of service he provides me.

"I am writing to you today to let you know that you have quite possibly one of the best salesman ever.  I have been dealing with Vapor Beast for almost 6 months now,  and I can not describe how happy I am with the company.  Since the start I have had Cam as a salesman,  he has not only been funny and entertaining to deal with but so very knowledgeable about the products.  I don’t buy anything until I have spoken with him.  If I have had a problem he has taken care of it in a timely fashion.  I like that I can purchase most things that I carry from him and know it is going to get here in 24 hours.  I’m not going to say that I don’t order from other companies because I have had to when you are low or out of product.  I will say I don’t like to and will try hard to find replacement for the item from your catalog first.  The speed and accuracy of the company are irreplaceable to me.  And so is Cam,  he is generally the highlight of my Monday and any other time I need to talk to him.  He may not work for me but he is one of the top assets to my business.  Thank you for you time.
Sincerely,

Im glad that VaporBeast is a good Company that knows what the true definition of customer service is. I have to deal daily with these type of issues and if I did not respond and give the customer what they were asking for even as a Regional Manager I would be officially documented and placed in my file. I dont understand what is so hard about taking care of the customer. You have represented Vapor Beast very well and should be proud. I know you wont get an award or a raise for what you have done but you have my gratitude. "–AnonymousSee All Reviews

You and Vapor Beast are the best in the US. Thank you for taking the time to help me with this problem!
 
I got my Zipper Bag yesterday and I couldn't believe how nice it was and to make it even better you added a 15ml bottle of Vape Juice! I was expecting one of the old Ego cases that doesn't work for most people. I was very pleasantly surprised that you took the time to choose a case that actually fit my Mod. Plus, you gave me two of the new VB stickers and two of the old VB stickers!!
 
Vapor Beast and esp. you Teddy are awesome and even when I'm cranky about a problem, you Listen and Help!

I have never had representative from any company who has provided me with such good customer service.  He's always there to answer my questions, make recommendations and he makes a point of staying within the budget I give him. His recommendations are on spot for my area.  

As a direct result of Jordan's persistence and professionalism, you are one of my main distributors.  As a startup company it makes things much easier to find a rep that offers such good customer service and, I believe, genuinely cares about seeing their customers succeed.  I can honestly say I'm not sure if I would be ordering from you guys if it weren't for Jordan.

Thank you,

Your receptionist Betheny is just the sweetest! 

Jacob was not available, but another gentleman came out and I handed him some of Little Head's samples, he was very excited (he already loved our crazy cookie).

"I placed an order and the customer service was fantastic!  Then on Tuesday 4/6 I stopped by the newest shop in town and come to find out they are sponsored by VB.  I wrote a review to let them know I’m a promoter now. Fast forward to 4/12 and I’ve got vapemail.  I’m like a kid on Christmas.  I carefully cut the tape, open the box and…it wasn’t quite what I thought. It was or good or better.  There were 2 t-shirts 2 stickers and a personally autographed Thank You card with like 30 names including the founder. Looks like just about everyone in the main office.  I am more impressed with this company every day!

My order got cancelled and my money refunded because they were out of stock on something, then I get an email from Vapor Beast saying sorry and included a coupon for 50% off any 1 item. I had a problem using the coupon and Teddy put it through for me himself. - Now thats great customer service folks! I won't hesitate on ordering from Vapor Beast, and you shouldn't either. As I work customer service/tech support (and have for 20 years), I give praise when I see other great customer service.

"I submitted an order for the first time just the other day. To start off the deal of the day was fantastic. Upon confirming the order I set down my tablet and within a New York minute, my phone rang. There was this guy asking for me. My wife knew it was not a friend of mine and we were both confused. This gentleman introduced himself as a rep from VaporBeast and thanked me for my order. He was very pleasant and chatted with me for a little bit. He even plugged the new Kanger with the Squonk box. (can’t blame him for that.)

Now just today I walked into the new vape shop that just opened yesterday (so excited that I missed there name also). It is the first one that we have in my little town so far. After looking around and sampling a juice…I happened to look into one of the glass cases and all be… There’s a VaporBeast t-shirt. The owner Kat told me you are a sponsor of theirs and the shirt is for a grand opening raffle. 

I am more impressed with VaporBeast at every turn. So far you guys ROCK and have me as an unofficial promoter, I will definitely be at the grand opening and hope I win the shirt. 

Thanks for what you do. Helping myself and others to stay off the Cigs and supporting local businesses get started.

I had to drop you a line and let you know that I spoke with Will via telephone and he did a great job. Very friendly and helpful. What happened was...I ordered my wife a mod for her birthday and also a couple Samsung 18650's. Well, the USPS has been sitting on the package for about 10 days. I have ordered so many times from you guys (first time I ordered batteries) and skipped over the info you guys provided on how battery orders will delay package etc. via US mail. Anyway, that was my bad and he explained it all to me. I now realize I just need to be patient and not use USPS to ship batteries. I felt like I had to let you know that your staff is doing an awesome job.... but you probably already know that, Lol!

"To the fine folks at Vaporbeast, 
 
I just wanted to drop a quick line and say how happy I am with my recent order.  Your shipping was quick, I got a great price, and my order was packaged very nicely.  I bought the Lost vape epetite DNA 40 mod to replace another very unsatisfactory DNA 40 mod I just sent back. Nice and solid, I would buy another one if you had any other colors available than pink..ha
 
Anyway, I think good service and quality packaging deserve recognition.  There is lots of competition out there, but I will shop at vaporbeast.com next time I'm looking for vape supplies. 
 
Thanks again."–David CSee All Reviews


"I got a Nebox today from ya'll. Not only was shipping ridiculously cheap, super fast. My package thief's in the neighborhood didn't manage to swipe it. But it is an amazing mod and y'all had it so ridiculously cheap. I am now a fan and a customer. Referred a grip of friends ‪#‎Beastmode‬ thanks ya'll!!!"–Jesse D.See All Reviews


"Man I have to say it has been an absolute pleasure dealing with you guys so far. At my shops, we preach service before all else and it's awesome to do business with a company that obviously stresses the same.

We are in the process today of moving our second shop (different LLC and tax ID) to another location. I will need to get with you tomorrow on setting the new company up and then will place an order for the new account.

Today, I will be too busy dealing with the moving company and helping to set up the shop in its new location. 

I appreciate you reaching out and look forward to speaking with you tomorrow. Thanks!"–KenSee All Reviews


"Mid December 2015 I decided I wanted to open a Vape shop! With zero knowledge about vaping I stared to research heavily about the subject. After finding vapor beast online I quickly became aware that they were going to be my wholesaler due to their product selection. I contacted them and was put in touch with Alan. After multiple phone conversations with him I decided that vapor beast and specifically Alan was what was needed to start my shop. (BC Vape Shop) He literally coached me from beginning to end teaching me everything I needed to know about vaping. I would go over name ideas, location ideas, I'd send him pictures and everything just to get his input on creating the best possible shop that I could for the money that I had to spend. By the end of December I had gotten my starter order through vapor beast using Alan as my sales rep. He set me up with all the essentials that I needed to open. He left no stone unturned as far as making sure that I had everything I needed from starter kits to RDAs to juice to batteries! Since then I still contact Alan multiple times a week just to get information on products and get his point of view on certain vape related things. Since my Initial order I have reordered multiple times bringing in new products and replacing sold items. January 1, 2016 was my grand opening day since then I have had over $10,000 in sales (Feb 14, 2016 current date) and I know the majority of that to Alan. Literally couldn't have done it without this guy. Being a store owner I need more than just a sales rep who is going to throw products down my throat I need him to be conscious and aware of the industry and it's ever-changing atmosphere. That's what Alan does, he goes above and beyond to make sure my shop is running up to speed with everything and I have the latest and greatest in this fast-paced industry. I would recommend Alan and Vapor Beast to any individual looking to open up a vapor shop."–Robert L.See All Reviews


"Hi Tim, I wanted to compliment one of your employees Jason on the OUTSTANDING job he did helping me with my order today!!! I was asking alot of questions and and he seemed to be very knowledgeable about your products and I told him I was going to send this and tell you he needs a raise (I said it he did not)!!! I really appreciate all your help with my last issue and I don't think enough people take the time to give kudos for a job well done by yourself and Jason!!!"–Shelley S.See All Reviews


"Just emailing to say that I got my package and something was missing  and called to resolve the issue and to see what happened. So this is a thank you to the gentleman I spoke with who helped resolve this issue and admitted it was a mistake on your guys end the guy was very polite which usually doesn't happen when you call customer service and be a dick. But he fixed it sent the item out and was just very polite. Thank you again and I will definitely be shopping with VaporBeast in the future. Have a great day

"My name is Dustin F. and I am the owner of Vapeway in Bangor, Maine. Vaporbeast has been my go to wholesaler since I opened my shop in March of 2015. I love everything that you stand for and your product selection and pricing is phenomenal. However, this email does not pertain to any of that as I wanted to let you know what an awesome team you have working for the beast. 

I've been working with Roy Oelschlager for a few months now after Alan Stokes lost my region. I must say, it is the best customer service experience I have ever had in the vaping industry. I have over 95 accounts with companies around the world and I have never spoken with someone as helpful, inspiring, professional, and enthusiastic as Roy. I get stock updates, information on new products, and great insight into anything I need to know that is vape related. 

I'm sure you get dozens of emails a day, I just wanted to voice with you how awesome it is to be able to work with Roy and the rest of your team. 

Thanks so much for everything! "–Dustin F.See All Reviews


"Hi Tod, I just wanted to drop a line and tell you how much we appreciate having Cam as our rep he is very informative, helpful, and just an all around good rep, now if you believe that no I am kidding I really appreciate everything he does sometimes I get a little rough with him and give him a hard time but that is to keep him on his toes. All joking aside he does a great job , he puts up with me and that's a plus so treat him good. Good people are hard to find. Thanks for everything you guys do."–Deb Q.See All Reviews

"I started the long drudgery of online shopping for supplies. Simple search revealed Vapor Beast and all they have to offer! Now, I'm not kidding when I say my search history of online stores was bordering addiction, but something about Vapor Beast seemed good! Well, EVERYBODY, they are that good! Really good! Seriously! You now have my business, our business, and all business! And as a bonus they actually know what they are talking about! I can't remember the name of the guy that I talked to in customer service (I was the one with the 5 year old asking for candy in the background) but he answered ALL of my questions and even gave me info on equipment! Well done you guys! If you don't have it, chances are I didn't need it! "–Louise S.See All Reviews


"Hello Mr. Campbell,
My name is Abe J. I own a vape shop in Fort Collins, CO (Vape Colorado) and I am calling in regards to an employee named John Umlaf. I have had the pleasure with working with John over the past 4-6 months and it has been a treat every time we interact. John calls to check on me and genuinely cares about how my business is doing. He always goes above and beyond the call of duty, whether it is returning emails after hours or calling to touch base about important issues, John does it. John had no influence in me writing this email, I just wanted to let someone know what exemplary employee he must be for you. Hard work should never go unrecognized and John is just that a hard worker you takes care of his clients. I hope this message finds you well Mr. Campbell. Thank you and have a great day,

"I would just like to say how appreciative I am on how fast you got my order shipped out. I already own the KBox mini complete kit when it just had come out for $44.95. It's in white. You cant find one for much less than $70.00 now. Coming across your website and the price for just the mods was pretty stellar, so what the hell, i bought two more just because and free shipping for orders over $35.00 when most places I order from want you to drop $50.00+++ to get free shipping. I checked out the rest of your gear and I think you've got yourself a new customer. Great Customer Service already from you BEASTS says a lot in my book. Thanks again, I look forward to doing continued business with you.

"Hello Tod,
Hope this email finds you well and ready for the holidays.
I am the purchasing manager for the 4 locations of Deep South Vape and I wanted to send you a quick email about Jordan.
He has been our account rep for very short time but I wanted you to know that I have been very impressed. Not only does he send me a quick email about new products (which is the norm for Vapor Beast) but he follows up in a couple days with a phone to make sure I got the info (also the norm I am accustomed to) BUT he goes the extra effort of answering my questions about the products, giving honest feedback and being respectful of my time without being pushy.
My job is very demanding and I truly appreciate his honesty and "salesmanship" for lack of a better word.
Because of his feedback and the time he takes to ensure I am knowledgeable about new products I am slowly transitioning more of my product purchases from some of my other vendors and I wanted to take a quick moment to sing his praises to you. (Not something I normally do because I am a hard person to impress).
Thank you for your time and happy holidays to you and yours."–CrystalSee All Reviews


"I just wanted to take a few minutes to contact you about Ms. Taitingfong. About a month and a half ago, I was ready to start the process of opening a store. I had called and emailed several vapor suppliers only to find out that none would so much as even speak with me without an EIN. Then I found Vapor Beast and Ms. Taitingfong. From the very beginning Jocelyn was very helpful and just as importantly to me, she has a personality that outshines the sun.

I have been an avid vaper for a while and then the opportunity to open a store presented itself to me. After some consideration about the nature of this venture, I decided that it would be worth pursuing.Now, from the first conversation I had with Jocelyn to the last one, ( yesterday ) I have always received the very best customer service from her and I can't remember the last time I spoke with someone in her position that I could actually hear the smile radiating from their voice. She is an absolute joy to speak with and always has an encouraging word. She has worked very hard to accommodate any and all of my request and even answered the stupid questions I've had. 
I'm telling you sir, she has been one my best cheerleaders. From the first conversation to the follow-up on my order, she has been phenomenal!
In my opinion, Vapor Beast is very fortunate to have Jocelyn as an employee that is as dedicated to her company and customers as she is. I usually don't go to the top to let management know how their employees are performing, however, I feel that she deserves my praise. It's not always the prices that generate customers, sometimes it's also the people."–Alan F.See All Reviews


"I just wanted to write you guys, and say THANK YOU for always keeping me updated about new products, and your GREAT customer service, and fast shipment of my product. I have to admit, when I found out Seth would no longer be my rep., I was nervous that I wouldn't receive the same great customer service I was used to. But, Jordan jumped in and never missed a beat. Same BEASTLY service I'm used to!!! Thanks guys for making my job easier!!!!!!

Last month I bought a Lotus LE80 from you, the price was way below what everyone else sells it for. I have had the Lotus Jellyfish for almost a year and I refuse to give it up, very dependable! My LE80 broke and I contacted you and your customer service was really impeccable! I mailed the broken one to you on Monday and just got notice the replacement in today's mail. I highly recommend you guys to anyone!!!"–Thomas F.See All Reviews


"I just want to start off by saying that vapor best is by far the best Vape company I have ever dealt with. With that being said here is why. They have the best selection of products from accessories, ejuices, mods and tanks. Everything is amazingly priced and and to top it off they have free shipping if you spend $35 or more, which is hard not to accomplish because I can never just buy one thing. Shipping is really fast and usually takes  3 to 4 days to get to where I live in NY. Cheap prices plus free shipping equals a happy customer. They always have great customer reviews which helps in deciding if that new item is a good fit for you, knowing that others have tried it and voiced their opinions. Vapor beast also does video reviews by there product specialists which has helped me a lot with decisions on if I'm purchasing the right RDA, tank, mod, etc. It is a great first hand look as to what you can expect. They are always stocked and if they sell out of a HOT item, its not long before its back in stock. 

Not only do they have amazing products, they don't just focus on that. Their customer service is amazing as well. They are always there to help. If its a problem with an order or just have questions about how to properly set up a mod, you can feel comfortable that you will get the best feedback. They listen, take the time to explain information and always take the customers opinion into consideration. I have personally had the pleasure on several different occasions to speak with Jocelyn who deals with the Social Media and Sales aspect of the company. I recently entered an Instagram giveaway and part of entering is having to re post an image. I gladly re post it in the hopes of winning but mainly do it to help show people an amazing company and hopefully when they check them out that they have the same feeling towards Vapor Beast like I have. Well turns out I won and was very excited. It didn't take long for the prize to show up at my house. When I opened it, I"–Jake J.See All Reviews

"READ THIS. If you want crap and slow service Do Not order from here. I am extremely impressed with vaporbeast. I ordered the eleaf istick 50w later in the day, so I expected they would ship it out the next day. It was on a truck and headed to fedex in just a couple hours. They do not mess around at all. I have been looking for a place to order product and was back and forth about it, but it took me poking around for a day and I had my order the same day. And as far as the eleaf istick 50w all I can say is wow. I am more then happy about it but my wife not so much, she is tired of me gloating about the istick haha. She most definitely has more coming. So the people,customer service and product all are 5 star in my opinion. Thanks vaporbeast you are appreciated. Keep up the beast mode!"–James K.See All Reviews

I called Vapor Beast to see if they sold glass for it. As soon as they heard I hadn't even put juice in it yet they offered to send me a new tank. I was awe struck. Nobody does things like that anymore, or so I thought. I am always a little apprehensive ordering from a company I haven't used before but they have the best prices bar none and have definitely earned a valued customer for life.

If you are selling a clone you make that fact very, very clear. With all of the other vaping websites out there, I can count the number of places I trust on one hand and have fingers left over. Second, your shipping is second to none. You not only ship on your dime, but you get it sent out at lightning speed.

I received the confirmation of your gift pack! Thanks A TON my man!!!! You know you have went above and beyond in my eyes, which I already felt by the lengthy personal call in the first place! Not too many owners would take that time! I will tell you this, you have a customer for life brother. Because like I said before, I am more apt to use a company that messed up and fixed it right than a company that I don't know. So in a way the fact this happened and the way you fixed it earned you another life long customer! So you should feel good about this in a way and good about yourself as a person and an owner! I don't know what else to say except Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!!! Tim, I honestly wish you nothing but luck with your business, your family, health and anything else brother! Take care.

"Since I am new to this, and I do not have any experience with any other Clearomizers, I cannot offer a comparison. However, I can say that I have been using my iClear 30s paired up with the MVP 20 Watt, vape'n Kick Ash and I must say, I am blown away. I truly thought I would be using this sporadically, while smoking cigs at the same time (see my MVP 20 Watt review) but after 1 full day with my new setup, I haven't smoked a cig in over 2 weeks. As always, VB is the best online retailer to buy your Vape'n goods from. VB should be #1 on that Top 10 List of where to get supplies from. "–Vapin with a SmileSee All Reviews


"Thanks and keep up the excellent work Tim and staff, your passion for the people is what sets you guys apart from rest!" (Customer for life)"–Caleb H.See All Reviews


"Been vaping 6 years have bought a lot of stuff. I've never experienced such fast and free shipping and I live on the east coast! love my new MVP 20w and the price! Thank you Vapor beast ! I will be ordering plenty more! you guys Rock! "–ReneSee All Reviews


"Thank you for following up with me on this. I have to be honest, ordering and going through Vapor Beast has been a really good experience and I appreciate the professionalism you and your company exercise.  "–Tony P.See All Reviews


"Hi, I ordered an innokin Itaste 20w, an innokin 30s tank, some wire and replacement coils from you guys last week. I just wanted to tell you guys that I am very satisfied with your service. I ordered it Monday i believe around 3 PM, and i chose the free shipping. I was a little excited to get it, So I called and asked roughly when it would arrive. You guys said 4 to 5 business days and i guess you heard the disappointment in my voice because it came in the mail Thursday morning Via Priority. Any way, you definitely deserve my business and i will return for anything i need. I also referred a co worker to you guys and hope he is as ecstatic with your service as i am.
thank you
"–BrentSee All Reviews


"I just want to say you guys are turning into my main online Vape shop... Prices are decent and I can't say enough about shipping...  you are rivaling Amazon on quickness.  Just want to say Thanks and keep up the good work."–Max M.See All Reviews


"THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!! Used a coupon code for some Aero Tank MEGA's for cheap and they were ordered Friday, here MONDAY with $5 shipping!!!!!!! Amazing customer service when emailed about tracking, highly recommended!"–Danny B.See All Reviews


"I've ordered twice from these guys and I must say I give them 5 stars on all aspects!! Thanks for everything!!"–Joshua P.See All Reviews


"There are no vapor shops around me within the nearest hundred miles. Your company VaporBeast has been a great help in answering all my questions and providing me the perfect service. I have no problems with anything, this letter here is just to simply state my gratitude for all the help everyone has given me. Now, if I can only decide on my first Box Mod,Lol!"–Vernon L.See All Reviews


"Yall are GREAT! I'm so thankful i have a supplier i can count on. It has SERIOUSLY made my company look excellent when it comes to offering warranty exchanges and special orders that arrive in just 2-3 days! 
Thanks yall!

"OK, I don't know how to revise a post, but about 1/2 hour ago I posted a negative comment about this company because I hadn't received the product I ordered before Christmas. Within minutes I received a personal message from Alan asking me to call, which I did. Apparently my package was lost by USPS. It was due to arrive at my house on Dec. 22nd which would have been excellent shipping time, but it disappeared in transit. VaporBeast is going to over-night a new shipment which I really appreciate since clearly this wasn't their fault. So, I not only take back my original complaint but I sincerely have to give them 5 stars for customer service and I will definitely continue using them. Btw - their prices are also excellent."–Alice M.See All Reviews


"i just wanted your team to know that i recieved my order today in the mail, and would like to thank you for your excellent customer service! 
"–Andrew S.See All Reviews


"The screw-in threading on my EVOD VV 1600mAh battery was damaged by my using the wrong charger, and VaporBeast got me an authentic Kanger replacement from California to Virginia just two days after I ordered it even with just regular USPS shipping, for less than the cost of a knock-off over the counter at my local vape store. "–Bill H.See All Reviews


"I talked to Jean the other day and he was super helpful and I bought a Mech mod based on his recommendations. You rock buddy! I'm vaping all day now! Thank you"–John C.See All Reviews


"I purchased an item from your company, received it and did not like it. talked to Robert and he took care of it. very professional. love your company and Robert. "–Steve B.See All Reviews


"This review of The Vapor Beast is long overdue. I have been vaping for just over a year and have purchased vaping gear from a lot of different companies, but hands down the best by far is Vapor Beast. I am on disability and do not work so I have to watch every penny and my funds always go farther at Vapor Beast. Their sales and deals of the day are the best deals on the internet and nobody even comes close. Their are two other major factors why I shop at Vapor Beast. The price is one thing, but if it is not quality items crap is crap no matter how great the deal is. Also lets talk about service. I have made over 30 to 35 orders with Vapor Beast and the service is beyond your imagination. I have only had to send back one item and of course their return policy is the best in the industry . Before the week was over I had my replacement mod in my hand. I am not a big spender and most of my orders are usually under $30.00 and they still treat me like a high roller. In this world of ours you always hear about the negative end of things, but not always the shinning stars. Well Vapor Beast is a shinning star. Next time somebody says I am having a problems finding an honest on line vapor company, well you tell them you must have not tried Vapor Beast. Well I must go because I am dripping some really great juice. Happy Vaping "–STEVEN G.See All Reviews


"Thank you Vapor Beast for the great deal on the MVP 2.0! Shipping was free and SUPER fast! From CA to MI in 3 business days.. can't beat that! Will definitely do business again! The freebies were cool too!"–Melissa W.See All Reviews


"I received my order today and I couldn't be happier! My order shipped the same day and arrived on time. I ordered 4 boxes of Kanger 1.5 dual coil heads, which were at a great price by the way, for my AeroTank. I got exactly what I ordered and they are indeed authentic, as advertised. With all the clones and counterfeit items being sold as authentic, its sometimes hard to find a place you can trust. I recently got burned on a ProTank 3, I paid full price for a counterfeit item at a fairly large chain of stores in my area so now I am very cautious when i buy. But not with vaporbeast! I will most certainly  be ordering from you guys again, keep up the great work!"–Mark W.See All Reviews


"Hi Deee-Ho! This is not necessarily a general inquiry as it is a big ol SHOUT OUT! of THANK YOU! and a sincere and heart-felt "ATTA BOY" for Steve ext 7475. I am still WOWING from my experience on the phone with Steve. He provided me with excellence in customer service! His product knowledge was phenomenal! He spent the kind of time with me that made me feel like I was his only customer or even family for that matter. I say this because I had ordered a product that was most definitely not for me at this time--he realized this by asking specific questions to my needs and experience as a vaper. Instead of letting the sale go thru for financial gain he explained why it was not a good fit for me. You never and I mean never find this kind of service anymore. It is add on sales including selling snow to an Eskimos for most retail co. Please tell the powers that be that Steve is an exceptional employee who represents your company well. If all of your employees have even a part of what Steve had to offer, then your company must be as successful as successful can be. I LOVE VAPOR BEAST and STEVE! Thank you so much!"–Kathryn aka "K"See All Reviews


"Man that last order of Peach Melon was the bomb! I ordered the Pina Colada and I'm sure it will be as good or better. Thanx for the swag in the box, that was icing on the cake! Thanx again for the great service and product."–Mark H.See All Reviews
