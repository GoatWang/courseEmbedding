A STATEMENT FROM OUR CEO


     



Greetings,


         
    

On March 9, 2017, Notis Global finalized an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
        whereby the company agreed to abide by current and future regulations.  Other than agreeing to the terms of the consent decree, Notis Global was not subjected to any fine or
        penalty.  With the consent decree, Notis Global formally severs any and all ties to the former senior executives of MedBox, Inc.—thereby closing a sad, long-ended chapter in the
        company’s history.


         
    

We, the new Notis Global executive team, have spent the past 30 months cleaning up and moving beyond what had
        been MedBox, Inc.  At the same time, we developed and have been executing our new business plan, which is beginning to show early signs of success.


         
    


In the coming weeks and months, we expect to have good, going-forward news to share.


     


In the meantime, I and the executive team remain committed to running Notis Global with the highest of standards
    and ethics.


     


Jeff Goh, President & CEO

Strategy - Notis Global, Inc.




 





 



























Strategy







Notis Global's focus is on quality products, compliance, operational excellence, consumer safety and continuous innovation.


     


    Our strategy is to build the company’s portfolio of cultivation, branded product assets, and proprietary hemp strains and genetics. We will leverage its expertise to design industry-leading
    facilities and implement a proven operational process that will help to ensure quality, consistency, and profitable yields.


     


BRAND DEVELOPMENT


    Notis Global focuses on developing, acquiring and designing products and brands in the clinical non-psychoactive, high cannabidiol (“CBD”) hemp extracts sectors. We intend to build a portfolio of
    differentiated brands that target high-value demographics and which have the potential to become recognized nationally.


     


BUILD A CONNECTED DISTRIBUTION NETWORK


    Through strategically acquiring companies that already have attained the required licenses for cultivation, extraction and/or CBD-infused product operations, as well as signing new operators, in
    specific geographical markets this connected distribution network will generate recurring revenue and success for the company. Notis Global will be able to leverage this growing network of
    operators and CBD-infused product and extract brands to begin laying the foundation for a national seed to sale supply chain network and streamlined marketing channel, helping help to attract
    more Operators and Infused Product Brands interested in rolling up into the Notis Global umbrella.


     


STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS


    As an increasing number of markets come online, Notis Global will be able to strategically invest in companies that have already attained the required licenses for cultivation, retail,
    extraction, and/or CBD-infused product operations in specific geographical markets. Due to the powerful trends driving the opportunity in today’s emerging hemp industry, Notis Global intends to
    focus on companies with the following company traits:


Compliance: Companies need rigid adherence to applicable laws and regulations


Management: Highly qualified, talented, and professional management


Scale: Companies need economies of scale in order to be competitive in the long run


Timing: Aggressive movement is needed to capitalize on the early stage of the industry and acquire significant market share

(p/k/a Medbox, Inc.) (the “Company”) and the individual defendants entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (the “Stipulation”) in the following previously disclosed stockholder derivative lawsuits: (1) Mike Jones v. Guy Marsala, et al., in the U.S. District Court for Central District of California; (2) Jennifer Scheffer v. P. Vincent Mehdizadeh, et al., in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada; (3) Kimberly Y. Freeman v.

The settlement is dependent upon final approval by the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the “Court”).      On October 27, 2016, Richard Merritts (“Merritts”) filed a stockholder derivative lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles (the “Merritts Action”).  On April 22, 2016, the Court issued an Order granting Merritts’ Motion to Intervene in the lawsuit titled Mike Jones v.

The Order granting the Motion to Intervene also continued the final fairness hearing in the Derivative Actions, previously scheduled for May 16, 2016, at 1:30 p.m., to August 15, 2016, at 1:30 p.m.      On August 2, 2016, the Court issued another Order continuing the final fairness hearing in the Derivative Actions, previously scheduled for August 15, 2016, at 1:30 p.m., to September 22, 2016, at 1:30 p.m. The Court also ordered that opening briefs and supporting documents in support of final approval of the settlement shall be filed on or before August 15, 2016, that all objections of Notis Global shareholders to the settlement shall be filed on or before August 29, 2016, and that all reply papers in support of the settlement and responses to shareholder objections shall be filed on or before September 12, 2016.      On August 19, 2016, the Court issued another Order continuing the final fairness hearing in the Derivative Actions, previously scheduled for September 22, 2016, at 1:30 p.m., to October 17, 2016, at 1:30 p.m. The Court also ordered that opening briefs and supporting documents in support of final approval of the settlement shall be filed on or before September 9, 2016, that all objections of Notis Global shareholders to the settlement shall be filed on or before September 23, 2016, and that all reply papers in support of the settlement and responses to shareholder objections shall be filed on or before October 7, 2016.      On September 16, 2016, solely to avoid the costs, risks, and uncertainties inherent in litigation, the parties entered into a settlement regarding Merritts’ claims in the Merritts Action. The settlement provides, among other things, for the release and dismissal of all asserted claims.     On September 26, 2016, the Court issued an Order scheduling the final fairness hearing for the settlement in the Merritts Action for October 17, 2016 at 1:30 p.m. The Court also ordered Merritts to file his Motion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement on or before September 23, 2016 and his Motion for Final Approval of Settlement on or before October 3, 2016.  The Court also ordered that all objections of Notis Global shareholders to the settlement of the Merritts Action shall be filed on or before October 7, 2016 and that all reply papers in support of the settlement and responses to shareholder objections shall be filed on or before October 10, 2016.

Medbox, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:15-CV-00426-BRO (JEMx), pending before the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the “Court”) notified the Court of a settlement. The Court stayed the action pending the Court’s review of the settlement and directed the parties to file a stipulation of settlement. On December 18, 2015, plaintiffs filed the Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement that included the stipulation of settlement. On February 3, 2016, the Court issued an Order granting preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement provides for notice to be given to the class, a period for opt outs and a final approval hearing. The Court had scheduled the Final Settlement Approval Hearing to be held on May 16, 2016 at 1:30 p.m.
On May 13, 2016, the Court issued an Order continuing the final fairness hearing to August 15, 2016, at 1:30 p.m.

Derivative Actions – Notice of Change of Date for Final Fairness Hearing and Stipulation of Settlement Agreement in Merritts Derivative Action
                            As previously reported in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, as well as on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2016, on October 16, 2015, solely to avoid the costs, risks, and uncertainties inherent in litigation, Notis Global, Inc. (p/k/a Medbox, Inc.) (the “Company”) and the individual defendants entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (the “Stipulation”) in the following previously disclosed stockholder derivative lawsuits: (1) Mike Jones v. Guy Marsala, et al., in the U.S. District Court for Central District of California; (2) Jennifer Scheffer v. P. Vincent Mehdizadeh, et al., in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada; (3) Kimberly Y. Freeman v. Pejman Vincent Mehdizadeh, et al., in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada; (4) Tyler Gray v. Pejman Vincent Mehdizadeh, et al., in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada; (5) Robert J. Calabrese v. Ned L. Siegel, et al., in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada; (6) Patricia des Groseilliers v. Pejman Vincent Mehdizadeh, et al., in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada; (7) Michael A. Glinter v. Pejman Vincent Mehdizadeh, et al., in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles (collectively, the “Derivative Actions”) brought against certain current and former officers and directors (as previously disclosed). The settlement is dependent upon final approval by the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the “Court”).      On October 27, 2016, Richard Merritts (“Merritts”) filed a stockholder derivative lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles (the “Merritts Action”).  On April 22, 2016, the Court issued an Order granting Merritts’ Motion to Intervene in the lawsuit titled Mike Jones v. Guy Marsala, et al., in order to conduct limited discovery. The Order granting the Motion to Intervene also continued the final fairness hearing in the Derivative Actions, previously scheduled for May 16, 2016, at 1:30 p.m., to August 15, 2016, at 1:30 p.m.      On August 2, 2016, the Court issued another Order continuing the final fairness hearing in the Derivative Actions, previously scheduled for August 15, 2016, at 1:30 p.m., to September 22, 2016, at 1:30 p.m. The Court also ordered that opening briefs and supporting documents in support of final approval of the settlement shall be filed on or before August 15, 2016, that all objections of Notis Global shareholders to the settlement shall be filed on or before August 29, 2016, and that all reply papers in support of the settlement and responses to shareholder objections shall be filed on or before September 12, 2016.      On August 19, 2016, the Court issued another Order continuing the final fairness hearing in the Derivative Actions, previously scheduled for September 22, 2016, at 1:30 p.m., to October 17, 2016, at 1:30 p.m. The Court also ordered that opening briefs and supporting documents in support of final approval of the settlement shall be filed on or before September 9, 2016, that all objections of Notis Global shareholders to the settlement shall be filed on or before September 23, 2016, and that all reply papers in support of the settlement and responses to shareholder objections shall be filed on or before October 7, 2016.      On September 16, 2016, solely to avoid the costs, risks, and uncertainties inherent in litigation, the parties entered into a settlement regarding Merritts’ claims in the Merritts Action. The settlement provides, among other things, for the release and dismissal of all asserted claims.     On September 26, 2016, the Court issued an Order scheduling the final fairness hearing for the settlement in the Merritts Action for October 17, 2016 at 1:30 p.m. The Court also ordered Merritts to file his Motion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement on or before September 23, 2016 and his Motion for Final Approval of Settlement on or before October 3, 2016.  The Court also ordered that all objections of Notis Global shareholders to the settlement of the Merritts Action shall be filed on or before October 7, 2016 and that all reply papers in support of the settlement and responses to shareholder objections shall be filed on or before October 10, 2016.
     The disclosure set forth herein provides notice to potential objectors of the settlement and the foregoing information and notice to potential objectors of the change to the hearing date.
Class Action - Notice of Change of Date for Final Fairness Hearing      As previously reported in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, on December 1, 2015, Notis Global and the class plaintiffs in Josh Crystal v. Medbox, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:15-CV-00426-BRO (JEMx), pending before the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the “Court”) notified the Court of a settlement. The Court stayed the action pending the Court’s review of the settlement and directed the parties to file a stipulation of settlement. On December 18, 2015, plaintiffs filed the Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement that included the stipulation of settlement. On February 3, 2016, the Court issued an Order granting preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement provides for notice to be given to the class, a period for opt outs and a final approval hearing. The Court had scheduled the Final Settlement Approval Hearing to be held on May 16, 2016 at 1:30 p.m.
On May 13, 2016, the Court issued an Order continuing the final fairness hearing to August 15, 2016, at 1:30 p.m.
On August 3, 2016, the Court issued another Order continuing the final fairness hearing to September 22, 2016, at 1:30 p.m.
On September 13, 2016, the Court issued another Order continuing the final fairness hearing to October 17, 2016, at 1:30 p.m.

Micro Cap Insider, Street Watch




Notis Global Inc (OTCMKTS:MDBX) is the new name for Medbox Inc. The stock has been in massive decline in recent months as huge blocks of newly printed shares have hit the market decimating currently shareholders and taking the O/S from a manageable 35 million in May to over 240 million.
MDBX is also unmatched in its ability to sell the sizzle on the pot sector and getting themselves featured in mainstream media. There are plenty of reasons for pot stocks to heat up this year; a number of states are moving towards one form of legalization or another. Billionaire Richard Branson suggesting a decriminaliztion ammendment in the U.N., 6,000 non-violent drug offenders released last year, Australia lifting ban on medical mj, New York opening medical mj dispensaries, Colorado revenues increasing are more catalysts.
Notis Global Inc (OTCMKTS:MDBX) bills itself as a pioneer in the burgeoning, multi-billion dollar legal cannabis industry. The company and its partners are working to bring best practices and drive significant revenues in the cannabis industry. Through key partnerships, Notis is a leading U.S. based provider of Cannabidiol (CBD) oil and is a partner in one of the largest hemp operations in the United States.
The Company’s original claim to fame was a free standing vending machine that dispenses packaged pot. The Company touts its cashless inventory control system whose biometric thumbprint scan and Company-issued debit card ensure that only those with prescriptions can get access to the product inside. Medbox has been awarded United States & Canadian Patents concerning the software and hardware related to their medicine dispensing systems.
MDBX has been hugely successful getting their brand into the national media with features on MDBX in CNN, ABCNews, Reuters, BBC, Fox Business, Bloomberg TV, CNBC, Associated Press, NPR, and company has been featured in articles appearing in Newsweek, Bloomberg BusinessWeek, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, and the Wall Street Journal, as well as over 30 other news agencies around the world.

Earlier this year MDBX announced it has signed an agreement to purchase 320-acres of agricultural land in Pueblo, Colorado. Terms of the transaction, which is expected to be completed in August 2015, were not disclosed.
In what will be one of the largest cultivation centers in Colorado, Medbox plans to engage a licensed grower of hemp and marijuana, which it will advise on operations matters, ensuring proper oversight and compliance in the cultivation of high-quality commercial grade marijuana and hemp in a safe, controlled environment.
MDBX said they completed a $4.5 million financing with its existing lenders. CEO Jeff Goh said “We are pleased to have completed this additional round of funding, which demonstrates confidence in Medbox and its future. The funds will be used for corporate purposes, including further implementation of our strategic growth plan.”
In January of this year, MDBX purchased a two-story, 7,500 square-foot retail property in San Diego, CA which they plan to refurbish as a medical marijuana dispensary that is scheduled to open in May. The Company plans to assist with the build-out of the property and will consult with the dispensary operator, Rise Industries, Inc., on compliance, training and related matters. MDBX will be paid a fee for its services, expected to approximate half of the dispensary’s annual profits. The purchase price of the building was just ujnder $1 million US and the Company was awarded a Conditional Use Permit granting them a license for the operation of the dispensary.
On February 23 MDBX announced the launch of its new company name, visual brand identity and website. Notis specializes in cultivation, production and consulting and will bring operational excellence and pioneering expertise to the multi-billion dollar, worldwide legal cannabis industry. Notis will begin trading under the symbol NGBL, starting March 21, 2016.
CEO Jeff Goh said “We have a tremendous opportunity to help define and elevate the legal cannabis industry, moving it into a more mature and accepted mainstream product. Together, our leadership team and Board of Directors have the business background and savvy to guide cannabis advancement as laws change across the country and around the world.”

Former Frito Lay Executive Jeff Goh Leads Company as President and CEO
Los Angeles, California (FSCwire) - Notis Global Inc. ("Notis"), formerly Medbox, Inc. (OTCQB MDBX) today announced the launch of its new company name, visual brand identity and website.

Legal cannabis is one of the fastest growing industries in the United States. It is projected to be worth $4.4 billion this year according to California research company ArcView, up from $2.7 billion in 2014. Already, 23 states and Washington D.C. have legalized medical marijuana and up to 14 states are expected to put legalization initiatives on voting ballots this November.

"Global" to reflect the company's strategy to focus on international partnerships and establish a worldwide presence.
"Our goal is to grow confidence in cannabis and its positive attributes, specifically health and wellness," said Aron Levinson, Notis Global SVP of business and brand development. "It is important for our brand to reflect credibility, compliance and consistency as we respond to the growing worldwide demand for cannabis products."
In conjunction with its partners, including Whole Hemp Company, Notis is on track to be one of the largest U.S. growers, processors and revenue producers of hemp products from seed to sale. With cultivation facilities located in Pueblo, Colo., Notis uses best farming practices, growing product outdoors and in greenhouse facilities. Notis is positioned to become a leading U.S. based provider of Cannabidiol (CBD) oil with a dedicated sales team, driving revenue and bringing the product to market. Through key partnerships, Notis is working with some of the world's leading researchers on continuous innovations of CBD-related medical products to help patients around the world.
"We strongly believe this industry will continue to grow and we are ready to lead its maturation, working withour partners toward cultivating and bringing the best products to consumers and researchers around the world," Goh said. "As new legislation is approved across the U.S., we have a strong established operation in place to serve the growing demand."
