Dinner Celebrating Thierry Brouin and Domaine des Lambrays6:30 pm Champagne Delamotte receptionGünter Seeger NY - 641 Hudson Street, New York, NY 10014$1,500.00The legendary vineyard of Clos des Lambrays ranks among the most hallowed Grand Crus of Burgundy and its reputation has only gained in prominence under the auspices of winemaker Thierry Brouin, who will retire in 2017 after spending the past 35 years working with this extraordinary terroir. This dinner at one of New York City's hottest restaurants and newly Michelin-starred Günter Seeger NY, will celebrate Thierry’s remarkable career and will present wines from a range of Domaine des Lambrays’ impressive holdings, as well as an unforgettable vertical of Clos des Lambrays, nearly all served from magnums sourced directly from the estate. A tasting menu prepared by celebrated Chef Günter Seeger will culminate with the 1938 vintage which, Thierry hastens to add, he was not yet alive to make, but that is an elegant, perfumed testament to the timelessness of this magical vineyard.Champagne Delamotte, Blanc de Blancs 2000 en magnumPuligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos du Cailleret 2015 en magnumPuligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Clos du Cailleret 2008 en magnumPuligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières 2011 en magnumPuligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Folatières 2010 en magnumMorey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Les Loups 2005 en magnumMorey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Les Loups 1996 en magnumClos des Lambrays Grand Cru 2014 en magnumClos des Lambrays Grand Cru 2012 en magnumClos des Lambrays Grand Cru 2009 en magnumClos des Lambrays Grand Cru 2001 en magnumClos des Lambrays Grand Cru 1995 en magnumClos des Lambrays Grand Cru 1985 en magnumClos des Lambrays Grand Cru 1938
