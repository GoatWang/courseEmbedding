James E. Mikolaichik

MCLEAN, VA—Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc., has appointed James E. Mikolaichik as CFO of Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV) in advance of the planned separation of the timeshare business from Hilton later this year.
Mikolaichik will oversee the company's finance and accounting organizations and will play a crucial role in the development and implementation of HGV's corporate and financial strategies, according to the company. His appointment as CFO will be effective in August, and he will report to Mark Wang, president and CEO, Hilton Grand Vacations.
"Jim is a great addition to the HGV leadership team and we are confident his leadership and experience will contribute greatly to the long-term success of the HGV business," stated Christopher J. Nassetta, president and CEO, Hilton. "With Jim's appointment, we now have CEOs and CFOs in place for both our planned REIT, Park Hotels & Resorts, and HGV businesses, which represents a major milestone in our path to completing the separation later this year."
"After a thorough and deliberate search process, we are thrilled to have Jim join us," said Mark Wang, president and CEO, Hilton Grand Vacations. "He brings extensive financial planning and strategy experience to the team and will play a critical role as we continue to lead the timeshare industry."
Mikolaichik joins HGV from Manning & Napier, Inc., an approximately $37-billion investment management firm, where he was CFO. He was responsible for strategic and financial planning, financial reporting, tax, corporate development, investor relations, internal audit and human resources. Prior to Manning & Napier, he was with Old Mutual Asset Management as EVP, head of strategy and co-head of fund operations, as well as chief risk officer. Mikolaichik also worked for Deloitte LLP in various roles from 1993 to 2004.
"I can't imagine a more exciting time to join Hilton Grand Vacations," Mikolaichik said. "I look forward to working with Mark and the entire Hilton leadership team to ensure a successful separation and position HGV as a long-term growth and capital-efficient timeshare business."

With Rise in Travel Spending, Dreams Can Come True
        I took a summer vacation to Alaska. This natural beauty of a state might be our 49th, but it was my 50th. Why all this talk of my summer vacation? Well, Allianz Global Assistance (AGA) just released data earlier this week saying that Americans are spending more on summer vacations this year, topping $100 billion for the first time in the AGA survey’s eight-year history. This represents a 12.5% increase over last year.
