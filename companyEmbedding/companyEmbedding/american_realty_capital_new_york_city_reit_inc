Invest in 1031 Eligible PropertiesDefer Capital Gains on Your Real Estate Investment.Become a 1031 Investor 







What is a 1031 Exchange?
A 1031 exchange is a powerful wealth management tool. Real estate investors can defer their capital gains tax on the sale of a property if they reinvest the proceeds in another qualifying property under the Internal Revenue Code Section 1031.


 










1031 Exchange Benefits:


Defer capital gains taxes on the sale of your property.
Invest in cash flowing properties and look to receive monthly distributions.
Ensure certainty of closing and avoid property management headaches.
Diversify your portfolio with a broad range of geography and property types.



 









1031 Exchange Risks:


A 1031 Exchange is a complicated transaction. Investors should consult their tax professionals.
The underlying investments in Real Estate are Illiquid Investments.
Investors who fail to complete their 1031 exchange in the allowable time (typically 180 days) lose their capital gains tax protection.
Each investment has its own risks and the investor should review offering materials for a full review of those risks.

Strategy
NYC REIT has focused and intends to continue focusing our investment activities on acquiring quality, income-producing commercial real estate located in the five boroughs of New York City and, in particular, properties located in Manhattan. We may also originate or acquire real estate debt backed by quality, income-producing commercial real estate located predominantly in New York City. The real estate debt, which we may also originate or acquire is expected to be primarily first mortgage debt but also may include bridge loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity or securitized loans
The three primary objectives are*:

Preserve and protect capital
Pay monthly stable cash distributions; and
Increase the value of assets in order to generate capital appreciation.



     *There is no guarantee these objectives will be met.

Risk Factors
There are risks associated with an investment in American Realty Capital New York City REIT, Inc. The following is a summary of some of these risks. See the section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of the risks which should be considered in connection with your investment.


We have a limited operating history which makes our future performance difficult to predict; 
All of our executive officers are also officers, managers or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor, New York City Advisors, LLC (our "Advisor") and other entities affiliated with AR Global Investments, LLC (the successor business to AR Capital, LLC, "AR Global"); as a result, our executive officers, our Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our Advisor’s compensation arrangements with us and other investor entities advised by AR Global affiliates, and conflicts in allocating time among these entities and us, which could negatively impact our operating results; 
We depend on tenants for our revenue and, accordingly, our revenue is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants; 
We may not be able to achieve our rental rate objectives on new and renewal leases and our expenses could be greater, which may impact operations; 
Our properties may be adversely affected by economic cycles and risks inherent to the New York metropolitan statistical area ("MSA"), especially New York City; 
We are obligated to pay fees, which may be substantial, to our Advisor and its affiliates; 
We may fail to continue to qualify to be treated as a real estate investment trust for United States federal income tax purposes ("REIT"); 
Because investment opportunities that are suitable for us may also be suitable for other AR Global-advised programs or investors, our Advisor and its affiliates may face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase of properties and other investments and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, meaning that we could invest in less attractive assets, which could reduce the investment return to our stockholders; 
No public market currently exists, or may ever exist, for shares of our common stock and our shares are, and may continue to be, illiquid; 
Our stockholders are limited in their ability to sell their shares pursuant to our share repurchase program (the "SRP") and may have to hold their shares for an indefinite period of time;
If we and our Advisor are unable to find suitable investments, then we may not be able to achieve our investment objectives, or pay distributions with cash flows from operations; 
Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and limit our ability to pay distributions; 
We do not expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund distributions at our current level, and there can be no assurance we will be able to continue paying cash distributions at our current level or at all; 
 We may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"), and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act; and
As of December 31, 2016, we owned only six properties and therefore have limited diversification.

Investment Goals and Objectives
NYC REIT seeks to create value for shareholders through the execution of the following goals and objectives:

Maximize Total Shareholder Returns through a combination of realized appreciation and current income.
Pay Distributions out to shareholders on a monthly basis1
Maintain Low Leverage - financing the portfolio at a target level of not more than 40% to 50% loan-to-value
Target a Potential Liquidity Event within three to six years from the close of initial offering2
New York City Focus to acquire high-quality commercial real estate located in the five boroughs of New York City, and in particular, Manhattan
Diversified Tenant Mix leased to a diversified group of tenants with a bias toward lease terms of five years or greater




(1) Distributions are not guaranteed. A portion of the distributions paid in cash has exceeded cumulative cash flow from operations and has been paid out of cash on hand and proceeds from the IPO.
(2) If the board does not decide to purse a liquidity event, or the stockholders do not approve a liquidity event, we could continue to operate indefinitely.

 BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. 

Purpose. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and any AR Global Entity regarding the Website or any service thereon, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Section (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. If you have a Dispute with any AR Global Entity or any of their officers, directors, employees or agents that cannot be resolved through negotiation within the time frame described in the “Notice of Dispute” clause below, other than those matters listed in the Exclusions from Arbitration clause, you and the entity that you have a Dispute with agree to seek resolution of the Dispute only through arbitration of that Dispute in accordance with the terms of this Section, and not litigate any Dispute in court. Arbitration means that the Dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.
Exclusions from Arbitration. YOU AND THE AR GLOBAL ENTITIES AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY ANY AR GLOBAL ENTITY IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION.
RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE MAILED TO AR GLOBAL GENERAL COUNSEL, 405 PARK AVENUE, 14TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10022 AND MUST INCLUDE: (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, (3) YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER, IF YOU HAVE ONE, AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH THE AR GLOBAL ENTITIES THROUGH ARBITRATION.
Notice of Dispute. IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ANY AR GLOBAL ENTITY, YOU MUST SEND WRITTEN NOTICE TO AR GLOBAL General Counsel, 405 Park Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, NY 10022 TO GIVE SUCH AR GLOBAL ENTITY YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE
INFORMALLY THROUGH NEGOTIATION. You agree to negotiate resolution of the Dispute in good faith for no less than 60 days after you provide notice of the Dispute. If AR Global or the AR Global Entity you have a Dispute with does not resolve your Dispute within 60 days from receipt of notice of the Dispute, you, AR Global or the AR Global Entity you have a Dispute with may pursue your claim in arbitration pursuant to the terms in this Section.
Class Action Waiver. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE AR GLOBAL ENTITY WITH WHICH YOU HAVE A DISPUTE SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION. 
Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator. If you or the entity you have a Dispute with elect to resolve your Dispute through arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS www.jamsadr.com. The terms of this Section govern in the event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration organization selected by the parties.
Arbitration Procedures. Because the software and/or service provided to you by the entity you have a Dispute with concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, applicable federal or state law may also apply to the substance of any Disputes. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (“Supplementary Procedures”) shall apply including the schedule of arbitration fees set forth in Section C-8 of the Supplementary Procedures; for claims over $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to and negotiated in good faith with the entity you had a Dispute with as described above, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law afforded to the entity you have a Dispute with or you. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
Location of Arbitration. You or the entity you have a Dispute with may initiate arbitration in either New York County, New York or the county in which you reside. In the event that you select the county of your residence, the entity you have a Dispute with may transfer the arbitration to New York County, New York in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the change in location as determined by the arbitrator.
Severability. If any clause within this Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section, and the remainder of this Section will be given full force and effect.
Continuation. This Section shall survive any termination of these Terms and Conditions or the provision of the associated services to you.

 EQUITABLE RELIEF. You acknowledge that any use or threatened use of the Website or Content in a manner inconsistent with these Terms and Conditions shall cause immediate irreparable harm to AR Global and/or the other AR Global Entities for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that AR Global and the other AR Global Entities shall be entitled to immediate and permanent injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any such breach or threatened breach by you. You agree and stipulate that AR Global and the AR Global Entities shall be entitled to such injunctive relief without posting a bond or other security; provided however that if the posting of a bond is a prerequisite to obtaining injunctive relief, then a bond in the amount of $1000 shall be sufficient. Nothing contained herein shall limit the right of AR Global or any other AR Global Entities to any remedies at law, including without limitation the recovery of damages from you for breach of these Terms and Conditions, as applicable.
 ASSIGNMENT. THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE PERSONAL TO YOU AND YOU MAY NOT ASSIGN, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BY OPERATION OF LAW, CHANGE OF CONTROL OR OTHERWISE, THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, EITHER IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO ANYONE. ANY ATTEMPT TO ASSIGN THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTRARY TO THIS SECTION WILL BE VOID AND HAVE NO EFFECT.

AR Capital, the real estate investment company built by Nicholas S. Schorsch and William M. Kahane, said Monday that it would stop creating new investment products and close existing ones to new investors to focus on managing the $19 billion it has in current investments.The company cited “regulatory and market uncertainty” that was affecting its ability to raise investor money.The New York-based firm, once called American Realty Capital, is one of the biggest sponsors of nontraded real estate investment trusts, but it is in the center of a maelstrom.Its most recent troubles began with the collapse a week ago of a $378 million deal to sell a 60 percent stake of a newly formed company holding the $19 billion of assets to the private equity giant Apollo Global Management.

Then on Thursday, Massachusetts’s securities regulator accused an affiliate of the firm — Realty Capital Securities — of faking proxy votes for a September special meeting of shareholders in one of AR Capital’s sponsored investment vehicles. Continue reading the main story

Realty Capital Securities is part of RCS Capital, a publicly traded broker that said last week it was facing possible delisting by the New York Stock Exchange. Its share price has slumped since an accounting scandal at one of Mr. Schorsch’s investment vehicles forced him to resign from the management of American Realty Capital Properties and boards of affiliated entities last year.In its administrative complaint on Thursday, the Massachusetts securities division said the faked votes were for a shareholder meeting that was a prerequisite to having the deal with Apollo move forward.AR Capital said on Monday that Realty Capital Securities would discontinue proxy activities for AR Capital-sponsored vehicles because of the Massachusetts investigation.

AR Capital’s woes come as regulators take a closer look at how nontraded REITs are sold to investors. Nontraded REITs, which invest in various types of real estate, are typically sold through advisers. Unlike publicly traded REITs, nontraded REITs are difficult to sell or liquidate.“There were serious problems with their lack of transparency and the interrelationship with affiliated companies,” said Michael Kitces, the director of financial planning at Pinnacle Advisory Group in Columbia, Md.In September, the broker LPL Financial agreed to pay $1.4 million in a settlement with state regulators regarding its sales practices for nontraded REITs.Regulators have proposed new fiduciary standards for advisers and mandated new disclosures on fees and costs that cut into investors’ principal. AR Capital seems to be saying, Mr. Kitces said, “now that the market is requiring transparency, we don’t think we can sell these any more.”Mr. Kahane, AR Capital’s co-founder, said in a statement on Monday regarding the regulatory changes, “Until there is greater clarity, we have decided to sit this one out.”AR Capital said it would stop taking new money at year end for Business Development Corporation of America II, ARC Healthcare Trust III, New York City REIT II, ARC Hospitality Trust and ARC Global Trust II.

1140 Avenue of the Americas, New York
New York—Slowly but surely, American Realty Capital New York City REIT Inc.’s portfolio is getting bigger and bigger. The public non-traded REIT will add a quarter-million square feet of office space to its collection with the acquisition of 1140 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan. NYCR just signed on to pay BPGL Holdings LLC, an affiliate of Blackstone Real Estate Partners VI LP, $180 million for the Class A asset.
Oh, what a difference five years can make. Blackstone snapped up 1140 Avenue of the Americas in 2011 for just $98.25 million, having acquired the loans secured by the 250,000-square-foot building from a consortium of banks led by Landesbank Baden-Württemberg. Originally developed in 1926, the property has seen its share of owners over the last 10 years, beginning with SL Green Realty Corp., which sold the asset to Stellar Management and Rockpoint Group for $97.5 million in 2006. A few years later, the office building fell into the hands of  Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
Located in Midtown Manhattan’s Bryant Park neighborhood, 1140 Avenue of the Americas has a lot going for it today, including a recent $85 million capital investment and a respectable occupancy level. The 22-story tower is 91 percent leased and counts City National Bank—which occupies roughly 30,000 square feet under a lease scheduled to expire in 2023—as its largest tenant. Ultimately, NYCR plans to increase the value of the asset by capitalizing on below-market leases. Midtown’s Class A office property segment closed 2015 with an average asking lease rate of $66.96 per square-foot, according to a report by ABS Partners Real Estate.
NYCR expects to fund the acquisition of 1140 Avenue of the Americas with financing and cash on hand yielded from its initial public offering, which closed in May 2015.
“We believe the sale of 1140 Avenue of the Americas is a solid transaction for both parties and marks another successful deal with AR Global,” Jon Gray, Global Head of Real Estate for Blackstone, said in a prepared statement. Indeed, Blackstone and AR Global entities have executed more than a few transactions together. Among the most notable deals was Blackstone’s $2 billion joint venture purchase of a group of 71 shopping centers from American Realty Capital Properties (now VEREIT) in 2014.
If all goes as planned, NYCR and Blackstone will complete the 1140 Avenue of the Americas transaction in the second quarter of this year. With the purchase of the building, NYCR will have increased the number of assets in its portfolio to six, and pushed the total square footage over the 1 million mark.

Invest in 1031 Eligible PropertiesDefer Capital Gains on Your Real Estate Investment.Become a 1031 Investor 







What is a 1031 Exchange?
A 1031 exchange is a powerful wealth management tool. Real estate investors can defer their capital gains tax on the sale of a property if they reinvest the proceeds in another qualifying property under the Internal Revenue Code Section 1031.


 










1031 Exchange Benefits:


Defer capital gains taxes on the sale of your property.
Invest in cash flowing properties and look to receive monthly distributions.
Ensure certainty of closing and avoid property management headaches.
Diversify your portfolio with a broad range of geography and property types.



 









1031 Exchange Risks:


A 1031 Exchange is a complicated transaction. Investors should consult their tax professionals.
The underlying investments in Real Estate are Illiquid Investments.
Investors who fail to complete their 1031 exchange in the allowable time (typically 180 days) lose their capital gains tax protection.
Each investment has its own risks and the investor should review offering materials for a full review of those risks.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
