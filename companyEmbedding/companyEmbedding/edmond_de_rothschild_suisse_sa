PRIBCHGGXXX | Swift / BIC code for EDMOND DE ROTHSCHILD (SUISSE) S.A. bank located in GENEVA - SWITZERLAND (CH)     WHAT IS A SWIFT / BIC CODE?A Swift Code is the standard format for Business Identifier Codes (BIC) and it's a unique identificationcode for banks and financial institutions globally. These codes are used when transferring money between banks,in particular for international wire transfers or SEPA payments.SWIFT code, BIC code, SWIFT ID or SWIFT - BIC (ISO 9362) is a standard format of Business Identifier Codes approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It is a unique identification code for both financial and non-financial institutions. The acronym SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. When assigned to a non-financial institution, the code may also be known as a Business Entity Identifier or BEI. These codes are used when transferring money between banks, particularly for international wire transfers, and also for the exchange of other messages between banks. The codes can sometimes be found on account statements. The overlapping issue between ISO 9362 and ISO 13616 is discussed in the article International Bank Account Number (also called IBAN). The SWIFT network does not require a specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. In the process of the Single Euro Payments Area the European central banks have agreed on a common format based on IBAN and BIC including an XML-based transmission format for standardized transactions; the TARGET2 is a joint gross clearing system in the European Union that does not require the SWIFT network for transmission (see EBICS). The TARGET-directory lists all the BICs of the banks that are attached to the TARGET2-network being a subset of the SWIFT-directory of BICs.SWIFTCODES BY COUNTRYABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWYZPRIBCHGG Swift / BIC code - EDMOND DE ROTHSCHILD (SUISSE) S.A. bank - GENEVA - SWITZERLAND (CH)Swift Code also known as BIC Code is a unique bank identifier used to verify financial transactions such as a Bank Wire Transfer.The Bank Swift Code provides information about the bank and branch where the money should be transferred. Being able to check information about the Swift Code will provide you with the proper information necessary to make or receive payments. Some of the banks and their associated branches benefit from an address listing which provides you with the means to match swift codes with financial institution office address.This unique swift code directory provides businesses and individuals with an easy way to avoid bank transfer and money transfer mistakes.  Swift Code General StructureThe SWIFT code / BIC code is made up of 8 or 11 characters, broken down as follows:4 letters: Institution Code or bank code.2 letters: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code2 letters or digits: location codeif the second character is "0", then it is typically a test BIC as opposed to a BIC used on the live network.if the second character is "1", then it denotes a passive participant in the SWIFT networkif the second character is "2", then it typically indicates a reverse billing BIC, where the recipient pays for the message as opposed to the more usual mode whereby the sender pays for the message.3 letters or digits: branch code, optional ('XXX' for primary office)Where an 8-digit code is given, it may be assumed that it refers to the primary office.SWIFT Standards, a division of The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), handles the registration of these codes. Because SWIFT originally introduced what was later standardized as Business Identifier Codes (BICs), they are still often called SWIFT addresses or codes.

Edmond de Rothschild chooses Clearstream to consolidate fund processing
24 July 2017  |  2796 views  |  0
Source: Clearstream
Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) S.A. has chosen Clearstream as strategic partner to streamline and consolidate its third-party fund processing activities. 

	Clearstream’s investment funds processing infrastructure Vestima enables processing of all types of funds from mutual funds to hedge funds on a single platform.The current regulatory agenda has made asset safety a key concern for financial institutions and the asset management industry. The fifth Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS V) directive and the Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive (AIFMD) are reshaping the operational landscape of the European investment funds market, leading to a growing need for transparency and efficiency in investment funds processing.Centralised solutions, such as Clearstream’s Vestima platform support market participants to comply with the regulatory requirements and new rules on risk mitigation. As an international central securities depository (ICSD), Clearstream is highly regulated and publicly discloses its risk management principles. Vestima’s secured transaction model is based on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) settlement process that improves operational efficiency and reduces risks.Philippe Seyll, Co-CEO and Head of Investment Fund Services at Clearstream Banking, said: “We are delighted that Edmond de Rothschild has chosen Vestima for the processing of fund assets. Clearstream operates according to the highest standards of safety for customer assets, including asset segregation and delivery-versus-payment settlement. Edmond de Rothschild will benefit from our focus on risk management and the operational efficiency of our streamlined one-stop-shop solution across all fund types.”

          Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) S.A. has chosen Clearstream as strategic partner to streamline and consolidate its third-party fund processing activities. Clearstream's investment funds processing infrastructure Vestima enables processing of all types of funds from mutual funds to hedge funds on a single platform.
        



          The current regulatory agenda has made asset safety a key concern for financial institutions and the asset management industry. The fifth Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS V) directive and the Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive (AIFMD) are reshaping the operational landscape of the European investment funds market, leading to a growing need for transparency and efficiency in investment funds processing.
        



          Centralised solutions, such as Clearstream's Vestima platform support market participants to comply with the regulatory requirements and new rules on risk mitigation. As an international central securities depository (ICSD), Clearstream is highly regulated and publicly discloses its risk management principles. Vestima's secured transaction model is based on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) settlement process that improves operational efficiency and reduces risks.
        



          Philippe Seyll, Co-CEO and Head of Investment Fund Services at Clearstream Banking, said: 'We are delighted that Edmond de Rothschild has chosen Vestima for the processing of fund assets. Clearstream operates according to the highest standards of safety for customer assets, including asset segregation and delivery-versus-payment settlement. Edmond de Rothschild will benefit from our focus on risk management and the operational efficiency of our streamlined one-stop-shop solution across all fund types.'

          Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) S.A. has chosen Clearstream as strategic partner to streamline and consolidate its third-party fund processing activities. Clearstream's investment funds processing infrastructure Vestima enables processing of all types of funds from mutual funds to hedge funds on a single platform.
        



          The current regulatory agenda has made asset safety a key concern for financial institutions and the asset management industry. The fifth Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS V) directive and the Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive (AIFMD) are reshaping the operational landscape of the European investment funds market, leading to a growing need for transparency and efficiency in investment funds processing.
        



          Centralised solutions, such as Clearstream's Vestima platform support market participants to comply with the regulatory requirements and new rules on risk mitigation. As an international central securities depository (ICSD), Clearstream is highly regulated and publicly discloses its risk management principles. Vestima's secured transaction model is based on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) settlement process that improves operational efficiency and reduces risks.
        



          Philippe Seyll, Co-CEO and Head of Investment Fund Services at Clearstream Banking, said: 'We are delighted that Edmond de Rothschild has chosen Vestima for the processing of fund assets. Clearstream operates according to the highest standards of safety for customer assets, including asset segregation and delivery-versus-payment settlement. Edmond de Rothschild will benefit from our focus on risk management and the operational efficiency of our streamlined one-stop-shop solution across all fund types.'
