Sam specializes in corporate and business law, commercial leasing and other real estate transactions, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, contracts, finance and business dispute resolution.
Sam has extensive experience not only in the legal arena but also in the business world. After 25 years practicing corporate and business law on behalf of two major firms in Boston, Sam went into business with former clients in Virginia, successfully leading an agri-chemical company to public ownership and coordinating with private equity investors the acquisition of a national specialty mail order prescription pharmaceutical corporation.
With Cetrulo LLP, Mr. Sears has enthusiastically returned to the practice of law. He also acts as Managing Partner of the Firm.
Mr. Sears has two abiding passions—his five children and seven grandchildren, and sports. He has been active as a coach of youth sports teams and currently plays as much golf as time allows (not enough as his game attests).
