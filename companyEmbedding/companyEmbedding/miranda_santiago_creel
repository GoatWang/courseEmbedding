Santiago Creel Miranda (Spanish pronunciation: [sanˈtjaɣo kɾil miˈɾanda] ( listen); born on 11 December 1954) is a Mexican senator representing the centre-right National Action Party who served as Secretary of the Interior in the cabinet of President Vicente Fox.

6 References



Background and family life[edit]
His campaign describes his background as that of a lawyer, father, and husband, as well as of a Party loyalist.[1] Descendant of the Creel-Terrazas family, son of René Creel Luján, one of the founders of the National Action Party,[2] Santiago Creel has extensive connections within the PAN. In 2008 he admitted that he is the father of actress Edith González's daughter, Constanza.
Education[edit]
Creel received a bachelor's degree in Law from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and subsequently did graduate work at Georgetown University and earned a master's degree at the University of Michigan.[3]
Political career[edit]
His career highlights include running for Head of Government of the Federal District in 2000 (a race he narrowly lost to Andrés Manuel López Obrador). He was later appointed to the cabinet by President Vicente Fox to serve as Secretary of the Interior, a position he held from December 2000 to June 2005.
On June 1, 2005, Creel presented Fox with his resignation in order to seek his party's candidacy for the 2006 presidential election. Creel's main contender for the PAN's candidacy was Felipe Calderón who won the primary elections and went on to become President of Mexico.
In 2006 Santiago Creel won a proportional representation seat in the Senate to serve during the 60th and 61st Legislatures (2006–2012) and led the PAN Senate delegation until June 2008.
2012 PAN presidential primary[edit]
Santiago Creel decided to run for the PAN's Presidential Nomination for the 2012 and initially led polls ahead of the other candidates on the basis of his strong name recognition. He has been falling behind a rising Vazquez Mota in the later half of 2011 and also faces stiff competition from Ernesto Cordero. He has identified himself as more independent from the current administration than either Josefina Vazquez Mota or Ernesto Cordero and he has demanded noninterference and a clean result,[4] with confidence in a fair result not to be overturned, but his support not being a blank check, but rather assuming the absence of serious issues.[5] Should he lose, he has indicated likely support for the winning candidate and joining in supporting the candidate and would welcome other candidates to his campaign should he win.
Constitutional Assembly of Mexico City[edit]
Creel was one of seven PAN representatives elected by the voters of Mexico City to sit on the Constitutional Assembly of Mexico City, which will convene on September 15, 2016.[6]

Background and family life[edit]
His campaign describes his background as that of a lawyer, father, and husband, as well as of a Party loyalist.[1] Descendant of the Creel-Terrazas family, son of René Creel Luján, one of the founders of the National Action Party,[2] Santiago Creel has extensive connections within the PAN. In 2008 he admitted that he is the father of actress Edith González's daughter, Constanza.
Education[edit]
Creel received a bachelor's degree in Law from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and subsequently did graduate work at Georgetown University and earned a master's degree at the University of Michigan.[3]
Political career[edit]
His career highlights include running for Head of Government of the Federal District in 2000 (a race he narrowly lost to Andrés Manuel López Obrador). He was later appointed to the cabinet by President Vicente Fox to serve as Secretary of the Interior, a position he held from December 2000 to June 2005.
On June 1, 2005, Creel presented Fox with his resignation in order to seek his party's candidacy for the 2006 presidential election. Creel's main contender for the PAN's candidacy was Felipe Calderón who won the primary elections and went on to become President of Mexico.
In 2006 Santiago Creel won a proportional representation seat in the Senate to serve during the 60th and 61st Legislatures (2006–2012) and led the PAN Senate delegation until June 2008.
2012 PAN presidential primary[edit]
Santiago Creel decided to run for the PAN's Presidential Nomination for the 2012 and initially led polls ahead of the other candidates on the basis of his strong name recognition. He has been falling behind a rising Vazquez Mota in the later half of 2011 and also faces stiff competition from Ernesto Cordero. He has identified himself as more independent from the current administration than either Josefina Vazquez Mota or Ernesto Cordero and he has demanded noninterference and a clean result,[4] with confidence in a fair result not to be overturned, but his support not being a blank check, but rather assuming the absence of serious issues.[5] Should he lose, he has indicated likely support for the winning candidate and joining in supporting the candidate and would welcome other candidates to his campaign should he win.
Constitutional Assembly of Mexico City[edit]
Creel was one of seven PAN representatives elected by the voters of Mexico City to sit on the Constitutional Assembly of Mexico City, which will convene on September 15, 2016.[6]

SANTIAGO CREEL MIRANDA JOINS EZCORP BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Jan 6, 2014




AUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 6, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- EZCORP, Inc. (NASDAQ: EZPW) announced today Santiago Creel Miranda has been appointed to the EZCORP Board of Directors. Mr. Creel is a former Senator of Mexico, having served from 2006 to 2012. During his term, he acted as Speaker of the Senate and Chairman of the Senate's Political Coordination Committee. Prior to being elected to the Senate, Mr. Creel served as Secretary of Governance in President Vicente Fox's administration from 2000 to 2005 and as a Federal Deputy (Congressman) in the 57th Congress, where he was Vice Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and chaired the Government and Constitutional Issues Committee.
Mr. Creel began his professional career as a lawyer in the firm of Noriega y Escobedo in Mexico City, where he practiced for almost 20 years, becoming the firm's managing partner. He has been a legal consultant to many companies, both domestic and foreign, as well as to international organizations and to the Mexican government. Mr. Creel is now a member of the governing body of Pacto por México, which sponsors an extensive agenda of political, economic and structural changes in Mexico.
Mr. Creel studied law at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, and received a master's degree in law from the University of Michigan. He also has a Diploma in American Law from Georgetown University. He was a university professor for almost two decades, time during which he participated in the foundation of the ITAM Law School, where he became Dean of the Law School and head of its academic department. He is the author of several works on law, politics, and economics, and has also collaborated on the editorial pages of leading Mexican newspapers. He resides in Mexico City, Mexico.
Paul Rothamel, EZCORP's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated "I would like to welcome Santiago Creel to the EZCORP board. His extensive multinational experience spanning business, government service and the law make him a great addition to our board. We look forward to benefitting from his insights and contributions as we continue to grow and diversify our business."
EZCORP also announced that Thomas C. Roberts has retired from the EZCORP board. Mr. Roberts had served as a director since January 2005 and as Lead Director from November 2008 to September 2013. Mr. Roberts had previously announced in July that he intended to step down from the board by the end of the year.

Background and family life[edit]
His campaign describes his background as that of a lawyer, father, and husband, as well as of a Party loyalist.[1] Descendant of the Creel-Terrazas family, son of René Creel Luján, one of the founders of the National Action Party,[2] Santiago Creel has extensive connections within the PAN. In 2008 he admitted that he is the father of actress Edith González's daughter, Constanza.
Education[edit]
Creel received a bachelor's degree in Law from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and subsequently did graduate work at Georgetown University and earned a master's degree at the University of Michigan.[3]
Political career[edit]
His career highlights include running for Head of Government of the Federal District in 2000 (a race he narrowly lost to Andrés Manuel López Obrador). He was later appointed to the cabinet by President Vicente Fox to serve as Secretary of the Interior, a position he held from December 2000 to June 2005.
On June 1, 2005, Creel presented Fox with his resignation in order to seek his party's candidacy for the 2006 presidential election. Creel's main contender for the PAN's candidacy was Felipe Calderón who won the primary elections and went on to become President of Mexico.
In 2006 Santiago Creel won a proportional representation seat in the Senate to serve during the 60th and 61st Legislatures (2006–2012) and led the PAN Senate delegation until June 2008.
2012 PAN presidential primary[edit]
Santiago Creel decided to run for the PAN's Presidential Nomination for the 2012 and initially led polls ahead of the other candidates on the basis of his strong name recognition. He has been falling behind a rising Vazquez Mota in the later half of 2011 and also faces stiff competition from Ernesto Cordero. He has identified himself as more independent from the current administration than either Josefina Vazquez Mota or Ernesto Cordero and he has demanded noninterference and a clean result,[4] with confidence in a fair result not to be overturned, but his support not being a blank check, but rather assuming the absence of serious issues.[5] Should he lose, he has indicated likely support for the winning candidate and joining in supporting the candidate and would welcome other candidates to his campaign should he win.
Constitutional Assembly of Mexico City[edit]
Creel was one of seven PAN representatives elected by the voters of Mexico City to sit on the Constitutional Assembly of Mexico City, which will convene on September 15, 2016.[6]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
