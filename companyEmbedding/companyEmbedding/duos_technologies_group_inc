					Full Description



Duos Technologies Group, Inc., incorporated on May 31, 1994, is a holding company. The Company operates under two business units consisting of the Intelligent Technologies Division utilizing its technology platform, and IT Infrastructure Services Division, which provides information technology asset management (ITAM) services. Duos Technologies, Inc., (DTI), its Intelligent Technologies Division, provides an array of technology applications and turnkey engineered systems. The Company's ITAM services for data centers is operated as a division of the Company that markets its services through strategic partners. The Company's offerings are built upon two core technology platforms: praesidium and centraco, both distributed as licensed software suites, and embedded within engineered turnkey systems. Its ITAM division is engaged in developing, marketing and delivering software and professional services to the data centers. The Company serves the commercial, industrial, healthcare, utilities and government sectors.The Company developed a methodology for the data collection of assets contained within data centers. Using a methodology, the Company surveys and audits data centers by physically identifying each piece of equipment, scanning it into its system and then providing the client with a report detailing everything found, including but not limited to racks, servers, network cards and power connections affording the client the ability to verify their own internal records. praesidium is a modular suite of analytics applications, which process and simultaneously analyze data streams from a virtually unlimited number of conventional sensors and/or data points. Its native algorithms compare analyzed data against user-defined criteria and rules in real time and automatically report any exceptions, deviations and/or anomalies. This application suite also includes a range of conventional operational system components and sub-systems, including an embedded video management engine and an alarm management service (AMS). This service provides continuous monitoring of all connected devices, processes, equipment and sub-systems, and automatically communicates to the front end user interface, if and when an issue, event or performance anomaly is detected. The processed information is instantly distributed simultaneously to an unlimited number of users in a visualized and correlated user interface using the Company’s modular centraco command and control platform, i.e. enterprise information management suite.Centraco is a multi-layered command and control interface, which functions as the central point for information consolidation, connectivity and communications. The platform is browser-based and agnostic to the interconnected sub-systems and provides Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), also known as Active Directory, integration for seamless user credentialing and performs the functions, such as collection, analysis, verification, resolution, reporting and auditing. The Company has created turnkey systems and applications for commercial railways, which include the Intelligent Rail Inspection Portal (rip). The rip system includes the following sub-systems, which can be delivered either as stand-alone applications or as modules to a complete portal system: Linear Panorama Generator; Automated Detection of Open Doors and Missing or Open Hatches; Illegal Train Rider Detection System (trids); Vehicle Undercarriage Examiner (vue), and Precision Linear Speed Sensor (plss). Its applications also include railroad bridge security, tank farm surveillance, rail yard security, remote bridge controls, gondola car inspection system (gcis) and virtual fence/secure rail corridor.The Intelligent Mechanical Inspection Rail Portal incorporates its vue, in addition to other technologies, and is considered to be a game changer for the rail industry. Utilizing the centraco command and control platform as the system interface, the user accesses a range of features enabling remote inspection, analysis and detection from the safety of remote command centers. The Linear Panorama Generator assembles images gathered from cameras on all four sides of the train and stitches all frames to create a continuous 360-degree view of the entire train. trids performs automated detection of riders hiding in railcar wells. plss is designed to provide high resolution, non-contact train speeds, with an accuracy of within 0.1 miles per hour (MPH). In addition to speed measurement, the plss sensor array provides a range of features to improve situational awareness of train movements and track conditions around the deployed area.
