EQUITY FUNDS
Equity mutual funds are principally categorized according to a specific investment objective. Often times equity mutual funds objectives are described by size (small, medium or large cap). The size references the typical capitalization of each underlying investment. Additionally, equity mutual funds can be categorized by style. The style is described as growth, value or geography. Highland offers equity funds of all styles including growth, value, small cap, large cap, international and domestic. Click on the links below to learn more about Highland’s Equity funds.

ASSET ALLOCATION FUNDS
Asset allocation mutual funds provide investors with a portfolio of fixed or variable allocations to major asset classes such as stocks, bonds and cash equivalents. Some funds maintain a fixed allocation proportion to specific asset classes while others actively manage the proportional composition of the portfolio in response to macro‐economic conditions and/or changes in investment markets.

EXCHANGE‐TRADED FUNDS – ETFs
Exchange-traded funds are securities that track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund.  An ETF trades like a stock on an exchange so its net asset value (NAV) is not calculated every day like a mutual fund. ETFs experience price changes throughout the day as they are bought and sold.  Highland’s exchange‐traded fund seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the Markit iBoxx Liquid Leveraged Loan Index (the “Underlying Index”).

Fund Overview
Investment Objective
The investment objective of the Highland Floating Rate Opportunities Fund is to provide a high level of current income, consistent with the preservation of capital.
Attractive Alternatives for Income-Oriented Investors

High income potential in all markets
Yields that reset when short-term interest rates move, which may mitigate price declines in a rising short-term interest rate environment
Low correlation to other asset classes
Access to one of the largest and most experienced senior loan managers
Most fixed rate securities experience price declines when interest rates rise. Floating Rate Senior loans are different.

They are short-duration, floating-rate securities. So, as interest rates rise, yields on bank loans increase, while their short duration helps keep prices relatively stable.

The performance data quoted here represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Highland Funds carefully before investing. A prospectus with this and other information about Highland's mutual funds can be found on the Literature tab above. You may also obtain a prospectus for our mutual funds by calling 877-665-1287. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
*The total annual operating expenses of the Fund are Class A 1.73%, Class C 2.23%, Class Z 1.38%. Class A Max Sales Charge: 3.50%. Class A Max Sales Charge: 3.50%. Class C Contingent Deferred Sales Charge (“CDSC”) is 1% within the first year from each purchase. Class C performance results shown include CDSC. Performance results reflect any contractual waivers and/or reimbursements of fund expenses by the Advisor. Absent this limitation, performance results would have been lower.
Non-Payment Risk. Senior Loans, like other corporate debt obligations, are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal. Non-payment would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the Senior Loan experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in the NAV of the Fund.
Credit Risk. The Fund may invest all or substantially all of its assets in Senior Loans or other securities that are rated below investment grade and unrated Senior Loans deemed by Highland to be of comparable quality. Securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as “high yield securities” or “junk securities.” They are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuing company’s continuing ability to meet principal and interest payments. Investments in high yield Senior Loans and other securities may result in greater NAV fluctuation than if the Fund did not make such investments.
Senior Loans Risk. The risks associated with senior loans are similar to the risks of below investment grade securities in that they are considered speculative. In addition, as with any debt instrument, senior loans are also generally subject to the risk of price declines and to increases in prevailing interest rates. Senior loans are also subject to the risk that, as interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases, which may also increase the risk and rate of default. In addition, the interest rates of floating rate loans typically only adjust to changes in short-term interest rates; long term interest rates can vary dramatically from short term interest rates. Therefore, senior loans may not mitigate price declines in a rising long-term interest rate environment.
Risk of Restrictions on Resale. Senior Loans may not be readily marketable and may be subject to restrictions on resale. As a result, the ability of the Fund to dispose of its investments in a timely fashion and at an advantageous price may be restricted.
Ongoing Monitoring Risk. On behalf of the several Lenders, the Agent generally will be required to administer and manage the Senior Loans and, with respect to collateralized Senior Loans, to service or monitor the collateral.
Sector Concentration Risk. The fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in a single sector. As a result the Fund’s investment in fewer sectors may result in the Fund’s shares being more sensitive to the economic results and other risks specific to those sectors. An investment in the Fund could fluctuate in value more than the investment in a more diversified fund.

The performance data quoted here represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.
Note: Effective April 9, 2013, Highland Core America Equity Fund was renamed Highland Global Allocation Fund. At the same time, Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P. became the sole Adviser to the Fund and the Fund no longer utilizes a sub-adviser. In addition to these changes, the Fund’s investment strategies were revised and the Fund will no longer invest at least 80% of its assets in domestic equity securities. For more information, please view the Fund’s prospectus which can be found under the “Literature” tab above or by calling 877-665-1287.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Highland Funds carefully before investing. A prospectus with this and other information about Highland's mutual funds can be found on the Literature tab above. You may also obtain a prospectus for our mutual funds by calling 877-665-1287. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
1. The Advisor has contractually agreed to limit the total annual operating expenses of the Fund to 0.90% of average daily net assets of the Fund. The expense cap will continue through at least January 31, 2018.
*The maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 5.75%.
Securities Market Risk. The value of the securities may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting particular companies or the securities market generally. A general downturn in the securities market may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously, although equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities.
Value Investing Risk. The risk of investing in undervalued stocks that may not realize their perceived value for extended periods of time or may never realize their perceived value.  Value stocks may respond differently to market and other developments than other types of stocks.
Foreign Investment Risk. The risk that investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to smaller markets, differing reporting, accounting and auditing standards, nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockages and political changes of diplomatic developments. The cost of investing in many foreign markets are higher than the U.S. and investments may be less liquid.
Currency Risk. The risk that the values of foreign investments may be affected by changes in the currency rates or exchange control regulations. If a foreign currency weakens against the U.S. dollar, the value of a foreign investment denominated in that currency would also decline in dollar terms.
Credit Risk. The risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty of a derivatives contract or repurchase agreement, is unable or unwilling (or is perceived to be unable or unwilling) to make a timely payment of principal and/or interest, or to otherwise honor its obligations.
Interest Rate Risk. The risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in interest rates. A fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration.
Derivatives Risk. The risk that an investment in derivatives may not correlate completely to the performance of underlying securities and may be volatile, and may result in a loss greater than the principal amount invested. Equity derivatives may also be subject to liquidity risk as well as the risk the derivative may be different than what would be produced through the use of another methodology or if it had been priced using market quotations.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.              
              
            

12:40 p.m.  Today12:40 p.m. July 28, 2017






What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

How We Invest
CLO Management

Seeks to achieve better absolute performance with less risk, while providing investors with maximum transparency
Invests in larger, liquid, broadly syndicated bank loans
Utilizes a rigorous credit research process with a low ratio of credits per analyst
Supplements bottom-up analysis with a disciplined approach to risk management and portfolio monitoring

CLO Investing

Seeks to achieve attractive absolute returns while minimizing volatility
Evaluates CLO tranches using a combination of rigorous qualitative (portfolio, manager and legal considerations) and quantitative (structural, cash-flow, collateral valuation and pricing/relative value) analysis
Utilizes a proprietary quantitative analytical tool, CLO ViewPointTM, to view and track Acis credit research team’s credit opinion on each individual loan, including ratings downgrade probability and timing, default probability and estimated recovery values












 

Acis Capital Management, Highland Capital’s Structured Product affiliate, was established as a separate SEC registered investment adviser in 2010 to specialize in Collateralized Loan Obligation (“CLO”) management and CLO investing.
A CLO is an issuance of securities (AAA to B) and an equity tranche backed by the cash flows from a diversified pool of senior secured corporate bank loans. CLOs are structured with a re-investment period, allowing the CLO Manger to actively buy and sell assets, subject to asset quality covenants for a period of 3-5 years. The return paid to the equity holders is the difference between the current yield on the underlying assets and the financing cost of the issued notes.
Highland was one of the early pioneers in the CLO market, setting up one of the first non-bank deals in 1996. Highland together with Acis has become one of the largest managers of US CLOs with over $11B under management including a secondary CLO investment portfolio with over $2 billion of assets under management. Members of the Acis team have structured and managed over $32B of CLOs across 40 vehicles, have invested in over $13 billion of CLO paper and have traded over $17 billion of structured credit paper over the last decade, providing investors optimal access to the market.
The integration of the Acis CLO platform and its rigorous investment and risk management processes focused solely on CLOs provides investors with unique investment opportunities.

Highland Europe Fund II raises $379.6 mln

Highland Europe said Thursday that its most recent fund raised 332 million euros (US$379.6 million).

With offices in London and Geneva, Highland Europe invests between 10 million euros to 30 million euros per deal. 
PRESS RELEASE
LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Highland Europe, the prominent growth-stage technology investor, has raised a new €332m tech growth fund, Highland Europe Technology Growth II. This follows Highland Europe’s 2012 €250m Highland Europe Technology Growth I fund that invested in 15 technology companies including WeTransfer, AMCS, GetYourGuide, Outfittery, SocialPoint, Finanzcheck, TalentSoft, eGym, Intersec, NewVoiceMedia, Brandwatch, Matches Fashion, Jampp, LoveCrafts, and Malwarebytes.
Highland Europe’s partners – Fergal Mullen, Laurence Garrett, Irena Goldenberg, Sam Brooks and Tony Zappala – intend to continue investing this second fund with the same laser-focused growth-stage investment strategy: targeting rapidly emerging internet, mobile and software companies. These companies are led by inspiring entrepreneurs who have demonstrated resourcefulness by achieving substantial revenue scale in a relatively short period of time, and on a capital-efficient basis. The companies are always high-growth and have sensible business models from a unit-economics perspective. The partners aim to back sector-leading companies addressing large market opportunities either on a pan-Europe basis or globally.
Fergal Mullen, who joined Highland Capital Partners in the US in 2001 and who launched the firm in Europe in 2007 said, “The new fund was substantially oversubscribed, which reflected support for our focused strategy and early performance of Fund I. We had the pleasure of welcoming back all investors from Fund I – with many substantially increasing their commitments. In addition, we were honoured to welcome a very limited number of sophisticated new investors who have a long-term commitment to our asset-class.”
Laurence Garrett, Highland Europe partner, said, “In Europe, the early-stage investment market is relatively well-funded – but there is a relative under-capitalization of the venture and growth-stage market. In the past, deals requiring investment of €10M – €30M were over-syndicated by European investors prompting many entrepreneurs to seek capital in the US. Highland Europe is simply meeting a market need within the venture capital and growth-capital eco-system.”
About Highland Europe
Launched in 2012, Highland Europe operates from offices in London and Geneva and invests in European growth-stage companies addressing large market opportunities in internet, mobile and software. Investments generally range in size from €10M to €30M. Notable investments of the team members include companies such as CSR, Mathletics and Moleskine.
Highland Europe is one of the few firms that has an established global platform that enables a valuable collaboration with Highland Capital Partners, the independent global venture capital firm from which it was launched. With three decades of investment experience and partners in offices in Boston, Palo Alto and Shanghai, Highland Capital Partners provides substantial reach and global perspective to Highland Europe and the entrepreneurs that it backs. Prior to 2012, the Highland Europe team invested from various Highland Capital Partners funds in European companies such as VistaPrint, Photobox, Privalia, Spartoo, Wooga, and myOptique.

 Plan of Distribution Approved for Highland Crusader Fund 
         










    










 






 











 









Plan of Distribution Approved for Highland Crusader Fund

		  Developed by investor-led group, plan received support of super-majority of investors
		

Jul 19, 2011, 08:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Highland Capital Management, L.P. 











 
















































 

 




















 


DALLAS, July 19, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Highland Capital Management, L.P. ("Highland"), a SEC‐registered investment adviser with approximately $23 billion of assets under management, announced today that a plan to distribute the assets of the Highland Crusader Fund ("fund") was approved overwhelmingly by approximately 86% of investors.  Highland will remain the fund manager.
"We are pleased that the investor-led distribution plan received vast support and we will diligently execute the plan.  This investor vote frees Highland to distribute fund assets, including approximately $350 million in cash immediately and the remaining $1.3 billion, which we believe has material upside, over the next three years," said John Honis, partner at Highland.  "We firmly agree with our investors that this plan will deliver the most value to all parties."
"The decision to wind-down the Crusader fund during the depths of the global financial meltdown was difficult, but we believe it was the right decision," said James Dondero, co-founder and President of Highland.  The wind-down process provided time for the prudent disposition of illiquid assets, and has helped the fund nearly double in value over the last two years.  In support of the fund, Highland waived millions in management fees and recovered significant amounts from counterparties for egregious actions during the global financial crisis.
The Crusader plan of distribution follows a similar agreement for the Highland Credit Strategies Fund, approved earlier this year.  Together, this completes all wind-down processes begun by Highland during the global financial crisis, which affected some of the firm's hedge funds, a small portion of the firm's overall business.  Also noteworthy is that Houston Municipal Employees Pension System consented unconditionally to the distribution plan, without supplemental consideration.  Additionally, this distribution plan provides full releases for Highland and its employees.
