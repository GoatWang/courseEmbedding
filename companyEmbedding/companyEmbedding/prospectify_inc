Pros:  - Fast, accurate, and easy-to-use.
Cons:  Could be prettier -- still a little rough around the edges, visually.
Overall:  Very simple interface -- I use the LinkedIn, HubSpot, and Salesforce connectors.  With a single click I've got contact information, trigger events, and interests in my CRM.

Pros:  Easy of use. Natural integration into Libkedin. Future roadmap. 
Cons:  No complaints. 
Overall:  I used tonuse an array of tools to prospect and validate information for potential buyers on Linkedin. It took entirely too long and was stressful moving I formation back and forth between various sources. Prospectify puts it all into one step and all in one tool. I wouldn't trade it for anything.

Comments:  Prospectify is a super easy to use prospecting platform and is a great value for what you get. I'm a consultant and it has been my go to platform for finding leads on new clients. I highly recommend it for individuals looking to grow their businesses as well as startup and corporate salespeople. It's one of the main tools I refer my clients to for use with their sales teams as well. 5 stars all around!

What is Salesforce Automation Software?
Salesforce Automation (SFA) Software is a comprehensive dynamic program that enables business managers to monitor their sales processes closely and track sales-related data, from time to time. Besides managing sales, business heads can also use the software to control their stock and inventory and track customer interactions. SFA is a compact and powerful application that provides relevant data, vital for analyzing sales performances and predicting future sales. It's customized versions specifically meet the needs of every business and empower them to improve the efficiency of sales personnel and gradually push up sales. 
Features of Salesforce Automation Software
The best SFA software helps the sales team leaders and business heads to streamline their sales process and make the most of their efforts. To achieve this, the sales management software has the following features:
1) Activity & Task Management 
SFA programs enable the sales and the customer service teams to maintain a continuous record of their operations, over a period. Using this software, professionals can document all actions along with the probable results. They can also schedule their tasks and ensure on-time work, on a regular basis. Basis the work progress, users can clearly demarcate the current status and execute work according to deadlines. Once they complete work, it automatically features as an activity. 
2) Alerts & Notifications
SFA software sends real-time alerts and notifications in the pre-set emails. Business heads can schedule a convenient time for receiving notifications and alerts, for instance, 10 a.m. every day. The notifications contain email reports of all activities and status of work, in regards to the previous day. Thus, professionals get the necessary data, in a nutshell. 
3) Managing Appointments
Most SFA software comes with an inbuilt calendar where users can schedule their business appointments, team meetings, and customer interaction sessions. They can set reminders and monitor their work plan, at regular intervals. Using this feature, professionals can keep track on their activities and maintain consistent relationships with leads and prospects.
4) Monitoring Sales Opportunities
Another excellent feature of SFA application, it enables the sales team to look into their sales cycle and procedures and identify critical loopholes and fruitful opportunities. The powerful software provides useful analytics using which the sales professionals can assess the current situations and based on their understanding, can strategize the further course of action to maximize sales.
 Advantages of Salesforce Automation Software
1) Increased Sales
The primary benefit of installing SFA software reflects on the increasing sales figures of business. With this solution, sales personnel can manage their contacts, maximize their efforts, and find new rather innovative ways to push sales. When it comes to organizing sales campaign, they can use the software analytics, target the most relevant customers, and proactively engage them within their products/services. 
2) Increased Leads
Sales automation application also helps the Salesforce to manage their leads, follow the most suitable ones, capture them, and turn them into customers. Besides leads, users can also create, deploy and manage lead generation campaigns. Collating software generated data, they can filter out the most valuable leads and take further action to bring them to their product or service bouquet. 
3) Optimized Productivity
Targeting more prospects and customers and making the most of the sales efforts automatically enhances the efficiency of professionals and boost the team’s productivity, as a whole. Using an SFA software, employees can manage simultaneous jobs and accelerate growth. 
4) Making Informed Decisions
The database of a sales force automation program serves as an extensive resource of information that enables the sales personnel and customer service executives to take the right choices. It provides useful insights and analytics that allow professionals to make informed decisions and achieve sales targets.
Some Potential Cons of Salesforce Automation Software
Given all the above advantages, SFA application is also prone to certain problems like: 
1) Time-Consuming Data Entry Work
SFA software works according to the entered data. And the work of the data entry operators is very time-consuming. Besides time, a lot of effort goes into the data-entry process. 
2) Hard to Integrate
Even in today’s age and time, most SFA software is difficult to sync and integrate. More often than not, users come across technical issues and non-compatibility of software. This again restricts the level of customization. Although the sales apps are easily customizable, problems in integrations fail to deliver the relevant results.
3) High Maintenance Cost
Software Maintenance cost is very high unless it’s Cloud. However, Cloud technology is still emerging in the sales software solutions industry. Conventional SFA applications involve the cost of regular updates and installing latest versions of the software.
Things to Keep in Mind before Choosing Salesforce Automation Software 
Considering the pros and cons, businesses must look for the following factors while purchasing SFA software:
1) Contact Management
From the interdepartmental staff to customers to vendors and other business peers, contacts are THE MOST crucial aspect of any organisation. Thus, the SFA software must store each section of the contacts and ease management. Based on the size, and nature of business, companies must look for specific software that will easily fit within its operations and adapt to the business domain. 
2) Sales Forecast
The selected SFA application must provide useful data and analytics, preferably in the form of graphs and charts to help management in making proper sales and revenue estimates 
3) Access to Mobiles
With the world going mobile, professionals must look for something which they can access from anywhere and anytime using their personal devices. High mobile interface keeps people on-the-go. It enables the business leaders and sales managers to track real-time data and maintain updated records, on a timely basis. 
4) Customisation
In the end, it’s all about personification and getting the desired results with complete accuracy. While browsing through various options, organizations must first think of the purpose and need behind purchasing SFA software. Based on their understanding, they must go for the software that is best suitable for fulfilling their requirements. 
Conclusion
To sum up, sales automation software has revolutionized sales processes and management. It is a flexible, customization, and convenient solution. At the same time, it’s more accurate and works at real-time. Above all, SFA software serves a dual purpose- sales tracking and customer relationship management and is highly beneficial in today’s competitive industries.
