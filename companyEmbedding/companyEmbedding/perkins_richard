Richard Perkins began working at Perkins Oil Co. when he was 14 and now is the company president.


AMBER ARNOLD — State Journal





















































As one of the largest distributors of Shell, Pennzoil, Quaker State and Citgo products in the U.S., Perkins Oil Co. has a history that began 50 years ago.
The business was started in 1962 by Chet Perkins and his son Roger. Four years later, Chet's other son Vince joined the business. Richard Perkins, Roger's son, began working for the company when he was 14 years old.
"I went full time when I was 21 years old," Richard said. "My grandpa Chet retired in 1970, my father retired in 2002, my uncle Vince retired in 2006. I purchased my Dad's stock when he retired, and I bought the remainder of the business when Vince retired."

Richard serves as president of the company, which sells and delivers bulk and packaged virgin finished lubricants, anti-freeze, washer fluids and diesel exhaust fluid.
"We sell and install dispensing equipment and are licensed with the state of Wisconsin to service and sell used oil tank system installation and to service the equipment," he said.
Perkins offers on- or off-site training to management and service personnel, oil-analysis programs, environmental service, inventory management program and custom bottle packaging. An electronic marketing program helps their clients manage and create everything from websites and email marketing programs to other social media.
Perkins has 32 full-time employees, including Richard's sister, Krista Perkins-McPhee; her husband, Chris McPhee; and Richard's stepson, David Rademaker.

Perkins' environmental Green Product Line Closed Loop Process program sends used oil to a re-refining plant. From there, it goes to a blending plant and gets shipped back as high-quality synthetic blend engine oil.

"One four-quart engine oil change can reduce our need for foreign crude oil by two barrels. The process of re-refining motor oil uses up to 89 percent less energy than refining oil from virgin crude," Richard said.
The business originally located on South Brearly Street and moved to Dempsey Road in 1977. In 1999, they moved to the current location on Pflaum Road. They also have buildings in Fitchburg and Sparta.
"We have over 350,000 gallons of bulk tank storage between the three locations," he said.
The company acquired four companies in 1985, which expanded its market from south-central Wisconsin into Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota. The business works with new and used car and truck dealers, quick lubes, trucking companies, construction companies, manufacturers, municipalities and the agriculture market.
In the Family Business features family-owned businesses. To suggest a business to feature, contact Jill Carlson at jillcarlson1957@gmail.com with the name, contact information and a brief description of the business.
