DescriptionBook ExcerptReviewsQuiz



Book Description      New York Times bestselling author and UCLA psychiatrist, Judith Orloff, M.D. created this practical, empowering book for everyone who wants to develop their sensitivities and empathy to become more caring people in an often insensitive world. Whether you’re a highly sensitive person, or an empath who absorbs other people’s stress, or simply someone who wants to live a more open-hearted life without burning out or experiencing compassion fatigue—this book is for you. It’s also for the loved ones of sensitive people who want to become more supportive of them. Sensitivity is a great gift that needs to be honored and developed.   The Empath's Survival Guide begins with self-assessment exercises to help you understand your sensitivity, then offers potent strategies for protecting yourself from overwhelm and replenishing your vital energy. For any sensitive person who’s been told to “grow a thick skin,” here is your lifelong guide for staying fully open while building resilience, exploring your gifts, raising empathic children, and feeling welcomed and valued by a world that desperately needs what you have to offer. It’s also about embracing the empath in all of us.   As a physician and empath herself, Dr Orloff is passionate about this topic as she sees how sensitive people too often get misdiagnosed in the mainstream health care system with depression, agoraphobia, panic disorder, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. In this book, she offers empaths and all sensitive people a range of “survival guide” strategies to positively manage their sensitivities and avoid sensory and intuitive overload. She covers topics including health, work, love, sex, parenting, narcissists and other energy vampires, and developing intuition. Then, with these strategies in place, they can enjoy their gifts of depth, creativity, intuition, love of nature, capacity to deeply love, and fulfill their desire to help others and better the world.     What is the difference between having empathy and being an empath? “Having empathy means our heart goes out to another person in joy or pain,” says Dr. Judith Orloff “But for empaths it goes much farther. We actually feel others’ emotions, energy, and physical symptoms in our own bodies, without the usual defenses that most people have.”   With The Empath's Survival Guide, Dr. Orloff offers an invaluable resource to help sensitive people develop healthy coping mechanisms in our high-stimulus world—while fully embracing their gifts and power.

About Dr. Hellman 





Dr. Judith Hellman, M.D.

A genuine "people person," Dr. Judith Hellman brings her expertise and outstanding bedside manner to hundreds of New Yorkers with a wide gamut of therapeutic and aesthetic skin concerns.
A board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Hellman practices medical dermatology, and also specializes in dermatological surgery, laser surgery and anti-aging skin treatments. She received her B.A. Magna Cum Laude from Boston’s Berklee College of Music. An accomplished musician, she decided to switch gears and pursue a medical career.
After graduating, she went on to complete her premedical training at Wellesley College, where she was on the Dean’s List. Subsequently she attended the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City and received her MD in 1989. After an internship in internal medicine at New York’s Beth Israel Medical Center, she completed her residency in Dermatology at SUNY Stony Brook, where she was selected as chief resident in dermatology. From 1992, Dr. Hellman spent several years training in the surgical treatment of skin cancers and in the use of lasers for various skin conditions at the prestigious Long Island Laser CosmediCenter.
Dr. Hellman became board certified in dermatology in 1994. She is currently an associate professor in the Department of Dermatology at Mt. Sinai Medical Center, and has authored numerous papers for medical journals on a variety of topics.
"I find Dermatology personally gratifying because I come in contact with many people on a daily basis, which I enjoy tremendously," says Dr. Hellman. "It also allows me to utilize the fine motor skills which I developed during my musical training in performing surgical and aesthetic procedures of all kinds. I especially enjoy helping my patients improve their appearance in relatively short periods of time, boosting their self-esteem, and giving them the confidence they need to feel that they can go out and conquer the world. This is the greatest gratification for a physician."
Dr. Hellman has been in private practice in New York City since 1993. She is fluent in English, Hebrew and Hungarian. She is a fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology, American Society for Laser Surgery and Medicine, Dermatologic Society of Greater New York and others. She is affiliated with the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, and has been a guest on various radio and TV programs as well as interviewed in a variety of magazines on medical and cosmetic dermatology topics.
Dr. Hellman resides in Manhattan and is the mother of Michael, 14, a musical prodigy. Michael’s original music can be heard on his website, www.MichaelEliran.com

Find Cardiologists by city and state

    Cardiologists are doctors who specialize in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of conditions related to the heart and blood vessels.


    A patient may be referred to a cardiologist if he experiences symptoms like chest pains, shortness of breath, dizziness, or high blood pressure. The physician will then evaluate your symptoms, take your health and family history and your weight. The cardiologist may order additional diagnostic tests, such as an echocardiogram, X-ray or blood tests. If necessary, the cardiologist may also call for a cardiac catheterization - a procedure in which a small tube is inserted into or near the heart that can take pictures of the heart's activity, or relieve blockage.


    Once determining whether there is a heart condition, a cardiologist will treat a patient through cholesterol management, cardiac rehabilitation, and fitness. If surgical intervention is required, like open-heart surgery, a cardiologist will make that determination, but a cardiothoracic surgeon will perform the procedure.

Find Family Physicians by city and state

    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings. When necessary, family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist.


    The doctors may also provide physicals, inoculations, prenatal care, treat chronic diseases, like diabetes and asthma, and provide advice on disease prevention.

Find Pediatricians by city and state

    A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in the regular care of children, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of illness in children. Young patients are often more complicated to treat because they are still growing and developing.


    While pediatricians may sub-specialize in specific therapy areas like oncology, surgery, ophthalmology, and anesthesiology, in general, pediatricians provide services like vaccinations, health exams, and treatment of common ailments and injuries. In addition, pediatricians are trained to handle the complex emotional and behavioral issues faced by children, especially during puberty.


    Pediatricians normally see their patients from birth until the age of 18, although some may agree to treat patients into their early 20s, if requested.

SohriakoffFamily Doctor / G.P.8 reviewsRatings for Dr. Judith M. Kemp 4Staff 2Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeDr. Kemp has been brought to the board for medical misconduct. She makes unsubstantiated diagnoses and prescribed me a medication that I later found out was completely inappropriate for my condition. She is "nice," but that does not mean she is a good doctor. Do real research before choosing a doctor. Read the negative reviews - they often have a lot more to say than the positive ones. Was this rating useful? 3 flag | Submitted August 31, 2015 2Staff 3Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeI would only recommend Dr. Kemp's office to someone that I didn't like very much. She makes off the cuff diagnosis that aren't correct (once the rather expensive bloodwork comes back from the lab) and she has horrible follow-through. There was a very costly billing/coding error on my bill that basically took an act of God and man to correct and several of my completely unnecessary blood tests weren't covered due to the fact that they aren't considered customary. My two visits with her were basically just a huge waste of my time and money. I will keep looking for a new GP and so should you...Was this rating useful? 3 flag | Submitted August 26, 2011 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI've had this doctor for almost two years now. Simply put, she's amazing. More than any other doctor I've had in the past, she spends time to ensure that she's answered all of your questions. She explains what medications do that she is recommending, and she explains various options that can be pursued. Her practice is warm and inviting and doesn't have the usual cold utilitarian feel of a doctor's office. Her staff is extremely helpful and they go out of their way to ensure that you, as a patient, stay well informed. For example, they've actually called me in the past to tell me that they received a request from the pharmacy for a refill and that they responded authorizing the refill. She's a great doctor and has a great practice.Was this rating useful? 4 flag | Submitted July 14, 2010 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Kemp has been my doctor for almost 4 years now. She is a caring and diligent physician. I had sleep apnea for years and was never diagnosed properly until I went to Dr. Kemp. I also have 4 relatives, each one has been treated by Dr. Kemp and she diagnosed and treated each of them and greatly improved the quality of life for each.I would highly recomend her as the best Doctor my family has ever had.Was this rating useful? 3 flag | Submitted February 11, 2010 5Staff 2Punctuality 1Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI have been a patient of Dr Kemp's for 8 months. Every month she fills my medication which I've been on for 9 years and need in order to function. She's usually on time, but in the past she has missed the date and left me without for a day or two. This last time, she left me without for 7 days. The doctor she had on call refused to fill the prescription because he couldn't verify that Dr Kemp had prescribed it for me. By the time she returned I had experienced the full set of withdrawals and had missed a good deal of work. Then I got a letter in the mail from Dr Kemp informing me that she was terminating me as a patient. After several calls to inquire why, she said I was "rude to her staff". Disregarding the fact that I was in pain from the withdrawal, she decided to drop me because I was not "polite". I have filed a complaint against Dr Judith Kemp with the Oregon State Medical Board for negligant disregard of a patient's needs.Was this rating useful? 2 flag | Submitted April 15, 2008 Rate this DoctorDr. Judith M.
