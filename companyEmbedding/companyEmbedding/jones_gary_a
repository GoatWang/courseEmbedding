Description






Publication Date: July 01, 2008

 This article was originally published in March-April 1994 and was republished in July-August 2008 as an HBR Classic. This article includes a one-page preview that quickly summarizes the key ideas and provides an overview of how the concepts work in practice along with suggestions for further reading.In exemplary service organizations, executives understand that they need to put customers and frontline workers at the center of their focus. Those managers heed the factors that drive profitability in this service paradigm: investment in people, technology that supports frontline workers, revamped recruiting and training practices, and compensation linked to performance. They also express a vision of leadership in somewhat unconventional terms, referring to an organization's "patina of spirituality" and the "importance of the mundane." In this article, Heskett, Jones, Loveman, Sasser, and Schlesinger take a close look at the links in the service-profit chain, which puts hard values on soft measures so that managers can calibrate the impact of employee satisfaction, loyalty, and productivity on the value of products and services delivered. Managers can then use this information to build customer satisfaction and loyalty and assess the corresponding impact on profitability and growth. Describing the links in the service-profit chain, the authors explain that profit and growth are stimulated by customer loyalty; loyalty is a direct result of customer satisfaction; satisfaction is largely influenced by the value of services provided to customers; value is created by satisfied, loyal, and productive employees; and employee satisfaction, in turn, results from high-quality support services and policies that enable employees to deliver results to customers. By completing the authors' service-profit chain audit, companies can determine not only what drives their profit but how they can sustain it in the long term.

Home Regions UAW Region 5 Director Gary Jones 

Director Gary Jones
Gary Jones was elected director of UAW Region 5 at the union’s 36th Constitutional Convention held in June 2014.  Jones was first elected to serve as director of UAW Region 5 in a special election held Oct. 19, 2012, in Kansas City, Mo.
Jones, who was previously the region’s assistant director, filled the director’s position formerly held by Jim Wells, who died Sept. 27, 2012, and had led the region since 1995.
Region 5 serves UAW members and retirees in 17 states in the western and southwestern United States, including Missouri, California and Washington state.
A graduate of the University of Tulsa and a certified public accountant, Jones was appointed top administrative assistant to former UAW Secretary-Treasurer Roy Wyse in 1995. He continued to serve in that capacity to Secretary-Treasurers Ruben Burks and Elizabeth Bunn, until his appointment as Region 5 assistant director in 2004.
In 1990, former UAW President Owen Bieber and then-Secretary-Treasurer Bill Casstevens appointed Jones to the International staff. He was assigned to the union’s Accounting Department. A year later, Jones was named chief accountant of the UAW.
A UAW Local 1895 member, Jones was hired at Ford Motor Co.’s Glass plant in Broken Arrow, Okla., in 1975. He became a member of UAW Local 249 when he transferred to the Kansas City Ford Assembly Plant when the glass plant closed.
Jones is a lifetime member of the NAACP and various other civic and political organizations. Jones and his wife, Cindy, live in O’Fallon, Mo., where they are members of the First Baptist Church. They have two daughters and three granddaughters.

Product Description
View ClipThe scenario is as follows. You approach a group of people or an individual, holding a note pad. You then proceed to ask them if they are ready to place their order, if they say no, you then say something like, that's ok, how about a card trick instead. The notepad turns into a pack of cards right in front of their eyes. You can use this in any scenario, restaurants, corporate functions, bars, partys. It is limited to your own imagination. You can even write on the gimmick, so you can use it for example at the beginning of your invisible deck routine. You ask a spectator to name any card. You write it on the Noted gimmick. You then say I will find your card, but you need a deck of cards. You then make the note pad turn into a deck of cards and then go into your invisible deck routine. You can see that the possibilities with the Noted gimmick are endless. You are supplied with a universal gimmick that makes all this possible. No slight of hand needed Custom made gimmick supplied You just supply your own deck. Comes with DVD with full explanations
