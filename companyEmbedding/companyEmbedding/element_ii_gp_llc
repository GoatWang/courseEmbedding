Georgia-Pacific Products Overview



Today’s Georgia-Pacific is vastly different from the small lumberyard that salesman Owen Cheatham started at Augusta, Ga., in 1927.  Using $6,000 of his own money and $6,000 from investors, Cheatham purchased an existing lumberyard consisting of storage sheds and a small business office and created Georgia Hardwood Lumber Company.  The company survived the Great Depression, and ultimately became a top supplier to the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II.
Georgia-Pacific, a subsidiary of Koch Industries, is headquartered in Atlanta and employs approximately 35,000 people at more than 200 facilities worldwide.
