Amplitech Amplifiers
























 







AmpliTech Products . . . The AmpliTech Advantage
AmpliTech makes an extensive line of RF Products. Competitive pricing, high performance, quality, and reliability are the basis of all our products. All our products can be screened up to Space Qualified Level, and use MIL-STD 883 guidelines for assembly and inspection, and come with a three year warranty. In addition, many of our designs can be hermetically sealed and cryogenically cooled to significantly improve the already lowest noise figure performance, as well as provide the highest caliber of reliability (in terms of MTBF and MTTF). Aside from our listing of products, many other designs are also available. Contact us for more information. 
Why AmpliTech? 
              AmpliTech is a new company that has taken the experiences of its founders and has formulated a whole new way of manufacturing and offering amplifiers. AmpliTech has taken its experiences from leading systems and components manufacturers  in order to offer a newer, more efficient process of LNA manufacturing. We have extremely low overhead and reduced manufacturing steps which lets us offer a state-of-the-art amplifier, at a very competitive price, and with sharply reduced delivery schedules as well as a three year warranty. For large quantity orders, we have teamed up with large manufacturers, assemblers, testers, and consultants to help assist in getting the amplifiers done in time while still not affecting the overall quality of the product.   
Design Heritage
              AmpliTech draws on the extensive experience of its founders in the marketing, design and manufacture of high reliability, high-performance amplifiers. We have a design heritage that has been field tested and proven to be reliable by the many customers listed below. AmpliTech provides specialized designs that have been supplied to the Space, Military, and Commercial markets. This same exact design heritage can be provided to your organization while avoiding the learning curves or yield issues that other new companies experience. We have ISO 9001 compliant processes and traceability in place to guarantee our customers quality and repeatability.
Customer Base  
              AmpliTech is currently an official registered supplier to the US government (CAGE CODE # 3CS43) and has recently also become a supplier to the Australian, Russian, Canadian, French, German, Italian, Israeli, and UK governments.  AmpliTech welcomes the opportunity to assist you and is confident that we are offering the best amplifier, at the best price, in any part of the world. We are committed to becoming the leader in amplifier sales and a model for customer service. We do not want to just make a sale, we want to create a long term relationship.

We take extreme care in maintaining a complete and detailed product assurance program. Our product quality is structured to and operates within the guidelines of ISO9001-2008 and MIL-STD-883. This, in turn, allows us to meet the rigorous requirements generated by our customers in the aerospace, military, and commercial sectors. Internal procedures are used to perform all functions affecting quality, from initial design through final acceptance. These procedures detail the responsibilities and functions necessary to maintain effective controls and to provide a means for evaluating quality disciplines during all phases of a job's assembly. Warranty Policy 			AmpliTech guarantees that each of its products will be free from manufacturing and material defects and will perform in full accordance with applicable specifications provided.

This warranty does not apply to any products which have been subject to accident, negligence, alteration, abuse, or other misuse. AmpliTech offers no warranty on accessories or internal parts not directly supplied by us and does not warranty damages to other equipment located before and after our products. Disassembly of our products or removal of factory seals by anyone other than an authorized representative of AmpliTech, voids this warranty in its entirety.
