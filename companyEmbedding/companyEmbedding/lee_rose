Excerpts

















The performance rating system (or PRS) provides the most comprehensive and factual analysis in basketball
Objective evaluation of individual and team performance can be a challenge for both players and coaches. Each of us is predisposed to favor certain styles and facets of play.

The motion offense can be an effective weapon 
The motion offense is an effective weapon that every team should consider adding to its repertoire, but it cannot be used as a complete offense because too many players have to handle the ball and make crucial decisions.

Product Description
				                  		                
		                    Lee Rose has been one of basketball’s most knowledgeable and respected coaches over the past 50 years at the high school, college, and professional levels. Winning Basketball Fundamentals presents his proven program for success, the same one he used in taking teams from two different colleges to the Final Four. 

From offense to defense to transition play and special situations, Rose covers every tactical facet of the game and adds his insights for improving execution in each. He presents popular offensive systems—the Triangle, LA, Flex, Dribble Drive, and Motion—as well as man-to-man and zone defensive schemes, with suggestions for when and how to deploy and adjust them. 

Rose also teaches all the essential individual skills required for performing those tactics proficiently and consistently, with special tips for executing when the game is on the line. Perimeter- and post-specific instruction and drills will help players build on their skills through practice.

Coach Rose also shares his Performance Rating System—a tool he’s used time and again to develop some of the game’s top players. Rose explains not only how to identify strengths and weaknesses but also how to use that information to maximize the potential of individual players and the team. 

Flashy and fluke plays might be fun to watch, but you can’t build a successful season or career on them. Winning Basketball Fundamentals is the proven formula for developing the solid individual skills and team tactics you can count on game after game.

Lee Rose began his coaching career starting at the high school 
      level and then moving on to assistant coaching jobs at the college level 
      before landing the head coaching and athletic director position at 
      Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky.
    

      In 1975, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte hired Rose as 
      head coach and athletic director, and UNCC was soon rewarded for the 
      move. Rose compiled a 72-18 (.800) record in three seasons at the 
      school, and he was named the Sporting News National Coach of the 
      Year in 1977 after leading UNC Charlotte to the NIT finals in 1976 and 
      the NCAA Final Four in 1977.
    

      Rose left UNCC in 1978 for Purdue University, where he took his first 
      team to the NIT finals and the next year’s squad to the 1980 Final Four, 
      compiling a 50-18 record as the Boilermakers’ coach. He then accepted 
      the position of head coach at the University of South Florida, a school 
      with a basketball program only 10 years old at the time.
    

      As a college head coach, Rose compiled a .705 winning percentage 
      (388-162). Equally impressive, he was named Coach of the Year in every 
      conference in which he coached: Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic 
      Conference, Sun Belt, and Big Ten. He was inducted into the Kentucky 
      Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001.
    

      After his collegiate career, Rose went on to serve as an assistant coach 
      for five NBA teams: San Antonio Spurs, New Jersey Nets, Milwaukee Bucks, 
      Charlotte Hornets, and Charlotte Bobcats. In addition, Lee was the vice 
      president of player personnel for the Milwaukee Bucks. Rose has also 
      served as an NBA consultant and coaching supervisor for NBA 
      Developmental League coaches. The NBA also recruited him to coordinate 
      and conduct the on-court instruction and drills at the NBA pre-draft 
      camp for over 15 years.
    

      One of Rose’s proudest accomplishments is the work that he and his wife, 
      Eleanor, do to reverse low educational attainment in Kentucky’s Fifth 
      Congressional District in conjunction with Forward in the Fifth (a 
      nonprofit organization and an affiliate of the Center for Rural 
      Development). Since 2005, Rose has been to 42 counties in this 
      Appalachian region. He has spoken to more than 11,000 middle school 
      students, encouraging them to stay in school and to use their education 
      as a stepping stone for future success.
    

      Lee is still actively involved with Forward in the Fifth in Kentucky and 
      works with the Men's Homeless Shelter of Charlotte. He and his wife live 
      in Charlotte, North Carolina.
    



      “This incisive analysis of basketball’s essentials will be an 
      invaluable guide to coaches and players alike.”
    

Jordan Cohn-- NBA Scout
    

      “Lee Rose’s ability to break down the game and communicate his 
      thoughts is on a level with the best in basketball."
    

Mike Pratt-- Basketball Radio Analyst, University of Kentucky 
      Hall of Fame Member
    

      “Lee Rose has developed hundreds of players throughout his 
      legendary career. In Winning Basketball Fundamentals, he 
      continues to share his winning coaching strategy and offers the best 
      drills to refine individual skills and team execution.”
    

Ed Conroy-- Head Basketball Coach Tulane University
    

“The game needs more of Lee Rose’s coaching style. Winning 
      Basketball Fundamentals exemplifies the teaching that made him one of 
      the most respected coaches in the game.”


Tom Crean-- Head Basketball Coach Indiana University
    

“Coach Lee Rose provides an excellent resource for basketball 
      enthusiasts. His understanding of the game is unmatched, and his 
      commitment to excellence, integrity and hard work are exemplary. Winning 
      Basketball Fundamentals is an outstanding primer on the game of 
      basketball, and the basic principles, outlined by Coach Rose, are 
      applicable to life in general – i.e., developing individual skills, team 
      execution, and having a winning attitude. And Coach Rose’s character and 
      commitment to education and service are beyond reproach. I recommend 
      this book.”


John E. Chowning -- Vice President for Church & External Relations
    

      Executive Assistant to the President
    

      Campbellsville University
    

“This book is a must read for all basketball coaches and those 
      wanting to better understand the minds of these professionals. While the 
      book can be technical in some places, Coach Rose’s knowledge and proven 
      system for success is superb. His recipe for success on the court and in 
      life can be found in this resource.” 


Jim Tackett -- Executive Director
    

      Forward in the Fifth

Lee
"
	The Teardrop
"

	Named after a beautiful marbled tortoise cat that was surrendered to the Pixie Project when her owner very suddenly lost her home. Like its namesake, the Lee frame has an elegant feline silhouette.  The striking teardrop shape is balanced with delicately thin acetate edging.  The Lee is available as an optical and sunglass frame for women in driftwood, surf and rose garden.
Designer's Note

	The distinctive teardrop shape and thin acetate rim are perfectly balanced. This feminine frame looks great on medium to longer faces.

Sizing Information
Glasses sizing is defined by three numbers: Lens Width, Bridge Width, and Temple Length. Frame width is usually the most important factor in finding a pair of glasses that fit well. It will give you a sense of a frame’s overall width (42mm frames would be narrow, while 52mm frames would be wide).
  
 If you have a narrow bridge or close set eyes you will want the second number (bridge width) to be lower (15mm to 18mm), but if you have a wider bridge or wide set eyes this number can be higher (18mm to 22mm).
  
The third number in the string, temple length is the measurement in millimeters of the ‘arm’ of the frame. If you have had problems with temples being too short, look for frames with lengths of 145 and 150mm.
  
Read our sizing guide.


 
Home Try-On
​Six pairs, seven days, no charge. 
Select up to six pairs of your favorite Fetch frames, add them to the Home Try-On cart and proceed with checkout. You have seven days from arrival to test out the frames and get feedback from friends and family. Then simply return all the frames using the enclosed prepaid label and order the winners here. A valid credit card is required to use the Home Try-On service. An authorization of $1 is temporarily placed on the card to ensure frame return, and this hold is promptly removed upon receipt of your prepaid Home Try-On return.

Rx Made Easy
​Fetch fills single vision prescriptions in either CR-39 or 1.67 high index lenses. High index lenses are thinner and lighter, and add $40 to the cost. If you need a specialty lens such as a bifocal or progressive, you can purchase Fetch frames here (click the Frame Only tab to order non-Rx), then take the frame to your local optician to have your prescription filled.
 More Rx Info  


 
Reading Magnification
​Made of optical quality plastic (unlike those drugstore numbers) our reading lenses include anti-reflective and scratch resistant coatings just like their Rx counterparts. Fetch readers are available in quarter diopters from +0.50 to +3.50. Need different magnifications for each eye? No problem, just contact us directly to place your order.


 
Frame Only Lenses
​ Standard Demo lenses are meant for those who are going to put other lenses in their Fetch frames. It's not recommended to wear the frames as is with the demo lenses. If you plan to wear your clear frames out and about, our Prescription Quality lenses are made of optical quality plastic and include anti-reflective and scratch resistant coatings like their Rx counterparts for just $40 more.

Absorption (?
AbsorptionAbsorption describes how well a substance penetrates your skin. Here we measure absorption in terms of its rate of penetration into your skin. How fast did it absorb? Some products don't absorb well, and instead "sit" on top of skin forming a film, which can range from light to heavy. If you still have a layer of product sitting on top of your skin, the rate would be considered Very Slow.)


Very SlowVery SlowSlowAverageFastVery FastVery Fast


Residue (?
ResidueSometimes a product leaves a residue on the skin after it is applied - a film or a layer of product. Often the residue feels greasy, particularly with heavy moisturizers that contain a high amount of lipids. If your product does have residue, how greasy is it?)

Drugstore.com does not have any on hand.  I really would like to get some.  Been using it for 20 years.  Are there any other locations to purchase Rose Milk?

Product Funnel for Non-Profits

General » Product Funnel for Non-Profits											





 
 
 




Today’s comment came from a busy professional and an entrepreneur:
Last week I attended your It’s a SNAP presentation at the NCTech4Good conference.  It was very good, but I could not see how to convert the Product Funnel Strategy to my side-job or even a non-profit organization.   After all, they don’t sell a product or service.  Their company just offers “good works” and my donors just donate money, because it’s the right thing to do.
Well – all companies are in the business to make money (profits and nonprofits alike).
And if you make it “good business” to do business with you, you will attract more business (i.e. donors), who also like to do “good work”.
The key is “understanding your client’s business” and what will help their business thrive.  Because when their business thrives, they will donate more.
Product Funnel Example for a fund-raising based operation:
Goal is to attract new donors as well as entice current donors to not only continue to donate but increase their amounts.

One thing that all Companies have in common: They are in the Business to Make Money.
One thing that most individuals have in common: They want more time for the things that they love.

Use those two facts to build a product funnel that entices people to continue to move down your product funnel list.


 







Donate this amount – you will receive coupons to purchase products and services (from donors’ company)



———————
Donate this amount – receive gift certificates for hobbies, products and services (from donor’s company)
————————-
Donate this amount – invitation to a gala event with celebrities (hold this event at one of your donor’s business)
—————————–
Donate this amount – and get 4 family tickets to Disney Fantasy Cruise line (or whatever cruise line is a donor).





The above example isn’t meant to perfectly fit your business model.  It just illustrates the concept.  In the above example, you are providing your donors additional more Effective Marketing Opportunities.  This means that their “donation bucks” are also working as their marketing dollars (above and beyond their name as sponsors in the front of back pages.)  It allows their target market to actually get a taste of their business and hopefully continue to buy from them.
Make better use of these two facts:

Clients/donors have to spend marketing dollars to make dollars.
People do business with people they know, like and trust.

Therefore, provide more opportunities for the “right public” to get to know more about your donors and their businesses.  Learn about your donor’s “target client” and create an effective marketing strategy for that donor.  Some examples are below.
Provide bundles to entice them to go further down the list, such as:

1-full page advertorial* strictly on the donor’s business. You distribute this article to all your magazines, ezines, websites, social media pages, blog-sites (including affiliated partner sites) – that go out to your donor’s target clients/market. They also receive the files for their own distribution.  Each advertorial includes links, coupons and ways to contact the donor’s business.

*An advertorial is an advertisement in the form of editorial content. The term “advertorial” is a blend of the words “advertisement” and “editorial.”
 

30 minute professional video interview on the donor’s business. You distribute this article to all your magazines, ezines, websites, social media pages, blog-sites, TV Stations (including affiliated partner sites) – that go out to your donor’s target clients/market.. They also receive the files for their own distribution. Each advertorial includes links, coupons and ways to contact the donor’s business.
You arrange to have your donor on a TV or Radio program that is specifically for their target market. This could be an interview, a guest spot, an infomercial, or whatever best fits your donor’s demographic.
Place a Billboard for their company at a location of their choice (you will have your logo on it to sponsor them).
Contract that X number of your staff members will post positive comments on the donor’s website/social media pages for a total of 3 posts a week for 3 months.
Contract that X number of your staff members will do a video testimonial for your donor’s business.

 

Create a Networking Event for your donors to meet and do business together. Officially introduce them to each other and make it easy for them to do business together.  Have these events at one of your donor’s facilities.

 
 
Once again – these examples may not fit your business model.  But the idea is to design a product funnel strategy that will help your donors do better business.  When your donor’s business thrives, their donation amounts will increase, and therefore, you will thrive.

Take part in a legend with our diverse selection of Lee Jeans for women—they’ve been making fine denim for over a hundred years, so they know exactly what they’re doing. From the fabric to the construction, Lee jeans are made with longevity and style in mind. Do yourself a favor and check out the results of this hard-earned heritage, including pants, shorts, and all types of denim that come in every style and wash under the sun!

Grab a pair of classic-fit jeans that both flatter your figure while keeping you comfy all day long. If you’re wanting to give those new boots a whirl around town, be sure to pick up a pair of dark indigo bootcut jeans to complement them. For looking hip and edgy, there’s nothing quite like a pair of skinny cut jeans with just the right amount of distressing for that lived-in look—then wear them with one of your sweet new infinity scarves and a pair of aviator sunglasses to complete your outfit!

Lee collection doesn’t stop a jeans. They have an exciting selection of cargo pants, trousers, and chinos. Their trousers and essential chinos are flattering cuts that will look great on any shape. They are the both work well for numerous occasions. The chinos in particular are excellent for casual events too!

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.

The Wine Experts



“They’re their own perfect little tornado.” See what prompted noted winemaker Joel Gott to say this about the formidable wine-buying duo of Devon and Doug: 




Colors and Bubbles – The Main Wine Types
Red Wines
Color
Runs the gamut from dark pink to ink
Common Flavors
Everything red, everything dark, dark fruits, dark berries, leather, tobacco, coffee, cocoa, warm spices, black pepper — you get the idea.
Darker grape varieties are often used for making red wines, but it’s the amount of contact with the skin of the grape that truly determines color. More contact with the skin: darker wine. Skin contact also imparts a kaleidoscope of possible flavors and textures, contributing to body and complexity.
Extra credit: Tannins, those sometimes bitter or astringent notes, often very pleasant in well-balanced wines, come from grape skins. You won’t find tannins in a white wine.
Try These
El Terrano Tempranillo
Dark fruit aromas, loads of blackberry and currant flavors. Wild herbs in the mouthwatering finish.
Monterustico Rosso
Amazing quality from one of the best producers out there. Intense structure. More, please.
Criterion Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon
Grilling steak or ribs? Try this. Cherry, black plum, hint of eucalyptus. Quintessential complexity.
White Wines
Color
Near clear to honey
Common Flavors
White fruits, tropical fruits, citrus, peaches, butter, honey, vanilla, chalky minerality, white pepper — and many more.
Minimal grape skin contact allows room for the juice in a white wine to speak more clearly, subtle notes taking on greater significance. Because flaws in color or flavor are difficult to mask, a delicate hand is highly prized in the making of white wines.
Extra credit: Broadly speaking, as vineyards move farther north, they produce wines with more acidity, creating crisp, refreshing, mouthwatering white wines. 
Try These
Andover Estate Chardonnay
Beautifully balances between apricot flavors, buttery notes and a crisp finish. Super food-friendly.
El Terrano Albariño
Zippy, fresh. Saline minerality. Yes to paella, grilled shrimp or tapas. You can’t find it anywhere else.
Criterion Pinot Grigio Friuli Grave
An ideal example of pinot grigio. Peachy, juicy, crisp — perfect with seafood, light pasta or risotto.
Rosé Wines
Color
Gentle pink to light orange
Common Flavors
Strawberry, raspberry, cranberry, pomegranate, pink grapefruit, red currant, watermelon
Rosé wines came about as a way to quench a French summer thirst, like a white wine, but with a flavorful nod to the red wines that France highly treasures. Today, Rosés are on fire, making up nearly 40% of all wine purchases, and rightfully so — they’ve thrown off their “sweet and simple” shackles and are unabashedly delicious.
Extra credit: In the most common method, very short contact times with grape skins (1-2 days, as opposed to weeks for Reds) are dialed in by Rosé makers to get just the profile they want. Secondary method: Sometimes winemakers, wanting a denser red wine, will siphon off some early pink juice. This pink juice is then made into Rosé. 
Try These
Globerati Rosé
Crisp, delicate. Notes of wild strawberry. Perfect match for pork loin, rich salads, aged soft cheeses.

Fresh strawberries, blackberries. Light and elegant finish. More than 6 glasses of wine per 1-liter bottle!
El Terrano Rosado
Sipping feels like diving into a bowl of fresh raspberries and strawberries. Pair with goat cheese, tapas, pork chops. 
Bubbly
“Always have a backup bottle of bubbly on hand.” – Doug Bell, Global Beverage Buyer
Bubbly exists in its own world, apart from all other wines in both style and winemaking process. 
And…it’s a blast! The key players:
Champagne
To be called Champagne, it must be from the same named region of France. The most complex of the bunch, often with tantalizing notes of fresh-baked brioche, and running the spectrum from brut (driest) to demi-sec (a dessert Sparkler!), there’s a reason it’s the King of Bubbly. 
Prosecco
Italy’s offering to the world of sparkling wine is the fastest growing style in the category. While it lacks the complexity of its French counterpart, it makes up for it with reliably vibrant peach and apricot notes. And prosecco bubbles are famously unstoppable!
Cava
Spain’s Sparkler, because it is in-bottle fermented like Champagne, shares more in common with its French counterpart than prosecco. Almost always dry, cava often displays floral aromatics and citrus notes. 
Try These
Presto Prosecco
Pair with brunch. Crisp, lively. Apple and orange blossom notes. Touch of honey.

Madame Liberté Brut
A celebration bubbly! Zippy acidity, refreshing green apple notes. Touch of toast. Serve well chilled.

J. Lassalle Champagne Brut Premier Cru
A masterful example of a Grower Champagne. Refined, crisp. White peach and a graceful floral component. 
The Criterion® Line
Certain regions of the world are famous for a specific style of wine, like malbec from Argentina, sauvignon blanc from New Zealand or syrah from Australia. Have you ever wanted to know exactly what these sought-after wines are supposed to taste like? Our Criterion line of wines answers that question, with each wine providing a reference point for just how a wine from that region should taste. Each wine is an educational guide — the tastiest one you’ll ever try!
How to Store Your Wine
For short-term storage, keep your unopened wine bottles in a cool, dark place with a constant temperature — the main thing is to avoid big temperature changes. A closet, cabinet or under the bed works well here, ideally under 75°F. For long-term storage, wine is best when laid on its side (especially if it has a cork — otherwise the cork will dry out), in a cool, dark place between 55 and 60°F.
