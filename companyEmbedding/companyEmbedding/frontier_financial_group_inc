We are ready to provide this type of financial analysis to support the continue prosperity of your business.

News
                 |   July 21, 1998    













Frontier Insurance Group Creates New Financial Group



Frontier Insurance Group, Inc. has announced the formation of Frontier Financial. This new division consolidates the surety and fidelity products of the group with the financial specialty insurance products of principal subsidiaries, Lyndon Insurance Group and Acceleration Life Insurance Company.


Frontier Financial will be under the direction of David Campbell, vice president of the Rock Hill, NY-based Frontier Insurance Group, Inc. and president of the new division. With 20 years of experience in the surety and fidelity industry and formerly senior vice president of Frontier's
Surety operations, Campbell will be responsible for the marketing, underwriting and administration of Frontier Financial. Other senior officers include Rollie Anderson, president of Lyndon Insurance Group, who will continue to direct the operations of Lyndon, and David Rhodes, senior vice president of Surety for Frontier Insurance Company.


Campbell says, "This consolidation will allow Frontier to maximize the historical success of both our surety and financial operations and facilitate the creation and development of new products
in both areas."


Frontier is now one of the largest surety companies in the United States, writing primarily construction/subdivision, service contractors, environmental, and workers' compensation bonds. Lyndon generated over $175 million in 1997, with primary products including Single Premium Credit, Collateral Protection, Auto Residual Value, Inventory Protection, GAP Insurance,
and Extended Warranty.


Harry Rhulen, Frontier's president and CEO, says, "The combination of our financial and surety facilities will create tremendous opportunity for the group. David Campbell's entrepreneurial abilities have been evident in the outstanding performance of our bond division. We are confident his expertise will enhance the success and profitability of our financial specialty programs and products.''
