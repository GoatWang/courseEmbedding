Associate Scholar Kevin McNamara Interviewed by Czech Newspaper Lidovky on Latest Book

July 17, 2017 
It is exactly one hundred years since the Czecho-Slovak Legionnaires first came to attention at the battle of Zborov in today’s western Ukraine.  Exiled professor Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk recruited the legionnaires from among Czech and Slovak POWs in Russia and a few thousand more who fought for Allied Russia in World War One.  “Although he had no military experience, Masaryk created an army that won independence for the Czecho-Slovaks.  This and other achievements rank him as a great man,” says Kevin J. McNamara, author of the first major book about the Czecho-Slovak Legion in English in about 80 years, who talks about the Siberian anabasis of the Czech and Slovak legionnaires, and about Masaryk, in this Lidovky interview.
The Battle of Zborov in July 1917 was a foretaste of the astonishing things the legionnaires would later manage to accomplish after Russia left the war, forcing them to defend themselves by fighting their way at least 5,000 miles from the Ural Mountains to Vladivostok by the end of 1918.  In the summer of 1918, they even took over the entire Trans-Siberian Railway for a while. “I think the power of this story is that it is about an undistinguished array of shop-keepers, dentists, farmers, factory hands, and bank clerks who were plucked from obscurity and plunged into World War One, fought on the Eastern Front, and then fought their way across Siberia under terrible conditions,” says McNamara, author of the book, Dreams of a Great Small Nation.
 
Lidovky:  What is the level of awareness of World War One in the United States?
I think the average American knows we fought in that war, but many people probably confuse the First with the Second World War.  Most Americans are not well versed in history.
Lidovky:  Are American college and secondary students taught about such subjects?
Yes, but history curricula in both secondary schools and higher education emphasize the “western” part of Western Civilization, so that the focus is almost entirely on World War One’s Western Front.  The Eastern Front, where the story of my book takes place, is almost entirely absent.  The arc of world history in most American history survey courses starts with the ancient world, moving from Jerusalem, to Athens, to Rome, then has something to say about the Middle Ages, and then focuses on France and Great Britain and the founding of the United States, moving from Rome, to London, to Philadelphia.  Eastern Europe and Russia tend to get short shrift; even Germany does not make an appearance until Hitler surfaces. Very little is said of the Holy Roman Empire or Austria-Hungary, or the very high state of German culture.  Even American specialists in history with doctoral degrees confessed to me that they did not really know the full story of the Czecho-Slovak Legion.  In works on the Russian Civil War, the role of the Czecho-Slovak Legion is mentioned largely in passing, summarized in a few paragraphs. 
Read the full interview here.

Kevin McNamara: All-Star Game never should have 'counted'







Monday
Jul 10, 2017 at 3:55 PM







				Kevin McNamara Journal Sports Writer   kevinmcnamara33
			
A few thoughts, observations and news items while wondering which South County beach New Jersey’s Chris Christie will invade during a timeout from this week’s National Governor’s Association meetings.
All-Star Game
The last vestige of ex-commissioner Bud Selig’s awful idea to award home field in the World Series to the winner of the mid-summer classic is over. Tuesday’s baseball All-Star Game is all about fun and games, as it should be.
Back in 2002, Selig overreacted to the embarrassment of the All-Star game ending in a 7-7 tie when the teams ran out of pitching after 11 innings. Four of the 19 pitchers used that night couldn’t muster a full inning of "work" so Selig should've tossed a good chunk of blame to the two managers, Joe Torre and Bob Brenly.
Instead the commissioner who couldn't police steroids or give his small-market franchises a fighting chance felt that attaching some weight to the All-Star Game would elevate interest in the exhibition from both players and the fans. That didn’t happen. What we’d love to see are more innings and at-bats for the stars. Let’s watch American League starter Chris Sale throw at least two innings. Give me three at-bats from Mookie Betts, Aaron Judge and Carlos Correa. If we catch only a glimpse of A.L. reserves Brandon Kintzler, Avisail Garcia or Francisco Lindor no one will complain.
By the way, the Red Sox fans owe Uncle Bud a thank you. His goofy idea for home field via the All-Star game helped the Sox win all three (2004, '07, '13) of their modern-day World Series.
Kelly Olynyk, $50-million man?
It used to be that Mommas could wish for their babies to grow up to be over-priced lefty relievers. Now you could do worse than being a slow power forward.
Thanks to a new flood of television money, some crazy contracts are flowing through the NBA these days. The stars are seeing deals that would make hedge-fund titans blush. James Harden just signed an extension that will pay upwards of $45 million a season. Although he’s won only one playoff series in his career, the Celtics will send $127 million Gordon Hayward's way over the next four years.
The big dollars are filtering to the Next Level Guys as well. Olynyk barely averaged 20 minutes a game with the Celtics, but cashed in big-time with the Miami Heat. The Knicks dug themselves further into oblivion by signing Tim Hardaway Jr., to a four-year, $71-million deal.
This is all due to a superb labor deal that must make the fools in the insanely popular NFL furious. Two key provisions in the NBA’s deal guarantees all contracts and states that 51 percent of the gross revenue goes to the players. The NBA now receives $2.66 billion a year from ESPN and TNT, deals that the networks will struggle to afford.
Also the next time you read that Shelvin Mack, C.J. Miles and Bojan Bogdanovic are cashing in big, remember to root for the players. They need the dough a lot more than the billionaire owners.
UConn crying poor?
The Hartford Courant reported last week that UConn athletic department leaders are concerned about likely revenue challenges in the near future. Multi-million payouts that the Huskies have received from the dissolution of the Big East five years ago are due to run out next year. Combined with a sharp attendance drop in football, the department is facing major shortfalls as it fights to remain nationally relevant in the American Athletic Conference.
Here are the numbers: UConn received $10.5 million from the American in 2015-16, the highest payout in the conference. A large chunk came from money retained by UConn, Cincinnati and South Florida when they split with the Big East’s Catholic schools. Once that revenue stream runs dry those schools could see checks more in line with the $4.5 million the American currently sends schools like Memphis and Houston.
That would be a nice disbursement if UConn wasn’t trying to play Big Boy football. The Big East, for example, pays schools like Providence and Villanova around $3.5 million, but its members only focus on one major sport.
As a comparison, schools playing in the Power Five football conferences blow away the Huskies. Former rivals Boston College and Syracuse, for example, received $22.7 million from the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2015.
The Huskies are hoping for help in two areas. First the American is praying the TV networks — or an outlet like Google — will pay more to televise and stream its games. They’re also hoping football fans get a bit more excited about games against Central Florida and SMU. Average attendance was just 26,800 last year, off nearly 12,000 from the Big East days.
As they say in New Jersey, good luck with that.

Auto Accident

Kevin J. McNamara has handled literally hundreds of motor vehicle claims over the last 17 years.
Motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of personal injury and wrongful death claims. An experienced lawyer who is familiar with the countless state and federal laws that may apply as well as the insurance issues that arise is critical. Our firm is dedicated to ensuring that you recover maximum monetary awards for past and future medical expenses, past and future lost wages, long-term care, past and future pain and suffering, disability, and in the case of wrongful death, additional financial support for the family

-Truck Accidents

Wrongful Death

Kevin J. McNamara has represented the families of many victims of wrongful death.
When a loved one has died as a result of the negligence or reckless conduct of another, the family members have a right to be compensated for this terrible tragedy through the Illinois court system. Unlike a personal injury case where the injured person brings the lawsuit, in a wrongful death action the family members bring the lawsuit. 

Some common causes of wrongful death cases include:

-Car Accidents
-Truck Accidents
-Motorcycle Accidents
-Work-Related Injuries
-Construction Accidents
-Medical Malpractice

The wrongful death of a loved one can often leave family members with considerable expenses including hospital bills and funeral and burial costs. These costs are recoverable, in addition to the compensation you are entitled to for your emotional loss. Potential damages include loss of companionship, sorrow and grief, as well as loss of future wages.

Our firm is dedicated to ensuring that you recover the maximum monetary award for your tragic loss. If you have lost a loved one due to wrongful death, contact Kevin J. McNamara Law Offices, P.C. today for a free consultation.
