Biography[edit]




Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival.


As CEO of Loews Hotels beginning in 1989, Tisch initiated the Loews Hotels Good Neighbor Policy over 20 years ago, one of the first of its kind in the hospitality industry. The Loews Good Neighbor Policy is a recipient of the U.S. President’s Service Award from the Points of Light Foundation.
Tisch serves as Chairman Emeritus the U.S. Travel Association, the national non-profit association representing all segments of the multibillion-dollar travel industry. For six years, he served as Chairman of NYC & Company, the city’s official tourism marketing agency and convention and visitors bureau.
Concurrent with his national efforts to help stimulate travel and tourism in the aftermath of September 11, Tisch served as Chairman of New York Rising, a task force set committed to reviving tourism in New York City. In recognition for his leadership and civic involvement, Crain's New York Business named Tisch one of the "Top Ten Most Influential Business Leaders" and was named "CEO of the Year" by the Executive Council of New York in 2006.
The Tisch family is one of America's wealthiest and most influential, with assets in the billions which they control through their holding company, Loews Corporation.
Books[edit]
Tisch is the author of three best-selling books that explore his leadership philosophy, the role of the customer experience, and civic engagement: The Power of We: Succeeding Through Partnerships, Chocolates on the Pillow Aren't Enough: Reinventing the Customer Experience, and Citizen You: Doing Your Part to Change the World.
Media[edit]
He is also the host of the Emmy-nominated Beyond the Boardroom with Jonathan Tisch television series, where he speaks with some of America's preeminent CEOs and business luminaries in one-one-one interviews. In 2008, Tisch co-founded Walnut Hill Media, LLC, a separate, privately held company investing in a variety of media opportunities. Through Walnut Hill Media, Tisch is a minority investor in Tribeca Enterprises. Tisch's role as Chairman of Loews Hotels remains unchanged.
Philanthropy and board affiliations[edit]
Tisch served as the Vice-Chairman of The Welfare to Work Partnership, and currently serves on the Board of Trustees for Tufts University. Tisch, who graduated from Tufts University in 1976, gave an endowed gift of $40 million to fund the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service which celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2011. Tisch is on the Board of the Tribeca Film Institute and is a co-owner of the New York Football Giants. He also serves on the Board of Directors of the New York Giants and is the team's Treasurer. In 2010, Tisch joined Jets owner Woody Johnson as co-chairs of the bid committee established to bring Super Bowl XLVIII to the Metropolitan area. The bid was summarized by the tagline “Make Some History.” In a decision by NFL team owners, the New York/New Jersey region was awarded the 2014 Super Bowl. The game was played at MetLife Stadium, the first open-air stadium in a cold-weather region to host a Super Bowl. Tisch is a co-chair of the Host Committee. In 2011, Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch made a $10 million gift to The Metropolitan Museum of Art to support the creation of an exhibition space within the Costume Institute to be named The Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Gallery.
Personal life[edit]
In 1988, he married Laura Steinberg, the daughter of financier and insurance executive Saul Steinberg, at the Central Synagogue in Manhattan.[3] They later divorced. In 2007, he married Lizzie Rudnick.[4]

Biography[edit]




Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival.


As CEO of Loews Hotels beginning in 1989, Tisch initiated the Loews Hotels Good Neighbor Policy over 20 years ago, one of the first of its kind in the hospitality industry. The Loews Good Neighbor Policy is a recipient of the U.S. President’s Service Award from the Points of Light Foundation.
Tisch serves as Chairman Emeritus the U.S. Travel Association, the national non-profit association representing all segments of the multibillion-dollar travel industry. For six years, he served as Chairman of NYC & Company, the city’s official tourism marketing agency and convention and visitors bureau.
Concurrent with his national efforts to help stimulate travel and tourism in the aftermath of September 11, Tisch served as Chairman of New York Rising, a task force set committed to reviving tourism in New York City. In recognition for his leadership and civic involvement, Crain's New York Business named Tisch one of the "Top Ten Most Influential Business Leaders" and was named "CEO of the Year" by the Executive Council of New York in 2006.
The Tisch family is one of America's wealthiest and most influential, with assets in the billions which they control through their holding company, Loews Corporation.
Books[edit]
Tisch is the author of three best-selling books that explore his leadership philosophy, the role of the customer experience, and civic engagement: The Power of We: Succeeding Through Partnerships, Chocolates on the Pillow Aren't Enough: Reinventing the Customer Experience, and Citizen You: Doing Your Part to Change the World.
Media[edit]
He is also the host of the Emmy-nominated Beyond the Boardroom with Jonathan Tisch television series, where he speaks with some of America's preeminent CEOs and business luminaries in one-one-one interviews. In 2008, Tisch co-founded Walnut Hill Media, LLC, a separate, privately held company investing in a variety of media opportunities. Through Walnut Hill Media, Tisch is a minority investor in Tribeca Enterprises. Tisch's role as Chairman of Loews Hotels remains unchanged.
Philanthropy and board affiliations[edit]
Tisch served as the Vice-Chairman of The Welfare to Work Partnership, and currently serves on the Board of Trustees for Tufts University. Tisch, who graduated from Tufts University in 1976, gave an endowed gift of $40 million to fund the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service which celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2011. Tisch is on the Board of the Tribeca Film Institute and is a co-owner of the New York Football Giants. He also serves on the Board of Directors of the New York Giants and is the team's Treasurer. In 2010, Tisch joined Jets owner Woody Johnson as co-chairs of the bid committee established to bring Super Bowl XLVIII to the Metropolitan area. The bid was summarized by the tagline “Make Some History.” In a decision by NFL team owners, the New York/New Jersey region was awarded the 2014 Super Bowl. The game was played at MetLife Stadium, the first open-air stadium in a cold-weather region to host a Super Bowl. Tisch is a co-chair of the Host Committee. In 2011, Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch made a $10 million gift to The Metropolitan Museum of Art to support the creation of an exhibition space within the Costume Institute to be named The Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Gallery.
Personal life[edit]
In 1988, he married Laura Steinberg, the daughter of financier and insurance executive Saul Steinberg, at the Central Synagogue in Manhattan.[3] They later divorced. In 2007, he married Lizzie Rudnick.[4]

Jonathan M. Tisch, co-chairman of the board of the Loews Corporation and chairman of its subsidiary Loews Hotels & Resorts.

            Earl Wilson/The New York Times        



This interview with Jonathan M. Tisch, co-chairman of the board of the Loews Corporation and chairman of its subsidiary Loews Hotels & Resorts, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.Q. What were some early influences?A. I was fortunate to have grown up as a young kid in the hotel business watching my father, Bob Tisch, and my uncle, Larry Tisch, create what is today the Loews Corporation. I have a recollection of being 5 years old, standing at the front door of the Traymore Hotel, greeting President Eisenhower. I was given instructions that I first salute him because he was a general, and then I shake his hand. I was so nervous I did them both at the same time.My cousins, my siblings and I were fully indoctrinated into the hotel business as children. In 1957, my father and uncle opened the Americana of Bal Harbour, and we would often go there on vacation. If I was bored, I would go behind the front desk at 7 years old. I would go into the kitchen. I would go into the laundry. I had free rein to walk around the property, and I took full advantage of that.My first paying job in the industry started when I was 15 years old, and I worked at the former Americana on Seventh Avenue in New York, a big hotel that my family built. I worked behind the front desk, and I used my middle name as my last name so that nobody knew that I was a member of the family that controlled Loews Hotels and the Loews Corporation.

It said “Jonathan Mark” on my name badge. On nights when the hotel was sold out, somebody might walk up and say, “I have a reservation,” and I’d check. If they didn’t have one, I’d say, “No, sorry, there’s no reservation.” Then they’d say, “Well, I’m going to call the Tisch brothers. I know them very well. I know all three Tisch brothers.”Now, my father’s name was Preston Robert and my uncle is Larry. So in one particular case, an individual thought that there were three Tisch brothers. He was going to call Preston, Robert or Larry. So I knew right away that he didn’t know our family.Were you always going to go into the family business?I took about four years off and made a detour to go into the TV business. During my senior year at Tufts, I started as an intern and became a cinematographer-producer for what was then the NBC affiliate in Boston. I had no experience. I befriended the producer, who taught me how to shoot and edit film, and then videotape. When I graduated in 1976, they offered me a job, and I spent the next three years in various roles producing shows.

I found those years very informative and helpful to me for the lodging industry. With the properties, I get very involved in the design. Hotels are made up of thousands of edits — what the lobby looks like, what the room looks like, what the food tastes like. And so those years in TV have become incredibly beneficial to me.

Early management lessons you learned?Making sure that I knew what I was talking about and that I had done my homework on a particular issue, so that when I spoke, I had a sense of gravitas. One of the things I talk about today is that you really have to know your trade. You don’t have to have every answer. You can’t be all things to all people, and it’s good to surround yourself with people who complement your skill set. But you have to know enough to be fluent in every aspect of your company. There were some lessons learned early on when I might not have done as much homework as I should have.Another area is rushing to make decisions. I think taking time is important, especially when you’re making big decisions. You need to pull all the facts together and canvass your team to get their input. When you’re the C.E.O. or the chairman, the air gets very thin at the top, and oftentimes you’ve got people telling you what they think you should hear as opposed to telling you the truth. And as you become more competent in your abilities, you start to be able to parse out what’s fact from fiction and then press somebody to say, “Are you telling me this because it’s what you believe in, or because you think it’s what I want to hear?” That only comes from experience.How do you hire?You have to have a gene for hospitality, and I want to see that you have the ability to be creative. It doesn’t matter what role you’re in, you have to be creative in how you look at the challenges you face. And I want people who know how to listen. You can learn a lot with your mouth shut.What advice do you give to new college grads?I will say to them, take a job, any job. You’re not necessarily going to get the first job right out of the box that you want. But what you will learn by taking a job immediately is how to deal with other people, how to process information, how to be part of a team, and it’s easier to get a job when you have a job. Try to work in the field you’re interested in, but sometimes you may have to take a job that is not your ideal position, but you will still benefit from it.I also learned something in my first month at Loews Hotels in 1980. My boss told me that whenever you’re writing a letter — and now it applies to emails today — never start a paragraph with the word “I,” because that immediately sends a message that you are more important than the person that you’re communicating with.It has stayed with me now for 35 years, and it’s a message that I always deliver. When you start to train your thinking about how to not use “I,” you become a better writer, and it teaches you how to really think through an issue. What are you really trying to say and how are you going to say it without starting the paragraph with the word “I”?

Jonathan M. Tisch


Jonathan M. Tisch is chairman and CEO of Loews Hotels & Co. and co-chairman of the Board and member of the Office of the President of Loews Corporation.
Under Tisch’s leadership, Loews Hotels has expanded and emerged as a leading hotel company with a widely praised culture that places value on partnerships that empower team members, exceed customers' expectations, contribute to communities, and improve the bottom line. Tisch was recently voted "Hotelier of the World" by HOTELS magazine.
Believing you can do well and good at the same time, Tisch is a champion of corporate responsibility and active citizenship. More than 25 years ago, he initiated the Loews Hotels Good Neighbor Policy, a recipient of the US President's Service Award. He is vice chairman of the Board of Trustees of his alma mater Tufts University, and also is the naming benefactor of the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts. Last year he was honored by the NYU School of Professional Studies with the naming of the Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism, of which he has been a driving force for years.
Recognized as a statesman for the multibillion-dollar travel and tourism industry, Tisch is a leader both nationally and locally. He is chairman emeritus of the United States Travel Association, and previously founded and served as chairman of the Travel Business Roundtable as well as chairman of the American Hotel & Lodging Association. For nearly six years he was chairman of NYC & Company, the City's official tourism agency, and was chairman of New York Rising, established to bring back visitors and revive the economy after 9/11.
A co-owner of the New York Giants, Tisch was instrumental in bringing the 2014 Super Bowl to the metropolitan area and served as co-chair of the NY/NJ Super Bowl Host Committee. Crain's New York Business named him one of the "Top Ten Most Influential Business Leaders" and inducted him into their Hall of Fame, which recognizes individuals who have transformed the City in both their professional work and in their civic and philanthropic activities.
Tisch is the author of three best-selling books: The Power of We: Succeeding Through Partnerships; Chocolates on the Pillow Aren't Enough: Reinventing the Customer Experience; and Citizen You: Doing Your Part to Change the World. He hosted the Emmy-nominated and Gracie Award-winning television series Beyond the Boardroom, where he spoke with some of America's most notable business luminaries.
This is Tisch's 23rd year as conference chair.



Executive Planning Committee


The University is grateful for the efforts of the Executive Planning Committee and for the financial contributions made by the conference patrons and sponsors. These contributions assure the quality, enhancement, and continuation of the conference, as well as support hospitality and tourism students at NYU.

Candlelight Wedding Joins 2 Billionaire Families


By GEORGIA DULLEA


Published: April 19, 1988









                    It was a power wedding. Laura S. Steinberg and Jonathan M. Tisch were married last night at the Central Synagogue in Manhattan in a candlelight ceremony joining two billionaire families that in one generation have carved a place in New York's world of high finance and society.        

                    Mrs. Tisch is the 25-year-old daughter of Barbara Steinberg and Saul P. Steinberg, chairman and chief executive of Reliance Group Holdings Inc. Mr. Tisch, 34, is president of Loews Hotels. His parents are Joan and Preston Robert Tisch, who is president and co-chief executive officer of the Loews Corporation and former Postmaster General of the United States.        

                    It was a Wall Street wedding, with names from the ''smart money crowd'' studding the guest list. Mr. Steinberg and Tisch family members are major stock market investors, notably the bridegroom's uncle, Laurence A. Tisch, who is chief executive of CBS. At the bridal couple's engagement party last year, a Tisch family member said, ''If they get married, it will have to be cleared by the S.E.C.''        

                    It was a stylish wedding, white-on-white, with all the women's dresses designed by Arnold Scaasi. The bride's aunt, Lynda Steinberg Jurist, was matron of honor and the bridegroom's brother, the movie producer Steven Tisch, was best man. White on White        

                    The bride wore an off-white taffeta dress, delicately embroidered in gold, with a seven-foot train. Her tulle veil was held in place by a diamond and pearl tiara that may have been something old, something new or something borrowed.        

                    Dressed in off-white moire shot with gold were her 10 attendants. The men were in white tie and tails while children from both families were done-up as flower girls and ring bearers.        

                    It was a wedding that blended tradition and contemporary mores. The bride's divorced parents were at her side during the ceremony, which was performed by Rabbi Stanley Davids, senior rabbi of the synagogue, under a chuppa fashioned of bronze palms from Mr. Steinberg's collection of antiquities.        

                    Barbara Walters, Helen Gurley Brown and others hiked their bouffant skirts as they climbed out of limousines and ran to the synagogue steps, where a canopy shielded them from the rain. Most of the limousines could not reach the entrance because the wedding party's burgundy Rolls-Royce was blocking it. 'Queen of Nouvelle Society'        

                    Spotlights illuminated the East 55th Street side of the synagogue, a landmark Moorish-style building. Guests said the effect inside was of sunlight on the stained glass windows. On the altar, banked with flowers and glowing candelabra, were antique pieces from the Steinberg home.        

                    ''We tried very much to respect the integrity of the synagogue by using period pieces,'' said the bride's stepmother, Gayfryd Steinberg. who was described recently in U.S. News & World Report as ''the queen of nouvelle society.''        

                    The families declined a request by Life magazine to document what was being called the wedding of the 80's. Interest was keen, however, as news photographers scrambled in the rain to catch the bridal couple before they sped off to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where a gala dinner was held.        

                    Passing through the receiving line in the museum's Great Hall were more than 500 guests, including Norman Mailer and Norris Church, Lord Weidenfeld, Beverly Sills, Carolyne Roehm and Henry Kravis, Donald and Ivana Trump, Georgette Mosbacher, Alex Papamarkou, Lewis Rudin, Laura and John Pomerantz, Vernon Jordan, Nancy and Frank Richardson, Hillary and David Mahoney. 'A Young People's Party'        

                    ''It was a fairy tale wedding,'' Blaine Trump was saying to her husband, Robert.        

                    ''You can really describe this as very much a family party and a young people's party,'' Gayfryd Steinberg said, levelly, in an interview before the party.        

                    Her presence had excited the gossip columnists. Caterers, florists and other worker were required to sign confidentiality agreements, which could have subjected them to lawsuits for leaking details.        

                    In designer beige were the bridegroom's mother, the bride's mother and stepmother. The bride's mother, owner of an antiques shop, Barbara Steinberg Unlimited, was escorted by Justin Hornik, whom she introduced as ''a man I've been seeing for some time.''        

                    As for her daughter and son-in-law, she said they began dating about three years ago. ''It just clicked. I hope they will always be as happy as they are today.''        

                    The bride, a graduate of the Dalton School and the University of Pennsylvania, has an M.B.A. degree from New York University. Until recently she worked as a story analyst for Warner Bros., Inc. in New York.        

                    The bridegroom, who graduated from the Gunnery and Tufts University, is a trustee of both institutions.        

                    After the reception, guests drifted past the Greek and Roman antiques to the museum restaurant, decorated in French Directoire, with swags, rosettes and tassels. On the tables were centerpieces of gilded magnolia leaves and spring branches.        

                    Between courses of poached salmon with champagne aspic, trio of veal, lamb and chicken, orzo with porcini, and spring vegetables, guests danced to Hank Lane's orchestra.        

                    The wines, from the Steinberg cellar, were Corton Charlemagne, Chateau Latour and Roederer Cristal Champagne.        

                    A spun sugar sprig of sweet peas decorated each dessert plate. Dessert was wedding cake.

Biography[edit]




Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival.


As CEO of Loews Hotels beginning in 1989, Tisch initiated the Loews Hotels Good Neighbor Policy over 20 years ago, one of the first of its kind in the hospitality industry. The Loews Good Neighbor Policy is a recipient of the U.S. President’s Service Award from the Points of Light Foundation.
Tisch serves as Chairman Emeritus the U.S. Travel Association, the national non-profit association representing all segments of the multibillion-dollar travel industry. For six years, he served as Chairman of NYC & Company, the city’s official tourism marketing agency and convention and visitors bureau.
Concurrent with his national efforts to help stimulate travel and tourism in the aftermath of September 11, Tisch served as Chairman of New York Rising, a task force set committed to reviving tourism in New York City. In recognition for his leadership and civic involvement, Crain's New York Business named Tisch one of the "Top Ten Most Influential Business Leaders" and was named "CEO of the Year" by the Executive Council of New York in 2006.
The Tisch family is one of America's wealthiest and most influential, with assets in the billions which they control through their holding company, Loews Corporation.
Books[edit]
Tisch is the author of three best-selling books that explore his leadership philosophy, the role of the customer experience, and civic engagement: The Power of We: Succeeding Through Partnerships, Chocolates on the Pillow Aren't Enough: Reinventing the Customer Experience, and Citizen You: Doing Your Part to Change the World.
Media[edit]
He is also the host of the Emmy-nominated Beyond the Boardroom with Jonathan Tisch television series, where he speaks with some of America's preeminent CEOs and business luminaries in one-one-one interviews. In 2008, Tisch co-founded Walnut Hill Media, LLC, a separate, privately held company investing in a variety of media opportunities. Through Walnut Hill Media, Tisch is a minority investor in Tribeca Enterprises. Tisch's role as Chairman of Loews Hotels remains unchanged.
Philanthropy and board affiliations[edit]
Tisch served as the Vice-Chairman of The Welfare to Work Partnership, and currently serves on the Board of Trustees for Tufts University. Tisch, who graduated from Tufts University in 1976, gave an endowed gift of $40 million to fund the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service which celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2011. Tisch is on the Board of the Tribeca Film Institute and is a co-owner of the New York Football Giants. He also serves on the Board of Directors of the New York Giants and is the team's Treasurer. In 2010, Tisch joined Jets owner Woody Johnson as co-chairs of the bid committee established to bring Super Bowl XLVIII to the Metropolitan area. The bid was summarized by the tagline “Make Some History.” In a decision by NFL team owners, the New York/New Jersey region was awarded the 2014 Super Bowl. The game was played at MetLife Stadium, the first open-air stadium in a cold-weather region to host a Super Bowl. Tisch is a co-chair of the Host Committee. In 2011, Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch made a $10 million gift to The Metropolitan Museum of Art to support the creation of an exhibition space within the Costume Institute to be named The Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Gallery.
Personal life[edit]
In 1988, he married Laura Steinberg, the daughter of financier and insurance executive Saul Steinberg, at the Central Synagogue in Manhattan.[3] They later divorced. In 2007, he married Lizzie Rudnick.[4]

In 2011, Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch made a $10 million gift to The Metropolitan Museum of Art to support the creation of an exhibition space within the Costume Institute to be named The Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Gallery.
Personal life[edit]
In 1988, he married Laura Steinberg, the daughter of financier and insurance executive Saul Steinberg, at the Central Synagogue in Manhattan.[3] They later divorced. In 2007, he married Lizzie Rudnick.[4]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
