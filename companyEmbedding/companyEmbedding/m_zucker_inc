Power Factor Correction Capacitors
Power Factor Correction Capacitors store and redistribute reactive power.  When a capacitor assembly is connected to an electrical system containing an inductive load will require less reactive power from the utility.  Low power factor caused by inductive loads results in increased line losses and possible surcharges or penalties billed by electric utility providers.

Myron Zucker, Inc. offers a wide range of power factor correction capacitors for various applications to ensure optimal power utilization.  Our products are specified in kilovolt-amperes reactive (kVAr) for three-phase voltages of 240, 480, and 600 VAC.  Our capacitor assemblies are also designed for other voltage or phase applications.


 



Harmonic Filters
Harmonics are multiples of a fundamental frequency.  for example, in a 60 Hz system, the 5th harmonic is 300 Hz.  The total amount of harmonics in a power system is referred to as Total Harmonic Distortion (THD).  Non-linear loads such as Adjustable Speed Drives, 6-pulse Converters, Uninterruptible Power Supplies, etc. are likely causes of damaging harmonics in your system.

When present in a power system, harmonics often result in higher voltages and currents.  This condition is known as poor power quality.  Harmonics contribute to problems such as blown fuses, overheating of equipment, misfiring of AC and DC drives, to name a few.

Myron Zucker, Inc. has developed both automatic and fixed harmonic filtering products that are designed to eliminate or reduce harmonics in your electrical system.
