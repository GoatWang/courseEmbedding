History[edit]
1983-2011: Background[edit]
Prologis was formed in 2011 through the merger of AMB and ProLogis, both multinational real estate companies based in the United States.[3]
AMB Property Corporation[edit]
In 1983, Hamid Moghadam and Doug Abbey used a $50,000 line of credit to found Abbey, Moghadam and Company,[13] an investment manager serving institutions.[4] Although they initially planned to provide investment advisory services, according to Forbes, they soon became known for instead "helping investors revive underperforming assets."[9] The company was joined by T. Robert Burke in 1984 and established AMB Property Corporation, a legacy Prologis company that invested in office, industrial and community shopping centers on behalf of large institutional investors.[13] During the collapse of the office building market in the late 1980s, the company avoided significant financial repercussions by investing in industrial parks and shopping centers beforehand,[9] and beginning to exit the office market in 1987.[13] AMB launched its first private equity fund in 1989, which focused on industrial and retail properties.[4]
In late 1997,[4] AMB closed its initial public offering (IPO) with more than US$2.8 billion under management.[13] Selling its retail business around 1999 to focus solely on the industrial sector, the company made its first overseas investment in 2002, developing a facility for Procter & Gamble.[4] That year AMB initiated an international expansion program[13] focused on buying and developing distribution facilities near global trade hubs, particularly in growth markets such as Brazil, Mexico, and China.[9] AMB added an internal development division in 2004. By 2011 AMB was focusing on expanding its operations in China and Brazil, at which point the company announced it was considering a merger with ProLogis, formerly Security Capital Trust.[4]
Security Capital Trust[edit]
Security Capital Investment Trust (SCI), a legacy company to Prologis, was incorporated in 1991. SCI made an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994.[13][4] The company first expanded outside the United States in 1996 with acquisitions in Mexico[13] and went international in 1997[4] with Security Capital Industrial Trust moving into both Mexico and Europe. SCI moved into the Netherlands in the summer of 1997, and afterwards expanded into Paris, Stockholm, Brussels, Warsaw, London, Berlin, Milan, and Madrid. SCI purchased 33 percent of the Oregon software company Insight Inc. in October 1997, to help solve supply-chain problems for clients. SCI also expanded into the refrigerated distribution business in 1997, purchasing Christian Salvesen and changing it into CS Integrated LLC. SCI furthermore acquired Texas Cold Storage and Continental Freezer in 1997, and secured the primary contract to distribute food for Kroger Co. in Illinois. For refrigeration abroad, SCI purchased Frigoscandia AB, then "Europe's largest distributor of refrigerated goods."[14] SCI later exited the cold-storage business.[15]
After Prologis, Inc. was incorporated on November 24, 1997,[7] SCI officially changed its name to ProLogis in July 1998, at which point it had already gone by StarLogis abroad. SCI was active in 84 markets in 12 countries by July 1998, with a market capitalization of nearly $5 billion.[14] In November 1998, Prologis Trust acquired Meridian Industrial Trust for $862.5 million in stock. At the time, Prologis was the "largest owner of industrial and warehouse properties in the United States."[16] ProLogis formed its first property funds in 1999, and entered the Japanese market in 2001. In 2003 ProLogis joined the S&P 500 and entered the Chinese market,[13] and in 2004 the company acquired Keystone Industrial Trust for $1.6 billion.[17] In the same year, ProLogis formed its first joint venture in China with Suzhou Logistics Center Co. Ltd.[13] With headquarters in Aurora, Colorado at the time, in 2005 ProLogis completed a merger with Catellus Development Corporation, a North American industrial development company, for $4.9 billion. That year, ProLogis ranked #1 in the 2005 Top 25 Industrial Owners survey.[18] In 2006, ProLogis became a Fortune 1000 company and the ProLogis European Properties Fund went public.[13]
In the midst of problems with debt[10] following aggressive expansion[3] and heavy borrowing,[4] ProLogis' CEO Jeffrey Schwartz was replaced with Walter Rakowich in 2008.[10] Rakovich afterwards implemented a cost-cutting effort involving raising capital and selling assets.[3] In December 2008 ProLogis sold a portfolio of assets to the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation,[3] and it sold its China operations and some of its Japanese interests to GIC Real Estate for $1.3 billion in 2009.[13] That August, ProLogis secured financing from Deutsche Pfandbriefbank and an unidentified German bank for two of its funds.[19] Blackstone Group LP bought a portfolio of ProLogis assets in late 2010 for $1 billion.[3] After acquiring Catellus Development Corp. in 2005 for $3.6 billion,[3] in January 2011 ProLogis sold a portfolio of Catellus retail and mixed-use assets to affiliates of TPG Capital for $505 million, including rights to the Catellus name.[20] Prior to its final merging with ProLogis in 2011, AMB Property Corp AMB.N formed a €470 million joint venture with Allianz Real Estate in March 2011.[21]
2011: Formation of Prologis[edit]
In January 2011, AMB Property Corporation agreed to buy the larger ProLogis for $8.7 billion,[21] with the new entity to be named Prologis (NYSE:PLD)[10][22] and remain on the New York Stock Exchange.[23] The companies announced that the new Prologis would be based in San Francisco, AMB's hometown, but would maintain operations headquarters in Denver, Colorado, where ProLogis was based.[3] Completed in June 2011,[4] the “merger of equals”[3][22] was described as "one of the biggest real-estate deals since the [2008] recession,"[3] and created the largest industrial real estate company in the world.[10][3] With total market value estimated at $24 billion,[22] the new Prologis had around $46 billion in assets under management[3] and logistics and distribution facilities[10][3] in North America, Europe, Asia and South America.[10] Clients of the new company included DHL, Kuehne & Nagel International AG, Home Depot Inc., Unilever,[3] and FedEx.[4] AMB CEO Hamid Moghadam and ProLogis CEO Walter Rakowich were appointed as the new company's co-chiefs, with Moghadam to become the sole CEO in 2013.[3]
2013-2014: International ventures[edit]
Prologis was among the largest 200 companies in the United States by June 2011, with a market cap of $15 billion,[10] activity in 22 countries and 22 funds. By the fourth quarter of 2011, Prologis had sold a variety of assets and raised $1 billion, with plans to raise a further $2 billion through asset sales. Occupancy at Prologis real estate at the end of 2011 was 92 percent. In 2012, the company announced it planned to spend around $1 billion to develop projects in the United States, Brazil, China and Japan. By March 2012, Prologis was "the sixth-largest U.S. REIT in terms of equity market capitalization, about $15 billion," and by May, Prologis had assets valued at around $10 billion in Europe.[4] On February 14, 2013,[23] Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. (NPR),[7] a Japanese real estate investment trust formed by Prologis, successfully completed an IPO on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.[24] In March 2013, Prologis formed the Prologis European Logistics Partners Sarl joint venture with Norges Bank Investment Management for USD$3.1 billion.[25] Prologis had $46.9 billion of assets under management as of September 2013. By November 2013, Prologis Inc. remained the world's biggest warehouse owner, with plans to spend "as much as $600 million a year to develop warehouses in Japan," its biggest market after the United States. At the time, Prologis had customers such as Amazon.com and Nippon Express.[23]
By the summer of 2014, Prologis was active in 21 countries, with around 1,400 real estate professionals.[11] The company also had around $51 billion in total assets under management,[11][26] with $27.3 billion of that amount in investment management.[11] Prologis completed its IPO for FIBRA Prologis in June 2014, the company’s Mexican affiliate also known as Prologis Property Mexico SA, raising about 7 billion pesos ($541 million).[27] At the end of 2014 Prologis owned 2,853 properties, with the bulk in North America and around 600 in Europe and Asia.[28]
2015-2016: Recent sales[edit]
Prologis had reduced its number of managed funds from 23 to 11 by the spring of 2015, and was managing "$29 billion in real-estate assets through joint ventures and a series of funds backed by institutional investors."[28] That financial quarter, earnings were boosted by the sale of a Silicon Valley industrial park to Facebook, Inc.[6] With corporate headquarters remaining in San Francisco, in April 2015 Prologis announced a plan to move its operational headquarters from east Denver, Colorado to a building in downtown Denver[29] in 2017.[30]
Also that month, Prologis partnered with Norges Bank Investment Management to buy KTR Capital Partners for $5.9 billion, expanding Prologis' real estate portfolio in the United States[28] through the Prologis U.S. Logistics Venture.[31] At the time, Prologis had a market value of around $22 billion.[28][31] In October 2015, Prologis acquired Morris Realty Associates' portfolio of logistics and retail properties in the United States for $820 million. Prologis sold the acquired retail assets to Blackstone Real Estate Advisors for $374 million.[32]
By late 2016, Prologis had built large multistory warehouses in Japan, Singapore and China.[33] The company began construction on a three-floor warehouse in Seattle, Washington in November 2016, which was the first multi-story warehouse in the country.[34] The following month, Prologis also outlined pans to build a three-story warehouse in San Francisco.[33] Prologis received two 2016 Eurobuild CEE Awards in December 2016,[35] at which point[34] Prologis Inc. remained the world's largest owner of warehouses[5] and distribution centers,[6] with a 97.1% occupancy rate.[36] As of May 30, 2017, Prologis Inc. was one of the world's largest industrial property owners.[37] As of March 31, 2017, Prologis had $67 billion in total assets under management, with 3,322 industrial properties in 19 countries. It also had 1,600 employees[2] and continued to be traded on the NYSE.[7]

History[edit]
1983-2011: Background[edit]
Prologis was formed in 2011 through the merger of AMB and ProLogis, both multinational real estate companies based in the United States.[3]
AMB Property Corporation[edit]
In 1983, Hamid Moghadam and Doug Abbey used a $50,000 line of credit to found Abbey, Moghadam and Company,[13] an investment manager serving institutions.[4] Although they initially planned to provide investment advisory services, according to Forbes, they soon became known for instead "helping investors revive underperforming assets."[9] The company was joined by T. Robert Burke in 1984 and established AMB Property Corporation, a legacy Prologis company that invested in office, industrial and community shopping centers on behalf of large institutional investors.[13] During the collapse of the office building market in the late 1980s, the company avoided significant financial repercussions by investing in industrial parks and shopping centers beforehand,[9] and beginning to exit the office market in 1987.[13] AMB launched its first private equity fund in 1989, which focused on industrial and retail properties.[4]
In late 1997,[4] AMB closed its initial public offering (IPO) with more than US$2.8 billion under management.[13] Selling its retail business around 1999 to focus solely on the industrial sector, the company made its first overseas investment in 2002, developing a facility for Procter & Gamble.[4] That year AMB initiated an international expansion program[13] focused on buying and developing distribution facilities near global trade hubs, particularly in growth markets such as Brazil, Mexico, and China.[9] AMB added an internal development division in 2004. By 2011 AMB was focusing on expanding its operations in China and Brazil, at which point the company announced it was considering a merger with ProLogis, formerly Security Capital Trust.[4]
Security Capital Trust[edit]
Security Capital Investment Trust (SCI), a legacy company to Prologis, was incorporated in 1991. SCI made an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994.[13][4] The company first expanded outside the United States in 1996 with acquisitions in Mexico[13] and went international in 1997[4] with Security Capital Industrial Trust moving into both Mexico and Europe. SCI moved into the Netherlands in the summer of 1997, and afterwards expanded into Paris, Stockholm, Brussels, Warsaw, London, Berlin, Milan, and Madrid. SCI purchased 33 percent of the Oregon software company Insight Inc. in October 1997, to help solve supply-chain problems for clients. SCI also expanded into the refrigerated distribution business in 1997, purchasing Christian Salvesen and changing it into CS Integrated LLC. SCI furthermore acquired Texas Cold Storage and Continental Freezer in 1997, and secured the primary contract to distribute food for Kroger Co. in Illinois. For refrigeration abroad, SCI purchased Frigoscandia AB, then "Europe's largest distributor of refrigerated goods."[14] SCI later exited the cold-storage business.[15]
After Prologis, Inc. was incorporated on November 24, 1997,[7] SCI officially changed its name to ProLogis in July 1998, at which point it had already gone by StarLogis abroad. SCI was active in 84 markets in 12 countries by July 1998, with a market capitalization of nearly $5 billion.[14] In November 1998, Prologis Trust acquired Meridian Industrial Trust for $862.5 million in stock. At the time, Prologis was the "largest owner of industrial and warehouse properties in the United States."[16] ProLogis formed its first property funds in 1999, and entered the Japanese market in 2001. In 2003 ProLogis joined the S&P 500 and entered the Chinese market,[13] and in 2004 the company acquired Keystone Industrial Trust for $1.6 billion.[17] In the same year, ProLogis formed its first joint venture in China with Suzhou Logistics Center Co. Ltd.[13] With headquarters in Aurora, Colorado at the time, in 2005 ProLogis completed a merger with Catellus Development Corporation, a North American industrial development company, for $4.9 billion. That year, ProLogis ranked #1 in the 2005 Top 25 Industrial Owners survey.[18] In 2006, ProLogis became a Fortune 1000 company and the ProLogis European Properties Fund went public.[13]
In the midst of problems with debt[10] following aggressive expansion[3] and heavy borrowing,[4] ProLogis' CEO Jeffrey Schwartz was replaced with Walter Rakowich in 2008.[10] Rakovich afterwards implemented a cost-cutting effort involving raising capital and selling assets.[3] In December 2008 ProLogis sold a portfolio of assets to the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation,[3] and it sold its China operations and some of its Japanese interests to GIC Real Estate for $1.3 billion in 2009.[13] That August, ProLogis secured financing from Deutsche Pfandbriefbank and an unidentified German bank for two of its funds.[19] Blackstone Group LP bought a portfolio of ProLogis assets in late 2010 for $1 billion.[3] After acquiring Catellus Development Corp. in 2005 for $3.6 billion,[3] in January 2011 ProLogis sold a portfolio of Catellus retail and mixed-use assets to affiliates of TPG Capital for $505 million, including rights to the Catellus name.[20] Prior to its final merging with ProLogis in 2011, AMB Property Corp AMB.N formed a €470 million joint venture with Allianz Real Estate in March 2011.[21]
2011: Formation of Prologis[edit]
In January 2011, AMB Property Corporation agreed to buy the larger ProLogis for $8.7 billion,[21] with the new entity to be named Prologis (NYSE:PLD)[10][22] and remain on the New York Stock Exchange.[23] The companies announced that the new Prologis would be based in San Francisco, AMB's hometown, but would maintain operations headquarters in Denver, Colorado, where ProLogis was based.[3] Completed in June 2011,[4] the “merger of equals”[3][22] was described as "one of the biggest real-estate deals since the [2008] recession,"[3] and created the largest industrial real estate company in the world.[10][3] With total market value estimated at $24 billion,[22] the new Prologis had around $46 billion in assets under management[3] and logistics and distribution facilities[10][3] in North America, Europe, Asia and South America.[10] Clients of the new company included DHL, Kuehne & Nagel International AG, Home Depot Inc., Unilever,[3] and FedEx.[4] AMB CEO Hamid Moghadam and ProLogis CEO Walter Rakowich were appointed as the new company's co-chiefs, with Moghadam to become the sole CEO in 2013.[3]
2013-2014: International ventures[edit]
Prologis was among the largest 200 companies in the United States by June 2011, with a market cap of $15 billion,[10] activity in 22 countries and 22 funds. By the fourth quarter of 2011, Prologis had sold a variety of assets and raised $1 billion, with plans to raise a further $2 billion through asset sales. Occupancy at Prologis real estate at the end of 2011 was 92 percent. In 2012, the company announced it planned to spend around $1 billion to develop projects in the United States, Brazil, China and Japan. By March 2012, Prologis was "the sixth-largest U.S. REIT in terms of equity market capitalization, about $15 billion," and by May, Prologis had assets valued at around $10 billion in Europe.[4] On February 14, 2013,[23] Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. (NPR),[7] a Japanese real estate investment trust formed by Prologis, successfully completed an IPO on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.[24] In March 2013, Prologis formed the Prologis European Logistics Partners Sarl joint venture with Norges Bank Investment Management for USD$3.1 billion.[25] Prologis had $46.9 billion of assets under management as of September 2013. By November 2013, Prologis Inc. remained the world's biggest warehouse owner, with plans to spend "as much as $600 million a year to develop warehouses in Japan," its biggest market after the United States. At the time, Prologis had customers such as Amazon.com and Nippon Express.[23]
By the summer of 2014, Prologis was active in 21 countries, with around 1,400 real estate professionals.[11] The company also had around $51 billion in total assets under management,[11][26] with $27.3 billion of that amount in investment management.[11] Prologis completed its IPO for FIBRA Prologis in June 2014, the company’s Mexican affiliate also known as Prologis Property Mexico SA, raising about 7 billion pesos ($541 million).[27] At the end of 2014 Prologis owned 2,853 properties, with the bulk in North America and around 600 in Europe and Asia.[28]
2015-2016: Recent sales[edit]
Prologis had reduced its number of managed funds from 23 to 11 by the spring of 2015, and was managing "$29 billion in real-estate assets through joint ventures and a series of funds backed by institutional investors."[28] That financial quarter, earnings were boosted by the sale of a Silicon Valley industrial park to Facebook, Inc.[6] With corporate headquarters remaining in San Francisco, in April 2015 Prologis announced a plan to move its operational headquarters from east Denver, Colorado to a building in downtown Denver[29] in 2017.[30]
Also that month, Prologis partnered with Norges Bank Investment Management to buy KTR Capital Partners for $5.9 billion, expanding Prologis' real estate portfolio in the United States[28] through the Prologis U.S. Logistics Venture.[31] At the time, Prologis had a market value of around $22 billion.[28][31] In October 2015, Prologis acquired Morris Realty Associates' portfolio of logistics and retail properties in the United States for $820 million. Prologis sold the acquired retail assets to Blackstone Real Estate Advisors for $374 million.[32]
By late 2016, Prologis had built large multistory warehouses in Japan, Singapore and China.[33] The company began construction on a three-floor warehouse in Seattle, Washington in November 2016, which was the first multi-story warehouse in the country.[34] The following month, Prologis also outlined pans to build a three-story warehouse in San Francisco.[33] Prologis received two 2016 Eurobuild CEE Awards in December 2016,[35] at which point[34] Prologis Inc. remained the world's largest owner of warehouses[5] and distribution centers,[6] with a 97.1% occupancy rate.[36] As of May 30, 2017, Prologis Inc. was one of the world's largest industrial property owners.[37] As of March 31, 2017, Prologis had $67 billion in total assets under management, with 3,322 industrial properties in 19 countries. It also had 1,600 employees[2] and continued to be traded on the NYSE.[7]

History[edit]
1983-2011: Background[edit]
Prologis was formed in 2011 through the merger of AMB and ProLogis, both multinational real estate companies based in the United States.[3]
AMB Property Corporation[edit]
In 1983, Hamid Moghadam and Doug Abbey used a $50,000 line of credit to found Abbey, Moghadam and Company,[13] an investment manager serving institutions.[4] Although they initially planned to provide investment advisory services, according to Forbes, they soon became known for instead "helping investors revive underperforming assets."[9] The company was joined by T. Robert Burke in 1984 and established AMB Property Corporation, a legacy Prologis company that invested in office, industrial and community shopping centers on behalf of large institutional investors.[13] During the collapse of the office building market in the late 1980s, the company avoided significant financial repercussions by investing in industrial parks and shopping centers beforehand,[9] and beginning to exit the office market in 1987.[13] AMB launched its first private equity fund in 1989, which focused on industrial and retail properties.[4]
In late 1997,[4] AMB closed its initial public offering (IPO) with more than US$2.8 billion under management.[13] Selling its retail business around 1999 to focus solely on the industrial sector, the company made its first overseas investment in 2002, developing a facility for Procter & Gamble.[4] That year AMB initiated an international expansion program[13] focused on buying and developing distribution facilities near global trade hubs, particularly in growth markets such as Brazil, Mexico, and China.[9] AMB added an internal development division in 2004. By 2011 AMB was focusing on expanding its operations in China and Brazil, at which point the company announced it was considering a merger with ProLogis, formerly Security Capital Trust.[4]
Security Capital Trust[edit]
Security Capital Investment Trust (SCI), a legacy company to Prologis, was incorporated in 1991. SCI made an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994.[13][4] The company first expanded outside the United States in 1996 with acquisitions in Mexico[13] and went international in 1997[4] with Security Capital Industrial Trust moving into both Mexico and Europe. SCI moved into the Netherlands in the summer of 1997, and afterwards expanded into Paris, Stockholm, Brussels, Warsaw, London, Berlin, Milan, and Madrid. SCI purchased 33 percent of the Oregon software company Insight Inc. in October 1997, to help solve supply-chain problems for clients. SCI also expanded into the refrigerated distribution business in 1997, purchasing Christian Salvesen and changing it into CS Integrated LLC. SCI furthermore acquired Texas Cold Storage and Continental Freezer in 1997, and secured the primary contract to distribute food for Kroger Co. in Illinois. For refrigeration abroad, SCI purchased Frigoscandia AB, then "Europe's largest distributor of refrigerated goods."[14] SCI later exited the cold-storage business.[15]
After Prologis, Inc. was incorporated on November 24, 1997,[7] SCI officially changed its name to ProLogis in July 1998, at which point it had already gone by StarLogis abroad. SCI was active in 84 markets in 12 countries by July 1998, with a market capitalization of nearly $5 billion.[14] In November 1998, Prologis Trust acquired Meridian Industrial Trust for $862.5 million in stock. At the time, Prologis was the "largest owner of industrial and warehouse properties in the United States."[16] ProLogis formed its first property funds in 1999, and entered the Japanese market in 2001. In 2003 ProLogis joined the S&P 500 and entered the Chinese market,[13] and in 2004 the company acquired Keystone Industrial Trust for $1.6 billion.[17] In the same year, ProLogis formed its first joint venture in China with Suzhou Logistics Center Co. Ltd.[13] With headquarters in Aurora, Colorado at the time, in 2005 ProLogis completed a merger with Catellus Development Corporation, a North American industrial development company, for $4.9 billion. That year, ProLogis ranked #1 in the 2005 Top 25 Industrial Owners survey.[18] In 2006, ProLogis became a Fortune 1000 company and the ProLogis European Properties Fund went public.[13]
In the midst of problems with debt[10] following aggressive expansion[3] and heavy borrowing,[4] ProLogis' CEO Jeffrey Schwartz was replaced with Walter Rakowich in 2008.[10] Rakovich afterwards implemented a cost-cutting effort involving raising capital and selling assets.[3] In December 2008 ProLogis sold a portfolio of assets to the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation,[3] and it sold its China operations and some of its Japanese interests to GIC Real Estate for $1.3 billion in 2009.[13] That August, ProLogis secured financing from Deutsche Pfandbriefbank and an unidentified German bank for two of its funds.[19] Blackstone Group LP bought a portfolio of ProLogis assets in late 2010 for $1 billion.[3] After acquiring Catellus Development Corp. in 2005 for $3.6 billion,[3] in January 2011 ProLogis sold a portfolio of Catellus retail and mixed-use assets to affiliates of TPG Capital for $505 million, including rights to the Catellus name.[20] Prior to its final merging with ProLogis in 2011, AMB Property Corp AMB.N formed a €470 million joint venture with Allianz Real Estate in March 2011.[21]
2011: Formation of Prologis[edit]
In January 2011, AMB Property Corporation agreed to buy the larger ProLogis for $8.7 billion,[21] with the new entity to be named Prologis (NYSE:PLD)[10][22] and remain on the New York Stock Exchange.[23] The companies announced that the new Prologis would be based in San Francisco, AMB's hometown, but would maintain operations headquarters in Denver, Colorado, where ProLogis was based.[3] Completed in June 2011,[4] the “merger of equals”[3][22] was described as "one of the biggest real-estate deals since the [2008] recession,"[3] and created the largest industrial real estate company in the world.[10][3] With total market value estimated at $24 billion,[22] the new Prologis had around $46 billion in assets under management[3] and logistics and distribution facilities[10][3] in North America, Europe, Asia and South America.[10] Clients of the new company included DHL, Kuehne & Nagel International AG, Home Depot Inc., Unilever,[3] and FedEx.[4] AMB CEO Hamid Moghadam and ProLogis CEO Walter Rakowich were appointed as the new company's co-chiefs, with Moghadam to become the sole CEO in 2013.[3]
2013-2014: International ventures[edit]
Prologis was among the largest 200 companies in the United States by June 2011, with a market cap of $15 billion,[10] activity in 22 countries and 22 funds. By the fourth quarter of 2011, Prologis had sold a variety of assets and raised $1 billion, with plans to raise a further $2 billion through asset sales. Occupancy at Prologis real estate at the end of 2011 was 92 percent. In 2012, the company announced it planned to spend around $1 billion to develop projects in the United States, Brazil, China and Japan. By March 2012, Prologis was "the sixth-largest U.S. REIT in terms of equity market capitalization, about $15 billion," and by May, Prologis had assets valued at around $10 billion in Europe.[4] On February 14, 2013,[23] Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. (NPR),[7] a Japanese real estate investment trust formed by Prologis, successfully completed an IPO on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.[24] In March 2013, Prologis formed the Prologis European Logistics Partners Sarl joint venture with Norges Bank Investment Management for USD$3.1 billion.[25] Prologis had $46.9 billion of assets under management as of September 2013. By November 2013, Prologis Inc. remained the world's biggest warehouse owner, with plans to spend "as much as $600 million a year to develop warehouses in Japan," its biggest market after the United States. At the time, Prologis had customers such as Amazon.com and Nippon Express.[23]
By the summer of 2014, Prologis was active in 21 countries, with around 1,400 real estate professionals.[11] The company also had around $51 billion in total assets under management,[11][26] with $27.3 billion of that amount in investment management.[11] Prologis completed its IPO for FIBRA Prologis in June 2014, the company’s Mexican affiliate also known as Prologis Property Mexico SA, raising about 7 billion pesos ($541 million).[27] At the end of 2014 Prologis owned 2,853 properties, with the bulk in North America and around 600 in Europe and Asia.[28]
2015-2016: Recent sales[edit]
Prologis had reduced its number of managed funds from 23 to 11 by the spring of 2015, and was managing "$29 billion in real-estate assets through joint ventures and a series of funds backed by institutional investors."[28] That financial quarter, earnings were boosted by the sale of a Silicon Valley industrial park to Facebook, Inc.[6] With corporate headquarters remaining in San Francisco, in April 2015 Prologis announced a plan to move its operational headquarters from east Denver, Colorado to a building in downtown Denver[29] in 2017.[30]
Also that month, Prologis partnered with Norges Bank Investment Management to buy KTR Capital Partners for $5.9 billion, expanding Prologis' real estate portfolio in the United States[28] through the Prologis U.S. Logistics Venture.[31] At the time, Prologis had a market value of around $22 billion.[28][31] In October 2015, Prologis acquired Morris Realty Associates' portfolio of logistics and retail properties in the United States for $820 million. Prologis sold the acquired retail assets to Blackstone Real Estate Advisors for $374 million.[32]
By late 2016, Prologis had built large multistory warehouses in Japan, Singapore and China.[33] The company began construction on a three-floor warehouse in Seattle, Washington in November 2016, which was the first multi-story warehouse in the country.[34] The following month, Prologis also outlined pans to build a three-story warehouse in San Francisco.[33] Prologis received two 2016 Eurobuild CEE Awards in December 2016,[35] at which point[34] Prologis Inc. remained the world's largest owner of warehouses[5] and distribution centers,[6] with a 97.1% occupancy rate.[36] As of May 30, 2017, Prologis Inc. was one of the world's largest industrial property owners.[37] As of March 31, 2017, Prologis had $67 billion in total assets under management, with 3,322 industrial properties in 19 countries. It also had 1,600 employees[2] and continued to be traded on the NYSE.[7]
Business model[edit]
A publicly traded company[7] and member of the S&P 500,[8] Prologis operates in the Americas, Europe, and Asia with a portfolio of real-estate ownings or joint-ventures[7] in 19 countries.[2] Operating segments distinguish real estate operations from strategic capital, with distribution facilities leased to customers[7] in both the business-to-business and retail/online fulfillment categories.[38]
Prologis focuses on three key lines of business:

Real estate operations (leasing, managing buildings)[11][39]
Capital deployment (development and acquisitions of properties)[40]
Strategic capital (raising capital and co-investing in portfolios)[26][39]

Market research[edit]
Through its research department, the company publishes proprietary market research and several white papers each year. These include the Industrial Business Indicator, published on a quarterly basis, and the Prologis Logistics Rent Index, published annually[12] since 2016.[41]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Concerning corporate responsibility, Prologis espouses a focus on environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and ethics and governance,[42] with programs supporting these goals detailed in periodic reports.[43] The company was named among the “Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World” for six consecutive years, starting in 2008.[11] The company first began testing the use of rooftop solar panels[44] on its buildings in Germany and France, and by 2016, Prologis was second after Walmart for amount of installed rooftop solar capacity in the United States.[45]

History[edit]
1983-2011: Background[edit]
Prologis was formed in 2011 through the merger of AMB and ProLogis, both multinational real estate companies based in the United States.[3]
AMB Property Corporation[edit]
In 1983, Hamid Moghadam and Doug Abbey used a $50,000 line of credit to found Abbey, Moghadam and Company,[13] an investment manager serving institutions.[4] Although they initially planned to provide investment advisory services, according to Forbes, they soon became known for instead "helping investors revive underperforming assets."[9] The company was joined by T. Robert Burke in 1984 and established AMB Property Corporation, a legacy Prologis company that invested in office, industrial and community shopping centers on behalf of large institutional investors.[13] During the collapse of the office building market in the late 1980s, the company avoided significant financial repercussions by investing in industrial parks and shopping centers beforehand,[9] and beginning to exit the office market in 1987.[13] AMB launched its first private equity fund in 1989, which focused on industrial and retail properties.[4]
In late 1997,[4] AMB closed its initial public offering (IPO) with more than US$2.8 billion under management.[13] Selling its retail business around 1999 to focus solely on the industrial sector, the company made its first overseas investment in 2002, developing a facility for Procter & Gamble.[4] That year AMB initiated an international expansion program[13] focused on buying and developing distribution facilities near global trade hubs, particularly in growth markets such as Brazil, Mexico, and China.[9] AMB added an internal development division in 2004. By 2011 AMB was focusing on expanding its operations in China and Brazil, at which point the company announced it was considering a merger with ProLogis, formerly Security Capital Trust.[4]
Security Capital Trust[edit]
Security Capital Investment Trust (SCI), a legacy company to Prologis, was incorporated in 1991. SCI made an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994.[13][4] The company first expanded outside the United States in 1996 with acquisitions in Mexico[13] and went international in 1997[4] with Security Capital Industrial Trust moving into both Mexico and Europe. SCI moved into the Netherlands in the summer of 1997, and afterwards expanded into Paris, Stockholm, Brussels, Warsaw, London, Berlin, Milan, and Madrid. SCI purchased 33 percent of the Oregon software company Insight Inc. in October 1997, to help solve supply-chain problems for clients. SCI also expanded into the refrigerated distribution business in 1997, purchasing Christian Salvesen and changing it into CS Integrated LLC. SCI furthermore acquired Texas Cold Storage and Continental Freezer in 1997, and secured the primary contract to distribute food for Kroger Co. in Illinois. For refrigeration abroad, SCI purchased Frigoscandia AB, then "Europe's largest distributor of refrigerated goods."[14] SCI later exited the cold-storage business.[15]
After Prologis, Inc. was incorporated on November 24, 1997,[7] SCI officially changed its name to ProLogis in July 1998, at which point it had already gone by StarLogis abroad. SCI was active in 84 markets in 12 countries by July 1998, with a market capitalization of nearly $5 billion.[14] In November 1998, Prologis Trust acquired Meridian Industrial Trust for $862.5 million in stock. At the time, Prologis was the "largest owner of industrial and warehouse properties in the United States."[16] ProLogis formed its first property funds in 1999, and entered the Japanese market in 2001. In 2003 ProLogis joined the S&P 500 and entered the Chinese market,[13] and in 2004 the company acquired Keystone Industrial Trust for $1.6 billion.[17] In the same year, ProLogis formed its first joint venture in China with Suzhou Logistics Center Co. Ltd.[13] With headquarters in Aurora, Colorado at the time, in 2005 ProLogis completed a merger with Catellus Development Corporation, a North American industrial development company, for $4.9 billion. That year, ProLogis ranked #1 in the 2005 Top 25 Industrial Owners survey.[18] In 2006, ProLogis became a Fortune 1000 company and the ProLogis European Properties Fund went public.[13]
In the midst of problems with debt[10] following aggressive expansion[3] and heavy borrowing,[4] ProLogis' CEO Jeffrey Schwartz was replaced with Walter Rakowich in 2008.[10] Rakovich afterwards implemented a cost-cutting effort involving raising capital and selling assets.[3] In December 2008 ProLogis sold a portfolio of assets to the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation,[3] and it sold its China operations and some of its Japanese interests to GIC Real Estate for $1.3 billion in 2009.[13] That August, ProLogis secured financing from Deutsche Pfandbriefbank and an unidentified German bank for two of its funds.[19] Blackstone Group LP bought a portfolio of ProLogis assets in late 2010 for $1 billion.[3] After acquiring Catellus Development Corp. in 2005 for $3.6 billion,[3] in January 2011 ProLogis sold a portfolio of Catellus retail and mixed-use assets to affiliates of TPG Capital for $505 million, including rights to the Catellus name.[20] Prior to its final merging with ProLogis in 2011, AMB Property Corp AMB.N formed a €470 million joint venture with Allianz Real Estate in March 2011.[21]
2011: Formation of Prologis[edit]
In January 2011, AMB Property Corporation agreed to buy the larger ProLogis for $8.7 billion,[21] with the new entity to be named Prologis (NYSE:PLD)[10][22] and remain on the New York Stock Exchange.[23] The companies announced that the new Prologis would be based in San Francisco, AMB's hometown, but would maintain operations headquarters in Denver, Colorado, where ProLogis was based.[3] Completed in June 2011,[4] the “merger of equals”[3][22] was described as "one of the biggest real-estate deals since the [2008] recession,"[3] and created the largest industrial real estate company in the world.[10][3] With total market value estimated at $24 billion,[22] the new Prologis had around $46 billion in assets under management[3] and logistics and distribution facilities[10][3] in North America, Europe, Asia and South America.[10] Clients of the new company included DHL, Kuehne & Nagel International AG, Home Depot Inc., Unilever,[3] and FedEx.[4] AMB CEO Hamid Moghadam and ProLogis CEO Walter Rakowich were appointed as the new company's co-chiefs, with Moghadam to become the sole CEO in 2013.[3]
2013-2014: International ventures[edit]
Prologis was among the largest 200 companies in the United States by June 2011, with a market cap of $15 billion,[10] activity in 22 countries and 22 funds. By the fourth quarter of 2011, Prologis had sold a variety of assets and raised $1 billion, with plans to raise a further $2 billion through asset sales. Occupancy at Prologis real estate at the end of 2011 was 92 percent. In 2012, the company announced it planned to spend around $1 billion to develop projects in the United States, Brazil, China and Japan. By March 2012, Prologis was "the sixth-largest U.S. REIT in terms of equity market capitalization, about $15 billion," and by May, Prologis had assets valued at around $10 billion in Europe.[4] On February 14, 2013,[23] Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. (NPR),[7] a Japanese real estate investment trust formed by Prologis, successfully completed an IPO on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.[24] In March 2013, Prologis formed the Prologis European Logistics Partners Sarl joint venture with Norges Bank Investment Management for USD$3.1 billion.[25] Prologis had $46.9 billion of assets under management as of September 2013. By November 2013, Prologis Inc. remained the world's biggest warehouse owner, with plans to spend "as much as $600 million a year to develop warehouses in Japan," its biggest market after the United States. At the time, Prologis had customers such as Amazon.com and Nippon Express.[23]
By the summer of 2014, Prologis was active in 21 countries, with around 1,400 real estate professionals.[11] The company also had around $51 billion in total assets under management,[11][26] with $27.3 billion of that amount in investment management.[11] Prologis completed its IPO for FIBRA Prologis in June 2014, the company’s Mexican affiliate also known as Prologis Property Mexico SA, raising about 7 billion pesos ($541 million).[27] At the end of 2014 Prologis owned 2,853 properties, with the bulk in North America and around 600 in Europe and Asia.[28]
2015-2016: Recent sales[edit]
Prologis had reduced its number of managed funds from 23 to 11 by the spring of 2015, and was managing "$29 billion in real-estate assets through joint ventures and a series of funds backed by institutional investors."[28] That financial quarter, earnings were boosted by the sale of a Silicon Valley industrial park to Facebook, Inc.[6] With corporate headquarters remaining in San Francisco, in April 2015 Prologis announced a plan to move its operational headquarters from east Denver, Colorado to a building in downtown Denver[29] in 2017.[30]
Also that month, Prologis partnered with Norges Bank Investment Management to buy KTR Capital Partners for $5.9 billion, expanding Prologis' real estate portfolio in the United States[28] through the Prologis U.S. Logistics Venture.[31] At the time, Prologis had a market value of around $22 billion.[28][31] In October 2015, Prologis acquired Morris Realty Associates' portfolio of logistics and retail properties in the United States for $820 million. Prologis sold the acquired retail assets to Blackstone Real Estate Advisors for $374 million.[32]
By late 2016, Prologis had built large multistory warehouses in Japan, Singapore and China.[33] The company began construction on a three-floor warehouse in Seattle, Washington in November 2016, which was the first multi-story warehouse in the country.[34] The following month, Prologis also outlined pans to build a three-story warehouse in San Francisco.[33] Prologis received two 2016 Eurobuild CEE Awards in December 2016,[35] at which point[34] Prologis Inc. remained the world's largest owner of warehouses[5] and distribution centers,[6] with a 97.1% occupancy rate.[36] As of May 30, 2017, Prologis Inc. was one of the world's largest industrial property owners.[37] As of March 31, 2017, Prologis had $67 billion in total assets under management, with 3,322 industrial properties in 19 countries. It also had 1,600 employees[2] and continued to be traded on the NYSE.[7]
Business model[edit]
A publicly traded company[7] and member of the S&P 500,[8] Prologis operates in the Americas, Europe, and Asia with a portfolio of real-estate ownings or joint-ventures[7] in 19 countries.[2] Operating segments distinguish real estate operations from strategic capital, with distribution facilities leased to customers[7] in both the business-to-business and retail/online fulfillment categories.[38]
Prologis focuses on three key lines of business:

Real estate operations (leasing, managing buildings)[11][39]
Capital deployment (development and acquisitions of properties)[40]
Strategic capital (raising capital and co-investing in portfolios)[26][39]

Market research[edit]
Through its research department, the company publishes proprietary market research and several white papers each year. These include the Industrial Business Indicator, published on a quarterly basis, and the Prologis Logistics Rent Index, published annually[12] since 2016.[41]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Concerning corporate responsibility, Prologis espouses a focus on environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and ethics and governance,[42] with programs supporting these goals detailed in periodic reports.[43] The company was named among the “Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World” for six consecutive years, starting in 2008.[11] The company first began testing the use of rooftop solar panels[44] on its buildings in Germany and France, and by 2016, Prologis was second after Walmart for amount of installed rooftop solar capacity in the United States.[45]

History[edit]
1983-2011: Background[edit]
Prologis was formed in 2011 through the merger of AMB and ProLogis, both multinational real estate companies based in the United States.[3]
AMB Property Corporation[edit]
In 1983, Hamid Moghadam and Doug Abbey used a $50,000 line of credit to found Abbey, Moghadam and Company,[13] an investment manager serving institutions.[4] Although they initially planned to provide investment advisory services, according to Forbes, they soon became known for instead "helping investors revive underperforming assets."[9] The company was joined by T.

By 2011 AMB was focusing on expanding its operations in China and Brazil, at which point the company announced it was considering a merger with ProLogis, formerly Security Capital Trust.[4]
Security Capital Trust[edit]
Security Capital Investment Trust (SCI), a legacy company to Prologis, was incorporated in 1991. SCI made an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994.[13][4] The company first expanded outside the United States in 1996 with acquisitions in Mexico[13] and went international in 1997[4] with Security Capital Industrial Trust moving into both Mexico and Europe. SCI moved into the Netherlands in the summer of 1997, and afterwards expanded into Paris, Stockholm, Brussels, Warsaw, London, Berlin, Milan, and Madrid. SCI purchased 33 percent of the Oregon software company Insight Inc. in October 1997, to help solve supply-chain problems for clients. SCI also expanded into the refrigerated distribution business in 1997, purchasing Christian Salvesen and changing it into CS Integrated LLC. SCI furthermore acquired Texas Cold Storage and Continental Freezer in 1997, and secured the primary contract to distribute food for Kroger Co. in Illinois. For refrigeration abroad, SCI purchased Frigoscandia AB, then "Europe's largest distributor of refrigerated goods."[14] SCI later exited the cold-storage business.[15]
After Prologis, Inc. was incorporated on November 24, 1997,[7] SCI officially changed its name to ProLogis in July 1998, at which point it had already gone by StarLogis abroad. SCI was active in 84 markets in 12 countries by July 1998, with a market capitalization of nearly $5 billion.[14] In November 1998, Prologis Trust acquired Meridian Industrial Trust for $862.5 million in stock. At the time, Prologis was the "largest owner of industrial and warehouse properties in the United States."[16] ProLogis formed its first property funds in 1999, and entered the Japanese market in 2001. In 2003 ProLogis joined the S&P 500 and entered the Chinese market,[13] and in 2004 the company acquired Keystone Industrial Trust for $1.6 billion.[17] In the same year, ProLogis formed its first joint venture in China with Suzhou Logistics Center Co. Ltd.[13] With headquarters in Aurora, Colorado at the time, in 2005 ProLogis completed a merger with Catellus Development Corporation, a North American industrial development company, for $4.9 billion. That year, ProLogis ranked #1 in the 2005 Top 25 Industrial Owners survey.[18] In 2006, ProLogis became a Fortune 1000 company and the ProLogis European Properties Fund went public.[13]
In the midst of problems with debt[10] following aggressive expansion[3] and heavy borrowing,[4] ProLogis' CEO Jeffrey Schwartz was replaced with Walter Rakowich in 2008.[10] Rakovich afterwards implemented a cost-cutting effort involving raising capital and selling assets.[3] In December 2008 ProLogis sold a portfolio of assets to the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation,[3] and it sold its China operations and some of its Japanese interests to GIC Real Estate for $1.3 billion in 2009.[13] That August, ProLogis secured financing from Deutsche Pfandbriefbank and an unidentified German bank for two of its funds.[19] Blackstone Group LP bought a portfolio of ProLogis assets in late 2010 for $1 billion.[3] After acquiring Catellus Development Corp. in 2005 for $3.6 billion,[3] in January 2011 ProLogis sold a portfolio of Catellus retail and mixed-use assets to affiliates of TPG Capital for $505 million, including rights to the Catellus name.[20] Prior to its final merging with ProLogis in 2011, AMB Property Corp AMB.N formed a €470 million joint venture with Allianz Real Estate in March 2011.[21]
2011: Formation of Prologis[edit]
In January 2011, AMB Property Corporation agreed to buy the larger ProLogis for $8.7 billion,[21] with the new entity to be named Prologis (NYSE:PLD)[10][22] and remain on the New York Stock Exchange.[23] The companies announced that the new Prologis would be based in San Francisco, AMB's hometown, but would maintain operations headquarters in Denver, Colorado, where ProLogis was based.[3] Completed in June 2011,[4] the “merger of equals”[3][22] was described as "one of the biggest real-estate deals since the [2008] recession,"[3] and created the largest industrial real estate company in the world.[10][3] With total market value estimated at $24 billion,[22] the new Prologis had around $46 billion in assets under management[3] and logistics and distribution facilities[10][3] in North America, Europe, Asia and South America.[10] Clients of the new company included DHL, Kuehne & Nagel International AG, Home Depot Inc., Unilever,[3] and FedEx.[4] AMB CEO Hamid Moghadam and ProLogis CEO Walter Rakowich were appointed as the new company's co-chiefs, with Moghadam to become the sole CEO in 2013.[3]
2013-2014: International ventures[edit]
Prologis was among the largest 200 companies in the United States by June 2011, with a market cap of $15 billion,[10] activity in 22 countries and 22 funds. By the fourth quarter of 2011, Prologis had sold a variety of assets and raised $1 billion, with plans to raise a further $2 billion through asset sales. Occupancy at Prologis real estate at the end of 2011 was 92 percent. In 2012, the company announced it planned to spend around $1 billion to develop projects in the United States, Brazil, China and Japan. By March 2012, Prologis was "the sixth-largest U.S. REIT in terms of equity market capitalization, about $15 billion," and by May, Prologis had assets valued at around $10 billion in Europe.[4] On February 14, 2013,[23] Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. (NPR),[7] a Japanese real estate investment trust formed by Prologis, successfully completed an IPO on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.[24] In March 2013, Prologis formed the Prologis European Logistics Partners Sarl joint venture with Norges Bank Investment Management for USD$3.1 billion.[25] Prologis had $46.9 billion of assets under management as of September 2013. By November 2013, Prologis Inc. remained the world's biggest warehouse owner, with plans to spend "as much as $600 million a year to develop warehouses in Japan," its biggest market after the United States. At the time, Prologis had customers such as Amazon.com and Nippon Express.[23]
By the summer of 2014, Prologis was active in 21 countries, with around 1,400 real estate professionals.[11] The company also had around $51 billion in total assets under management,[11][26] with $27.3 billion of that amount in investment management.[11] Prologis completed its IPO for FIBRA Prologis in June 2014, the company’s Mexican affiliate also known as Prologis Property Mexico SA, raising about 7 billion pesos ($541 million).[27] At the end of 2014 Prologis owned 2,853 properties, with the bulk in North America and around 600 in Europe and Asia.[28]
2015-2016: Recent sales[edit]
Prologis had reduced its number of managed funds from 23 to 11 by the spring of 2015, and was managing "$29 billion in real-estate assets through joint ventures and a series of funds backed by institutional investors."[28] That financial quarter, earnings were boosted by the sale of a Silicon Valley industrial park to Facebook, Inc.[6] With corporate headquarters remaining in San Francisco, in April 2015 Prologis announced a plan to move its operational headquarters from east Denver, Colorado to a building in downtown Denver[29] in 2017.[30]
Also that month, Prologis partnered with Norges Bank Investment Management to buy KTR Capital Partners for $5.9 billion, expanding Prologis' real estate portfolio in the United States[28] through the Prologis U.S. Logistics Venture.[31] At the time, Prologis had a market value of around $22 billion.[28][31] In October 2015, Prologis acquired Morris Realty Associates' portfolio of logistics and retail properties in the United States for $820 million. Prologis sold the acquired retail assets to Blackstone Real Estate Advisors for $374 million.[32]
By late 2016, Prologis had built large multistory warehouses in Japan, Singapore and China.[33] The company began construction on a three-floor warehouse in Seattle, Washington in November 2016, which was the first multi-story warehouse in the country.[34] The following month, Prologis also outlined pans to build a three-story warehouse in San Francisco.[33] Prologis received two 2016 Eurobuild CEE Awards in December 2016,[35] at which point[34] Prologis Inc. remained the world's largest owner of warehouses[5] and distribution centers,[6] with a 97.1% occupancy rate.[36] As of May 30, 2017, Prologis Inc. was one of the world's largest industrial property owners.[37] As of March 31, 2017, Prologis had $67 billion in total assets under management, with 3,322 industrial properties in 19 countries. It also had 1,600 employees[2] and continued to be traded on the NYSE.[7]
Business model[edit]
A publicly traded company[7] and member of the S&P 500,[8] Prologis operates in the Americas, Europe, and Asia with a portfolio of real-estate ownings or joint-ventures[7] in 19 countries.[2] Operating segments distinguish real estate operations from strategic capital, with distribution facilities leased to customers[7] in both the business-to-business and retail/online fulfillment categories.[38]
Prologis focuses on three key lines of business:

Real estate operations (leasing, managing buildings)[11][39]
Capital deployment (development and acquisitions of properties)[40]
Strategic capital (raising capital and co-investing in portfolios)[26][39]

Market research[edit]
Through its research department, the company publishes proprietary market research and several white papers each year. These include the Industrial Business Indicator, published on a quarterly basis, and the Prologis Logistics Rent Index, published annually[12] since 2016.[41]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Concerning corporate responsibility, Prologis espouses a focus on environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and ethics and governance,[42] with programs supporting these goals detailed in periodic reports.[43] The company was named among the “Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World” for six consecutive years, starting in 2008.[11] The company first began testing the use of rooftop solar panels[44] on its buildings in Germany and France, and by 2016, Prologis was second after Walmart for amount of installed rooftop solar capacity in the United States.[45]

Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) vs.  Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) Heady Investors are Taking a Look
 Jul 19, 2017
 Financial News Staff









Strategic investors have taken a closer look of late at shares of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD).  Given the cheap price, many are wondering if there is now value and potential upside to the name.  During the most recent session, shares touched $146.21 after moving 0.71%.
Equity markets can move in an instant, requiring investors to always stay on their toes. Most sudden stock spikes or drops require the attention of anyone who is keeping a keen eye on the shares. What may go somewhat undetected is the slow and steady rise or fall of a particular stock. Sometimes it can be difficult to decipher fact from fiction in the markets. Why is a company that consistently produces strong returns going down? Why are the underperforming company shares moving higher? While there may be no clear cut answers to the questions, professional investors work endlessly to make sense of equity market nuances.
Based on recent analysis, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) shares have been seen trading -0.87% off of the 50-day peak and 3.86% away from the 50-day bottom. In terms of the stock price in relation to its moving averages, company shares are 1.55% away from the 20-day moving average and 1.32% off of the 50-day average. If we take a longer approach, shares have been trading 3.57% away from the 200-day moving average.
Occasionally investors may be looking to shift their stock strategy. Maybe one plan worked for a period of time, but now economic conditions have shifted and a change is required. Whatever the case, the primary goal is typically to maximize profits. Finding a winning investing strategy may not happen immediately. Navigating the sometimes murky economic waters can be a struggle. Staying afloat may depend on many factors, but doing homework and studying all the available information is essential.
Over the last year, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD)’s stock has performed 5.87%. For the last six months, the stock has performed -0.08%. From the start of the calendar year, shares have been 1.66%. Zooming in closer, company stock has been 8.34% for the quarter, 0.04% over the past month, and 1.73% over the past week. 
Bargain stock hunters have honed in their attention of late on shares of Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD).  The stock is currently valued at $60.12 after moving -0.03% in the most recent session and 4.03% over the past 5 trading days.  Given the current price levels, let’s take a look and see if there is any value here.
After a recent check, shares of Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) have been seen trading -0.58% off of the 50-day high and 11.64% away from the 50-day low. In terms of the stock price in relation to its moving averages, company shares are 3.19% away from the 20-day moving average and 5.60% off of the 50-day average. If we take a wider approach, shares have been trading 13.88% away from the 200-day moving average.
Over the last year, Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD)’s stock has performed 16.26%. For the last six months, the stock has performed 13.76%. From the start of the calendar year, shares have been 13.89%. Zooming in closer, company stock has been 10.72% for the quarter, 2.61% over the past month, and 4.03% over the past week.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
