Darwin E. Smith, 69, Executive Who Remade a Paper Company


By DAVID BARBOZA


Published: December 28, 1995









                    Darwin E. Smith, who led the growth of the Kimberly-Clark Corporation into a  consumer products giant, died on Tuesday after collapsing at his home in Longboat Key, Fla. He was 69.        

                    The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Lois Claire Archibold Smith.        

                    Mr. Smith, who was chairman and chief executive of Kimberly-Clark for 20 years until retiring in 1991, refocused and built the company, whose well-known  brands include Kleenex tissues and Huggies disposable diapers. Last July, the company announced plans for a $9.4 billion merger with the Scott Paper Company,  to create the world's largest tissue manufacturer.        

                    Mr. Smith had little interest in joining industry groups or high-profile executive associations. Instead, he channeled his attentions on Kimberly-Clark,  which was founded in 1872 in Neenah, Wis., as a newsprint business. The company  broadened its operations in the 1920's by introducing Kotex sanitary napkins and the first throw-away tissues, Kleenex. It also developed large interests in coated paper and book paper.        

                    Not long after he became chief executive, Mr. Smith sold off large interests  in coated paper and closed down inefficient mills, including one in Kimberly, Wis., a town named after the company. Later in the 1970's he pushed the company  into new products, particularly by revamping a disposable diaper, renamed Huggies, which would compete with Procter & Gamble's leading brand, Pampers.        

                    By the time of Mr. Smith's retirement, Huggies had become the nation's leading disposable diaper and accounted for about 23 percent of the company's $7 billion in annual revenues.        

                    Mr. Smith used the cash he raised from auctioning off paper mills and forest  lands to strengthen the company's consumer products division, making it less reliant on commodity products and providing higher returns for its shareholders. Out of the company's own operations, he even formed an airline, Midwest Express. The company later sold a majority holding in Midwest for a profit of more than $40 million.        

                    In 1985, he moved the company's headquarters to Dallas from Neenah.        

                    In the last 10 years of Mr. Smith's tenure, Kimberly-Clark was repeatedly cited by Fortune magazine as the most admired forest products company in the nation.        

                    Darwin Eatna Smith was born in Garrett, Ind., where his father, K. Bryant Smith, was a railroad engineer. He graduated with distinction from Indiana University in 1950. He later attended Harvard Law School, graduating cum laude in 1955, and took a position with a Chicago firm, Sidley, Austin, Burgess & Smith.        

                    In 1958, he joined the legal department of Kimberly-Clark at a salary of $15,000 a year, intending to stay only long enough to gain corporate experience. But he rose through the ranks and remained with the company for 34 years.        

                    At the time he became chairman, he learned that he had throat cancer and underwent radiation treatment, his wife said. Although the doctors said he would probably not live much more than a year, Mr. Smith regained his health and served as a vigorous chief executive.        

                    In addition to his wife, Mr. Smith is survived by two sons, Steven B., of Lorena, Tex., and Blair A., of Duluth, Ga.; two daughters, Valerie C. Hunt of Winnetka, Ill., and Pamela C. Smith of Elm Grove, Wis., and eight grandchildren.

We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Smith has no media or publications listed.Background Check 0 Malpractice ClaimsNo malpractice history found for Florida.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor.
