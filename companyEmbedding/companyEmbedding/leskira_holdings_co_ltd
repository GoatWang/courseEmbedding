SCREEN shall properly respond if a customer wishes to check, change, amend or stop the use (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Disclosure, etc.") of his/her personal information provided to us according to the customer's personal request, under the laws of Japan and the regulations. This provision is applied to only the customers residing in Japan.
•Procedures for Disclosure, etc.

The customer must fill in the necessary information in the prescribed "Personal Information Form (PDF: 76KB)" from SCREEN and then send it to the SCREEN Customer Service office described in "5. Provisions regarding inquiries about 'personal information'".
When applying, the customer must include a copy of his/her driver's license, passport, health insurance card, etc. to confirm his/her identity. Note that applications for Disclosure, etc. by an authorized representative must be accompanied by a notarized letter of attorney.
After confirming identity, SCREEN will check the personal information of the customer, handle it as necessary, and send the results to the customer in a response letter. However, a response letter may not be sent if an employee of SCREEN has received the request for Disclosure, etc. in an interview and handles it appropriately.
To prevent mailing errors, the response letter will be sent to the address of the customer using "Restricted Delivery Mail Service" provided by Japan's Postal Service. Therefore, the customer is responsible for the charge of 612 yen postage per response letter. To pay the postage, the customer must enclose 612 yen in stamps when sending the necessary documents. However, if an employee of SCREEN receives a request for Disclosure, etc. and handles it appropriately during an interview, a response letter will not be sent, so the postage fee above is not required.
We only use the personal information collected for the request for Disclosure, etc. within the scope necessary for the request for Disclosure, etc. The documents that are submitted will be saved for an appropriate amount of time after they are received and then destroyed.
If any of the following reasons applies, the information will not be disclosed. If it is decided that the information will not be disclosed, notification to that effect will be given to the customer.
								
If the identity of the person cannot be confirmed because the information in the application and the information in the documents to confirm identity do not match, or for other reasons;
If the prescribed application document is not complete;
If there is no payment of return postage;
If the requested information for Disclosure, etc. does not fall under the category of "held personal data" set forth in "Personal Information Protection Law" in Japan;
If there is a risk that the life, physical health, property or other rights or privileges of the customer or a third party may be harmed; or
