Insurance hubs





Richmond
Home to Markel’s headquarters, Richmond is the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
Read More...
Virginia is known for its history, dating back to the early 1600s with the first English settlement in Jamestown. Eight US presidents were also born in the state. Virginia has had a strong history with the insurance industry as well. Many insurance brokers and agencies started their business in Virginia and over the years, expanded across the globe. Many of these agencies are top ranking, have grown by acquisition, and are well-known across the nation, generating millions in revenues. In Richmond, Markel is not the only insurance headquarters--many excess and surplus lines carriers now call the capital city home, along with other non-P&C insurance carriers. 







New York
New York is the marketplace for insurance in the US. Home to the world’s largest stock exchanges, NASDAQ and the NYSE, and anchored by Wall Street, New York has made its mark in the global financial services sector. 
Read More...
And many of the largest insurance brokers, agencies, and carriers have a major presence in the city, making it efficient for underwriters and brokers to meet in person to discuss client risks and needs. Markel’s presence in the city and surrounding area continues to grow, with offices in Manhattan; Summit, New Jersey; and Red Bank, New Jersey.







Bermuda
Bermuda is known for its tropical beaches and picturesque views, but it is also one of the biggest offshore financial services centers in the world.
Read More...
Many of the world’s largest insurance and reinsurance companies have offices and headquarters on the 14-mile long island. Since the 1950s, insurance and reinsurance in Bermuda has evolved—initially, much of the industry thrived in catastrophe insurance, but now primary, life, and specialty insurers continue to grow. Markel’s presence in Bermuda has grown over the years, with its acquisitions of Alterra in 2013, which formed our Markel Global Insurance and Markel Global Reinsurance divisions, and CATCo, an ILS management business, in 2015.








London
London is one of the world’s leading financial centers and is home to Lloyd’s, the world’s largest specialist insurance market.
Read More...
Lloyd’s is not a company but a three-centuries-old market, where insurers come together through a number of syndicates to insure risks. The majority of business placed at Lloyd’s is conducted face-to-face between brokers and underwriters. Lloyd’s is licensed to do business in over 200 countries and territories, which makes it a hub to write insurance risks all over the globe. Markel entered the international marketplace in 2000, with the acquisition of Terra Nova in London. Since then, the Markel International division has grown to open offices across Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada, and most recently, Dubai.

History[edit]
Company founder Samuel A. Markel formed the Mutual Casualty Association and established the Mutual Casualty Company in Norfolk, Virginia. The company headquarters later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4] Sam Markel’s four sons, Lewis, Irvin, Stanley, and Milton, joined the growing business in the 1930s, and Markel Service, Inc. was created.[5] During this time, Markel was actively involved in efforts to develop safety and other standards aimed at legitimizing the growing bus and trucking industries. Markel also assisted in passing the National Motor Carrier Act of 1935.[4]
By the 1940s, Markel Service, Inc. earned a national following and developed a reputation for industry-leading claims adjusting and safety engineering. American Fidelity & Casualty, a sister company covering fleets of trucks and buses, also became the largest insurer of these risks in the USA.[4] In 1980, the company became an insurance carrier when Essex Insurance Company was incorporated and licensed to write excess and surplus lines business.[6] In 1986, the Markel Corporation was listed on the NASDAQ exchange, with an IPO offered at $8.33 per share. The company’s trading was moved to the NYSE in 1997.[7] Markel gained access to specialty international markets in 2000, when Terra Nova Holdings, Ltd. was acquired and the [London] office opened.[8] Branch offices later opened in the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada. With a “permanent capital” investing approach, Markel Ventures acquired AMF Bakery Systems in 2005 and continued to acquire other varied and scalable businesses.[4] With the $3.1 billion acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited, Markel added two additional insurance divisions, Markel Global and Markel Reinsurance.[9] In 2015, Markel acquired Bermuda-based CATCo, a specialist investment management business; and Markel Ventures announced a majority interest in CapTech.[10]
Today, the company is led by Executive Chairman Alan I. Kirshner,[11] who is one of the authors of the Markel Style.
Timeline[edit]
Beginning in 1930, Markel established Markel Service, a separate company to handle direct and reinsurance of AF&C.[4]
In 1951, the company expanded into Canada by founding Markel Service Canada, Ltd., headquartered in Toronto, Ontario.[4]
In 1959, the national claims division of AF&C became National Claims Service, an independent adjuster that could be contracted by other insurance firms. The Safety Engineering Division also began offering services to other firms.[4]
The company later expanded beyond truck and bus companies, led by the third generation of Markels: Anthony (Vice Chairman), Steve, and Gary.[4]
In 1980, the company founded Essex Insurance Company in Delaware. Essex began as a property insurance company in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, but later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4]
In 1985, Prem Watsa took control of Markel Financial Holdings, a Canadian-based trucking insurance company. Near bankruptcy, Watsa determined it needed a capital injection.[4]
In December 1986, Markel Corp. held its first IPO at $8.33 per share, valuing the company at $15 million. Shares traded on the NASDAQ.[7]
In 1987, Markel reorganized Markel Financial Holdings (Canada) and renamed it Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., short for "fair, friendly acquisitions."[4]
In December 1987, Markel Corp. acquired half of Shand Morahan & Company, an underwriter in Deerfield, Illinois.[12]
In December 1990, Markel completed its acquisition of Shand. As part of the Shand acquisition, Markel Corp. also acquired American Underwriting Managers, an insurance underwriter in Pewaukee, Wisconsin specializing in personal boat and motorcycle insurance.[12]
In 1989, Markel Corp. acquired the Rhulen Agency of Monticello, New York. Rhulen is a specialty insurer for children's summer camps and youth organizations. Rhulen was later moved to Richmond, Virginia, and renamed Markel Insurance Company.[4]
In the Spring of 1997, Markel Corp. trading moved to the NYSE.[7]
In January 2000, Markel Corp. founded Markel Southwest Underwriters in Scottsdale, Arizona after buying the Arizona policies of Acceptance Insurance Company.[13]
In March 2000, Markel Corp. completed the acquisition of Terra Nova (Bermuda) Holdings Ltd.[8]
In October 2009, Elliott Special Risks LP (ESR) was purchased by Markel International, a London-based specialty property and casualty insurer that runs the international operations of Markel Corp.[14]
On May 10, 2010, at the Markel Corp. Annual Meeting, it was reported there would be a new management structure approved by the Board. Alan I. Kirshner would remain Chairman and Chief Executive Officer while Anthony F. Markel and Steven A. Markel would still serve as Vice Chairman. Reporting to them would be a three-member Office of the President. Thomas S. Gayner became President and Chief Investment Officer, while Richard R. Whitt, III and F. Michael Crowley became President and Co-Chief Operating Officers.[15]
In July 2010, Markel Corp. acquired Aspen Holdings, Inc. of Omaha, Nebraska.[16]
In April 2011, Markel (UK) Limited launched Markel Direct, an online direct to customer distribution channel for specialist insurance.[17]
On January 4, 2012, Markel Corp. completed the acquisition of Thompson Insurance Enterprises, a privately held program administrator underwriting multi-line, industry-focused insurance programs.[18]
In February 2012, Markel's Camp Insurance Program joined forces with CampDoc.com, an electronic health record system for camps, to help summer camps reduce risk and liability and to ensure the health and safety of kids while at camp.[19]
In June 2012, Markel Direct expanded product range into charity and community group risks.
In October 2012, Markel purchased Essentia Insurance Company.[20]
On May 1, 2013, Markel Corporation completed its acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited.[21]
On December 17, 2013, the Essentia Insurance Company (Essentia) was rated as "A2" by Moody’s Investor Service.[22]

History[edit]
Company founder Samuel A. Markel formed the Mutual Casualty Association and established the Mutual Casualty Company in Norfolk, Virginia. The company headquarters later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4] Sam Markel’s four sons, Lewis, Irvin, Stanley, and Milton, joined the growing business in the 1930s, and Markel Service, Inc. was created.[5] During this time, Markel was actively involved in efforts to develop safety and other standards aimed at legitimizing the growing bus and trucking industries. Markel also assisted in passing the National Motor Carrier Act of 1935.[4]
By the 1940s, Markel Service, Inc. earned a national following and developed a reputation for industry-leading claims adjusting and safety engineering. American Fidelity & Casualty, a sister company covering fleets of trucks and buses, also became the largest insurer of these risks in the USA.[4] In 1980, the company became an insurance carrier when Essex Insurance Company was incorporated and licensed to write excess and surplus lines business.[6] In 1986, the Markel Corporation was listed on the NASDAQ exchange, with an IPO offered at $8.33 per share. The company’s trading was moved to the NYSE in 1997.[7] Markel gained access to specialty international markets in 2000, when Terra Nova Holdings, Ltd. was acquired and the [London] office opened.[8] Branch offices later opened in the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada. With a “permanent capital” investing approach, Markel Ventures acquired AMF Bakery Systems in 2005 and continued to acquire other varied and scalable businesses.[4] With the $3.1 billion acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited, Markel added two additional insurance divisions, Markel Global and Markel Reinsurance.[9] In 2015, Markel acquired Bermuda-based CATCo, a specialist investment management business; and Markel Ventures announced a majority interest in CapTech.[10]
Today, the company is led by Executive Chairman Alan I. Kirshner,[11] who is one of the authors of the Markel Style.
Timeline[edit]
Beginning in 1930, Markel established Markel Service, a separate company to handle direct and reinsurance of AF&C.[4]
In 1951, the company expanded into Canada by founding Markel Service Canada, Ltd., headquartered in Toronto, Ontario.[4]
In 1959, the national claims division of AF&C became National Claims Service, an independent adjuster that could be contracted by other insurance firms. The Safety Engineering Division also began offering services to other firms.[4]
The company later expanded beyond truck and bus companies, led by the third generation of Markels: Anthony (Vice Chairman), Steve, and Gary.[4]
In 1980, the company founded Essex Insurance Company in Delaware. Essex began as a property insurance company in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, but later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4]
In 1985, Prem Watsa took control of Markel Financial Holdings, a Canadian-based trucking insurance company. Near bankruptcy, Watsa determined it needed a capital injection.[4]
In December 1986, Markel Corp. held its first IPO at $8.33 per share, valuing the company at $15 million. Shares traded on the NASDAQ.[7]
In 1987, Markel reorganized Markel Financial Holdings (Canada) and renamed it Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., short for "fair, friendly acquisitions."[4]
In December 1987, Markel Corp. acquired half of Shand Morahan & Company, an underwriter in Deerfield, Illinois.[12]
In December 1990, Markel completed its acquisition of Shand. As part of the Shand acquisition, Markel Corp. also acquired American Underwriting Managers, an insurance underwriter in Pewaukee, Wisconsin specializing in personal boat and motorcycle insurance.[12]
In 1989, Markel Corp. acquired the Rhulen Agency of Monticello, New York. Rhulen is a specialty insurer for children's summer camps and youth organizations. Rhulen was later moved to Richmond, Virginia, and renamed Markel Insurance Company.[4]
In the Spring of 1997, Markel Corp. trading moved to the NYSE.[7]
In January 2000, Markel Corp. founded Markel Southwest Underwriters in Scottsdale, Arizona after buying the Arizona policies of Acceptance Insurance Company.[13]
In March 2000, Markel Corp. completed the acquisition of Terra Nova (Bermuda) Holdings Ltd.[8]
In October 2009, Elliott Special Risks LP (ESR) was purchased by Markel International, a London-based specialty property and casualty insurer that runs the international operations of Markel Corp.[14]
On May 10, 2010, at the Markel Corp. Annual Meeting, it was reported there would be a new management structure approved by the Board. Alan I. Kirshner would remain Chairman and Chief Executive Officer while Anthony F. Markel and Steven A. Markel would still serve as Vice Chairman. Reporting to them would be a three-member Office of the President. Thomas S. Gayner became President and Chief Investment Officer, while Richard R. Whitt, III and F. Michael Crowley became President and Co-Chief Operating Officers.[15]
In July 2010, Markel Corp. acquired Aspen Holdings, Inc. of Omaha, Nebraska.[16]
In April 2011, Markel (UK) Limited launched Markel Direct, an online direct to customer distribution channel for specialist insurance.[17]
On January 4, 2012, Markel Corp. completed the acquisition of Thompson Insurance Enterprises, a privately held program administrator underwriting multi-line, industry-focused insurance programs.[18]
In February 2012, Markel's Camp Insurance Program joined forces with CampDoc.com, an electronic health record system for camps, to help summer camps reduce risk and liability and to ensure the health and safety of kids while at camp.[19]
In June 2012, Markel Direct expanded product range into charity and community group risks.
In October 2012, Markel purchased Essentia Insurance Company.[20]
On May 1, 2013, Markel Corporation completed its acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited.[21]
On December 17, 2013, the Essentia Insurance Company (Essentia) was rated as "A2" by Moody’s Investor Service.[22]

History[edit]
Company founder Samuel A. Markel formed the Mutual Casualty Association and established the Mutual Casualty Company in Norfolk, Virginia. The company headquarters later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4] Sam Markel’s four sons, Lewis, Irvin, Stanley, and Milton, joined the growing business in the 1930s, and Markel Service, Inc. was created.[5] During this time, Markel was actively involved in efforts to develop safety and other standards aimed at legitimizing the growing bus and trucking industries. Markel also assisted in passing the National Motor Carrier Act of 1935.[4]
By the 1940s, Markel Service, Inc. earned a national following and developed a reputation for industry-leading claims adjusting and safety engineering. American Fidelity & Casualty, a sister company covering fleets of trucks and buses, also became the largest insurer of these risks in the USA.[4] In 1980, the company became an insurance carrier when Essex Insurance Company was incorporated and licensed to write excess and surplus lines business.[6] In 1986, the Markel Corporation was listed on the NASDAQ exchange, with an IPO offered at $8.33 per share. The company’s trading was moved to the NYSE in 1997.[7] Markel gained access to specialty international markets in 2000, when Terra Nova Holdings, Ltd. was acquired and the [London] office opened.[8] Branch offices later opened in the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada. With a “permanent capital” investing approach, Markel Ventures acquired AMF Bakery Systems in 2005 and continued to acquire other varied and scalable businesses.[4] With the $3.1 billion acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited, Markel added two additional insurance divisions, Markel Global and Markel Reinsurance.[9] In 2015, Markel acquired Bermuda-based CATCo, a specialist investment management business; and Markel Ventures announced a majority interest in CapTech.[10]
Today, the company is led by Executive Chairman Alan I. Kirshner,[11] who is one of the authors of the Markel Style.

History[edit]
Company founder Samuel A. Markel formed the Mutual Casualty Association and established the Mutual Casualty Company in Norfolk, Virginia. The company headquarters later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4] Sam Markel’s four sons, Lewis, Irvin, Stanley, and Milton, joined the growing business in the 1930s, and Markel Service, Inc. was created.[5] During this time, Markel was actively involved in efforts to develop safety and other standards aimed at legitimizing the growing bus and trucking industries. Markel also assisted in passing the National Motor Carrier Act of 1935.[4]
By the 1940s, Markel Service, Inc. earned a national following and developed a reputation for industry-leading claims adjusting and safety engineering. American Fidelity & Casualty, a sister company covering fleets of trucks and buses, also became the largest insurer of these risks in the USA.[4] In 1980, the company became an insurance carrier when Essex Insurance Company was incorporated and licensed to write excess and surplus lines business.[6] In 1986, the Markel Corporation was listed on the NASDAQ exchange, with an IPO offered at $8.33 per share. The company’s trading was moved to the NYSE in 1997.[7] Markel gained access to specialty international markets in 2000, when Terra Nova Holdings, Ltd. was acquired and the [London] office opened.[8] Branch offices later opened in the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada. With a “permanent capital” investing approach, Markel Ventures acquired AMF Bakery Systems in 2005 and continued to acquire other varied and scalable businesses.[4] With the $3.1 billion acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited, Markel added two additional insurance divisions, Markel Global and Markel Reinsurance.[9] In 2015, Markel acquired Bermuda-based CATCo, a specialist investment management business; and Markel Ventures announced a majority interest in CapTech.[10]
Today, the company is led by Executive Chairman Alan I. Kirshner,[11] who is one of the authors of the Markel Style.
Timeline[edit]
Beginning in 1930, Markel established Markel Service, a separate company to handle direct and reinsurance of AF&C.[4]
In 1951, the company expanded into Canada by founding Markel Service Canada, Ltd., headquartered in Toronto, Ontario.[4]
In 1959, the national claims division of AF&C became National Claims Service, an independent adjuster that could be contracted by other insurance firms. The Safety Engineering Division also began offering services to other firms.[4]
The company later expanded beyond truck and bus companies, led by the third generation of Markels: Anthony (Vice Chairman), Steve, and Gary.[4]
In 1980, the company founded Essex Insurance Company in Delaware. Essex began as a property insurance company in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, but later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4]
In 1985, Prem Watsa took control of Markel Financial Holdings, a Canadian-based trucking insurance company. Near bankruptcy, Watsa determined it needed a capital injection.[4]
In December 1986, Markel Corp. held its first IPO at $8.33 per share, valuing the company at $15 million. Shares traded on the NASDAQ.[7]
In 1987, Markel reorganized Markel Financial Holdings (Canada) and renamed it Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., short for "fair, friendly acquisitions."[4]
In December 1987, Markel Corp. acquired half of Shand Morahan & Company, an underwriter in Deerfield, Illinois.[12]
In December 1990, Markel completed its acquisition of Shand. As part of the Shand acquisition, Markel Corp. also acquired American Underwriting Managers, an insurance underwriter in Pewaukee, Wisconsin specializing in personal boat and motorcycle insurance.[12]
In 1989, Markel Corp. acquired the Rhulen Agency of Monticello, New York. Rhulen is a specialty insurer for children's summer camps and youth organizations. Rhulen was later moved to Richmond, Virginia, and renamed Markel Insurance Company.[4]
In the Spring of 1997, Markel Corp. trading moved to the NYSE.[7]
In January 2000, Markel Corp. founded Markel Southwest Underwriters in Scottsdale, Arizona after buying the Arizona policies of Acceptance Insurance Company.[13]
In March 2000, Markel Corp. completed the acquisition of Terra Nova (Bermuda) Holdings Ltd.[8]
In October 2009, Elliott Special Risks LP (ESR) was purchased by Markel International, a London-based specialty property and casualty insurer that runs the international operations of Markel Corp.[14]
On May 10, 2010, at the Markel Corp. Annual Meeting, it was reported there would be a new management structure approved by the Board. Alan I. Kirshner would remain Chairman and Chief Executive Officer while Anthony F. Markel and Steven A. Markel would still serve as Vice Chairman. Reporting to them would be a three-member Office of the President. Thomas S. Gayner became President and Chief Investment Officer, while Richard R. Whitt, III and F. Michael Crowley became President and Co-Chief Operating Officers.[15]
In July 2010, Markel Corp. acquired Aspen Holdings, Inc. of Omaha, Nebraska.[16]
In April 2011, Markel (UK) Limited launched Markel Direct, an online direct to customer distribution channel for specialist insurance.[17]
On January 4, 2012, Markel Corp. completed the acquisition of Thompson Insurance Enterprises, a privately held program administrator underwriting multi-line, industry-focused insurance programs.[18]
In February 2012, Markel's Camp Insurance Program joined forces with CampDoc.com, an electronic health record system for camps, to help summer camps reduce risk and liability and to ensure the health and safety of kids while at camp.[19]
In June 2012, Markel Direct expanded product range into charity and community group risks.
In October 2012, Markel purchased Essentia Insurance Company.[20]
On May 1, 2013, Markel Corporation completed its acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited.[21]
On December 17, 2013, the Essentia Insurance Company (Essentia) was rated as "A2" by Moody’s Investor Service.[22]
