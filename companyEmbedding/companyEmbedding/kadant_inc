History[edit]
The company was established as Thermo Fibrotek in 1991 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Electron[4]:9 of Exhibit 13 as part of its parent's strategy to innovate and grow by creating subsidiaries that were privately owned in part, and publicly-traded in part.[5] Its initial focus was paper making and paper recycling equipment.[4][5]
In 1996 the company set up a subsidiary, Thermo Fibergen, which it in turn made partially publicly traded, to focus on technologies to recover products from paper-making waste products; that company in turn acquired Granulation Technology, Inc. and created a division called GranTek that produced granules from sludge that were used, for example, as a carrier for agricultural chemicals and pesticides.[4] The original plan was that Fibergen would build its plants adjacent to paper-making plants to process their waste, but this plan failed because it required paper-making plants to commit to long-term contracts to dispose of their waste, which they were unwilling to do.[6] The granule business became the focus of Fibergen, helped in part by enzymologist Anatole Klyosov.[6]
In 1997 the company acquired Black Clawson for $110 million.[7]
In 2001, Thermo Electron fully spun out Thermo Fibrotek, which changed its name to Kadant at the same time;[8] the Fibrogen division was renamed to Kadant Composites at the same time.[6] The granule business of Kadant Composites took off when the company started using it as a filler in composite plastics products for decking, with sales growing from under $2 million in 2001 to $15 million in 2004.[6]
In 2013 the company acquired Carmanah Design and Manufacturing Inc. for Canadian dollars (CAD) 54 million in cash, or approximately US$52 million.[9]
Products[edit]
Kadant engages in mainly four segments: stock preparation systems, fluid handling systems, roll doctoring, cleaning and filtration, and fiber-based granules. Kadant provides custom-engineered systems (e.g. recycling and approach flow systems) and equipment (e.g. virgin pulping process equipment). The company also provides fluid-handling systems (e.g. rotary joints, syphons, turbulator bars, precision unions) widely used in the dryer section of the papermaking process, and the production of corrugated boxboard, metals, plastics, rubber, textiles, chemicals, and food. In addition, the company offers doctoring systems (e.g. doctor blades), profiling systems, shower and fabric-conditioning, formation, and water filtration systems Kaden also provides individual components, widely used in pulping, de-inking, screening, cleaning, refining recycled. The company supplies biodegradable absorbent granules from papermaking byproducts for some agriculture uses.[10]
Research and development[edit]
Kadant's Research and Development facilities are based in Europe and the USA, engaging in fiber processing, heat transfer, doctoring, and fluid handling. This facilities are located where customers can test under their own operating conditions. The company also holds seminars and training programs.[11]

History[edit]
The company was established as Thermo Fibrotek in 1991 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Electron[4]:9 of Exhibit 13 as part of its parent's strategy to innovate and grow by creating subsidiaries that were privately owned in part, and publicly-traded in part.[5] Its initial focus was paper making and paper recycling equipment.[4][5]
In 1996 the company set up a subsidiary, Thermo Fibergen, which it in turn made partially publicly traded, to focus on technologies to recover products from paper-making waste products; that company in turn acquired Granulation Technology, Inc. and created a division called GranTek that produced granules from sludge that were used, for example, as a carrier for agricultural chemicals and pesticides.[4] The original plan was that Fibergen would build its plants adjacent to paper-making plants to process their waste, but this plan failed because it required paper-making plants to commit to long-term contracts to dispose of their waste, which they were unwilling to do.[6] The granule business became the focus of Fibergen, helped in part by enzymologist Anatole Klyosov.[6]
In 1997 the company acquired Black Clawson for $110 million.[7]
In 2001, Thermo Electron fully spun out Thermo Fibrotek, which changed its name to Kadant at the same time;[8] the Fibrogen division was renamed to Kadant Composites at the same time.[6] The granule business of Kadant Composites took off when the company started using it as a filler in composite plastics products for decking, with sales growing from under $2 million in 2001 to $15 million in 2004.[6]
In 2013 the company acquired Carmanah Design and Manufacturing Inc. for Canadian dollars (CAD) 54 million in cash, or approximately US$52 million.[9]
Products[edit]
Kadant engages in mainly four segments: stock preparation systems, fluid handling systems, roll doctoring, cleaning and filtration, and fiber-based granules. Kadant provides custom-engineered systems (e.g. recycling and approach flow systems) and equipment (e.g. virgin pulping process equipment). The company also provides fluid-handling systems (e.g. rotary joints, syphons, turbulator bars, precision unions) widely used in the dryer section of the papermaking process, and the production of corrugated boxboard, metals, plastics, rubber, textiles, chemicals, and food. In addition, the company offers doctoring systems (e.g. doctor blades), profiling systems, shower and fabric-conditioning, formation, and water filtration systems Kaden also provides individual components, widely used in pulping, de-inking, screening, cleaning, refining recycled. The company supplies biodegradable absorbent granules from papermaking byproducts for some agriculture uses.[10]
Research and development[edit]
Kadant's Research and Development facilities are based in Europe and the USA, engaging in fiber processing, heat transfer, doctoring, and fluid handling. This facilities are located where customers can test under their own operating conditions. The company also holds seminars and training programs.[11]

Business Wire




May 30, 2017 4:25 PM EDT













 


















































  Kadant Inc. (NYSE: KAI) has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the forest products business of NII FPG Company for $173 million in cash, subject to a post-closing adjustment. The Company also announced that it has increased its revolving credit facility to $300 million from $200 million and intends to finance the transaction through borrowings under the revolving credit facility.  NII FPG Company is a global leader in the design and manufacture of equipment used by sawmills, veneer mills, and other manufacturers in the forest products industry. The company also designs and manufactures harvesting equipment used in cutting, gathering, and removing timber from forest plantations. The transaction is expected to close in July 2017.  "Our acquisition of the forest products business of NII FPG extends our presence deeper into the forest products industry and complements our existing wood processing product line," said Jonathan Painter, president and chief executive officer of Kadant Inc. "NII FPG is a leader in its markets with a history of stable earnings, a strong parts and consumables business, and a solid reputation as a premium manufacturer of products that have a high impact in customers' operations. We expect the company will make a strong contribution to our business." Mr. Painter continued, "With more than 50 percent of NII FPG's business coming from parts and consumables, this acquisition will also advance our strategic plan to increase our aftermarket revenue."  The forest products business of NII FPG Company includes two primary manufacturing facilities and approximately 275 employees worldwide with reported revenue of approximately $81 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016.

History[edit]
The company was established as Thermo Fibrotek in 1991 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Electron[4]:9 of Exhibit 13 as part of its parent's strategy to innovate and grow by creating subsidiaries that were privately owned in part, and publicly-traded in part.[5] Its initial focus was paper making and paper recycling equipment.[4][5]
In 1996 the company set up a subsidiary, Thermo Fibergen, which it in turn made partially publicly traded, to focus on technologies to recover products from paper-making waste products; that company in turn acquired Granulation Technology, Inc. and created a division called GranTek that produced granules from sludge that were used, for example, as a carrier for agricultural chemicals and pesticides.[4] The original plan was that Fibergen would build its plants adjacent to paper-making plants to process their waste, but this plan failed because it required paper-making plants to commit to long-term contracts to dispose of their waste, which they were unwilling to do.[6] The granule business became the focus of Fibergen, helped in part by enzymologist Anatole Klyosov.[6]
In 1997 the company acquired Black Clawson for $110 million.[7]
In 2001, Thermo Electron fully spun out Thermo Fibrotek, which changed its name to Kadant at the same time;[8] the Fibrogen division was renamed to Kadant Composites at the same time.[6] The granule business of Kadant Composites took off when the company started using it as a filler in composite plastics products for decking, with sales growing from under $2 million in 2001 to $15 million in 2004.[6]
In 2013 the company acquired Carmanah Design and Manufacturing Inc. for Canadian dollars (CAD) 54 million in cash, or approximately US$52 million.[9]
Products[edit]
Kadant engages in mainly four segments: stock preparation systems, fluid handling systems, roll doctoring, cleaning and filtration, and fiber-based granules. Kadant provides custom-engineered systems (e.g. recycling and approach flow systems) and equipment (e.g. virgin pulping process equipment). The company also provides fluid-handling systems (e.g. rotary joints, syphons, turbulator bars, precision unions) widely used in the dryer section of the papermaking process, and the production of corrugated boxboard, metals, plastics, rubber, textiles, chemicals, and food. In addition, the company offers doctoring systems (e.g. doctor blades), profiling systems, shower and fabric-conditioning, formation, and water filtration systems Kaden also provides individual components, widely used in pulping, de-inking, screening, cleaning, refining recycled. The company supplies biodegradable absorbent granules from papermaking byproducts for some agriculture uses.[10]
Research and development[edit]
Kadant's Research and Development facilities are based in Europe and the USA, engaging in fiber processing, heat transfer, doctoring, and fluid handling. This facilities are located where customers can test under their own operating conditions. The company also holds seminars and training programs.[11]
