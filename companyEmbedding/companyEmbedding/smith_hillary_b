Hillary B. Smith Joins Square as General Counsel






November 02, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Square (NYSE:SQ) has hired Hillary B. Smith as the company’s General 
      Counsel. Smith brings to Square years of legal leadership experience at 
      technology companies and has navigated complex legal and regulatory 
      environments at the local, state, and federal level. Smith most recently 
      served as General Counsel for Zenefits.
    


      “Square is a purpose-driven company with a long track record of 
      innovation, and I’m excited to work alongside the team as they continue 
      to take the company—and the entire financial services industry—forward,” 
      said Smith.
    

      "Hillary has exceptional experience serving as general counsel at 
      several technology companies, both publicly traded and startups, and 
      she's a great fit for our team," said Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square.
    

      Prior to serving as the General Counsel of Zenefits, Hillary was the 
      General Counsel for SuccessFactors, Inc., a global public company until 
      its acquisition by SAP for $3.4 billion in 2012. Following the 
      acquisition by SAP, Hillary led the Legal team supporting the global 
      cloud business at SAP. Before joining SuccessFactors in 2010, Hillary 
      was the General Counsel of Right Media (acquired by Yahoo! in 2007) and 
      Yahoo's Associate General Counsel supporting the company's global 
      advertising products and businesses. Prior to Right Media, Hillary was 
      the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of 
      DoubleClick Inc. She began her legal career at Paul Weiss Rifkind 
      Wharton & Garrison in New York following a federal district court 
      clerkship in the Eastern District of New York.
    

      In 2012, Hillary was honored as one of the San Francisco Business Times’ 
      Most Influential Women in Business. She was also honored in 2004 by the 
      New York County Lawyers' Association as one of the Outstanding Women of 
      the Bar and has served as a member of the Federal Bar Council Inns of 
      Court Project and Women in Digital Media. Hillary obtained her J.D. from 
      Cornell Law School magna cum laude where she was the editor-in-chief of 
      the Cornell Law Review and a member of the Order of the Coif. A 
      Montanan, Hillary graduated from Montana State University.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Smith Joins Square as General CounselBusiness WireNovember 2, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Square (SQ) has hired Hillary B. Smith as the company’s General Counsel. Smith brings to Square years of legal leadership experience at technology companies and has navigated complex legal and regulatory environments at the local, state, and federal level. Smith most recently served as General Counsel for Zenefits.“Square is a purpose-driven company with a long track record of innovation, and I’m excited to work alongside the team as they continue to take the company—and the entire financial services industry—forward,” said Smith."Hillary has exceptional experience serving as general counsel at several technology companies, both publicly traded and startups, and she's a great fit for our team," said Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square.Prior to serving as the General Counsel of Zenefits, Hillary was the General Counsel for SuccessFactors, Inc., a global public company until its acquisition by SAP for $3.4 billion in 2012.

Her first soap opera stint was as Kit on the now-canceled show The Doctors.
In 1983, she took over for Margaret Colin in the role of Margo Montgomery Hughes on As the World Turns, a character she would play on the serial for several years. During Smith's run as Margo, the character went from being a troublemaker to a leading heroine. After giving birth to her first child (as well as a bitter feud with a co-star over an adulterous relationship), Smith left "ATWT" in 1989.
Smith returned to daytime in 1992 in her Daytime Emmy Award-winning role as District Attorney Nora Hanen Gannon Buchanan Colson on the ABC soap opera, One Life to Live. Nora became a centerpiece of the show, particularly after her involvement as a lawyer in a rape trial. Her character has had several husbands and lovers, several children (including an interracial child) and is daytime's only Jewish character.
While portraying Nora, Smith briefly played the wife of Gene Wilder on the primetime sitcom Something Wilder. The show was quickly cancelled, and Smith returned to playing Nora full-time.
Hilary B. Smith has also appeared in Love Potion #9 alongside Sandra Bullock and Tate Donovan and the 2002 film, Maid in Manhattan. She guest starred on an episode of Law & Order: SVU for the 2004-2005 season.

Hillary B. Smith
 

Hillary B. Smith is bringing her One Life to Live character, Nora Buchanan, to General Hospital.The soap's executive producer, Frank Valentini, revealed the news in a Twitter video showing Smith in character as Nora. At the end of the clip, the two-time Daytime Emmy winner has a brief run-in with General Hospital star Rebecca Budig, her former co-star on All My Children.Details on the length of Smith's stay on General Hospital not immediately released.One Life to Live aired its last episode on ABC in 2012, but returned as a web series for a brief run in 2013. The network and production company Prospect Park quickly became embroiled in a legal battle over licensing, most notably over One Life to Live characters appearing on General Hospital. 

Several One Life to Live characters migrated to General Hospital after OLTL was canceled by ABC, but Smith's appearance as Nora Buchanan marks the first time a One Life to Live character will appear in Port Charles since the litigation began.pic.twitter.com/YEvaeGE0v8— Frank Valentini (@valentinifrank) February 1, 2017
