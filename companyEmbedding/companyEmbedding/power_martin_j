5.0 out of 5 starsBeat the slots!  Here's how -Bythomas baneon August 1, 2000This book has it all if you really want to win at slot machines. Martin Silverthorne reveals exactly how to find the highest paying slot machines in any casino.  Then he gives you a number of tested slot systems you can  use to play these machines.  This combination is just unbeatable!But  that's not all.  You will learn the professional's way of managing your  slot machine bankroll.  You can put this information to work to minimize  your losses and lock up winnings. And best of all, you will learn how to  walk away from a machine a solid winner.  I have used these money  management strategies with great results.I have been using this rock  solid system for over six months.  I have played in Las Vegas and in  Mississippi, as well as in Iowa (I travel a lot).  So far, I am winning  five out of six sessions. I hit one jackpot for over $5,000 on a machine I  would not have played without the insider information I got from Power  Slots.  If you want to read funny stories, buy a different book.  However,  if you want to become a consistent slot machine winner, this book will give  you the proven strategies you need to be a slots winner.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREPower Boilers: A Guide To Section I Of The Asme Boiler And Pressure Vessel Codeby Bernstein, Martin J./ Yoder, Lloyd W./ American Society Of Mechanical Engineers. Boiler And Pressure Vessel Committee (Cor)Written by engineers with extensive experience with both major boiler manufacturers and on the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee, this comprehensive guide explains the ASME construction process covered by Section I of the Code. Unlike other guides that simply summarize rules, it cites over 150 relevant ASME Interpretations that describe actual applications, supplying insights into the thinking of the Code Subcommittee on Power Boilers. These interpretations provide an extremely useful body of information which guides the user in many practical situations not explicitly covered by the rules of Section I. The construction of power boilers also requires the use of other sections of the Code besides Section I: Section II for materials, Section V for nondestructive examination, Section IX for qualification of welders and weld procedures, and B31.1, Power Piping, for the design of much of the boiler piping. This volume carefully explains the use of these other sections, with helpful guidance on the avoidance of the many pitfalls awaiting the unwary designer. It includes chapters on boiler life extension and repairs and on the alterations of boilers under the rules of the National Board Inspection Code, as well as useful appendices. Power Boilers covers the new 1998 edition of Section I. It provides expert advice and information for design engineers, project managers, architect engineers, manufacturing engineers, boiler operators, insurance inspectors, and other boiler professionals. It can also serve as a quick reference because of its extensive table of contents and index.GeneralCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
