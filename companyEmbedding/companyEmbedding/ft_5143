Frame Size Information
If you look on the inside of the arm of your glasses you find will something that looks like: 52 [] 16 135.
This is information on the size of your glasses: the lens diameter, the bridge width and the arm length, all measured in millimetres.



The Eye Width, or Lens Diameter, is the width of the lens (in mm), measured from the bridge. (In this example, the Eye Width is 52.)
The Bridge Width is the gap above your nose between the lenses. It should be comfortable. Too tight, and the glasses could pinch your nose; too loose and the glasses will not be stable on your face. (In this example, the Bridge Width is 16.)
The Temple Length, or Arm Length, is usually one of three standards ďż˝ 135, 140 or 145mm. The arm should be long enough to sit comfortably over your ears. Glasses with straight arms do not always have this measurement indicated. (In this example, the Temple Length is 135.)

For the day of 07/28/2017 














 Rhady (North Carolina)






 "I ordered Tom Fords Alana sunglasses on a Wednesday afternoon and had them on Friday afternoon! I paid for two-day shipping and the next day emailed the company to upgrade to overnight. Dane replied to my email immediately and made sure that I received them on Friday because I was going away for the weekend and wanted them by then. Not only did they have the glasses in stock, they are 100% authentic! The price was great and the service was great. I was skeptical at first about the authenticity since they were priced so low and were virtually unavailable anywhere else, but I am extremely happy with my purchase and would order from EZContacts again!" 













Marlena (Michigan)






 "These frames are a perfect fit for my face. I love them!" 













 Angela (Ohio)






 "Ordered 4 pair of sunglasses because the price was right. One pair is no longer available.  So far I have received the Gucci--OMG-they are spectacular and $200 less than Nordstroms!"
