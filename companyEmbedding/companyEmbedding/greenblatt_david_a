Joint Statement from Jason Dov Greenblatt and David Friedman, Co-Chairmen of the Israel Advisory…HomepageSign in / Sign upJason D. GreenblattBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingEVP/Chief Legal Officer of The Trump Organization, co-chairman of Mr.  Trump’s Israel Advisory Committee & Co-Founder of InspireConversation.comNov 2, 2016Joint Statement from Jason Dov Greenblatt and David Friedman, Co-Chairmen of the Israel Advisory Committee to Donald J. TrumpIt has been an exhilarating election cycle. Approximately seven months ago, we were blessed to have been tapped by Donald J. Trump to be his top advisors with respect to the State of Israel. We have been fortunate to work with a talented team of people and have put together the below positions. Each of these positions have been discussed with Mr. Trump and the Trump campaign, and most have been stated, in one form or another, by Mr. Trump in various interviews or speeches given by him or on his social media accounts. For those of you who are true friends of the State of Israel, and for those of you who believe that the State of Israel and the United States of America have an unbreakable friendship, we urge you to read the below. We would like to express our gratitude to those individuals who have helped us over the past few months — we truly appreciate your efforts, friendship and guidance. We would also like to express our gratitude to our friend, a great friend of the State of Israel, Donald J. Trump, who gave us the tremendous opportunity to serve in this capacity. May God bless the United States of America and the State of Israel.· The unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel is based upon shared values of democracy, freedom of speech, respect for minorities, cherishing life, and the opportunity for all citizens to pursue their dreams.· Israel is the state of the Jewish people, who have lived in that land for 3,500 years. The State of Israel was founded with courage and determination by great men and women against enormous odds and is an inspiration to people everywhere who value freedom and human dignity.· Israel is a staunch ally of the U.S. and a key partner in the global war against Islamic jihadism. Military cooperation and coordination between Israel and the U.S. must continue to grow.· The American people value our close friendship and alliance with Israel — culturally, religiously, and politically. While other nations have required U.S. troops to defend them, Israelis have always defended their own country by themselves and only ask for military equipment assistance and diplomatic support to do so. The U.S. does not need to nation-build in Israel or send troops to defend Israel.· The Memorandum of Understanding signed by the American and Israeli Governments is a good first step, but there is much more to be done. A Trump Administration will ensure that Israel receives maximum military, strategic and tactical cooperation from the United States, and the MOU will not limit the support that we give. Further, Congress will not be limited to give support greater than that provided by the MOU if it chooses to do so. Israel and the United States benefit tremendously from what each country brings to the table — the relationship is a two way street.· The U.S. should veto any United Nations votes that unfairly single out Israel and will work in international institutions and forums, including in our relations with the European Union, to oppose efforts to delegitimize Israel, impose discriminatory double standards against Israel, or to impose special labeling requirements on Israeli products or boycotts on Israeli goods.· The U.S. should cut off funds for the UN Human Rights Council, a body dominated by countries presently run by dictatorships that seems solely devoted to slandering the Jewish State. UNESCO’s attempt to disconnect the State of Israel from Jerusalem is a one-sided attempt to ignore Israel’s 3,000-year bond to its capital city, and is further evidence of the enormous anti-Israel bias of the United Nations.· The U.S. should view the effort to boycott, divest from, and sanction (BDS) Israel as inherently anti-Semitic and take strong measures, both diplomatic and legislative, to thwart actions that are intended to limit commercial relations with Israel, or persons or entities doing business in Israeli areas, in a discriminatory manner. The BDS movement is just another attempt by the Palestinians to avoid having to commit to a peaceful co-existence with Israel. The false notion that Israel is an occupier should be rejected.· The Trump administration will ask the Justice Department to investigate coordinated attempts on college campuses to intimidate students who support Israel.· A two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians appears impossible as long as the Palestinians are unwilling to renounce violence against Israel or recognize Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. Additionally, the Palestinians are divided between PA rule in the West Bank and Hamas rule in Gaza so there is not a united Palestinian people who could control a second state. Hamas is a US-designated terrorist organization that actively seeks Israel’s destruction. We will seek to assist the Israelis and the Palestinians in reaching a comprehensive and lasting peace, to be freely and fairly negotiated between those living in the region.· The Palestinian leadership, including the PA, has undermined any chance for peace with Israel by raising generations of Palestinian children on an educational program of hatred of Israel and Jews. The larger Palestinian society is regularly taught such hatred on Palestinian television, in the Palestinian press, in entertainment media, and in political and religious communications. The two major Palestinian political parties — Hamas and Fatah — regularly promote anti-Semitism and jihad.· The U.S. cannot support the creation of a new state where terrorism is financially incentivized, terrorists are celebrated by political parties and government institutions, and the corrupt diversion of foreign aid is rampant. The U.S. should not support the creation of a state that forbids the presence of Christian or Jewish citizens, or that discriminates against people on the basis of religion.· The U.S. should support direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians without preconditions, and will oppose all Palestinian, European and other efforts to bypass direct negotiations between parties in favor of an imposed settlement. Any solutions imposed on Israel by outside parties including by the United Nations Security Council, should be opposed. We support Israel’s right and obligation to defend itself against terror attacks upon its people and against alternative forms of warfare being waged upon it legally, economically, culturally, and otherwise.· Israel’s maintenance of defensible borders that preserve peace and promote stability in the region is a necessity. Pressure should not be put on Israel to withdraw to borders that make attacks and conflict more likely.· The U.S. will recognize Jerusalem as the eternal and indivisible capital of the Jewish state and Mr. Trump’s Administration will move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.· Despite the Iran Nuclear deal in 2015, the U.S. State Department recently designated Iran, yet again, as the leading state sponsor of terrorism — putting the Middle East particularly, but the whole world at risk by financing, arming, and training terrorist groups operating around the world including Hamas, Hezbollah, and forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The U.S. must counteract Iran’s ongoing violations of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action regarding Iran’s quest for nuclear weapons and their noncompliance with past and present sanctions, as well as the agreements they signed, and implement tough, new sanctions when needed to protect the world and Iran’s neighbors from its continuing nuclear and non-nuclear threats.Share29Never miss a story from Jason D.

Home > Award Winners > David J. Greenblatt, M.D.David J. Greenblatt, M.D.
2016 Award in Excellence in Clinical Pharmacology1980 Unit Award in Clinical PharmacologyDr. Greenblatt has been on the Faculty of Tufts University School of Medicine and the Staff of Tufts Medical Center since 1979.  He holds the Louis Lasagna, M. D., Endowed Professorship in the Department of Integrative Physiology and Pathobiology at Tufts University School of Medicine, and is Director of the institution’s Clinical Pharmacology Group.  Dr. Greenblatt is a senior faculty member in the Graduate Program in Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics at the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts University. He also holds appointments as Professor of Psychiatry, Medicine, and Anesthesia, Tufts University School of Medicine.  He has previously served as Chair of the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics at Tufts University School of Medicine, Program Director and Associate Program Director of the institution’s Clinical/Translational Research Center (formerly the General Clinical Research Center), and Chair of the Institutional Review Board. He is Editor-in-Chief of Clinical Pharmacology in Drug Development, operated by the American College of Clinical Pharmacology.  He also is Co-Editor-in-Chief, with Dr. Richard I. Shader, of the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology.
A native of Newton, Massachusetts, Dr. Greenblatt is a Magna Cum Laude graduate of Amherst College (1966), where he was senior class president and co-captain of the varsity football team. After college he attended Harvard Medical School, graduating in 1970.  Thereafter he trained in internal medicine at the Montefiore Hospital, New York City (1970-1971), and on the Harvard Medical Service at Boston City Hospital (1971-1972).  Following a Fellowship in Clinical Pharmacology at Massachusetts General Hospital under the mentorship of Dr. Jan Koch-Weser (1972-1974), he stayed on to head the Clinical Pharmacology Unit at Mass. General from 1975 to 1979, at which time he moved to Tufts.
Dr. Greenblatt has been an active investigator in the area of molecular and clinical pharmacology going back to the late 1960s.  His PubMed listing includes more than 1000 publications; more than 760 of these represent original research reports.  His work has been supported by the National Institutes of Health for more than 35 years.
Dr. Greenblatt’s early research work had a focus on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and neuroreceptor properties of the benzodiazepine derivatives, including the influence of age, gender, and body habitus on drug disposition and response, and the molecular mechanisms and consequences of tolerance and withdrawal.  This work (with colleagues Richard I. Shader, Jerold S. Harmatz, Darrell R. Abernethy, and Lawrence G. Miller) had an important impact on clinical understanding of the properties of these drugs, their appropriate clinical use, and a realistic perspective on drawbacks and hazards.  In the 1990s, Dr. Greenblatt initiated one of the first research programs on in vitro drug metabolism and transport, along with colleagues Lisa L. von Moltke and Michael H. Court.  The group has made numerous contributions to understanding of the enzymatic and genetic determinants of metabolic activity of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) and glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) enzymes, including the application if in vitro models to identify and predict clinical drug-drug interactions.  Specific targets of the research have included the azole antifungal agents, the class of antiretroviral agents, and the serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor antidepressants.  In retrospect, many of the group’s previous studies on the clinical pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepine derivatives – such as triazolam and midazolam – fortuitously served as population-based studies of metabolic phenotypic activity of Cytochrome P450-3A.  In the last decade, Dr. Greenblatt and colleagues have addressed the problem of drug interactions involving nutrients and natural products (such as grapefruit juice), again focusing on a critical evaluation of the value of in vitro models in the prediction of such interactions.  Work is also ongoing on the pharmacokinetic properties of the benzodiazepine ligand zolpidem, widely used throughout the world as a sleep-inducing medication.  The focus is on the public health problem of adverse reactions to zolpidem, and whether women in general are at increased risk.
Dr. Greenblatt is Board Certified by the American Board of Clinical Pharmacology (1991), and is one of the charter members of that board.  He has been a member of the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics since the 1970s, and received the Rawls-Palmer Award from that organization in 1980. Likewise a member of the American College of Clinical Pharmacology (ACCP) since the 1970s, he was President of ACCP from 1996 to 1998, and received from that organization the McKeen-Cattell Award in 1985, the Distinguished Service Award in 2001, and the Distinguished Investigator Award in 2002.  He was the recipient of the 2005 Research Achievement Award in Clinical Sciences from the American Association of Pharmaceutical Sciences.  Dr. Greenblatt received an Outstanding Speaker Award from the American Association for Clinical Chemistry in 2013.  In 2015, he received the Distinguished Faculty Award from Tufts University School of Medicine.  Over the years, Dr. Greenblatt has served on many NIH study sections and advisory groups.
Dr. Greenblatt is active as a teacher and mentor at a local level.  He directs a number of required and elective didactic courses for medical, graduate (Ph. D.), and masters students, and teaches subjects such as pharmacokinetics, drug metabolism, pharmacogenomics, alternative medicines, and psychopharmacology.  He has served as postdoctoral training supervisor or dissertation supervisor for more than 30 trainees, most of whom have gone on to positions as university-based investigators or scientists in industry.

David and Jessalynn Greenblatt 





David and Jessalynn Greenblatt
South Tacoma Grocery Outlet
 
The Greenblatts started their road to becoming GO operators in 2009 through the “Home-grown” path. Home-grown refers to an employee that has worked his/her way through the company and chooses to become an Owner/Operator. David began working at the Redding, California store as a courtesy clerk at the age of 17. After working at the West Sacramento and Rancho Cordova stores, he moved to the Elk Grove location to be an assistant manager. This is where it became clear he wanted to make a career of Grocery Outlet.
 

He worked in a number of training stores and asked a lot of questions: How does the Aspiring Operator Training (AOT) program work? Would their age be an issue? How does the money work? David knew from his own experience that family was the biggest driver of all for the Operators he had worked for. And family was important to him and to his wife, Jessalynn.
 
Because the Greenblatts knew the model and understood how GO worked from the business side, they were able to complete the training program in five months. And as one of the youngest operators in the system, the Greenblatts have embraced the opportunities available to them as part of the Grocery Outlet family. Currently they successfully operate the South Tacoma location, but hope to one day return home and open a Grocery Outlet store in Northern California, closer to their family.
 

The Greenblatts’ advice to prospective GO operators?
“If you are a GO employee and want to operate your own store, hang in there,” said David. “Keep growing, ask your supervisors how you can do better. They will guide you through all of the things that will make you stand out as an aspiring operator.”
 

“Be prepared for long hours and hard work,” continued David. “There will be a lot of work you put into it, but you get what you put into it back many times over.”
