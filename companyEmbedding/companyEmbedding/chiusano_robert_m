Winnebago Industries Announces Appointment of Robert M. Chiusano as Chair of the Board of Directors


















Lawrence A. Erickson and Jerry N. Currie Announce Retirement from the Board of Directors Effective December 2016
FOREST CITY, IOWA, June 16, 2016 - Winnebago Industries, Inc. (NYSE:WGO), a leading United States recreation vehicle manufacturer, announced that Robert M. Chiusano was elected chair of the Company's board of directors effective June 15, 2016.  Mr. Chiusano will continue to serve as the chair of the Human Resources Committee until at least December of 2016.  Mr. Chiusano has been a member of the board of directors since October of 2008.  He assisted in the assembly of the Company’s strong management team, including the appointment of Michael Happe as president and chief executive officer in January 2016. Prior to joining Winnebago Industries board, Mr. Chiusano was the chief operating officer, Commercial Systems, for Rockwell Collins, Inc., a provider of communication and aviation electronic solutions for commercial and military applications.
At the June 15, 2016, board of directors meeting Larry Erickson stepped down as chair of the board of directors and informed the board of his intention to retire from the board at the conclusion of his current term in December of 2016. Mr. Erickson has served as chair since August 2015, lead independent director from December 2011 to August 2015, and as a director since January 2005. Jerry N. Currie, who has served on the Board of Directors since 1996, also announced his retirement at the end of his current term in December of 2016. 
The change in chair is part of a transition plan, with Mr. Erickson indicating he will assist Mr. Chiusano during his remaining months on the board.  Mr. Happe said, “I congratulate Mr. Erickson on his leadership over the last year and throughout his 11 year tenure as a director.  His steady guidance helped the company remain productive and focused during the recent transition in leadership.  I also want to thank Mr. Currie for his many years of service to the Company.  All of us here at Winnebago wish Larry and Jerry well in their coming retirement.  I am confident that Bob’s commitment to excellence, enthusiasm for our employees and customers, and knowledge of the company will be invaluable as we move forward together in the future.”
Mr. Erickson said, “I am proud to have been a part of Winnebago’s growth and evolution into a leading U.S. manufacturer of recreation vehicles. Our dedicated employees and management team have put the Company on a solid footing, and I am confident that Winnebago is well positioned for its next phase of growth and development. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed working with our board of directors, and I couldn’t be more pleased that Robert has stepped up to take on this new leadership role.”

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
