VantaCore - Advantage through Core Minerals

		VantaCore is a rapidly growing private company whose objective is to establish a national presence across the United States aggregates industry through a series of acquisitions.  Our acquisition strategy provides independent quarry operators the potential to monetize the value of their business while maintaining local identity, historic management and seller participation in the future growth of the business.  We also are interested in acquiring large aggregate and construction companies' non-core assets.
	

		Since inception in 2006, VantaCore has acquired seven companies supplying eight states including Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana.  We provide crushed stone, sand and gravel for the infrastructure, energy, commercial and residential markets in those states.

		Winn Materials and McIntosh Construction, acquired in 2007, are leading aggregate and asphalt companies located in Clarksville, Tennessee, 50 miles northwest of Nashville.  Southern Aggregates, the preeminent sand and gravel business in Baton Rouge and Lafayette, Louisiana, was acquired in 2008, providing VantaCore with geographic and product diversity.  In 2010, Southern acquired the local operations assets of LaFarge Aggregate Southeast, further increasing its Louisiana reserves position.  In 2011, Winn acquired an aggregates operation located in Southern Kentucky.  In June 2012, VantaCore acquired Laurel Aggregates.  Headquartered in Morgantown, West Virginia, 65 miles south of Pittsburgh, PA, Laurel is a leading regional provider of limestone aggregates serving the energy and construction industries in southeastern Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia, western Maryland and eastern Ohio.
