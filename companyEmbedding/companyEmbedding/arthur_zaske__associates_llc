Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

Insight 2811, Inc.


                  Insight 2811 (aka AZA) employs a variety of portfolio management strategies for including: DRIV Core; Core Equity & Options; Enhanced Income; and 4) Custom Bond Portfolios.DRIV Core is a tactical allocation, long-term growth strategy that seeks to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns comparable to the broad US stock market over full cycles but with less volatility and downside risk.  It focuses on varying the portfolio allocation between stock and bond investments over time and through different market conditions, based on AZA's analysis of valuations and projected returns.The Core Equity & Options strategy is an actively managed approach that generally holds 20 to 30 large-cap equities and may write longer duration covered call options and/or cash-secured put options. AZA's goals in using options are to increase cash flow, reduce volatility and manage net exposure to the underlying equities. Returns are primarily driven by capital appreciation, dividends, and/or option premiums. Returns are affected by stock and sector selection based on fundamental and technical analysis, dividends, spot and strike prices, time-to-expiration, implied volatilities, and interest rates.The Enhanced Income strategy focuses on current income as a primary objective, with capital appreciation as a secondary objective. This strategy surveys areas of the traditional bond market in addition to non-traditional, liquid sources of income such as MLPs, REITS, energy royalty trusts, convertible bonds, and preferred stock. It primarily relies on momentum analysis of several indexes associated with securities that pay high dividends and/or interest and some which pay very secure interest.AZA's custom bond portfolios offer customized solutions for a client’s income, duration and tax needs. Portfolios are comprised of a diversified mix of bonds, based on risk and income objectives. Municipal, corporate, or government bonds may be used; however in most instances AZA favors tax-free municipal bonds.
