According to the report Latin America Intrauterine Devices Market, published by Market Data Forecast, the market is projected to reach USD 301 million by 2021, at a CAGR of 4.8% from 2016 to 2021.
Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are contraceptive medical implants used to avert pregnancies for a long time period. The intrauterine contraceptive device is a safe, effective and convenient contraceptive method. Their use in less developed countries has been controlled due to increase in menstrual blood loss, a vital issue in populations with a high prevalence of anaemia.
The levonorgestrel releasing IUD (LNg IUD) is the first device that is highly effective, long-lasting and reduces the blood loss during menstruation. So, this device is accepted, most used in Latin America. This device will have a clear niche amid reversible contraceptives when available.

Prescription Medications



    


Nilutamide: Package Insert and Label InformationBy ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | Last revised: 12 July 2017
NILUTAMIDE- nilutamide tabletANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. DESCRIPTION Nilutamide Tablets contain nilutamide, a nonsteroidal, orally active antiandrogen having the chemical name 5,5-dimethyl-3-[4-nitro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-2,4-imidazolidinedione with the following structural formula:Nilutamide is a microcrystalline, white to practically white powder with a molecular weight of 317.25. Its molecular formula is C12 H10 F3 N3 O4 .




It is freely soluble in ethyl acetate, acetone, chloroform, ethyl alcohol, dichloromethane, and methanol. It is slightly soluble in water [<0.1% W/V at 25°C (77°F)]. It melts between 153°C and 156°C (307.4°F and 312.8°F).
Each Nilutamide Tablet contains 150 mg of nilutamide. The inactive ingredients in Nilutamide Tablets include:  calcium stearate, docusate sodium, lactose, povidone, corn starch, and talc.
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  Mechanism of Action 
Prostate cancer is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to androgen ablation. In animal studies, nilutamide has demonstrated antiandrogenic activity without other hormonal (estrogen, progesterone, mineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid) effects. In vitro , nilutamide blocks the effects of testosterone at the androgen receptor level. In vivo , nilutamide interacts with the androgen receptor and prevents the normal androgenic response.
 Pharmacokinetics 
 Absorption 
Analysis of blood, urine, and feces samples following a single oral 150-mg dose of [14 C]-nilutamide in patients with metastatic prostate cancer showed that the drug is rapidly and completely absorbed and that it yields high and persistent plasma concentrations.
 Distribution 
After absorption of the drug, there is a detectable distribution phase. There is moderate binding of the drug to plasma proteins and low binding to erythrocytes. The binding is nonsaturable except in the case of alpha-1-glycoprotein, which makes a minor contribution to the total concentration of proteins in the plasma. The results of binding studies do not indicate any effects that would cause nonlinear pharmacokinetics.
 Metabolism 
The results of a human metabolism study using 14 C-radiolabelled tablets show that nilutamide is extensively metabolized and less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in urine after 5 days. Five metabolites have been isolated from human urine. Two metabolites display an asymmetric center, due to oxidation of a methyl group, resulting in the formation of D- and L-isomers. One of the metabolites was shown, in vitro , to possess 25 to 50% of the pharmacological activity of the parent drug, and the D-isomer of the active metabolite showed equal or greater potency compared to the L-isomer. However, the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of the metabolites have not been fully investigated.
 Elimination 
The majority (62%) of orally administered [14 C]-nilutamide is eliminated in the urine during the first 120 hours after a single 150-mg dose. Fecal elimination is negligible, ranging from 1.4% to 7% of the dose after 4 to 5 days. Excretion of radioactivity in urine likely continues beyond 5 days. The mean elimination half-life of nilutamide determined in studies in which subjects received a single dose of 100 to 300 mg ranged from 38.0 to 59.1 hours with most values between 41 and 49 hours. The elimination of at least one metabolite is generally longer than that of unchanged nilutamide (59 to 126 hours). During multiple dosing of 150 mg nilutamide (given as 3 × 50 mg) twice a day, steady state was reached within 2 to 4 weeks for most patients, and mean steady state AUC0–12  was 110% higher than the AUC0–∞  obtained from the first 150 mg dose. These data and in vitro metabolism data suggest that, upon multiple dosing, metabolic enzyme inhibition may occur for this drug. 
 Clinical Studies 
Nilutamide through its antiandrogenic activity can complement surgical castration, which suppresses only testicular androgens. The effects of the combined therapy were studied in patients with previously untreated metastatic prostate cancer. 
In a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study that enrolled 457 patients (225 treated with orchiectomy and Nilutamide Tablets, 232 treated with orchiectomy and placebo), the Nilutamide Tablets group showed a statistically significant benefit in time to progression and time to death. The results are summarized below.

   INDICATIONS AND USAGE  Metastatic Prostate Cancer 
Nilutamide Tablets are indicated for use in combination with surgical castration for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (Stage D2 ).
For maximum benefit, treatment with Nilutamide Tablets must begin on the same day as or on the day after surgical castration.
CONTRAINDICATIONS Nilutamide Tablets are contraindicated:
 • in patients with severe hepatic impairment (baseline hepatic enzymes should be evaluated prior to treatment) • in patients with severe respiratory insufficiency • in patients with hypersensitivity to nilutamide or any component of this preparation. WARNINGS   Interstitial Pneumonitis  Interstitial pneumonitis has been reported in 2% of patients in controlled clinical trials in patients exposed to nilutamide. A small study in Japanese subjects showed that 8 of 47 patients (17%) developed interstitial pneumonitis. Reports of interstitial changes including pulmonary fibrosis that led to hospitalization and death have been reported rarely post-marketing. Symptoms included exertional dyspnea, cough, chest pain, and fever. X-rays showed interstitial or alveolo-interstitial changes, and pulmonary function tests revealed a restrictive pattern with decreased DLco. Most cases occurred within the first 3 months of treatment with Nilutamide Tablets, and most reversed with discontinuation of therapy. A routine chest X-ray should be performed prior to initiating treatment with Nilutamide Tablets. Baseline pulmonary function tests may be considered. Patients should be instructed to report any new or worsening shortness of breath that they experience while on Nilutamide Tablets. If symptoms occur,  Nilutamide Tablets should be immediately discontinued until it can be determined if the symptoms are drug related. 
   Hepatitis 
Rare cases of death or hospitalization due to severe liver injury have been reported post-marketing in association with the use of Nilutamide Tablets. Hepatotoxicity in these reports generally occurred within the first 3 to 4 months of treatment. Hepatitis or marked increases in liver enzymes leading to drug discontinuation occurred in 1% of Nilutamide Tablet patients in controlled clinical trials. 
Serum transaminase levels should be measured prior to starting treatment with Nilutamide Tablets, at regular intervals for the first 4 months of treatment, and periodically thereafter. Liver function tests should also be obtained at the first sign or symptom suggestive of liver dysfunction, e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, “flu-like” symptoms, dark urine, jaundice, or right upper quadrant tenderness. If at any time, a patient has jaundice, or their ALT rises above 2 times the upper limit of normal, Nilutamide Tablets should be immediately discontinued with close follow-up of liver function tests until resolution.
 Use in Women 
Nilutamide Tablets have no indication for women, and should not be used in this population, particularly for non-serious or non-life threatening conditions.
 Other 
Foreign post-marketing surveillance has revealed isolated cases of aplastic anemia in which a causal relationship with Nilutamide Tablets could not be ascertained.
PRECAUTIONS  General   Antiandrogen Withdrawal Syndrome 
Patients whose disease progresses while being treated with an antiandrogen may experience clinical improvement with discontinuation of the antiandrogen.
 Information for Patients 
Patients should be informed that Nilutamide Tablets should be started on the day of, or on the day after, surgical castration. They should also be informed that they should not interrupt their dosing of Nilutamide Tablets or stop taking this medication without consulting their physician.
Because of the possibility of interstitial pneumonitis, patients should also be told to report immediately any dyspnea or aggravation of pre-existing dyspnea.
Because of the possibility of hepatitis, patients should be told to consult with their physician should nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or jaundice occur.
Because of the possibility of an intolerance to alcohol (facial flushes, malaise, hypotension) following ingestion of Nilutamide Tablets, it is recommended that intake of alcoholic beverages be avoided by patients who experience this reaction. This effect has been reported in about 5% of patients treated with Nilutamide Tablets.
 In clinical trials, 13% to 57% of patients receiving Nilutamide Tablets reported a delay in adaptation to dark, ranging from seconds to a few minutes, when passing from a lighted area to a dark area. This effect sometimes does not abate as drug treatment is continued. Patients who experience this effect should be cautioned about driving at night or through tunnels. This effect can be alleviated by the wearing of tinted glasses. 
Drug Interactions  In vitro , nilutamide has been shown to inhibit the activity of liver cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes and, therefore, may reduce the metabolism of compounds requiring these systems.
Consequently, drugs with a low therapeutic margin, such as vitamin K antagonists, phenytoin, and theophylline, could have a delayed elimination and increases in their serum half-life leading to a toxic level. The dosage of these drugs or others with a similar metabolism may need to be modified if they are administered concomitantly with nilutamide. For example, when vitamin K antagonists are administered concomitantly with nilutamide, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored and, if necessary, the dosage of vitamin K antagonists should be reduced.
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  Administration of nilutamide to rats for 18 months at doses of 0, 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day produced benign Leydig cell tumors in 35% of the high-dose male rats (AUC exposures in high-dose rats were approximately 1 to 2 times human AUC exposures with therapeutic doses). The increased incidence of Leydig cell tumors is secondary to elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations resulting from loss of feedback inhibition at the pituitary. Elevated LH and testosterone concentrations are not observed in castrated men receiving Nilutamide Tablets. Nilutamide had no effect on the incidence, size, or time of onset of any spontaneous tumor in rats. 
Nilutamide displayed no mutagenic effects in a variety of in vitro and in vivo tests (Ames test, mouse micronucleus test, and two chromosomal aberration tests).
In reproduction studies in rats, nilutamide had no effect on the reproductive function of males and females, and no lethal, teratogenic, or growth-suppressive effects on fetuses were found. The maximal dose at which nilutamide did not affect reproductive function in either sex or have an effect on fetuses was estimated to be 45 mg/kg orally (AUC exposures in rats approximately 1 to 2 times human therapeutic AUC exposures).
Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with nilutamide. It is also not known whether nilutamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Nilutamide should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.
Pediatric Use  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been determined.
Animal Pharmacology and Toxicology   Administration of Nilutamide Tablets to beagle dogs resulted in drug-related deaths at dose levels that produce AUC exposures in dogs much lower than the AUC exposures of men receiving the therapeutic doses of 150 and 300 mg/day. Nilutamide-induced toxicity in dogs was cumulative with progressively lower doses producing death when given for longer durations. Nilutamide given to dogs at 60 mg/kg/day (1 to 2 times human AUC exposure) for 1 month produced 100% mortality. Administration of 20 and 30 mg/kg/day nilutamide (1/2 to 1 times human AUC exposure) for 6 months resulted in 20% and 70% mortality in treated dogs. Administration to dogs of 3, 6, and 12 mg/kg/day nilutamide (1/10 to 1/2 human AUC exposure) for 1 year resulted in 8%, 33%, and 50% mortality, respectively. A “no-effect level” for nilutamide-induced mortality in dogs was not identified.  Pathology data from the one-year oral toxicity study suggest that the deaths in dogs were secondary to liver toxicity. Marked-to-massive hepatocellular swelling and vacuolization were observed in affected dogs. Liver toxicity in dogs was not consistently associated with elevations of liver enzymes. 
Administration of nilutamide to rats at a dose level of 45 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure in rats 1 to 2 times human therapeutic AUC exposures) for 18 months increased the incidence of lung pathology (granulomatous inflammation and chronic alveolitis). 
The hepatic and pulmonary adverse effects observed in nilutamide-treated animals and men are similar to effects observed with another nitroaromatic compound, nitrofurantoin. Nilutamide and nitrofurantoin are both metabolized in vitro to nitroanion free-radicals by microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in the lungs and liver of rats and humans.

   The overall incidence of adverse experiences is 99.5% (208/209) for the Nilutamide Tablets group and 98.5% (199/202) for the placebo group.
Some frequently occurring adverse experiences, for example hot flushes, impotence, and decreased libido, are known to be associated with low serum androgen levels and known to occur with medical or surgical castration alone. Notable was the higher incidence of visual disturbances (variously described as impaired adaptation to darkness, abnormal vision, and colored vision), which led to treatment discontinuation in 1% to 2% of patients.
Interstitial pneumonitis occurred in one (<1%) patient receiving Nilutamide Tablets in combination with surgical castration and in seven patients (3%) receiving Nilutamide Tablets in combination with leuprolide and one patient receiving placebo in combination with leuprolide. Overall, it has been reported in 2% of patients receiving Nilutamide Tablets. This included a report of interstitial pneumonitis in 8 of 47 patients (17%) in a small study performed in Japan.
In addition, the following adverse experiences were reported in 2 to 5% of patients treated with Nilutamide Tablets in combination with leuprolide or orchiectomy. 
Body as a Whole: Malaise (2%).
Cardiovascular System: Angina (2%), heart failure (3%), syncope (2%).
Digestive System: Diarrhea (2%), gastrointestinal disorder (2%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (2%), melena (2%).
Metabolic and Nutritional System: Alcohol intolerance (5%), edema (2%), weight loss (2%).
Musculoskeletal System: Arthritis (2%).
Nervous System: Dry mouth (2%), nervousness (2%), paresthesia (3%).
Respiratory System: Cough increased (2%), interstitial lung disease (2%), lung disorder (4%), rhinitis (2%).
Skin and Appendages: Pruritus (2%).
Special Senses: Cataract (2%), photophobia (2%).
Laboratory Values: Haptoglobin increased (2%), leukopenia (3%), alkaline phosphatase increased (3%), BUN increased (2%), creatinine increased (2%), hyperglycemia (4%).

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q quarterly report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance, that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many important factors, including those set forth under "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (together, "ANI," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is an integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on delivering value to our customers by developing, manufacturing, and marketing high quality branded and generic prescription pharmaceuticals. We focus on niche and high barrier to entry opportunities including controlled substances, anti-cancer (oncolytics), hormones and steroids, and complex formulations. We have two pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities located in Baudette, Minnesota, which are capable of producing oral solid dose products, as well as liquids and topicals, controlled substances, and potent products that must be manufactured in a fully-contained environment.  Our strategy is to use our assets to develop, acquire, manufacture, and market branded and generic specialty prescription pharmaceuticals. By executing this strategy, we believe we will be able to continue to grow our business, expand and diversify our product portfolio, and create long-term value for our investors.  As of March 31, 2017, our products include both branded and generic pharmaceuticals, specifically:   Generic Products Branded Products Erythromycin Ethylsuccinate Cortenema Esterified Estrogen with Methyltestosterone Inderal LA Etodolac Inderal XL Fenofibrate InnoPran XL Flecainide Lithobid Fluvoxamine Reglan Hydrocortisone Enema Vancocin Hydrocortisone Rectal Cream (1% and 2.5%) Lithium Carbonate ER Mesalamine Enema Methazolamide Metoclopramide Syrup Nilutamide Nimodipine Opium Tincture Oxycodone Capsules Oxycodone Oral Solution Propafenone Propranolol ER Vancomycin  We consider a variety of criteria in determining which products to develop, all of which influence the level of competition upon product launch. These criteria include:  � Formulation Complexity. Our development and manufacturing capabilities enable us to manufacture pharmaceuticals that are difficult to produce, including highly potent, extended release, combination, and low dosage products. This ability to manufacture a variety of complex products is a competitive strength that we intend to leverage in selecting products to develop or manufacture.  � Patent Status. We seek to develop products whose branded bioequivalents do not have long-term patent protection or existing patent challenges.  � Market Size. When determining whether to develop or acquire an individual product, we review the current and expected market size for that product at launch, as well as forecasted price erosion upon conversion from branded to generic pricing. We endeavor to manufacture products with sufficient market size to enable us to enter the market with a strong likelihood of being able to price our product both competitively and at a profit.  � Profit Potential. We research the availability and cost of active pharmaceutical ingredients in determining which products to develop or acquire. In determining the potential profit of a product, we forecast our anticipated market share, pricing, including the expected price erosion caused by competition from other generic manufacturers, and the estimated cost to manufacture the products.  � Manufacturing. We generally seek to develop and manufacture products at our own manufacturing plants in order to maximize the capacity and utilization of our facilities, ensure quality control in our products, and maximize profit potential.  � Competition. When determining whether to develop or acquire a product, we research the existing and expected competition. We seek to develop products for which we can obtain a sufficient market share, and may decline to develop a product if we anticipate significant competition. Our specialized manufacturing facilities provide a means of entering niche markets, such as hormone therapies, in which fewer generic companies are able to compete.  Recent Developments  In February 2017, we acquired from Cranford Pharmaceuticals, LLC the distribution license, trademark and certain finished goods inventory for Inderal(R) XL for $20.2 million in cash. Inderal XL is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.  In February 2017, we acquired from Holmdel Pharmaceuticals, LP the NDA, trademark, and certain finished goods inventory for InnoPran XL(R), including a license to an Orange Book listed patent, for $30.6 million in cash. InnoPran XL is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.  GENERAL The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated: (in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Net revenues $ 36,628 $ 20,555 Operating expenses Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 16,386 3,410 Research and development 1,618 966 Selling, general, and administrative 7,293 5,904 Depreciation and amortization 6,706 4,609 Operating income 4,625 5,666 Interest expense, net (2,932 ) (2,782 ) Other (expense)/income, net (18 ) 2 Income before provision for income taxes 1,675 2,886 Provision for income taxes (523 ) (1,540 ) Net income $ 1,152 $ 1,346  The following table sets forth, for all periods indicated, items in our unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net revenues:   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Net revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % Operating expenses Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 44.7 % 16.6 % Research and development 4.4 % 4.7 % Selling, general, and administrative 19.9 % 28.7 % Depreciation and amortization 18.3 % 22.4 % Operating income 12.7 % 27.6 % Interest expense, net (8.1 )% (13.6 )% Other (expense)/income, net - % - % Income before provision for income taxes 4.6 % 14.0 % Provision for income taxes (1.4 )% (7.5 )% Net income 3.2 % 6.5 %  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016 Net Revenues (in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change % Change Generic pharmaceutical products $ 26,572 $ 13,252 $ 13,320 100.5 % Branded pharmaceutical products 8,039 5,596 2,443 43.7 % Contract manufacturing 1,793 1,384 409 29.6 % Contract services and other income 224 323 (99 ) (30.7 )% Total net revenues $ 36,628 $ 20,555 $ 16,073 78.2 %  We derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of generic and branded pharmaceutical products, contract manufacturing, and contract services, which include product development services, laboratory services, and royalties on net sales of certain products.  Net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $36.6 million compared to $20.6 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of $16.1 million, or 78.2%, primarily as a result of the following factors:  � Net revenues for generic pharmaceutical products were $26.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 100.5% compared to $13.3 million for the same period in 2016. The primary reason for the increase was sales of Propranolol ER and other products launched in the second quarter of 2016, as well as sales of Nilutamide and Erythromycin Ethylsuccinate, both of which were launched in the third quarter of 2016. These increases were tempered by volume decreases in Esterified Estrogen with Methyltestosterone ("EEMT") sales.  As described in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies,in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q quarterly report, we market EEMT and Opium Tincture without Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approved New Drug Applications ("NDAs"). The FDA's policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products appears in the FDA's September 2011 Compliance Policy Guide Sec. 440.100 titled "Marketed New Drugs without Approved NDAs or Abbreviated New Drug Applications ("ANDAs")." Under this policy, the FDA has stated that it will follow a risk-based approach with regard to enforcement against marketing of unapproved products. The FDA evaluates whether to initiate enforcement action on a case-by-case basis, but gives higher priority to enforcement action against products in certain categories, such as those with potential safety risks or that lack evidence of effectiveness. While we believe that, so long as we comply with applicable manufacturing standards, the FDA will not take action against us under the current enforcement policy, we can offer no assurances that the FDA will continue this policy or not take a contrary position with any individual product or group of products. Our combined net revenues for these products for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $6.2 million and $9.0 million, respectively.  � Net revenues for branded pharmaceutical products were $8.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 43.7% compared to $5.6 million for the same period in 2016. The primary reason for the increase was sales of Inderal LA, which was launched in the second quarter of 2016, as well as sales of Inderal XL and InnoPran XL, both of which were launched in first quarter of 2017. The increase was partially offset by decreased unit sales for Lithobid and Vancocin. We experience periodic larger orders for our Vancocin product that relate to clinical trials. Such orders constituted $2.4 million of our branded pharmaceutical product revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2016. We had no such orders in the three months ended March 31, 2017, and we cannot be sure that such purchases will occur in future periods.  � Contract manufacturing revenues were $1.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 29.6% compared to $1.4 million for the same period in 2016, due to timing of orders from contract manufacturing customers in the period. As described in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q quarterly report, we contract manufacture a group of products on behalf of a customer that are marketed by that customer without an FDA-approved NDA. If the FDA took enforcement action against such customer, the customer may be required to seek FDA approval for the group of products or withdraw them from the market. Our contract manufacturing revenues for the group of unapproved products for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively.  � Contract services and other income were $0.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of 30.7% from $0.3 million for the same period in 2016, due primarily to the lack of royalties related to sales of Fenofibrate, the authorized generic of Lipofen(R), the marketing and distribution rights to which we acquired in January 2016. We launched Fenofibrate under our own label in the second quarter of 2016.  As described in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q quarterly report, we receive royalties on the net sales of a group of contract-manufactured products, which are marketed by the customer without an FDA-approved NDA. If the FDA took enforcement action against such customer, the customer may be required to seek FDA approval for the group of products or withdraw them from the market. Our royalties on the net sales of these unapproved products were less than 1% of total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.  Cost of Sales (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization) (in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change % Change Cost of sales (excl. depreciation and amortization) $ 16,386 $ 3,410 $ 12,976 380.5 %  Cost of sales consists of direct labor, including manufacturing and packaging, active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients, freight costs, packaging components, and royalties related to profit-sharing arrangements. Cost of sales does not include depreciation and amortization expense, which is reported as a separate component of operating expenses on our unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of earnings.  For the three months ended March 31, 2017, cost of sales increased to $16.4 million from $3.4 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of $13.0 million or 380.5%, primarily as a result of increased sales of products subject to profit-sharing arrangements, as well as increased volumes and the impact on cost of sales of the excess of fair value over cost for Inderal XL and InnoPran XL inventory acquired during the first three months of 2017 through asset acquisition transactions, and subsequently sold during the period. Cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues increased to 44.7% during the three months ended March 31, 2017, from 16.6% during same period in 2016, primarily as a result of increased sales of products subject to profit-sharing arrangements, a trend we expect to continue, and the $1.5 million net impact on cost of sales (4.2% as a percent of net revenues) of the excess of fair value over cost for Inderal XL, InnoPran XL, and Inderal LA inventory sold during the period, a trend which will continue until such time that the inventory as components of the Inderal XL, InnoPran XL, and Inderal LA asset purchases are consumed.  We source the raw materials for our products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients ("API"), from both domestic and international suppliers. Generally, only a single source of API is qualified for use in each product due to the cost and time required to validate a second source of supply. Changes in API suppliers usually must be approved by the FDA, which can take 18 months or longer. As a result, we are dependent upon our current vendors to reliably supply the API required for ongoing product manufacturing. In addition, certain of our API for our drug products, including those that are marketed without approved NDAs or ANDAs, are sourced from international suppliers. From time to time, we have experienced temporary disruptions in the supply of certain of such imported APIs due to FDA inspections.  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we purchased 33% of our inventory (exclusive of inventory acquired in asset purchases as described in Note 12, Fair Value Disclosures, in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q quarterly report) from two suppliers. As of March 31, 2017, the amounts payable to these suppliers were immaterial. In the three months ended March 31, 2016, we purchased approximately 50% of our inventory from three suppliers.  In order to manufacture Opium Tincture, Oxycodone capsules, and Oxycodone oral solution, we must receive approval from the Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA") for a quota to purchase the amount of opium and oxycodone needed to manufacture the respective products. Without approved quotas from the DEA, we would not be able to purchase these ingredients from our suppliers. As a result, we are dependent upon the DEA to annually approve a sufficient quota of API to support our continued manufacture of Opium Tincture, Oxycodone capsules, and Oxycodone oral solution.  Other Operating Expenses (in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change % Change Research and development $ 1,618 $ 966 $ 652 67.5 % Selling, general, and administrative 7,293 5,904 1,389 23.5 % Depreciation and amortization 6,706 4,609 2,097 45.5 % Total other operating expenses $ 15,617 $ 11,479 $ 4,138 36.0 %  Other operating expenses consist of research and development costs, selling, general, and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization.  For the three months ended March 31, 2017, other operating expenses increased to $15.6 million from $11.5 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of $4.1 million, or 36.0%, primarily as a result of the following factors:  � Research and development expenses increased from $1.0 million to $1.6 million, an increase of 67.5%, due to timing of work on development projects, primarily the Corticotropin re-commercialization project. Current projects also include work on the ANDAs purchased in 2014 and 2015, as well as collaborations with partners. We anticipate that research and development costs will continue to be greater in 2017 than in 2016, in support of our strategy to expand our product portfolio and as we continue to focus on the development of our Corticotropin products.  � Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased from $5.9 million to $7.3 million, an increase of 23.5%, primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense, increases in personnel and related costs, and $0.5 million of expenses related to a proposed transaction that we ultimately decided not to pursue further. We anticipate that selling, general, and administrative expenses will continue to be greater in 2017 than in 2016 as we support anticipated additional revenue growth.  � Depreciation and amortization increased from $4.6 million to $6.7 million, an increase of 45.5%, due primarily to the amortization of the rights, title, and interest in the NDA for Inderal LA, which was acquired in April 2016, the amortization of the distribution license and trademark for Inderal XL, which was acquired in February 2017, and the amortization of the product rights for InnoPran XL, which was acquired in February 2017. We anticipate that depreciation and amortization expense will continue to be greater in 2017 than in 2016 as a result of our first quarter 2017 asset purchases.  Other Expense, net (in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change % Change Interest expense, net $ (2,932 ) $ (2,782 ) $ (150 ) 5.4 % Other (expense)/income, net (18 ) 2 (20 ) NM (1) Total other expense $ (2,950 ) $ (2,780 ) $ (170 ) 6.1 %  (1) Not Meaningful  For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recognized other expense of $3.0 million versus other expense of $2.8 million for the same period in 2016, a change of $0.2 million. Interest expense, net for both periods consists primarily of interest expense on our convertible debt. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, there was $0.1 million and $46 thousand of interest capitalized into construction in progress, respectively.  Provision for Income Taxes  (in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change % Change Provision for income taxes $ (523) $ (1,540) $ 1,017 (66.0)%  Our provision for income taxes consists of current and deferred components, which include changes in our deferred tax assets, our deferred tax liabilities, and our valuation allowance.  For interim periods, we recognize an income tax provision/(benefit) based on our estimated annual effective tax rate expected for the entire year plus the effects of certain discrete items occurring in the quarter. The interim annual estimated effective tax rate is based on the statutory tax rates then in effect, as adjusted for estimated changes in temporary and estimated permanent differences, and excludes certain discrete items whose tax effect is recognized in the interim period in which they occur. These changes in temporary differences, permanent differences, and discrete items result in variances to the effective tax rate from period to period. We also have elected to exclude the impacts from significant pre-tax non-recognized subsequent events from our interim estimated annual effective rate until the period in which they occur. Our estimated annual effective tax rate changes throughout the year as our on-going estimates of pre-tax income, changes in temporary differences, and permanent differences are revised, and as discrete items occur.  For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recognized income tax expense of $0.5 million, versus $1.5 million for the same period in 2016, a decrease of $1.0 million. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was 31.2% of pre-tax income reported in the period, calculated based on the estimated annual effective rate anticipated for the year ending December 31, 2017 plus the effects of certain discrete items occurring in the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was impacted primarily by the Domestic Production Activities Deduction, as well as the discrete impact of current period awards of stock-based compensation, stock option exercises, and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options, all of which impact the consolidated effective rate in the period in which they occur.  The 53.4% effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was primarily driven by permanent differences related to our international tax structure surrounding our Corticotropin NDAs, which resulted in significant non-deductible amortization and interest expense in 2016. We expect that our effective tax rate for 2017 may continue to be lower than in 2016 as a result of the dissolution of the international tax structure surrounding our Corticotropin NDAs.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table highlights selected liquidity and working capital information from our balance sheets: (in thousands) March 31, December 31, 2017 2016 Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,826 $ 27,365 Accounts receivable, net 46,697 45,895 Inventories, net 45,893 26,183 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 3,565 3,564 Total current assets $ 106,981 $ 103,007 Accounts payable $ 4,785 $ 3,389 Accrued expenses and other 2,549 927 Accrued royalties 10,331 11,956 Accrued compensation and related expenses 673 1,631 Current income taxes payable 3,656 2,398 Accrued government rebates 4,655 5,891 Returned goods reserve 5,776 5,756 Total current liabilities $ 32,425 $ 31,948  At March 31, 2017, we had $10.8 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2016, we had $27.4 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. We generated $6.5 million of cash from operations in the three months ended March 31, 2017. In February 2017, we purchased from Cranford Pharmaceuticals, LLC a distribution license, trademark and certain finished goods inventory for Inderal XL for $20.2 million in cash. We made the $20.2 million cash payment using cash on hand. In February 2017, we purchased from Holmdel Pharmaceuticals, LP the NDA, trademark, and certain finished goods inventory for InnoPran XL, including a license to an Orange Book listed patent, for $30.6 million in cash. We made the $30.6 million cash payment using $30.0 million of funds from our Line of Credit and $0.6 million of cash on hand.  In May 2016, we entered into a credit arrangement (the "Line of Credit") with Citizens Bank Capital, a division of Citizens Asset Finance, Inc. that provided for a $30.0 million asset-based revolving credit loan facility. In February 2017, we implemented the accordion feature and increased the Line of Credit to $40.0 million. As of March 31, 2017, we had a $30.0 million outstanding balance on the Line of Credit, and our available borrowing base was $10.0 million.  We are focused on expanding our business and product pipeline through collaborations, and also through acquisitions of products and companies. We are continually evaluating potential asset acquisitions and business combinations. To finance such acquisitions, we might raise additional equity capital, incur additional debt, or both.  . . .

Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

America’s biopharmaceutical companies are driving the future of medicine through bold advances in genomics, personalized medicine and immunotherapy. The new era of genomics provides better understanding of the genes that can cause certain diseases and equips researchers with the tools they need to tailor treatments like never before. Personalized medicines are at the center of this revolution, offering patients individualized therapies unique to each patient. Immunotherapy is transforming cancer care in new ways by harnessing the patient’s immune system to eliminate the disease or slow its growth. Together, these advancements are helping patients live longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

Personalized Medicine
Personalized medicine — sometimes referred to as precision or individualized medicine —is an emerging field of medicine that uses diagnostic tools to identify specific biological markers, often genetic, to help assess which medical treatments and procedures will be best for each patient.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
