Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. All returns shown are total returns that assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns for periods under a year are cumulative, all others are average annual returns. Investment returns and principal will fluctuate with market and economic conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. From time to time the Fund’s advisor may waive fees or reimbursed expenses, without which performance would have been lower. Please call 866-290-2688 for most recent month-end performance. 
Performance shown prior to a share class’s inception date reflects the historical performance of the Fund’s Class I shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of the Class N or Class R6 shares, respectively.



The Gross Expense Ratio includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.


The Net Expense Ratio per the Fund’s latest Prospectus. For the Diversified Arbitrage Fund and the Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, the Net Expense Ratio includes expenses related to short sales and interest on any borrowings.


The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to maintain the total annual Fund operating expenses at the stated levels. These expense caps are exclusive of expenses that may apply to some of the Funds, such as acquired fund fees, expenses related to short sales and borrowing costs, and extraordinary expenses. See the Prospectus for additional details. 

The expense caps are guaranteed until the following dates: Diversified Arbitrage Fund, Equity Market Neutral Fund, Global Macro Fund, Long/Short Equity Fund, Managed Futures Strategy Fund, Managed Futures Strategy HV Fund, Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy Fund, Risk Parity Fund, Risk Parity II MV Fund, Risk Parity II HV Fund, Style Premia Alternative Fund LV and Style Premia Alternative Fund: April 30, 2018

Defensive Style Funds, Momentum Style Funds, Multi-Style Funds, International Equity Fund, Global Equity Fund and Relaxed Constraint Equity Funds: January 28, 2018

Investment Approach








Risk parity is all about diversification. Whereas traditional portfolios focus on dollar-based allocation, risk parity portfolios focus on risk-based allocation.
AQR's Risk Parity Fund invests globally across stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky.
In building the portfolio, we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term.
We target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes, but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments, or “tilts,” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive.
We believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner, and adapting to market conditions, the Fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches.






AQR Risk Parity Fund:  Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. This fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. When investing in bonds, yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. There is also a chance that some of the fund’s holdings may have their credit rating downgraded or may default. Actual or realized volatility can and will differ from the forecasted or target volatility described above.

60/40 Portfolio benchmark consists of 60% S&P 500 Index / 40% Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index. The S&P 500 Index is a market value weighted index consisting of 500 stocks chosen for market size, liquidity, and industry grouping, and is meant to reflect the risk/return characteristics of the large cap universe. The Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index is a broad-based index used to represent investment grade bonds being traded in the United States.


AQR Risk Parity Fund:  Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. This fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. When investing in bonds, yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. There is also a chance that some of the fund’s holdings may have their credit rating downgraded or may default. Actual or realized volatility can and will differ from the forecasted or target volatility described above.

Investment Approach








Risk parity is all about diversification. Whereas traditional portfolios focus on dollar-based allocation, risk parity portfolios focus on risk-based allocation.
AQR's Risk Parity Fund invests globally across stocks, bonds, currencies  and commodities, allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky.
In building the portfolio, we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term.
We target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes, but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments, or “tilts,” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive.
We believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner, and adapting to market conditions, the Fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches.

Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. When investing in bonds, yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. There is also a chance that some of the fund’s holdings may have their credit rating downgraded or may default. Actual or realized volatility can and will differ from the forecasted or target volatility described above.

An investment in any of the AQR Funds involves risk, including loss of principal. The value of the Funds’ portfolio holdings may fluctuate in response to events specific to the companies in which the Fund invests, as well as economic, political or social events in the United States or abroad. Please refer to the prospectus for complete information regarding all risks associated with the Funds. An investor considering the Funds should be able to tolerate potentially wide price fluctuations. The Funds are subject to high portfolio turnover risk as a result of frequent trading, and thus, will incur a higher level of brokerage fees and commissions, and cause a higher level of tax liability to shareholders in the Funds. The Funds may attempt to increase its income or total return through the use of securities lending, and they may be subject to the possibility of additional loss as a result of this investment technique.

A collection of definitions related to investing.



















Absolute Return



A category of investment strategies that seek to generate returns that are uncorrelated to stock and bond markets. It is sometimes used as a synonym for hedge funds, but while some hedge fund strategies qualify—such as Equity Market Neutral and Global Macro—many hedge funds have tended to incorporate passive market exposure into their portfolios.


Tags:



Total Return, Traditional Investment







Active Management



                            Any investment approach other than one aiming to match the performance of a passive benchmark index, or a buy-and-hold portfolio. Examples of active management strategies include long-only strategies aiming to beat a benchmark, long/short absolute return strategies, and indeed any strategy that deviates from market-cap weighted indices. The precise boundary between passive and active management may be debatable for multi-asset class portfolios, where the true "market" may not be known or investable.



Tags:



Passive Management, Alpha, Beta, Benchmark, Index







Alpha




From a statistics perspective: An unexplained average return.
From an industry perspective: Returns generated by skilled active managers. For a benchmark-oriented strategy, alpha is measured by portfolio returns in excess of benchmark returns.
More broadly: Returns that cannot be explained by exposure to common risk factors, and may stem from a variety of sources, including security selection, market timing, portfolio management, execution or risk control.





Tags:



Active Management, Passive Management, Beta, Benchmark







Alternative Beta



                            Exposures to alternative risk factors. Alternative risk factors are well-known, empirically-tested, sources of return that can be systematically harvested through dynamic long/short strategies. They can be thought of either as returns that underlie “classic” hedge fund strategies (hedge fund risk premia) or the returns from “classic” styles (style premia), such as value, momentum, carry and defensive. Exposure to these risk factors results in alternative risk premia, or rewards for assuming active, systematic risk (risk that in the context of modern portfolio theory cannot be diversified away).

Alternative Risk Premia, Beta, Risk Premia, Market Risk Premia







Alternative Investment



                            Alternatives are typically thought of as investments other than long-only stocks and bonds. Generally they can be divided into two categories: alternative asset classes, such as private equity and commodities; and alternative strategies, such as classic styles or hedge fund investments. Alternative asset classes are usually long-only and benchmark-oriented, while alternative strategies are commonly long/short and compared to their peers or a cash benchmark.

Alternative Risk Premia



The rewards for bearing alternative risk exposure, or the rewards for assuming active, systematic risks (risks that in the context of modern portfolio theory cannot be diversified away). Alternative risk exposures are well-known, empirically-tested, sources of return that can be systematically harvested through dynamic long/short strategies. They can be thought of either as returns that underlie “classic” hedge fund strategies (hedge fund risk premia) or the returns from “classic” styles (style premia), such as value, momentum, carry and defensive.

Asset Class



                            A group of securities that share financial characteristics, and tend to behave similarly. Traditional asset classes include stocks and bonds, and alternative asset classes include private equity and commodities.

Benchmark



A pre-defined portfolio, index or strategy against which the performance of an active strategy is compared, or which a passive strategy seeks to match. For an active long-only strategy, the benchmark is often a market index with similar risk characteristics to the active strategy. For an absolute return strategy, the benchmark is usually the risk-free rate.

Beta





Statistics: A measure of one "dependent" variable’s sensitivity to another "independent" variable, often the equity market. Beta (the regression slope coefficient) is the product of the relative volatility of the dependent and independent variables and the correlation between the two. 
More practical: A security (or strategy’s) sensitivity to a particular risk factor. For example, an equity index fund’s beta to the equity market will likely be 1.0. A twice-levered equity index fund’s beta to the equity market will likely be about 2.0.

Capital Allocation



                            Making portfolio allocation decisions based on nominal or dollar values. Investors who make decisions based on dollars may build portfolios with concentrated risk exposures. For example, the traditional 60/40 stock/bond portfolio is roughly 90% dominated by equity risk. As such, investors should look beyond capital-based asset allocation to better understand a portfolio’s true risk exposures.

Capital Asset Pricing Model



                            A model that describes the pricing of risky assets. It relates a stock's expected return only to its beta, or sensitivity to the overall stock market.

Carry



                            A style premia strategy that seeks to capture the tendency of higher-yielding assets to provide higher returns than lower-yielding assets. Generally, carry can be thought of as the expected return on an asset assuming its price doesn’t change, and is derived from yield or income.

Convertible Arbitrage



                            A “classic” hedge fund strategy that generally buys a convertible bond and short-sells the relevant stock. It aims to capture the discount (illiquidity premium) of convertible bonds relative to the fair value of their constituent parts (bond + equity call option). It may also hedge out other risks, such as changing interest rates or the bond’s creditworthiness.
                        


Tags:

Correlation




Statistics: A measure of how variables — such as securities prices, interest rates or volatilities — move in relation with another, taking a value between -1 and +1. Positive correlation implies that as one price moves, either up or down, the other price tends to move in the same direction. Negative correlation means that when one price moves, the other price tends to move in the opposite direction. If the correlation is zero, the movements in the two prices (or other variables) have no detectable relationship.
More practical: Correlation is an important consideration for portfolio construction and diversification. A combination of unrelated (or uncorrelated) assets can results in higher risk-adjusted returns. Conversely, incorporating an asset that is highly correlated to the existing portfolio does little to improve a portfolio’s efficiency.

Dedicated Short Bias



                            A “classic” hedge fund strategy that generally maintains net short equity exposure. It profits from the inability for many investors to go short companies that are overpriced relative to their fundamentals.
                        


Tags:

Defensive



                            A style premia strategy that aims to invest in assets with lower risk and higher quality in order to generate higher risk-adjusted returns.

Discretionary Investing



An investment philosophy in which the manager makes a subjective judgment call on market conditions and then trades based on these opinions. This is in contrast to a quantitative approach.

Quantitative Investing







Diversification



                            Diversification can be achieved along many dimensions, such as by geography, asset class, risk factor, strategy style, or indicator. The goal of diversification is to eliminate systematic (or market risks), which are typically not rewarded. When the focus is on the diversification of specific risks, diversification means reducing exposure to specific risks that are undesirable because they are unrewarded. When the focus is on the diversification of systematic risks, it means efficient allocation to factors that bring positive, long-term rewards. Diversification has famously been called the only free lunch that markets have to offer in that a combination of uncorrelated strategies can result in higher risk-adjusted returns.

Efficient Frontier



                            A concept in modern portfolio theory that describes the highest expected returns available for a given volatility, under a no-leverage constraint.

Efficient Market Hypothesis



                            The hypothesis that security prices fully reflect all available information. In practice, the EMH cannot be tested directly independent of a pricing model; to determine if security prices fully reflect all available information, a model that explains how prices are supposed to reflect this information must also be proposed.

Equity Market Neutral



                            A “classic” hedge fund strategy that generally maintains neutral equity market exposure. It aims to capture systematic mispricing in global equity markets, typically between different stocks in the same sector.

Event-Driven Arbitrage



                            A "classic" hedge fund arbitrage strategy that seeks to exploit pricing inefficiencies that may occur before or after corporate events such as bankruptcies, mergers, acquisitions or spinoffs.

Excess Return



                            Strictly speaking (and especially for absolute return strategies) this is the return in excess of a pre-defined “risk-free” rate, typically the return on Treasury Bills or other sovereign cash instruments. For long-only strategies, it may refer to the return in excess of a benchmark; this is also called the active return.





Factor Investing



                            An investment strategy based on the assumption that there are sources of risk that compensate investors with returns. Traditionally, the primary factor is the market (as in the well-known three-factor model of Fama and French), while other factors may be value or momentum. Portfolios can be formed based on single factors (i.e., equity value) or multiple factors (i.e., equity value and equity momentum). Where factors have low correlations to each other, combining multiple factors can be a powerful investment tool offering improved risk-adjusted returns.

Fixed Income Arbitrage



                            A “classic” hedge fund strategy that aims to capture a range of mispricings in global bond and currency markets, including those created by market participants who are not profit-maximizing.

Global Macro



                            A “classic” hedge fund strategy that trades based on movements in economic variables. It aims to capture mispricings across major global asset classes, including stock, bond, currency and commodity markets.

Hedge Fund



                            A commingled investment vehicle that typically uses active strategies employing leverage, short-selling and/or derivatives in an attempt to provide positive returns regardless of moves in broad stock or bond markets. Hedge funds are usually subject to lighter regulation than other investment funds, and marketed to more sophisticated investors.
                        




Index



                            A weighted “basket” of securities — stocks, bonds, commodities or other tradable assets — used to track the performance of a particular market. Construction varies from index to index, with “capitalization-weighted indices” being among the most popular (e.g., S&P 500). Others include price-weighted indices (e.g., Dow Jones Industrial Average), indices weighted according to fundamental measures (e.g., fundamental indices), and ones that are weighted according to risk measures (e.g., MSCI Minimum Volatility Index).

Information Ratio



                            A measure of a portfolio's risk-adjusted returns relative to a benchmark. It is typically used for a long-only strategy and measures 'alpha' (active return over a benchmark) per unit of tracking error (how much active risk the strategy takes relative to its benchmark).

Long/Short Equity



                            A “classic” hedge fund strategy that maintains long and short positions in equity markets. It pursues a range of opportunities in global stock markets, including relative value between sectors and growth-based stockpicking.

Long-Only



                            Any investment strategy that does not involve short-selling of securities or of derivatives. The returns of long-only strategies are usually highly correlated to the broader markets from which they select their investments. Their performance is often (but not always) measured relative to a market benchmark.



Tags:



Long-Short, Market Neutral







Long-Short



Any investment strategy that takes both long and short positions in securities or derivatives, usually in an attempt to reduce exposure to broad market moves. Long-short strategies may have a directional bias and are not necessarily managed to be market-neutral.

Long-Only, Market Neutral







Managed Futures



                            A “classic” hedge fund strategy that invests long or short in futures contracts on a variety of commodities, as well as financial futures on equity indices, Treasuries and currencies. It profits from the tendency of assets to exhibit short-and long-term trends.

Market Neutral



                            A type of long-short strategy that sizes its long and short positions in an effort to minimize or eliminate exposure to broad market moves. Market neutral strategies can be particularly valuable diversifiers alongside portfolios dominated by market directional risks.

Market Risk Premia



                            The rewards for bearing asset class risk exposure. An example includes the equity risk premium for investing in stock markets.

Minimum Variance



                            Used to describe the portfolio with the lowest variance (or volatility squared), given a universe of securities. For example, the minimum variance portfolio for stocks in the S&P 500 would be the portfolio of stocks in the S&P that results in the lowest overall portfolio variance. From the standpoint of the Efficient Frontier, the minimum variance portfolio is represented by the left-most point on the curve.

Modern Portfolio Theory



                            A theory of how to build a portfolio that maximizes expected return given a level of volatility or that minimizes volatility for a given level of expected return. This can be done by varying the weights given to various assets taking into account estimates of their expected returns and volatilities, and the correlations between them.

Momentum



                            A style premia strategy that aims to take advantage of the tendency for an asset's recent relative performance to continue in the near future.

Mutual Fund



                            A commingled open-ended investment vehicle that is typically regulated and accessible to the general public, either directly or through registered investment advisors. Mutual funds may invest in stocks, bonds or other securities, cash, or alternative investments.
                        




Net Asset Value



                            The total value of an investment vehicle’s assets less the value of its liabilities. Changes in NAV may be caused by investment returns or by investor flows. The NAV per share reflects the value of each unit of investment. The net return on an investment at redemption is approximately the change in NAV per share less fees.
                        




Passive Management



                            An investment approach aiming to match the performance of a passive benchmark index or portfolio, without making use of return forecasts. This is in contrast to active management. Strictly speaking, only a capitalization-weighted buy-and-hold portfolio is passive, since all other portfolios—including “smart beta” indices—involve tilts away from the market portfolio and require active rebalancing.

Quantitative Investing



An investment philosophy in which systematic model- or rule-based criteria are used to make investment decisions. This is in contrast to a discretionary approach.


Tags:



Discretionary Investing







Risk Allocation



                            Making portfolio allocation decisions based on risk units, rather than nominal or capital dollars. Investors tend to achieve a better balanced portfolio if they make allocations in volatility (or risk) units, not dollars.

Risk Premia



                            The rewards for taking risk in given strategies or asset classes. Examples include long-only market risk premia and long/short alternative risk premia.

Sharpe Ratio



1. Mathematically: the annualized return in excess of cash (total return − risk-free return) divided by the annualized standard deviation (or volatility) of returns.
2. More practical: A measure of a portfolio’s risk-adjusted performance. In general, the higher the Sharpe ratio, the more an investor should be compensated for bearing risk. Though the Sharpe Ratio does not reflect all kinds of risks. For example, it does not describe how or when losses occurred, nor does it provide information on the liquidity of the underlying investment.

Information Ratio







Style Premia



                            A source of alternative return backed by economic theory and decades of data across geographies and asset groups. Style exposure can be achieved in a long-only portfolio, by over-weighting securities with positive style attributes (e.g., value stocks). However, a market-neutral long/short portfolio seeks to provide more active and efficient style exposure while maintaining low correlation to traditional markets.

Traditional Investment

Trend-Following



                            A style premia strategy that is related to momentum and involves buying assets that have recently performed well and shorting assets that have recently lost money. It differs from momentum investing in that momentum buys assets that have done well relative to their peers, while trend-following considers each asset independently. As a result, trend-following strategies can at times take highly market directional positions.

Value



                            A style premia strategy that aims to take advantage of the tendency for relatively cheap assets to outperform relatively expensive ones.

Volatility




Statistically: A measure of the variation in returns for a given investment. Volatility is the same as standard deviation, and is typically shown as an annualized number over time.
More practical: Volatility can be used to gauge the likelihood of realizing (or failing to realize) a given return target. It allows us to better assess how realized returns can vary around expected returns.
Other applications: Can be used to effectively manage risk through volatility targeting.

Volatility Targeting







Volatility Targeting



                            A method to effectively manage risk. Because volatility can be reasonably well predicted over short horizons, it can be a useful risk management input. A volatility-targeted portfolio invests fewer dollars when markets are more volatile and more dollars when markets are less volatile. The goal is to achieve more consistent portfolio risk, regardless of market volatility, which may provide investors a ‘smoother ride.’ A volatility-targeted portfolio must be actively managed because the volatility forecast changes over time.

Volatility







Beta



                            1. Statistics: A measure of one variable’s sensitivity to another variable, usually equity risk.  It is similar to correlation, but is not constrained to the range of –1 to +1. An asset’s equity market beta (the regression slope) is the product of the relative volatility of the asset versus equity market and the correlation between the two.
                        


Tags:



Absolute Return, Total Return







Total Return




The total return of an investment including the price change and yield income/carry.
A category of investment strategies that are generally flexible with regard to market exposure. These include many tactical asset allocation funds and Risk Parity, which are typically long-biased, but which can vary their exposure to underlying markets based on market conditions.

Investment Approach








                The Fund invests in individual equities and equity-related instruments of companies in global developed markets, including the United States. The Fund's strategy combines three independent sources of potential returns: 
 
Security Selection — We use value, momentum, quality and other economic indicators to take long and short positions in industries, sectors and companies we believe are attractive on either a relative or absolute basis, targeting beta of 0 to equity markets. 

Passive Market Exposure — We seek cost-effective, efficient exposure to global equity markets by using a basket of futures that targets a beta of 0.5 to the MSCI World Index.

Tactical Market  Exposure — We use a variety of indicators to decide when to shift the Fund’s beta exposure to global equity markets in a range of 0.3 to 0.7 around its long-term strategic target of 0.5.
 
We seek to capture returns from each component of the portfolio independently; an approach we believe is more efficient, more transparent and allows for better risk management over time. 






AQR Long/Short Equity Fund: The Fund uses derivatives to manage its country and currency exposures. The use of derivatives exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund's initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty.

Investment Approach








                The Fund invests in individual equities and equity-related instruments of companies in global developed markets, including the United States. The Fund's strategy combines three independent sources of potential returns: 
 
Security Selection — We use value, momentum, quality and other economic indicators to take long and short positions in industries, sectors and companies we believe are attractive on either a relative or absolute basis, targeting beta of 0 to equity markets. 

Passive Market Exposure — We seek cost-effective, efficient exposure to global equity markets by using a basket of futures that targets a beta of 0.5 to the MSCI World Index.

Tactical Market  Exposure — We use a variety of indicators to decide when to shift the Fund’s beta exposure to global equity markets in a range of 0.3 to 0.7 around its long-term strategic target of 0.5.
 
We seek to capture returns from each component of the portfolio independently; an approach we believe is more efficient, more transparent and allows for better risk management over time. 






AQR Long/Short Equity Fund: The Fund uses derivatives to manage its country and currency exposures. The use of derivatives exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund's initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty.

Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. All returns shown are total returns that assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns for periods under a year are cumulative, all others are average annual returns. Investment returns and principal will fluctuate with market and economic conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. From time to time the Fund’s advisor may waive fees or reimbursed expenses, without which performance would have been lower. Please call 866-290-2688 for most recent month-end performance. 
Performance shown prior to a share class’s inception date reflects the historical performance of the Fund’s Class I shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of the Class N or Class R6 shares, respectively.



The Gross Expense Ratio includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.


The Net Expense Ratio per the Fund’s latest Prospectus. For the Diversified Arbitrage Fund and the Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, the Net Expense Ratio includes expenses related to short sales and interest on any borrowings.

These expense caps are exclusive of expenses that may apply to some of the Funds, such as acquired fund fees, expenses related to short sales and borrowing costs, and extraordinary expenses. See the Prospectus for additional details. 

The expense caps are guaranteed until the following dates: Diversified Arbitrage Fund, Equity Market Neutral Fund, Global Macro Fund, Long/Short Equity Fund, Managed Futures Strategy Fund, Managed Futures Strategy HV Fund, Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy Fund, Risk Parity Fund, Risk Parity II MV Fund, Risk Parity II HV Fund, Style Premia Alternative Fund LV and Style Premia Alternative Fund: April 30, 2018

An investment in any of the AQR Funds involves risk, including loss of principal. The value of the Funds’ portfolio holdings may fluctuate in response to events specific to the companies in which the Fund invests, as well as economic, political or social events in the United States or abroad. Please refer to the prospectus for complete information regarding all risks associated with the Funds. An investor considering the Funds should be able to tolerate potentially wide price fluctuations. The Funds are subject to high portfolio turnover risk as a result of frequent trading, and thus, will incur a higher level of brokerage fees and commissions, and cause a higher level of tax liability to shareholders in the Funds. The Funds may attempt to increase its income or total return through the use of securities lending, and they may be subject to the possibility of additional loss as a result of this investment technique.

Wholesale DELTA Fund



Fact Sheet












Overview








Investment Objective
                                Many hedge funds pursue similar, often well-known and widely understood strategies that seek to generate investment returns. AQR has found that a significant portion of hedge fund returns can be explained as compensation for assuming certain common hedge fund risk exposures, what we call “hedge fund risk premia.” While these largely uncorrelated return streams can be attractive for most portfolios, they require a significant amount of skill to capture, are difficult to isolate, and are often provided by managers at high fees. The AQR Wholesale DELTA Fund (“the Fund”) seeks to provide cost-effective exposure to a portfolio containing a diversified group of hedge fund risk premia. Over the medium to long term, the Fund will seek to achieve a return in excess of the benchmark (i.e., the Bloomberg AusBond Bank Bill Index, measured in AUD) by capturing the systematic components of dynamic trading strategies traditionally pursued by hedge funds.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

5 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 5 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 175 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks capital appreciation.




Strategy



Under normal market conditions, the fund pursues its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets (including borrowings for investment purposes) in equity instruments and equity related and/or derivative instruments. Equity related and/or derivative instruments are investments that provide exposure to the performance of equity instruments, including equity swaps (both single-name and index swaps), equity index futures and exchange-traded-funds and similar pooled investment vehicles (collectively, "Equity Derivative Instruments" and together with Equity Instruments, "Instruments").


Risk



Short positions pose a risk because they lose value as a security's price increases; therefore, the loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited. The fund can invest in securities that may have a leveraging effect (such as derivatives and forward-settling securities) that may increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Short positions pose a risk because they lose value as a security's price increases; therefore, the loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited. The fund can invest in securities that may have a leveraging effect (such as derivatives and forward-settling securities) that may increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.

Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks positive absolute returns.




Strategy



The fund is designed to be market- or beta-neutral, which means that the fund seeks to achieve returns that are not closely correlated with the returns of the equity markets in which the fund invests. Under normal market conditions, it pursues its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets (including borrowings for investment purposes) in equity instruments and equity related and/or derivative instruments.


Risk



Short positions pose a risk because they lose value as a security's price increases; therefore, the loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited. The fund can invest in securities that may have a leveraging effect (such as derivatives and forward-settling securities) that may increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


































 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Short positions pose a risk because they lose value as a security's price increases; therefore, the loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited. The fund can invest in securities that may have a leveraging effect (such as derivatives and forward-settling securities) that may increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
