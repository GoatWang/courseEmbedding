Sparta Systems, Inc. Key Developments

Sparta Systems Launches TrackWise® 9 Quality Management Software
Apr 11 17
Sparta Systems announced the launch of TrackWise 9, the latest version of its quality management software. This release introduced a new intuitive interface along with enhanced features to speed user adoption, and quality and compliance management throughout organizations. TrackWise 9 was built around insights from hundreds of users and feedback from seventy-five beta customers. The release offers a simple and seamless experience that makes it easy for casual users to track and act on quality events. It also introduced one-click data export, and a more robust automated validation package. Also, included in TrackWise 9 is an all new Intake capability. It allows employees to easily report potential quality or compliance issues from a simple, easy-to-use, cloud based interface. As a result, companies have greater visibility into potential quality incidents, and investigation and corrective actions can be initiated faster. TrackWise 9 continues the trend toward an integrated quality business network consisting of manufacturers, suppliers, distributors and other quality stakeholders. All of them are supported by capabilities in analytics, regulatory reporting, and quality processes that bring everything together in a single platform.


Sparta Systems Announces the Release of Stratas 3.0 Featuring TrackWise Intake
Apr 4 17
Sparta Systems announced the release of Stratas 3.0 featuring TrackWise Intake. The new capability is a web interface powered by Stratas 3.0 that enables a company to collect potential quality or compliance issues anywhere at any time from non-TrackWise users. TrackWise Intake leverages the Stratas platform to extend the reach of TrackWise through a web-based form that can be used to submit any type of quality events by those who don't normally access a company's quality management system (QMS). Companies have been searching for a means to effectively capture the information needed to investigate issues that would otherwise go unreported. The new capability empowers employees to contribute to company-wide quality initiatives while fostering a culture of collaboration and transparency. It also supports the shift towards an automated, all-digital approach to quality management processes. Stratas is a rapidly deployable QMS software platform that helps companies create, track, manage, and report on quality-related activities without the need to manage IT infrastructure. Stratas also enables companies to collaborate with suppliers on quality issues and provides full visibility throughout the supply chain. Additionally, suppliers and other partners can interact directly, leading to greater transparency, reduced risk, and improved control throughout the global supply chain. In addition to powering the TrackWise Intake feature, the Stratas 3.0 release expands administrator functionality, allowing greater control of user access and assignments throughout quality processes. It also adds new quality event workflows for partner-related activities, optimized for industry best practices.


Sparta Systems Releases Enhanced Document Management Solution for 123Compliance Cloud QMS Software
Feb 15 17
Sparta Systems announced the launch of enhanced document management functionality for its 123Compliance Quality Management Software. The release allows companies to improve collaboration on quality issues both internally and with external partners around the globe. 123Compliance Document Management enables companies to move away from outdated paper-based document management and reduce the number of separate document management systems required for compliance. This solution offers enhanced ease-of-use and simplified collaboration. 123Compliance Document Management improves quality collaboration and reduces risk of noncompliance. Updates to the solution accelerate review and approval processes by leveraging best practice workflows, organizing all documents into a single repository for ease of access across all sites and enabling the sharing of GxP documents among all key internal and external stakeholders. The robust document management feature allows authors, reviewers and approvers to access documents from any device and take the appropriate action. Moreover, a rule-based workflow is available to support established quality management processes. Documents can be templated for convenience and made to require electronic signatures.

The Jacksonville Jaguars to utilize cutting-edge athlete evaluation and performance software in partnership with Sparta Software, Corp.  Sparta Software, Corp. is proud to partner with the Jacksonville Jaguars and help the team in its continued pursuit of excellence in the NFL. Using the cutting-edge athlete evaluation and performance software, SpartaTrac™, the Jaguars will be able to prioritize player training before and during the season, monitoring player fatigue and injury risk , as well as maximizing players’ off-field preparation. The value is already being seen by Head Strength and Conditioning Coach Tom Myslinski, who spent the week with Sparta in Jacksonville before summarizing the infrastructure’s capabilities, “We are using the Sparta software to validate our training means and methods.” The patented software, coupled with force plate testing, will allow the Jaguars to conduct in-depth player draft analysis and position-specific comparisons to help the team build an outstanding roster and protect its valuable investments. Sparta Software, Corp.’s founder, Dr. Phil Wagner, MD had this to say about the partnership: “It’s exciting to partner with a franchise like the Jaguars and help them continue their tradition of excellence. This partnership shows the Jaguars’ commitment to using science and leading-edge technology to stay competitive in the NFL. We feel the software will be particularly helpful in monitoring player fatigue during the Jags’ challenging travel schedule. Because SpartaTrac™ is so precise, it will help the coaching staff see small changers in players’ performance levels and adjust accordingly.” Sparta Software, Corp. is the sister company of Sparta Performance Science. Located in the Silicon Valley, Sparta Performance Science uses force plate technology and proprietary software to help professional athletes become stronger, healthier more mentally tough athletes. Working with athletes like Jeremy Lin and Houston Astros All-Star Jason Castro, Sparta’s coaches build lasting relationships with their athletes based on trust and results.

Longstanding reputation for technical excellence and customer satisfaction
SPARTA, Inc., recently acquired by Parsons, provides world-class technical products and services to the defense, intelligence and homeland security sectors of the US federal government. SPARTA’s vision has been consistent since 1979—apply the best intellectual talent to help solve major national challenges. The company focuses on problems that require critical technical analysis, innovative computer science and engineering solutions, complex network analysis and architecture development, and expert acquisition support. SPARTA has a longstanding reputation for integrity, technical excellence, and customer satisfaction, which is founded in its commitment to the professional success of its employees.
SPARTA has more than 1,100 employees in offices across the US. Their core competencies include scientific, technical, and analytical skills applied to the development and application of models and simulations; the definition of complex system architectures; and the development of advanced algorithms, composite products, protocol processing, and information assurance technologies and methodologies. Parsons welcomes SPARTA and looks forward to an integration of its business units, which will enhance Parsons’ ability to provide world-class services in the areas of defense, intelligence, and national security.

Defense Business Unit
Integration of SPARTA’s Defense Business Unit will enable Parsons to offer an array of high-end scientific, systems engineering, and systems integration products and services for the Department of Defense (DoD) and the intelligence community. SPARTA has been instrumental in the design, development, fielding, and sustainment of effective weapons systems for more than 30 years and has proven domain expertise. Drawing on this background, Parsons will offer sophisticated and differentiated technical solutions to support the DoD and will maintain the prime position SPARTA has established on many long-term programs vital to our nation’s security. 
Key market segments include:

Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) 
System Engineering and Integration (SE&I) 
Information Assurance 
Training & Simulation 
Mission Support Services 

The Defense Business Unit has major offices in three primary locations: 

Arlington, Virginia 
Colorado Springs, Colorado 
Huntsville, Alabama 











National Security Business Unit
SPARTA’s National Security Business Unit will strengthen Parsons’ ability to provide unique solutions for intelligence production, information assurance, and computer network operations. Parsons will leverage SPARTA’s expertise in computer science and physics combined with their experience in analysis and mission operations to develop unique solutions to meet national intelligence requirements. SPARTA is an industry leader in network security, network operations, and cyber analytics. They bring to Parsons a comprehensive suite of cyber products and services that leverage reverse engineering, repeatable processes, advanced methods, and dedicated laboratories. The company’s full-spectrum cyber capabilities and solutions range from collection, processing, analysis, production, and dissemination of information to provisioning tools for network and information security. SPARTA has applied these tools to solve some of the most difficult and complex security issues using a novel approach that combines network defense techniques and active defensive capabilities to enable mission systems. SPARTA also provides high-end, specialized engineering services (hardware, software, systems, and security) in the scientific and technical intelligence domain. They employ nationally known experts in foreign material exploitation, associated production, and operational infrastructure including the implications on operational doctrine and tactics. SPARTA also employs experts in technical exploitation, reverse engineering activities, and modeling and simulation on various weapon systems.

What They're Saying



















                                            "TAS has been much more to us than just an outsourcing company.
                                            They really took time to understand what we were trying to do and
                                            it was like working with a consulting firm.
                                            We both lacked the technical expertise but they really understood our goals and made it happen.
                                            Steve, John, and Kent were incredible to work with from the admin, planning, and implementation side.
                                            I felt like we were always on the same page and virtually in the same office at times. Thank You so much guys."

                                            "I have 4 agents now (started out with one).
                                            My main requirement was accent neutral.
                                            What really sealed the deal for me? I am from the south in the USA, and speak with a southern drawl.
                                            I was blown away to find out that some of the TAS agents could even project southern dialects when necessary,
                                            and it even fooled me. Incredible! None of my customers has ever mentioned that I use an overseas call center. Extremely happy with what I have now."

                                            "We started outsourcing some low level development work to TAS in 2014.
                                            We were so satisfied with their work that we allocated additional work throughout 2014 and 2015,
                                            to the point where TAS is now the key technology provider to us.
                                            The current relation has been instrumental since it enabled us to shorten development time
                                            rather substantially while curbing our IT budget."

                                            "After initial concerns about outsourcing some of our software development I have come around full circle.
                                            Based on log sheets and evaluation our TAS team is actually now more productive than our onshore team,
                                            a situation which I had never expected. Given the realized savings I will allocate additional development their way throughout 2016.
                                            It’s nice to have a partner like TAS."

                                            "Extremely pleased.
                                            This was going to be our final try on outsourcing and we clearly hit gold.
                                            Could not be happier. Finally getting it done."

                                            "I highly recommend TAS. We had used centers in India and Pakistan before,
                                            and was not happy with the conversion results.
                                            I had always known that the Asian accent is more pleasing to the Western ear.
                                            but I did not expect that to make such a difference in customer acquisition costs. Very pleased."

                                            "We had used an Indian center before. Started to use TAS in March 2014.
                                            We were so happy with the quality of the agents that we closed our Indian center in Dec. 2014.
                                            Very very good solution, and no more customer complaints about not being able to understand the support center."

Sparta Software, Corp. and Jaguars announce partnership 














“We are using the Sparta software to validate our training means and methods.”
Tom Myslinski 
Head Strength and Conditioning Coach 
Sparta Software Corporation is proud to partner with the Jacksonville Jaguars and help the team in its continued pursuit of excellence in the NFL. Using the cutting-edge athlete evaluation and performance software, SpartaTrac™, the Jaguars will be able to prioritize player training before and during the season, monitoring player fatigue and injury risk , as well as maximizing players’ off-field preparation. The value is already being seen by Head Strength and Conditioning Coach Tom Myslinski, who spent the week with Sparta in Jacksonville before summarizing the infrastructure’s capabilities,“We are using the Sparta software to validate our training means and methods.”
The patented software, coupled with force plate testing, will allow the Jaguars to conduct in-depth player draft analysis and position-specific comparisons to help the team build an outstanding roster and protect its valuable investments.
Sparta Software, Corp.’s founder, Dr. Phil Wagner, MD had this to say about the partnership: “It’s exciting to partner with a franchise like the Jaguars and help them continue their tradition of excellence. This partnership shows the Jaguars’ commitment to using science and leading-edge technology to stay competitive in the NFL. We feel the software will be particularly helpful in monitoring player fatigue during the Jags’ challenging travel schedule. Because SpartaTrac™ is so precise, it will help the coaching staff see small changers in players’ performance levels and adjust accordingly.”
Sparta Software, Corp. is the sister company of Sparta Performance Science. Located in the Silicon Valley, Sparta Performance Science uses force plate technology and proprietary software to help professional athletes become stronger, healthier more mentally tough athletes. Working with athletes like Jeremy Lin and Houston Astros All-Star Jason Castro, Sparta’s coaches build lasting relationships with their athletes based on trust and results.
