1 Retail Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. Beginning October 14, 2016, the Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.

2 Government Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.


^ The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund 
(the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). 
The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance 
data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown in the 
performance sub-tab when the fund is hovered over) and the actual performance 
results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have 
lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed 
over the periods shown, would have been higher. 
					

						The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
					
* Some income is subject to state and local taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax.

The aim of the City National Rochdale Funds is simple. We seek competitive performance through active and disciplined investment management that includes a strong commitment to style consistency.

Designed to offer a full spectrum of investments, the City National Rochdale Funds fit the various risk and return preferences of most investors. Using the full family of funds, investors may create an optimal portfolio or round out their current asset allocation strategy.

            City National Rochdale Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO), which is not affiliated with City National Rochdale. Check the background of SIDCO on FINRA’s BrokerCheck.


You could lose money by investing in the money market funds. Although the money market funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.



	
	City National Rochdale Funds do not generally accept investments by non-U.S. persons and may not be available in all states.
	

	To determine if these Funds are an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider each Fund's investment objectives, risk factors and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's full or summary prospectus which may be obtained by clicking here or by calling 1-888-889-0799. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
	

	Investment products are not bank deposits or obligations of or guaranteed by City National Bank or any subsidiary or affiliate and are not insured by the FDIC, and may lose value. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Investment Manager for the City National Rochdale Funds is City National Rochdale, LLC, a subsidiary of City National Bank.
	
	Bond and bond funds will decrease in value as interest rates rise.  Funds that invest primarily in the securities of a single state may be more volatile and susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting those obligations.  High yield bonds involve greater risk of default or downgrade and are more volatile than investment-grade securities, due to the speculative nature of their investments.  Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility.  Asset Allocation and diversification may not protect against market risk.  
    International investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations.  Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. There may be a significant change in legislation or policy affecting taxation on dividends, which may affect the performance of the Fund.

1 Retail Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. Beginning October 14, 2016, the Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.

2 Government Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so.

^ The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund 
(the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). 
The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance 
data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown in the 
performance sub-tab when the fund is hovered over) and the actual performance 
results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have 
lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed 
over the periods shown, would have been higher. 
					

						The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
					
* Some income is subject to state and local taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax.
