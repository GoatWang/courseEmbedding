Empowering your patients with chronic pain to live a better life.
A psychological testing and mindfulness treatment program administered on a tablet in your medical office







 

"WellBrain's mindfulness exercises helped me recover from a painful shoulder injury
so that I can get back to doing what I love most."
 &dash; Garrett McNamara, professional big wave surfer & world record holder for largest wave ever surfed- using
WellBrain after flying off a 50 foot wave at Mavericks











It's measurable mindfulness with monk power.
It all started in Northern India where for nearly a year we lived and studied and collected the brainwaves of meditating Tibetan monks. Later using machine-learning computers to evaluate the data, we produced a unique mindfulness algorithm which blends with a revolutionary bio-feedback tool to help people gain more focus, calm and clarity. Returning a year later to Tibet, the Chief Medical Officer of the Dalai Lama thought WellBrain was an effective tool for their monks who were persecuted by torture. 
We realized that if it could help the monks, then it could help people and patients around the world.
Use our evidence-based treatment to help your patients relax and improve their mental well-being. Help diagnose and quantify psychological illness. Teach mindfulness based therapies in your office, and recommend home based mindfulness-based treatments to enhance and empower your patients.
WellBrain represents a paradigm shift in the assessment and treatment of patients with chronic pain, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and other mental health disorders.
Help your patients. Help your practice. Help mankind.
*Patent Pending.









 How It Works
Simple.  Efficient.

 Data Driven
Mindfulness training is very well-researched and positively impacts multiple medical and mental health conditions.  Many disease and mental health states have been shown to be favorably affected by routine mindfulness. The process is  risk free and has no harmful side effects. 

Recent studies have shown that when behavioral interventions are made in the doctors office, they are much more likely to be effective over the short and long term. 

WellBrain allows you to immediately introduce patients to a very effective and proven therapy in your office and subsequently promotes a home-based treatment solution with our individualized WellBrain at Home solution.

April 19, 2016

Computerized Mindfulness-Based Interventions Effective For Patients With Chronic Pain
April 19, 2016
Despite over 100 million Americans suffering from chronic pain, and medical costs associated with chronic pain climbing beyond $600 billion dollars per year, the penetration of low-cost mindfulness therapies into chronic pain populations has been limited. A false preconception among health care providers is that patients with chronic pain are only interested in opiate therapy, which can be accompanied by significant side effects, increased pain sensitivity and even death.

Meditation Reduces Emotional Pain by 44%: Study
November 12, 2015
According to a new study, mindfulness meditation exhibited even stronger physical pain reductions than morphine, says the study's lead investigator
Open any magazine (this one, for example) and you'll find that mindfulness has gone mainstream.You'll also notice there are studies that purport to show meditation's benefits on just about everything, from kids' math scores and migraine length to HIV management and bouncing back after a crisis. Now, an elaborate new forthcoming study looks at how the brains of meditators respond to pain, to be published in the Journal of Neuroscience.

Why Google, Target, and General Mills Are Investing in Mindfulness
December 28, 2015
When was the last time you sat quietly at your desk and did nothing but think? How would you react if you observed a peer, employee, or manager doing so? Encouraging employees to slow down to focus on the present can seem at odds with a corporate culture of speed and goal attainment. But in today's hyper-paced work environment, mindfulness practitioners know the importance of recharging in order to regain productivity.
