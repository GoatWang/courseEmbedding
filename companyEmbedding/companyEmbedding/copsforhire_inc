- StackShot Controller - USB enabled
- StackShot extended length macro rail
- 6ft (2m) long motor cable
- AC adapter (available in 4 different styles US, EU, UK and AUS)

The other option for controlling the camera is the Universal IR Remote. Use this option if your camera is has an IR port but is not equipped with a wired shutter release port.

The StackShot rail is a completely configurable automated system for capturing images for stacking. The step size can be configured from 200mm (the overall length of the rail) to a very minuscule 2 um.
Please don't forget the shutter interface cable.
