A Chief Investment Officer (CIO) is an experienced investment professional that is normally supported by a fully-staffed investment department and is point-accountable for the investment success of an entire investment program -- not just stocks or bonds or money market funds or hedge funds or venture capital or commodities, but all investments across the entire program.
Having a qualified Chief Investment Officer, supported by a fully-capable staff, provides a fundamental advantage in terms of both managing risk and achieving net-of-all-fee returns.
Whether the CIO is a full-time employee of one’s family or institution or an outsourced CIO (OCIO), the professional and moral contract between CIO and client is the same. The CIO (and firm) must have the skill, experience and resources to evaluate and manage assets across every asset class and return source and must be unencumbered by the conflicts-of-interest that have plagued the investment industry for far too long.
The most sophisticated investment programs implement component solutions by allocating capital to independent specialist money managers. This “open architecture” enables investors to use any specialist manager, anywhere in the world and reduces conflicts-of-interest.
Not only does a Chief Investment Officer have the critical task of allocating capital with insight, skill and discipline to control risk and enhance program return, but also just as important is allocating that capital in a manner that responds to the family or institution’s particular fact pattern -- financial risk, operating risk, liquidity requirements and constituency risk. As the first firm to offer outsourced CIO services to serious investors, who chose not to develop and pay for an internal department, Hirtle Callaghan has spent more than 25 years developing powerful proprietary processes for both capital allocation and manager selection. We work in a capacity that is most similar to our clients hiring their own internal staff.
We have written a commentary defining the outsourced CIO space, please contact us if you would like to receive a copy.



















Our great institutions have been entrusted with much of our nation’s patrimony.  The stewardship of that capital is a serious responsibility.  This is capital intended to educate our children, fight disease and support the arts.  Every dollar lost to ill-informed decisions means more ignorance and disease, less inspiration and security. 
Every day, we use our collective expertise and purchasing power, as well as the access they provide, to protect and enhance these critical assets, so that our institutional clients can better fulfill their critical missions.

Hirtle Callaghan was founded in 1988, by Jonathan J. Hirtle and Donald E. Callaghan, to serve solely as an outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) and investment department to family groups and institutions that chose not to develop and pay for a world-class internal investment department. 
Today, our firm manages over $20 billion of legacy assets evenly divided between family and institutional clients. 
This is serious capital intended for educating our children, fighting disease, supporting the arts and providing for future generations. We know that managing these assets well means less ignorance and disease, more inspiration and security.

Leadership

 





















Executive Team and Investment Policy Committee
Our Investment Policy Committee, which is comprised of the most senior professionals at the firm, approves significant strategy recommendations and managers before they are implemented in any client portfolios. We have a bifurcated due diligence process in which both our manager team and compliance team do their own separate due diligence and report back to the Investment Policy Committee.  The safety of our clients’ assets is always our focus. Please contact us if you would like to discuss this in greater detail.

Hirtle Callaghan - Chief Investment Officers

 
















America's First Outsourced Chief Investment Officers
For far too long, serious investors have not been fairly rewarded for putting their capital at risk.  Unjustifiable fees and bad investment decisions, based on instinct rather than the rigor of logic and proven process, rob investors of the returns they are due — Hirtle Callaghan changes all that.
We are an outsourced Chief Investment Officer (CIO) and investment department serving family groups and institutions.  Our conflict-free structure, sophisticated capability and multi-billion-dollar purchasing power, have made us uniquely suited to harness market complexity and deliver a complete, custom designed investment solution - at little or no incremental cost. The largest, most sophisticated investors in the world rely on a fully staffed internal investment department, led by a qualified Chief Investment Officer. We pioneered the business of delivering that same solution through outsourcing.
