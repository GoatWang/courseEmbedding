History[edit]
In 1957, Alfred W. Fielding and Marc Chavannes attempted to invent plastic wallpaper with a paper backing.[6][7][8][9] While the wallpaper failed, Fielding and Chavannes later realized that what they had come up with could be used for packing material.[6][8][9] Sealed Air was founded in 1960 based on this invention of Bubble Wrap.[6][7][8][9] That same year, Sealed Air raised $85,000 in its initial public offering.[10] Fielding served as executive vice president and director of Sealed Air until his retirement in 1987, while Chavannes worked mostly as a consultant.[8]
T.J. Dermot Dunphy served as CEO from 1971-2000.[8][10][11] Dunphy graduated from Oxford University and received his master of business administration from Harvard Business School.[10][11] He became Chairman of Kildare Enterprises, LLC in November 2000, after leaving Sealed Air.[11] While with Sealed Air, Dunphy grew sales from $5 million to $3 billion.[12]
William Hickey served as CEO from 2000-March 2013.[13] Prior to being CEO, William Hickey served in several capacities at Sealed Air, including COO, executive vice president, CFO, vice president, and general manager of the Food Packaging Division and the Cellu Products Division.[13] Before working for Sealed Air, he was CPA at Arthur Young and CFO of W. R. Grace and Company’s Latin American operations.[13]
Sealed Air produced the foam that was ignited in the 2003 Station nightclub fire and has paid $25 million to victims in various civil settlements.[14]
In March 2013, Peribere took over as CEO and President of Sealed Air.[15] Peribere obtained his business economics and finance degree from Institut d'études politiques in Paris, France.[15] Before working for Sealed Air, Peribere worked in several managerial roles with Dow Chemical Company from 1977-2012.[15] He also served as president and COO of Sealed Air before taking over as CEO.[15]
On July 23, 2014, Sealed Air announced that it would be moving its global headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina.[16]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 1970, Sealed Air acquired Smith Packaging Ltd., which was later renamed Sealed Air of Canada, Ltd., which marked Sealed Air going international.[10] In 1971, Sealed Air marketed a new product. (Encyclopedia) By laminating the AirCap cushioning to paper, the company now had Mail Lite padded shipping envelopes.[10]
In 1973, Sealed Air marketed its first product not based on its bubble technology.[10] Ply-Mask is a pressure sensitive polyethylene film used to protect delicate surfaces from scratches.[10] That same year, Sealed Air brought their market to Europe by acquiring 10 percent of Sibco Universal, S.A., a French manufacturing firm.[10] Over the next few years, Sealed Air bought out the rest of Sibco and came up with The Sealed Air Solar Blanket.[10]
Acquired in 1977, Instapak foam is expanding polyurethane foam that comes in a variety of densities.[10][17] Used primarily for shipping, the foam-in-bag process molds to the shape of the object and expands to fill the void space of its shipping container.[10][17]
Sealed Air acquired Cellu Products Co. and Dri-Loc in 1983, Jiffy in 1987, Sentinel in 1991, and the Shurtuff Division of Shuford Mills, Inc. in 1993.[10][18] 1994 was a busy year for Sealed Air with the acquisitions of Hereford Paper and Allied Products Ltd., Sup-Air-Pack, Fill Air, and packaging companies based in Norway, France, and Italy.
W.R. Grace sold Cryovac to Sealed Air in 1998 for $4.9 billion.[7][19] In June 2000, Sealed Air purchased Dolphin Packaging for $119 million, to better serve its European customers.[20] In October 2011, Sealed Air acquired Diversey Holdings, Inc..[19]
Company operations[edit]
Sealed Air’s Food Care Division makes packaging for the food and beverage industry.[2]
Sealed Air’s Product Care Division produces protective and specialty packaging materials for a wide range of goods.[2][3]
Sealed Air’s Diversey Care Division creates products for infection prevention, kitchen hygiene, fabric care, building care and consulting. Its products are developed for health care, food service, retail, hospitality and facility services.[2][3]
Brands[edit]
Bubble Wrap[edit]
Initially created as a failed wallpaper, Bubble was subsequently used as a greenhouse insulator.[10] Finally, it took on its best-known use as a packaging material.[10] In its earliest form, Bubble Wrap suffered from leaky bubbles, but by the mid 1960s a special coating was developed to prevent the bubbles from losing air.[10] In 1969, Sealed Air reported $4 million in sales, mostly attributed to Bubble Wrap, as it was still a proprietary product at that time.[10]
Cryovac[edit]
Cryovac is a thin plastic, used to shrink or wrap objects.[21] Depending on the type of job required of it, the plastic comes in a variety of thickness and durability.[21]
One of the uses of Cryovac is to wrap food.[22] Once wrapped, most of the air in the package is removed to prevent oxidation and inhibit the growth of most pathogens.[22] This process also gives food a longer shelf life in the refrigerator or freezer and makes freezer burn nearly impossible.[22] Cryovac Inc., a South Carolina-based company, created this product in the 1950 to extend the shipping distance of freshly slaughtered turkeys for Thanksgiving and Christmas.[22]
Diversey[edit]
Diversey is a provider of cleaning and hygiene products to the institutional marketplace, serving lodging, food service, retail, health care, food and beverage companies, as well as building service contractors worldwide.[3]

History[edit]
In 1957, Alfred W. Fielding and Marc Chavannes attempted to invent plastic wallpaper with a paper backing.[6][7][8][9] While the wallpaper failed, Fielding and Chavannes later realized that what they had come up with could be used for packing material.[6][8][9] Sealed Air was founded in 1960 based on this invention of Bubble Wrap.[6][7][8][9] That same year, Sealed Air raised $85,000 in its initial public offering.[10] Fielding served as executive vice president and director of Sealed Air until his retirement in 1987, while Chavannes worked mostly as a consultant.[8]
T.J. Dermot Dunphy served as CEO from 1971-2000.[8][10][11] Dunphy graduated from Oxford University and received his master of business administration from Harvard Business School.[10][11] He became Chairman of Kildare Enterprises, LLC in November 2000, after leaving Sealed Air.[11] While with Sealed Air, Dunphy grew sales from $5 million to $3 billion.[12]
William Hickey served as CEO from 2000-March 2013.[13] Prior to being CEO, William Hickey served in several capacities at Sealed Air, including COO, executive vice president, CFO, vice president, and general manager of the Food Packaging Division and the Cellu Products Division.[13] Before working for Sealed Air, he was CPA at Arthur Young and CFO of W. R. Grace and Company’s Latin American operations.[13]
Sealed Air produced the foam that was ignited in the 2003 Station nightclub fire and has paid $25 million to victims in various civil settlements.[14]
In March 2013, Peribere took over as CEO and President of Sealed Air.[15] Peribere obtained his business economics and finance degree from Institut d'études politiques in Paris, France.[15] Before working for Sealed Air, Peribere worked in several managerial roles with Dow Chemical Company from 1977-2012.[15] He also served as president and COO of Sealed Air before taking over as CEO.[15]
On July 23, 2014, Sealed Air announced that it would be moving its global headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina.[16]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 1970, Sealed Air acquired Smith Packaging Ltd., which was later renamed Sealed Air of Canada, Ltd., which marked Sealed Air going international.[10] In 1971, Sealed Air marketed a new product. (Encyclopedia) By laminating the AirCap cushioning to paper, the company now had Mail Lite padded shipping envelopes.[10]
In 1973, Sealed Air marketed its first product not based on its bubble technology.[10] Ply-Mask is a pressure sensitive polyethylene film used to protect delicate surfaces from scratches.[10] That same year, Sealed Air brought their market to Europe by acquiring 10 percent of Sibco Universal, S.A., a French manufacturing firm.[10] Over the next few years, Sealed Air bought out the rest of Sibco and came up with The Sealed Air Solar Blanket.[10]
Acquired in 1977, Instapak foam is expanding polyurethane foam that comes in a variety of densities.[10][17] Used primarily for shipping, the foam-in-bag process molds to the shape of the object and expands to fill the void space of its shipping container.[10][17]
Sealed Air acquired Cellu Products Co. and Dri-Loc in 1983, Jiffy in 1987, Sentinel in 1991, and the Shurtuff Division of Shuford Mills, Inc. in 1993.[10][18] 1994 was a busy year for Sealed Air with the acquisitions of Hereford Paper and Allied Products Ltd., Sup-Air-Pack, Fill Air, and packaging companies based in Norway, France, and Italy.
W.R. Grace sold Cryovac to Sealed Air in 1998 for $4.9 billion.[7][19] In June 2000, Sealed Air purchased Dolphin Packaging for $119 million, to better serve its European customers.[20] In October 2011, Sealed Air acquired Diversey Holdings, Inc..[19]
Company operations[edit]
Sealed Air’s Food Care Division makes packaging for the food and beverage industry.[2]
Sealed Air’s Product Care Division produces protective and specialty packaging materials for a wide range of goods.[2][3]
Sealed Air’s Diversey Care Division creates products for infection prevention, kitchen hygiene, fabric care, building care and consulting. Its products are developed for health care, food service, retail, hospitality and facility services.[2][3]
Brands[edit]
Bubble Wrap[edit]
Initially created as a failed wallpaper, Bubble was subsequently used as a greenhouse insulator.[10] Finally, it took on its best-known use as a packaging material.[10] In its earliest form, Bubble Wrap suffered from leaky bubbles, but by the mid 1960s a special coating was developed to prevent the bubbles from losing air.[10] In 1969, Sealed Air reported $4 million in sales, mostly attributed to Bubble Wrap, as it was still a proprietary product at that time.[10]
Cryovac[edit]
Cryovac is a thin plastic, used to shrink or wrap objects.[21] Depending on the type of job required of it, the plastic comes in a variety of thickness and durability.[21]
One of the uses of Cryovac is to wrap food.[22] Once wrapped, most of the air in the package is removed to prevent oxidation and inhibit the growth of most pathogens.[22] This process also gives food a longer shelf life in the refrigerator or freezer and makes freezer burn nearly impossible.[22] Cryovac Inc., a South Carolina-based company, created this product in the 1950 to extend the shipping distance of freshly slaughtered turkeys for Thanksgiving and Christmas.[22]
Diversey[edit]
Diversey is a provider of cleaning and hygiene products to the institutional marketplace, serving lodging, food service, retail, health care, food and beverage companies, as well as building service contractors worldwide.[3]

Sealed Air’s Diversey Care Division creates products for infection prevention, kitchen hygiene, fabric care, building care and consulting. Its products are developed for health care, food service, retail, hospitality and facility services.[2][3]
Brands[edit]
Bubble Wrap[edit]
Initially created as a failed wallpaper, Bubble was subsequently used as a greenhouse insulator.[10] Finally, it took on its best-known use as a packaging material.[10] In its earliest form, Bubble Wrap suffered from leaky bubbles, but by the mid 1960s a special coating was developed to prevent the bubbles from losing air.[10] In 1969, Sealed Air reported $4 million in sales, mostly attributed to Bubble Wrap, as it was still a proprietary product at that time.[10]
Cryovac[edit]
Cryovac is a thin plastic, used to shrink or wrap objects.[21] Depending on the type of job required of it, the plastic comes in a variety of thickness and durability.[21]
One of the uses of Cryovac is to wrap food.[22] Once wrapped, most of the air in the package is removed to prevent oxidation and inhibit the growth of most pathogens.[22] This process also gives food a longer shelf life in the refrigerator or freezer and makes freezer burn nearly impossible.[22] Cryovac Inc., a South Carolina-based company, created this product in the 1950 to extend the shipping distance of freshly slaughtered turkeys for Thanksgiving and Christmas.[22]
Diversey[edit]
Diversey is a provider of cleaning and hygiene products to the institutional marketplace, serving lodging, food service, retail, health care, food and beverage companies, as well as building service contractors worldwide.[3]

Why one analyst calls this the ‘chart of the week, month and potentially year’
              
              Oppenheimer’s Ari Wald calls this “our chart of the week, month and potentially year,” explaining that it “not only carries significance for the future direction of EEM’s trend—we think higher—but also for the cyclical recovery as well because broadening global participation remains a focal point to our outlook.”

Magna-Matic Corp. Precision Steel Dead-Blow Hammer - Precision Steel Dead-Blow Hammer 


                        Unlike all other hammers out there, the PSDB is all-steel precision CNC machined hammer. No cheap wood handles or over-molded screws for tips. This is a serious hammer for serious gunsmithing - hitting pins, punches, whatever. The PSDB can have 3 different hammer tip materials on-board - one can be                        
                             screwed into each side of the hammer head, and the third screws into the bottom of the handle. So no matter what type of pin, or against what finish you might have to hit you can pick a hard or soft non-marring hammer tip for the job. The tips are held tight with large o-rings, so they'll never back-off and come loose. The PSDB is a whole new type of dead-blow hammer, with t Mfg: Magna-Matic Corporation  SPECS: Total hammer weight 1 pound, 8.5 ounces Deadblow weight 3.1 ounces Steel Head weight 2.3 ounces Brass Head weight 2.5 ounces Delrin Head weight 0.5 ounces 10.5 inches tall 3.5 inches wide at the head faces Head OD at the face is 0.971 inches Head OD at t

History[edit]
In 1957, Alfred W. Fielding and Marc Chavannes attempted to invent plastic wallpaper with a paper backing.[6][7][8][9] While the wallpaper failed, Fielding and Chavannes later realized that what they had come up with could be used for packing material.[6][8][9] Sealed Air was founded in 1960 based on this invention of Bubble Wrap.[6][7][8][9] That same year, Sealed Air raised $85,000 in its initial public offering.[10] Fielding served as executive vice president and director of Sealed Air until his retirement in 1987, while Chavannes worked mostly as a consultant.[8]
T.J. Dermot Dunphy served as CEO from 1971-2000.[8][10][11] Dunphy graduated from Oxford University and received his master of business administration from Harvard Business School.[10][11] He became Chairman of Kildare Enterprises, LLC in November 2000, after leaving Sealed Air.[11] While with Sealed Air, Dunphy grew sales from $5 million to $3 billion.[12]
William Hickey served as CEO from 2000-March 2013.[13] Prior to being CEO, William Hickey served in several capacities at Sealed Air, including COO, executive vice president, CFO, vice president, and general manager of the Food Packaging Division and the Cellu Products Division.[13] Before working for Sealed Air, he was CPA at Arthur Young and CFO of W. R. Grace and Company’s Latin American operations.[13]
Sealed Air produced the foam that was ignited in the 2003 Station nightclub fire and has paid $25 million to victims in various civil settlements.[14]
In March 2013, Peribere took over as CEO and President of Sealed Air.[15] Peribere obtained his business economics and finance degree from Institut d'études politiques in Paris, France.[15] Before working for Sealed Air, Peribere worked in several managerial roles with Dow Chemical Company from 1977-2012.[15] He also served as president and COO of Sealed Air before taking over as CEO.[15]
On July 23, 2014, Sealed Air announced that it would be moving its global headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina.[16]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 1970, Sealed Air acquired Smith Packaging Ltd., which was later renamed Sealed Air of Canada, Ltd., which marked Sealed Air going international.[10] In 1971, Sealed Air marketed a new product. (Encyclopedia) By laminating the AirCap cushioning to paper, the company now had Mail Lite padded shipping envelopes.[10]
In 1973, Sealed Air marketed its first product not based on its bubble technology.[10] Ply-Mask is a pressure sensitive polyethylene film used to protect delicate surfaces from scratches.[10] That same year, Sealed Air brought their market to Europe by acquiring 10 percent of Sibco Universal, S.A., a French manufacturing firm.[10] Over the next few years, Sealed Air bought out the rest of Sibco and came up with The Sealed Air Solar Blanket.[10]
Acquired in 1977, Instapak foam is expanding polyurethane foam that comes in a variety of densities.[10][17] Used primarily for shipping, the foam-in-bag process molds to the shape of the object and expands to fill the void space of its shipping container.[10][17]
Sealed Air acquired Cellu Products Co. and Dri-Loc in 1983, Jiffy in 1987, Sentinel in 1991, and the Shurtuff Division of Shuford Mills, Inc. in 1993.[10][18] 1994 was a busy year for Sealed Air with the acquisitions of Hereford Paper and Allied Products Ltd., Sup-Air-Pack, Fill Air, and packaging companies based in Norway, France, and Italy.
W.R. Grace sold Cryovac to Sealed Air in 1998 for $4.9 billion.[7][19] In June 2000, Sealed Air purchased Dolphin Packaging for $119 million, to better serve its European customers.[20] In October 2011, Sealed Air acquired Diversey Holdings, Inc..[19]
Company operations[edit]
Sealed Air’s Food Care Division makes packaging for the food and beverage industry.[2]
Sealed Air’s Product Care Division produces protective and specialty packaging materials for a wide range of goods.[2][3]
Sealed Air’s Diversey Care Division creates products for infection prevention, kitchen hygiene, fabric care, building care and consulting. Its products are developed for health care, food service, retail, hospitality and facility services.[2][3]
Brands[edit]
Bubble Wrap[edit]
Initially created as a failed wallpaper, Bubble was subsequently used as a greenhouse insulator.[10] Finally, it took on its best-known use as a packaging material.[10] In its earliest form, Bubble Wrap suffered from leaky bubbles, but by the mid 1960s a special coating was developed to prevent the bubbles from losing air.[10] In 1969, Sealed Air reported $4 million in sales, mostly attributed to Bubble Wrap, as it was still a proprietary product at that time.[10]
Cryovac[edit]
Cryovac is a thin plastic, used to shrink or wrap objects.[21] Depending on the type of job required of it, the plastic comes in a variety of thickness and durability.[21]
One of the uses of Cryovac is to wrap food.[22] Once wrapped, most of the air in the package is removed to prevent oxidation and inhibit the growth of most pathogens.[22] This process also gives food a longer shelf life in the refrigerator or freezer and makes freezer burn nearly impossible.[22] Cryovac Inc., a South Carolina-based company, created this product in the 1950 to extend the shipping distance of freshly slaughtered turkeys for Thanksgiving and Christmas.[22]
Diversey[edit]
Diversey is a provider of cleaning and hygiene products to the institutional marketplace, serving lodging, food service, retail, health care, food and beverage companies, as well as building service contractors worldwide.[3]

History[edit]
In 1957, Alfred W. Fielding and Marc Chavannes attempted to invent plastic wallpaper with a paper backing.[6][7][8][9] While the wallpaper failed, Fielding and Chavannes later realized that what they had come up with could be used for packing material.[6][8][9] Sealed Air was founded in 1960 based on this invention of Bubble Wrap.[6][7][8][9] That same year, Sealed Air raised $85,000 in its initial public offering.[10] Fielding served as executive vice president and director of Sealed Air until his retirement in 1987, while Chavannes worked mostly as a consultant.[8]
T.J. Dermot Dunphy served as CEO from 1971-2000.[8][10][11] Dunphy graduated from Oxford University and received his master of business administration from Harvard Business School.[10][11] He became Chairman of Kildare Enterprises, LLC in November 2000, after leaving Sealed Air.[11] While with Sealed Air, Dunphy grew sales from $5 million to $3 billion.[12]
William Hickey served as CEO from 2000-March 2013.[13] Prior to being CEO, William Hickey served in several capacities at Sealed Air, including COO, executive vice president, CFO, vice president, and general manager of the Food Packaging Division and the Cellu Products Division.[13] Before working for Sealed Air, he was CPA at Arthur Young and CFO of W. R. Grace and Company’s Latin American operations.[13]
Sealed Air produced the foam that was ignited in the 2003 Station nightclub fire and has paid $25 million to victims in various civil settlements.[14]
In March 2013, Peribere took over as CEO and President of Sealed Air.[15] Peribere obtained his business economics and finance degree from Institut d'études politiques in Paris, France.[15] Before working for Sealed Air, Peribere worked in several managerial roles with Dow Chemical Company from 1977-2012.[15] He also served as president and COO of Sealed Air before taking over as CEO.[15]
On July 23, 2014, Sealed Air announced that it would be moving its global headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina.[16]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 1970, Sealed Air acquired Smith Packaging Ltd., which was later renamed Sealed Air of Canada, Ltd., which marked Sealed Air going international.[10] In 1971, Sealed Air marketed a new product. (Encyclopedia) By laminating the AirCap cushioning to paper, the company now had Mail Lite padded shipping envelopes.[10]
In 1973, Sealed Air marketed its first product not based on its bubble technology.[10] Ply-Mask is a pressure sensitive polyethylene film used to protect delicate surfaces from scratches.[10] That same year, Sealed Air brought their market to Europe by acquiring 10 percent of Sibco Universal, S.A., a French manufacturing firm.[10] Over the next few years, Sealed Air bought out the rest of Sibco and came up with The Sealed Air Solar Blanket.[10]
Acquired in 1977, Instapak foam is expanding polyurethane foam that comes in a variety of densities.[10][17] Used primarily for shipping, the foam-in-bag process molds to the shape of the object and expands to fill the void space of its shipping container.[10][17]

W.R. Grace sold Cryovac to Sealed Air in 1998 for $4.9 billion.[7][19] In June 2000, Sealed Air purchased Dolphin Packaging for $119 million, to better serve its European customers.[20] In October 2011, Sealed Air acquired Diversey Holdings, Inc..[19]
Company operations[edit]
Sealed Air’s Food Care Division makes packaging for the food and beverage industry.[2]
Sealed Air’s Product Care Division produces protective and specialty packaging materials for a wide range of goods.[2][3]
Sealed Air’s Diversey Care Division creates products for infection prevention, kitchen hygiene, fabric care, building care and consulting. Its products are developed for health care, food service, retail, hospitality and facility services.[2][3]
Brands[edit]
Bubble Wrap[edit]
Initially created as a failed wallpaper, Bubble was subsequently used as a greenhouse insulator.[10] Finally, it took on its best-known use as a packaging material.[10] In its earliest form, Bubble Wrap suffered from leaky bubbles, but by the mid 1960s a special coating was developed to prevent the bubbles from losing air.[10] In 1969, Sealed Air reported $4 million in sales, mostly attributed to Bubble Wrap, as it was still a proprietary product at that time.[10]
Cryovac[edit]
Cryovac is a thin plastic, used to shrink or wrap objects.[21] Depending on the type of job required of it, the plastic comes in a variety of thickness and durability.[21]
One of the uses of Cryovac is to wrap food.[22] Once wrapped, most of the air in the package is removed to prevent oxidation and inhibit the growth of most pathogens.[22] This process also gives food a longer shelf life in the refrigerator or freezer and makes freezer burn nearly impossible.[22] Cryovac Inc., a South Carolina-based company, created this product in the 1950 to extend the shipping distance of freshly slaughtered turkeys for Thanksgiving and Christmas.[22]
Diversey[edit]
Diversey is a provider of cleaning and hygiene products to the institutional marketplace, serving lodging, food service, retail, health care, food and beverage companies, as well as building service contractors worldwide.[3]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
