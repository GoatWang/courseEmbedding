                                    Accelerate Pension Funding and De-risking Ahead of Tax Reform: A Less Taxing Exercise


                                    Corporate plan sponsors continue to grapple with the risks and rising costs associated with managing and maintaining their pension plans. With the possibility of corporate tax reform on the horizon, plan sponsors may have a unique opportunity now to reduce PBGC expenses by accelerating funding and to deduct contributions at the current higher tax rate, resulting in a low risk, positive net present value outcome.

                                    A resurgent economy, strong equity markets and modestly higher interest rates are providing a tailwind to pension plan sponsors. The change in economic sentiment is driven in large part by expectations that companies will get a boost to cash flow from lower corporate tax rates, infrastructure spending and reduced regulations under the new administration.

After briefly recapping the what and why, this insight series will focus on the “how,” outlining the steps involved in the most complete form of pension risk transfer: a buy-out transaction. Whether or not a buy-out is imminent, there are preparations a plan sponsor can undertake to make a future transaction easier and to shorten the timeline for execution.

                                This insight series demonstrates that the conventional wisdom about de-risking DB plans is often false. Invalidating the five myths discussed in this paper can help broaden the range of options that DB plan sponsors are willing to evaluate when formulating their long-term pension strategies. A wider range of options is essential to providing sponsors with the flexibility they need to achieve their long-term DB objectives.

  The 2012 Prudential Financial and General Motors $25.1B pension risk transfer transaction was the largest and most complex of its kind by an order of magnitude in the U.S. market and globally. A flawless execution on behalf of 110,000 former plan participants of the legacy GM Retirement Program for Salaried Employees required exceptional teamwork, sophisticated expertise in longevity risk, ALM, investments, pensions, a scalable plan administration infrastructure and relentless dedication to servicing excellence.

  Increasing life expectancy is a contributing factor to the vulnerability of pension systems worldwide, helping drive many countries toward an impending retirement crisis. This article, however, asserts that increasing longevity may actually be an opportunity for creating economic growth and stability—but only if retirement systems adapt. Appearing in the February 2013 edition of European Pensions, the paper argues that by allowing individuals to work longer, linking the retirement age of social security systems with changes in healthy life expectancy, ensuring that employer-sponsored pension plans achieve sustainable risk profiles, and supporting employees in retirement planning, longer life can, in fact, help create sustainable retirement systems.

  A recent article by Pension & Investments discusses the impact of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board’s new pension rules on government bond ratings - specifically, a requirement to recognize unfunded net pension liabilities on the balance sheet. The article suggests plan sponsors’ credit ratings won’t be seriously affected because, in most cases, the ratings agencies already understand the reality of these underfunded liabilities.

 Recent papers by Prudential and others have focused on the “what” and the “why” of pension risk transfer, describing the types of solutions that are available and the trends that are driving increased interest in de-risking. After briefly recapping the what and why, this paper will focus on the “how,” outlining the steps involved in the most complete form of pension risk transfer: a buy-out transaction. Whether or not a buy-out is imminent, there are preparations a plan sponsor can undertake to make a future transaction easier and to shorten the timeline for execution.

  The Australian population’s life expectancy is increasing by one year, every seven years. Each year of increased life expectancy adds around 5% to a DB liability which needs to be funded by the plan sponsor, or in the government’s case, the tax payer. At a time when many Australian plans are poised to adopt a risk transfer strategy, this paper provides clarity and appreciation for the global markets approach to pension risk transfer and the hedging solutions that will be available to the Australian market.

ABOUT PRUDENTIAL OUR TRACK RECORD

"Pension risk transfer transactions exemplify our capabilities, culture of multi-disciplinary collaboration, and financial strength. It’s not only about pricing. It’s about the confidence a client has in a high-quality close and execution, and doing it on a timely basis. We have very good marks for this in the industry. I doubt that any other insurer has started as early or invested as heavily as we have in this area. . . it involves risks that we know and manage well."
— John R. Strangfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Prudential Financial, Inc.
KEEPING PROMISES
You can be assured that Prudential’s foremost objective is to help individuals and institutions achieve financial security and peace of mind—it is at the very heart of our philosophy. We have a proven track record of ensuring that pension plan sponsors and their participants have an extraordinary experience every step of the way.   

In 1928, Prudential completed a pension buy-out transaction with the Cleveland Public Library. In 2013, we celebrated the 85th anniversary of that transaction, with six of the original retirees still receiving pension payments. Jeannette Eckert is one of them. This is her story.
Story of Jeannette Eckert  




 

In 2012, Prudential assumed benefit payments for approximately 110,000 participants in the General Motors Retirement Program for Salaried Employees. Martin Darvick is one of those participants, and this is his story.

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

                                    Accelerate Pension Funding and De-risking Ahead of Tax Reform: A Less Taxing Exercise


                                    Corporate plan sponsors continue to grapple with the risks and rising costs associated with managing and maintaining their pension plans. With the possibility of corporate tax reform on the horizon, plan sponsors may have a unique opportunity now to reduce PBGC expenses by accelerating funding and to deduct contributions at the current higher tax rate, resulting in a low risk, positive net present value outcome.

                                    Means and Markets Have Aligned: Why You Should Consider De-risking Now


                                    A resurgent economy, strong equity markets and modestly higher interest rates are providing a tailwind to pension plan sponsors. The change in economic sentiment is driven in large part by expectations that companies will get a boost to cash flow from lower corporate tax rates, infrastructure spending and reduced regulations under the new administration.

But anyone looking at today's CMI model and believing they now know for certain that their liabilities are lower need to remember there is risk in retaining longevity exposure.

                                Recent publications by Prudential and others have focused on the “what” and the “why” of pension risk transfer, describing the types of solutions that are available and the trends that are driving increased interest in de-risking. After briefly recapping the what and why, this insight series will focus on the “how,” outlining the steps involved in the most complete form of pension risk transfer: a buy-out transaction. Whether or not a buy-out is imminent, there are preparations a plan sponsor can undertake to make a future transaction easier and to shorten the timeline for execution.

                                This insight series demonstrates that the conventional wisdom about de-risking DB plans is often false. Invalidating the five myths discussed in this paper can help broaden the range of options that DB plan sponsors are willing to evaluate when formulating their long-term pension strategies. A wider range of options is essential to providing sponsors with the flexibility they need to achieve their long-term DB objectives.

  A resurgent economy, strong equity markets and modestly higher interest rates are providing a tailwind to pension plan sponsors. The change in economic sentiment is driven in large part by expectations that companies will get a boost to cash flow from lower corporate tax rates, infrastructure spending and reduced regulations under the new administration.

Recently, however, plan sponsors have come to understand that an insurer’s service delivery capabilities are just as important as its financial strength and capacity.

  Increasing life expectancy is a contributing factor to the vulnerability of pension systems worldwide, helping drive many countries toward an impending retirement crisis. This article, however, asserts that increasing longevity may actually be an opportunity for creating economic growth and stability—but only if retirement systems adapt. Appearing in the February 2013 edition of European Pensions, the paper argues that by allowing individuals to work longer, linking the retirement age of social security systems with changes in healthy life expectancy, ensuring that employer-sponsored pension plans achieve sustainable risk profiles, and supporting employees in retirement planning, longer life can, in fact, help create sustainable retirement systems.

  A recent article by Pension & Investments discusses the impact of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board’s new pension rules on government bond ratings - specifically, a requirement to recognize unfunded net pension liabilities on the balance sheet. The article suggests plan sponsors’ credit ratings won’t be seriously affected because, in most cases, the ratings agencies already understand the reality of these underfunded liabilities.

After briefly recapping the what and why, this paper will focus on the “how,” outlining the steps involved in the most complete form of pension risk transfer: a buy-out transaction. Whether or not a buy-out is imminent, there are preparations a plan sponsor can undertake to make a future transaction easier and to shorten the timeline for execution.

  The Australian population’s life expectancy is increasing by one year, every seven years. Each year of increased life expectancy adds around 5% to a DB liability which needs to be funded by the plan sponsor, or in the government’s case, the tax payer. At a time when many Australian plans are poised to adopt a risk transfer strategy, this paper provides clarity and appreciation for the global markets approach to pension risk transfer and the hedging solutions that will be available to the Australian market.

ABOUT PRUDENTIAL OUR TRACK RECORD

"Pension risk transfer transactions exemplify our capabilities, culture of multi-disciplinary collaboration, and financial strength. It’s not only about pricing. It’s about the confidence a client has in a high-quality close and execution, and doing it on a timely basis. We have very good marks for this in the industry. I doubt that any other insurer has started as early or invested as heavily as we have in this area. . . it involves risks that we know and manage well."
— John R. Strangfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Prudential Financial, Inc.
KEEPING PROMISES
You can be assured that Prudential’s foremost objective is to help individuals and institutions achieve financial security and peace of mind—it is at the very heart of our philosophy. We have a proven track record of ensuring that pension plan sponsors and their participants have an extraordinary experience every step of the way.   

In 1928, Prudential completed a pension buy-out transaction with the Cleveland Public Library. In 2013, we celebrated the 85th anniversary of that transaction, with six of the original retirees still receiving pension payments. Jeannette Eckert is one of them. This is her story.
Story of Jeannette Eckert  




 

In 2012, Prudential assumed benefit payments for approximately 110,000 participants in the General Motors Retirement Program for Salaried Employees. Martin Darvick is one of those participants, and this is his story.
