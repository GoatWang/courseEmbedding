The 8.4% improvement in net income was primarily due to a 10.6% increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses, partially offset by a slight decline in noninterest income, and by a small increase in noninterest expenses.

For the six months, the company's total interest income was $19,845,000 against $18,391,000 a year ago. Income before income taxes was $8,503,000 against $7,643,000 a year ago.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc. Joins Russell 3000® Index






GlobeNewswire



Jun 26, 2017 8:30 AM EDT













 


















































 ARCHBOLD, Ohio, June 26, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:FMAO), the holding company for the Farmers & Merchants State Bank, today announced that it has been added to the broad-market Russell 3000 ® Index as a result of the Russell U.S. Indexes' annual reconstitution. "I am extremely pleased Farmers & Merchants was added to the Russell 3000 ® Index," commented Paul Siebenmorgen, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Our inclusion in the small-cap Russell 2000 ® Index reflects the significant growth we have achieved, as well as our recent uplisting to the NASDAQ Capital Market.  We believe F&M's trading liquidity and investor visibility will increase as a result of our membership in the small-cap Russell 2000 ® Index.  "To celebrate F&M's recent NASDAQ listing, financial growth, and inclusion in the Russell 2000 ®, members of F&M's leadership team and board of directors will ring the opening bell at the NASDAQ Stock Market in late July.  I am proud of all of our recent accomplishments and look forward to our continued success," concluded Mr. Siebenmorgen.  Annual Russell indexes reconstitution captures the 4,000 largest U.S. stocks as of the end of May, ranking them by total market capitalization. Membership in the U.S. all-cap Russell 3000® Index, which remains in place for one year, means automatic inclusion in the large-cap Russell 1000® Index or small-cap Russell 2000® Index as well as the appropriate growth and value style indexes. FTSE Russell determines membership for its Russell indexes primarily by objective, market-capitalization rankings and style attributes. Russell indexes are widely used by investment managers and institutional investors for index funds and as benchmarks for active investment strategies. Approximately $8.4 trillion in assets are benchmarked against Russell's U.S. indexes. Russell indexes are part of FTSE Russell, a leading global index provider.
