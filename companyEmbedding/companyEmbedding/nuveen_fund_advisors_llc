Risk Considerations
Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. There is no guarantee the Fund’s investment objectives will be achieved. This ETF seeks to generally track the investment results of an index; however the Fund may underperform, outperform or be more volatile than the referenced index. This Fund invests in REITS and real estate companies. The real estate industry is greatly affected by economic downturns or by changes in real estate values, rents, property taxes, interest rates, tax treatment, regulations, or the legal structure of the REIT. The value of equity securities may decline significantly over short or extended periods of time. The Fund’s assets will generally be concentrated in the securities of issuers in the real estate sector, and, accordingly, the Fund may be adversely affected by the performance of those securities, may be subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting that industry. These and other risk considerations, such as interest rate, non-diversification, and smaller company risks, are described in detail in the Fund’s prospectus.

Returns quoted represent past performance which is no guarantee of future performance. Current performance may be lower or higher than the data shown. Total returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative. All other figures represent average annual total returns. Fund performance figures assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions; the figures are pre-tax and net of expenses. Market price returns are based on the closing market price on the date shown.

No-Action Letter: Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC (June 20, 2017)






















Home | Previous Page


























Investment Company Act of 1940 — Section 15(a)
Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC
June 20, 2017
Response of the Chief Counsel's Office
Division of Investment Management
Your letter dated June 19, 2017 requests our assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against NWQ Investment Management Company, LLC (�NWQ�) under Section 15(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the �1940 Act�) if, under the circumstances described in your letter, NWQ continued to serve as investment adviser to certain series of the Nuveen Investment Trust and Nuveen Investment Trust II (the �Trusts�) pursuant to written investment sub-advisory agreements that were not approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such series.[1]
Background
You state the following:

Nuveen Tradewinds Value Opportunities Fund and Nuveen Tradewinds Global All-Cap Fund (the �Funds�) are series of the Trusts.  The Trusts are registered with the Commission as open-end management investment companies.  Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC (�Nuveen Fund Advisors�) serves as investment adviser to the Funds.[2]  Prior to August 1, 2016, Tradewinds Global Investors, LLC (�Tradewinds�) served as sub-adviser to the Funds.  Nuveen Investments, Inc. (�Nuveen�) owns a controlling interest in Nuveen Fund Advisors, Tradewinds, and NWQ.
In May 2016, Nuveen decided to wind up operations at Tradewinds due in large part to significant asset outflows that commenced following the departure of Tradewinds� President and Chief Investment Officer and persisted thereafter.  As part of a transition plan, at an in-person meeting held in the same month, the Trusts� Board of Trustees (the �Board�) approved the termination of each Fund�s sub-advisory agreement with Tradewinds, effective as of August 1, 2016.  As of the same date, the Board also appointed NWQ as sub-adviser to the Funds, pursuant to interim investment sub-advisory agreements (each, an �Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement�) as permitted by Rule 15a-4 under the 1940 Act.  Each Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement was scheduled to terminate no later than December 29, 2016 (the �Expiration Date�), thus providing for the longest interim period permitted under the rule.
Also at the May 2016 meeting, the Board considered various long-term alternatives, including liquidation of the Funds, and determined that the Funds� reorganization into Nuveen NWQ Global Equity Income Fund (each, a �Reorganization�) was in the best interests of each Fund.[3]  In the event a Fund�s Reorganization was not approved by shareholders and consummated prior to the Expiration Date, the Board also approved the longer-term appointment of NWQ as the sub-adviser to each Fund pursuant to a new sub-advisory agreement (each, a �New Sub-Advisory Agreement�).  
With a joint proxy statement/prospectus dated September 23, 2016, each Fund solicited shareholders to approve (1) its Reorganization and (2) the New Sub-Advisory Agreement (each, a �Proposal�).  After the joint proxy statement/prospectus was mailed, Nuveen Fund Advisors and the Funds actively solicited votes through direct mailings and the use of an experienced and well-respected proxy solicitor in an effort to achieve a quorum for each Fund.
As of November 8, 2016, an overwhelming majority of the votes received by the Funds� shareholders were cast in favor of both Proposals.  Nuveen Fund Advisors, however, believed that, despite all the efforts made, there was a high probability that neither Fund would receive the number of votes necessary to reach a quorum by the Expiration Date.[4]

Accordingly, as of November 29, 2016, you requested assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action against NWQ under Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act if NWQ continued to serve as sub-adviser to the Funds for the Additional Period (as described below) pursuant to written investment sub-advisory agreements that had not been approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Funds.
Analysis
Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act states, in relevant part, that it shall be unlawful for a person to serve as an investment adviser of a registered investment company, except pursuant to a written contract that, among other things, has been approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such registered investment company.[5]  Section 15(a) was adopted to give fund shareholders a voice in approving fund investment advisory contracts and to prevent trafficking in fund advisory contracts.[6]
Rule 15a-4 under the 1940 Act provides a temporary exemption from the shareholder approval requirement in Section 15(a) where, among other circumstances, the registered investment company�s board of directors has terminated the previous advisory contract.  The rule permits a person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company under an interim advisory agreement without the required shareholder approval for a period no greater than 150 days following the date on which the previous contract terminated subject to the requirements set forth in the rule.  Rule 15a-4 was designed to prevent registered investment companies from being harmed by losing investment advisory services before shareholders can approve a new investment advisory contract.[7]
You proposed to have NWQ continue to serve as investment sub-adviser to each Fund for an additional period of time following the interim period allowed by Rule 15a-4, but not to exceed the earliest of: (i) the consummation of the Reorganization; (ii) shareholder approval of the Fund�s New Sub-Advisory Agreement; or (iii) 60 days after the Expiration Date (the �Additional Period�).[8] 
Nuveen Fund Advisors and the Trusts believed that extending the term of the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreements was in the best interests of the Funds, and the Board approved such extension.  Without such an extension, you argue that it may have been necessary to liquidate the Funds.[9]
As conditions to the requested relief, the Funds and Nuveen Fund Advisors agreed to the following during the Additional Period:

Nuveen Fund Advisors and the Funds, with the assistance of their proxy solicitor, would continue their proxy solicitation efforts to seek to reach a quorum.  Nuveen Fund Advisors would bear all postage, printing, tabulation and proxy solicitation costs during the Additional Period.
Nuveen Fund Advisors would waive the portion of each Fund�s investment advisory fee in an amount equal to the amount of the sub-advisory fee that would have been payable by Nuveen Fund Advisors to NWQ under the original terms of the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement.
Other than changes to reflect the relief granted, the terms and conditions of the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreements would remain the same.

Conclusion
On the basis of the facts and representations set forth in your letter, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against NWQ under Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act for continuing to serve as investment adviser to each Fund for the Additional Period pursuant to written investment sub-advisory agreements that were not approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund.
This response expresses our views on enforcement action only and does not express any legal conclusions on the questions presented.  Because our position is based on the facts and representations in your letter, you should note that any different facts or representations may require a different conclusion.
Jill Ehrlich
Senior Counsel



[1] This letter confirms oral no-action relief that the staff provided to Deborah Bielicke Eades, Esq., of VedderPrice P.C. on November 29, 2016.


[2] Nuveen Fund Advisors� investment advisory agreements with the Funds comply in all respects with Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act, including having been approved by a vote of a majority of the Funds� outstanding voting securities. 


[3] Nuveen Fund Advisors and NWQ serve as the investment adviser and investment sub-adviser, respectively, of Nuveen NWQ Global Equity Income Fund.


[4] In particular, you state that several factors likely contributed to the failure to reach a quorum, including: (1) the level of redemptions since the record date for the shareholder meeting; (2) a higher than typical percentage of each Fund�s shares represented by objecting beneficial owners as of the record date; and (3) each Fund�s shareholder base was more dispersed than is typical.  


[5] Section 15(a) applies to investment advisers as defined in Section 2(a)(20)(A) and (B) of the 1940 Act, which includes both primary advisers and sub-advisers. 


[6] See Hearings on S. 3580 Before the Subcomm. of the Senate Comm. on Banking and Currency, 76th Cong., 3d. Sess. 253 (1940) (statement of David Schenker).  See also Temporary Exemption for Certain Investment Advisers, Investment Company Act Release No. 24177 at n.4 (Nov. 29, 1999) (�Adopting Release�).


[7] See Adopting Release at n.6 and accompanying text.  


[8] At a shareholder meeting held on December 29, 2016, Nuveen Tradewinds Global All-Cap Fund achieved a quorum and shareholders approved the New Sub-Advisory Agreement.  At a shareholder meeting held on January 26, 2017, Nuveen Tradewinds Value Opportunities Fund achieved a quorum and shareholders approved the New Sub-Advisory Agreement.   



[9] You represent that Nuveen Fund Advisors does not have the requisite infrastructure in place to manage the Funds� portfolios directly, and it would have been impracticable to establish such infrastructure prior to the Expiration Date.

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

Nuveen, formerly Nuveen Investments, is a division of TIAA, operating in asset management. Nuveen was founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1898 and was previously named The John Nuveen Co., after founder John Nuveen. In October 2014, TIAA-CREF completed their purchase of Nuveen.
Nuveen started in the municipal bond underwriting business and remains active in municipal bond market. Nuveen sells services including separately managed accounts, retail mutual funds and closed-end funds. Nuveen has $882 billion in assets under management.[1]

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
