 Educational Background



Bachelor of Arts 


Brown University

                  Brown University is located in historic Providence, Rhode Island and was founded in 1764. It is the seventh-oldest college in the United States. Brown is an independent, coeducational Ivy League institution comprising undergraduate and graduate programs, plus the Alpert Medical School, School of Public Health, School of Engineering, and the School of Professional Studies.                




Juris Doctor 


University of Utah - S. J. Quinney College of Law

                  S.J. Quinney College of Law is a school.                





 Career History



Executive Vice President, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary

                                    2012 - Current                


Novagold Resources Inc.


                  NovaGold Resources Inc. (NYSE-AMEX, TSX: NG) capped a successful year of achieving key milestones at all of its projects by announcing a strategic plan to unlock the value of its world-class suite of mining development and exploration assets.

The Company is focused on permitting and developing its 50%-owned flagship property, Donlin Gold, one of the world's largest known undeveloped gold deposits. NovaGold is also committed to maximizing value of its non-core assets and is currently exploring opportunities to sell its interest in the Galore Creek copper-gold-silver project in British Columbia, Canada. Its interest in NovaCopper Inc., which held its interest in the Ambler District, also known as the Upper Kobuk Mineral Project, was spun out to shareholders of NovaGold on April 30, 2012.

As envisioned, NovaGold is now a well-financed, jurisdictionally secure Company well on its way of becoming a pure gold play exclusively focused on the advancement of Donlin Gold.

Donlin Gold, which is equally and jointly held with Barrick Gold Corporation — the world's largest gold company — is a uniquely attractive asset. In terms of the combined size, grade, exploration potential, production profile and jurisdiction, it is quite possibly the most important gold development project in the world today. Donlin Gold has approximately 39 million ounces of gold mineral resources, inclusive of mineral reserves (541 million tonnes at 2.24 g/t), not including an additional approximately six million ounces of inferred mineral resources (92 million tonnes at 2.0 g/t) with tremendous growth opportunities.¹

These numbers already place Donlin Gold well within the top 1% of known global gold deposits in terms of size. Yet, more potential exists. With the current mineral estimates from along just two miles of a well-established mineralized corridor that is five miles long, the site will undoubtedly yield further discoveries. Once in production, Donlin Gold should be the largest gold mine among seven major producing mines in Alaska.

NovaGold is well-financed with a cash balance of approximately US$350 million, which is sufficient to take Donlin Gold through permitting. Management has expertise in permitting, mine development, and operations and a track record for delivering projects on time and on budget.

Committed to responsible development and operating to the highest environmental standards, we act with a long-term view, creating mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, employees, investors, partners and other people critical to our success and the economic development of Alaska

About










Achievements






I was responsible for the project that enabled Redback Networks to succeed after the downturn in the economy in 2000 - I built a team consisting of key personnel from the legacy product and key personnel from the new edge router (that was not selling due to the economic downturn), and developed and released a new subscriber management/edge router.  Acted as the functional manager for team, the project manager for the project, interfaced with Product Management on prioritizing function/features,  while still acting as Director for functional teams on legacy product.  I was able to effectively delegate responsibility when appropriate to succeed.  The biggest challenge was overcoming a certain amount of "us and them" mentality that existed in the company because of two different separate product teams under two different VPs.  The product enabled Redback to recapture part of the market, become profitable, and eventually the company was sold to Ericsson for 2.3B.
