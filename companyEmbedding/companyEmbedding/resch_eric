Grand Chute - Grand Grand Chute - Grand Chute police have arrested two Illinois men for allegedly selling fake tickets on Craiglist to Saturday's Eric Church concert at the Resch Center. Investigators have spoken with multiple victims, and they believe more people may have been scammed.
Police say the thieves advertised the fraudulent tickets on Craigslist and then met with their victims in Grand Chute to complete the transaction.
Police are recommending theft by fraud charges for both suspects.
If you think you're a victim, or if you have any information about this ticket scam, call Grand Chute police at (920) 832-1575. 
This is a sad reminder there are scam artists out there. Please be careful when purchasing tickets. The only safe way is to buy directly from the venue or the official ticketing agency of the venue you're attending. 
This event has a 6 ticket limit per household regardless of the time(s) of purchase.   Orders exceeding the ticket limit will be canceled without notice.  Some ticket options may not have a choice in delivery.  The box office reserves the right to adjust delivery methods and barcodes on any ticket order.  Customers will be notified if their order has been adjusted.  There are no box office or outlet sales for this tour.

Event Description

Eric Church Brings 2017 Holdin’ My Own Tour To Green Bay, WI!
For the first time ever, there will be no support act on this tour. Eric Church and the ECB will play two full sets with an intermission in between. In an effort to ensure his core fans get great tickets at face value, Church is revamping the pre-sale and on-sale process to eliminate scalpers from the equation. 
 
“In this era where growing inequality seems to be the norm, we wanted to do everything within our power to put the advantage back in the hands of true fans rather than those that take advantage of the system, and by extension our people,” said John Peets, Church’s manager. “It was important to us to invest time into evaluating and redesigning the ticket buying process and build the technology to level the playing field.”
  
Church has secured a larger allotment of fan club tickets than in the past so Church Choir members will have much better success buying tickets in the pre-sale.  The Church Choir pre-sale will be the ONLY pre-sale. There will be no venue, credit card or radio pre-sales. Church and his team developed a new fan club pre-sale system that allows them to remove scalpers from the pre-sale process before it even happens. Scalpers that are found to be gaming the system and posing as real fans won’t receive the buy link at all. 
 
As on past tours, Church will continue to cancel any and all orders found to be made by scalpers.  New for the Holdin’ My Own Tour, Church commissioned a proprietary technology that scrubs ticket purchases using up to 10 different data points and automatically flags orders made by scalpers.  Orders may be cancelled at any time and without warning.  Church cautions fans to stay away from the secondary market because it’s likely that tickets found there will be invalid by the time the show happens.
 
Finally, delivery of all ticket orders will be delayed until the days leading up to each show.  Church hopes that this will make it impossible for scalpers to complete their transactions. 
 
By doing this – investing time and energy to create a more efficient and balanced model – the Church team is not only communicating directly to the fans the best source for face value tickets, but also building a model that protects fans and can be adopted by the industry as a whole.
 
“The way this album came together mandated we release it as a surprise, straight to our fans, as it was important for me to deliver the music the same way the creativity hit me—directly and swiftly. What I didn’t anticipate is that it left me scratching my head a little as this year was supposed to be spent writing.”  Church continues, “What this year’s open schedule did afford us was time to think through the way the fans experience our music live, and it was important to us that we find a way to stick to these same principles when it came to approaching our shows, down to the way they go on sale.”
  
Church’s 2014-2015’s The Outsiders World Tour topped Billboard's Hot Tours consistently after Church set new attendance records in five markets including Chicago's Allstate Arena on March 20 with 18,626 present. Church also shattered Nashville's Bridgestone Arena attendance on January 10 with an unprecedented 18,411 fans assembled, surpassing The Blue Collar Comedy Tour’s record set on Feb. 2006. On April 7, 2015 he also broke the attendance record at Grand Forks, N.D.’s Ralph Engelstad Arena, which was previously set by Sir Elton John's 2012 show. The Outsiders World Tour saw Church performing to over 800,000 fans in more than 65 cities with nearly 20 stops from September 2014 through September of ‘15 and was named one ofRolling Stone Magazine’s Must-See Tours.

The Interview

Resch
Stone Creek Coffee’s four co-owners recently decided to expand the coffee business into Madison and Chicago, as well as open new cafes in the Milwaukee market. Stone Creek will open a cafe in July in Wauwatosa, in November on Downer Avenue in Milwaukee, and two in Chicago in spring 2018, bringing the total to 15 stores. BizTimes managing editor Molly Dill caught up with Eric Resch, founder and co-owner of Stone Creek, about the company’s growth streak.
How did you decide it was time to start expanding into other markets, and how did you choose Chicago and Madison?
“Why new markets? Why climb a mountain? Because it challenges you; because it’s full of unknowns; because it helps you grow.
“We chose Madison and Chicago, ultimately, because they were close to home. We could drive there in a day, we could visit our cafes, we could serve our customers, we could serve our stores out of the Stone Creek factory in Milwaukee. We do buy local fresh bakery in Madison. We’ll do the same thing in Chicago. And then at some point, if our business continues to grow in Chicago, we would build a Stone Creek roastery and then potentially, a Stone Creek kitchen. That’s where we make all our coffee-centric foods.”
How does Stone Creek differentiate itself in a crowded coffee market?
“On the retail side of our business, we focus on three primary things: No. 1, the quality of our coffee that we try to produce – we call it sweet, clean and juicy. The second is to build beautiful cafes – places that you want to come see and spend time. The third is creating a very welcoming space and just having professional level baristas there every day all day to serve our customers.
“One other thing that is an umbrella statement: We have a saying at Stone Creek that is ‘Never stop learning.’ It’s really a celebration of failure. We welcome and encourage crazy ideas, we’re willing to try things, we prototype the ideas as quickly as we can.”
What are some examples of celebrated Stone Creek failures?
“For a while, we actually had a fail wall – a wall where we would post big and small failures. It would go from anything from the first time we shipped a container of coffee from Tanzania, it got lost and ended up in a port that we didn’t know it was going to and the coffee got too hot, all the way to trying to develop a new coffee with rose petals on top that just didn’t work.
“Failure is a strong word. It’s more about encouraging new things, trying new things. They’re simply just exercises in learning.”
Stone Creek has a flat leadership structure. Has that become more challenging as the company has grown?
“We didn’t used to have that. It was more of a traditional hierarchy. We actually put this in place about three years ago because as the entrepreneur or the original founder of the company, I was out of bandwidth. Now it’s sort of mass chaos with a reasonable amount of control and feedback loops. It’s up to each team to accomplish their goals and we have a shared understanding of what their goals are. But it’s up to them to go find the resources and the partners to accomplish those goals.”
Has that structure ever backfired or been a challenge for you?
“I would say for me individually, it’s been a challenge because I had to change my habits. As the founder of the company, I have a tendency to want to control things. I think for some individuals who want to be told what to do, it can feel unstructured and difficult. Because the structure rewards those who kind of stand up and go do something.”
