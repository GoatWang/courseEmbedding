MARKETING
PowerVerde does not plan to launch a world-wide marketing or distributor system initially.
    After the new system is validated, a Sales and Marketing team will be hired.  PowerVerde
    will concentrate on the industrial waste heat market because of the many contacts
    and locations identified by Hank Leibowitz.  The established market of methane powered
    generators on dairy farms is also a natural end user of the PowerVerde co-generation
    systems.  
A presently identified and extensive customer base assures contacts for the PowerVerde
    Marketing team.  As interest and demonstrated product acceptance accelerates, PowerVerde
    will phase in a world-wide sales and marketing strategy.
Companies or individuals interested in exploring sales or marketing opportunities
    should contact PowerVerde.
