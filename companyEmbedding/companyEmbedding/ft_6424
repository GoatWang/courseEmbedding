GREAT PRODUCT
URCHASED THE 8 X 12. 5 SHED AND 2 EXTENSIONS FOR A TOTAL OF 17. 5. I MADE A PLATFORM OUT OF 6X6 WITH 2X6 FLOOR JOIST AT 12' INSTEAD OF 16' AND A DOUBLE FLOOR. INTEND TO HOUSE MY FOUR WHEELER ALONG WITH OTHER THINGS. WITH THE HELP OF MY FRIEND WE HAD THE ENTIRE SHED UP IN SIX AND A HALF HOURS. THE WHOLE DEAL IS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A LEVEL BASE AND IT GOES UP WITHOUT A HITCH. THE WALLS GO UP IN NO TIME FLAT , SNAP THEM TOGETHER AND AWAY YOU GO. IT TOOK LONGER TO PUT ALL THE ROOF TRUSSES TOGETHER, THEN IT DID TO SNAP THE WALLS IN PLACE. THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE OK, BUT TO A NOVICE THEY MAY BE A LITTLE CONFUSING , BUT ITS , NO BIG DEAL. ONLY THING THAT I DID DIFFERENT WAS I INSTALLED THE DOOR HINGES FIRST, THEN LIFTED THE DOOR DOWN OVER THE HINGE, BECAUSE IT WAS HARD TO LOCATE THE SLOT FOR THE COTTER PIN. THE ROOF WHEN ON WITHOUT A HITCH. I M RETIRED AND DO REMODELING ON THE SIDE. I TOYED WITH BUILDING A STICK SHED OVER THIS. IT WOULD HAVE COST ME MORE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LABOR INTENSIVE. NEXT SPRING AFTER OUR SNOW IS GONE I PLAN TO ADD TWO MORE EXTENSIONS ON.  YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH SHED. IT IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE OUT THERE. KUDOS TO THE GUYS WHO THOUGHT OF THIS

Great Product!
I bought our original 8 X 5 building 7 years ago and decided to buy two expansion kits for it. They went together beautifully, no problems at all. Glad we did it. . . our new storage shed is now 8 X 10. It really looks nice! Originally posted on 8' Shed Extension Kit 30"

Great For Expanding
Bottom Line: Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. I recently bought a 8 x 12. 5 shed and one of the reasons I decided to purchase the Lifetime shed, was you can purchase these expansion kits to add more space. Directions weren't that difficult but you have to dismantle the back two sections of the roof and the last back wall panels, then slide the back section away from the front before you can add on. Makes sense structure wise but a bit of a hassle. After that installation was easy. Fits exactly into the original shed. 2 1/2 ft made a huge difference in space. Took about 5 hours to do this

Looks Great!
The expansion looks great from the outside but the product was missing the wall supports and the floor was completely different than the original floor pattern, overall the product is good. I called about the missing parts (wall supports) and they shipped immediately, I received them in a couple of days. Originally posted on 8' Shed Extension Kit 30"

 Q: Do I need to move the boxes myself?
 Asked by: Admin


 
			  - 8/12/2015 12:49:46 AM

 A: A curbside delivery means the driver brings the product to your address. Most of the freight companies used to deliver these Lifetime storage buildings come equipped with a lift gate. A lift gate is a piece of equipment on the back of the truck that lowers the boxes to the ground. While this piece of equipment is common on delivery trucks, we encourage you to assume the worst case scenario and have sufficient help on hand to remove the boxes 1 at a time from the truck.
