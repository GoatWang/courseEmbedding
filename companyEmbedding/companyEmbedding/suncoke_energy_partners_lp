(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements of expected future developments, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and industry that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our future results and financial condition may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements." This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and certain other financial data that is prepared using non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP components, see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" at the end of this Item, and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.  Table of Contents  The following table sets forth information about our cokemaking facilities and our coke, steam and energy sales agreements as of June 30, 2017:   Annual Cokemaking Coke Year of Contract Number of Capacity Facility Location Customer Start Up Expiration Coke Ovens (thousands of tons) Use of Waste Heat Granite City U.S. Steel 2009 2025 120 650 Steam for power Granite City, Illinois generation Haverhill I Franklin Furnace, Ohio ArcelorMittal 2005 2020 100 550 Process steam Haverhill II Franklin Furnace, Ohio AK Steel 2008 2022 100 550 Power generation Middletown(1) Middletown, Ohio AK Steel 2011 2032 100 550 Power generation Total 420 2,300  (1) Cokemaking capacity represents stated capacity for the production of blast furnace coke. The Middletown coke sales agreement provides for coke sales on a "run of oven" basis, which includes both blast furnace coke and small coke. Middletown nameplate capacity on a "run of oven" basis is 578 thousand tons per year.  We also provide coal handling and/or mixing services with our coal logistics business, which has collective capacity to mix and/or transload approximately 40 million tons of coal annually and store approximately 3 million tons. CMT is one of the largest export terminals on the U.S. gulf coast and has direct rail access and the capability to transload approximately 15 million tons of coal annually through its operations in Convent, Louisiana. The facility is supported by long-term, take-or-pay contracts with volume commitments covering 10 million tons of its current capacity. KRT is a leading metallurgical and thermal coal mixing and handling terminal service provider with collective capacity to mix and transload approximately 25 million tons of coal annually through its operations in West Virginia. Our terminal located in East Chicago, Indiana, Lake Terminal, provides coal handling and mixing services to SunCoke's Indiana Harbor cokemaking operations. Coal is transported from the mine site in numerous ways, including rail, truck, barge or ship. Our coal terminals act as intermediaries between coal producers and coal end users by providing transloading, storage and mixing services. We do not take possession of coal in our coal logistics business, but instead earn revenue by providing coal handling and/or mixing services to our customers on a fee per ton basis. We provide mixing and handling services to steel, coke (including some of our and SunCoke's domestic cokemaking facilities), electric utility and coal producing customers.  Table of Contents  Recent Developments  In April 2017, SunCoke announced the termination of discussions with the Conflicts Committee of our Board of Directors regarding its proposal to acquire all of the Partnership's common units not already owned by SunCoke ("Simplification Transaction"), announced on October 31, 2016. The Conflicts Committee and its independent advisors reviewed the proposal made by SunCoke and had several discussions with SunCoke regarding the potential transaction. At this time, the parties determined that they will not be able to reach an agreement and have therefore terminated discussions regarding the proposed Simplification Transaction.  See "Items Impacting Comparability" below for further details on the Partnership's debt refinancing.   Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Increase Increase 2017 2016 (Decrease) 2017 2016 (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Sales and other operating revenue(1) $ 200.6 $ 181.4 $ 19.2 $ 396.2 $ 375.9 $ 20.3 Net cash provided by operating activities(2) $ 12.2 $ 67.7 $ (55.5 ) $ 51.6 $ 108.1 $ (56.5 ) Adjusted EBITDA(1) $ 43.0 $ 41.7 $ 1.3 $ 94.7 $ 89.9 $ 4.8  (1) See analysis of changes described in "Analysis of Segment Results."  (2) See analysis of changes described in "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  Items Impacting Comparability Debt Activities. During the second quarter of 2017, the Partnership refinanced its debt obligations. The Partnership received $620.6 million of proceeds, net of an original issue discount of $9.4 million, from the issuance of the 7.5 percent 2025 Partnership Notes and $100.0 million of proceeds from borrowings under the Partnership's amended and restated credit facility. The Partnership used these proceeds to purchase and redeem all of its 7.375 percent 2020 Partnership Notes, including principal of $463.0 million and a premium of $18.7 million, to repay the $50.0 million outstanding on the Partnership Term Loan and to repay $172.0 million on the Partnership Revolver. In connection with the debt issuance, the Partnership incurred debt issuance costs of $14.8 million, which were included in long-term debt and financing obligation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2017.  As a result of the debt refinancing, the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 included a loss on extinguishment of debt on the Consolidated Statement of Operations of $19.9 million, which consisted primarily of the premium paid of $18.7 million.   IRS Final Regulations on Qualifying Income. In January 2017, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") announced its decision to exclude cokemaking as a qualifying income generating activity in its final regulations (the "Final Regulations") issued under section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the qualifying income exception for publicly traded partnerships. However, the Final Regulations include a transition period for activities that were reasonably interpreted to be qualifying income and carried on by publicly traded partnerships prior to the Final Regulations. The Partnership previously received a will-level opinion from its counsel, Vinson  Table of Contents  & Elkins LLP, that the Partnership's cokemaking operations generated qualifying income prior to the Final Regulations. Therefore, the Partnership believes it had a reasonable basis to conclude its cokemaking operations were considered qualifying income before the issuance of the new regulations and as such expects to maintain its treatment as a partnership through the transition period. Cokemaking entities in the Partnership will become taxable as corporations on January 1, 2028, after the transition period ends.   Pass Through Coal Cost Under-Recovery. During the fourth quarter of 2016, as part of our ordinary course coal sourcing activities, Haverhill, Middletown and AK Steel each entered into arrangements with a coal supplier for 2017 fulfillment. As a result of unfulfilled coal supply commitments by this coal supplier, substitute coal suppliers are currently meeting the shortfall, resulting in a higher price. Presently, we are aggressively pursuing the coal supplier and sharing a portion of the increased coal cost differential with AK Steel, resulting in a negative impact to revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 million and $2.8 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. We expect this impact to lower revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Contingent Consideration. In connection with the CMT acquisition, the Partnership entered into a contingent consideration arrangement that requires the Partnership to make future payments to The Cline Group based on future volumes over a specified threshold, price, and contract renewals. During the first quarter of 2016, the Partnership amended the contingent consideration terms with The Cline Group, which resulted in a $3.7 million gain recognized as a reduction to costs of products sold and operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations The following table sets forth amounts from the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Increase Increase 2017 2016 (Decrease) 2017 2016 (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Revenues Sales and other operating revenue $ 200.6 $ 181.4 $ 19.2 $ 396.2 $ 375.9 $ 20.3 Costs and operating expenses Cost of products sold and operating expenses 149.4 128.6 20.8 284.8 262.8 22.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 8.5 11.1 (2.6 ) 17.0 19.5 (2.5 ) Depreciation and amortization expense 21.5 20.5 1.0 43.1 39.2 3.9 Total costs and operating expenses 179.4 160.2 19.2 344.9 321.5 23.4 Operating income 21.2 21.2 - 51.3 54.4 (3.1 ) Interest expense, net 14.0 11.7 2.3 26.6 24.2 2.4 Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt(1) 19.9 (3.5 ) 23.4 19.9 (23.9 ) 43.8 (Loss) income before income tax (benefit) expense (12.7 ) 13.0 (25.7 ) 4.8 54.1 (49.3 ) Income tax (benefit) expense (0.2 ) 0.4 (0.6 ) 149.0 1.0 148.0 Net (loss) income (12.5 ) 12.6 (25.1 ) (144.2 ) 53.1 (197.3 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.4 0.5 (0.1 ) (2.0 ) 1.2 (3.2 ) Net (loss) income attributable to SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P. $ (12.9 ) $ 12.1 $ (25.0 ) $ (142.2 ) $ 51.9 $ (194.1 )  (1) See year-over-year changes described in "Items Impacting Comparability."  Total Revenues. Sales and other operating revenue increased for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same prior year periods. These increases were primarily due to the pass-through of higher coal prices in our Domestic Coke segment as well as higher sales volumes in our Coal Logistics segment.  Table of Contents  Noncontrolling Interest. Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents SunCoke's retained ownership interest in our cokemaking facilities. The decrease in net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was driven by the impact of the IRS Final Regulations previously described in "Items Impacting Comparability." Results of Reportable Business Segments   Domestic Coke consists of our Haverhill, Middletown and Granite City cokemaking and heat recovery operations located in Franklin Furnace, Ohio; Middletown, Ohio; and Granite City, Illinois, respectively. Coal Logistics consists of our coal handling and/or mixing services in East Chicago, Indiana; Ceredo, West Virginia; Belle, West Virginia; and Convent, Louisiana.  The operations of each of our segments are described at the beginning of the MD&A.  Table of Contents  Segment Operating Data The following tables set forth financial and operating data for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Increase Increase 2017 2016 (Decrease) 2017 2016 (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Sales and other operating revenues: Domestic Coke $ 182.0 $ 167.5 $ 14.5 $ 355.2 $ 346.4 $ 8.8 Coal Logistics 18.6 13.9 4.7 41.0 29.5 11.5 Coal Logistics intersegment sales 1.5 1.7 (0.2 ) 3.3 3.2 0.1 Elimination of intersegment sales (1.5 ) (1.7 ) 0.2 (3.3 ) (3.2 ) (0.1 ) Total Sales and other operating revenues $ 200.6 $ 181.4 $ 19.2 $ 396.2 $ 375.9 $ 20.3 Adjusted EBITDA(1): Domestic Coke $ 37.5 $ 41.1 $ (3.6 ) $ 80.0 $ 87.4 (7.4 ) Coal Logistics 9.6 5.3 4.3 22.6 11.2 11.4 Corporate and Other (4.1 ) (4.7 ) 0.6 (7.9 ) (8.7 ) 0.8 Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 43.0 $ 41.7 $ 1.3 $ 94.7 $ 89.9 $ 4.8 Coke Operating Data: Domestic Coke capacity utilization (%) 98 101 (3 ) 99 102 (3 ) . . .

LISLE, Ill., July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 

Net loss attributable to SXCP was $12.9 million in the second quarter 2017, down $25.0 million versus the prior year period primarily driven by $19.9 million of debt extinguishment costs related to our debt refinancing activities in the current year period 
Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXCP was $42.2 million for the quarter, up $1.3 million versus the prior year period 
Second quarter 2017 Distributable Cash Flow ("DCF") and Distribution Cash Coverage Ratio ("Cash Coverage") of $18.0 million and 0.61x, respectively, include $8.4 million repayment of deferred corporate costs and IDRs to SXC; excluding the repayment, DCF and Cash Coverage were $26.4 million and 0.89x, respectively 
Declared second quarter 2017 distribution of $0.5940 per unit 
Reaffirm full-year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXCP guidance of $210 million to $220 million









SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE:    SXCP) today reported results for the second quarter 2017, which reflect comparable consolidated operating results and current period charges related to debt refinancing completed in the quarter.
"Our second quarter operating performance finished in line with our expectations and positions us to achieve our financial guidance targets in 2017," said Fritz Henderson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P.  "Additionally, in the quarter we successfully completed our debt refinancing which extends our revolver and note maturities and provides the flexibility to execute our growth and capital allocation strategies going forward."

Revenues in second quarter 2017 increased $19.2 million from the same prior year period, reflecting the pass-through of higher coal prices in our Domestic Coke segment as well as higher sales volumes in our Coal Logistics segment.
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter increased $1.3 million primarily due to higher sales volumes in our Coal Logistics segment as compared to the same prior year period. This improvement was partially offset by the impacts of a planned outage at our Granite City facility in the current quarter. 
Net loss attributable to SXCP in the second quarter 2017 was $12.9 million, compared to a net gain of $12.1 million in the prior year period.  This $25.0 million change is primarily driven by $19.9 million of debt extinguishment costs related to our debt refinancing activities in the current year period, compared to $3.5 million of debt extinguishment gains recorded in the prior year period.
SECOND QUARTER SEGMENT INFORMATION
Domestic Coke
Domestic Coke consists of cokemaking facilities and heat recovery operations at our Haverhill, Middletown and Granite City cokemaking facilities, located in Franklin Furnace and Middletown, Ohio, and Granite City, Illinois, respectively.

Revenues increased $14.5 million, reflecting the pass-through of higher coal prices in our Domestic Coke segment, partially offset by lower energy sales due to the planned outage at our Granite City facility in the current year period. 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.6 million, driven primarily by lower energy sales and higher operating and maintenance spend for the planned Granite City outage described above.

Coal Logistics
Coal Logistics consists of the coal handling and mixing services operated by SXCP at Convent Marine Terminal ("CMT") located on the Mississippi river in Louisiana, Lake Terminal in East Chicago, Indiana and Kanawha River Terminals, LLC ("KRT"), which has terminals along the Ohio and Kanawha rivers in West Virginia.

Corporate and Other
Corporate and other expenses improved $0.6 million to $4.1 million due to lower spending on professional services in the current year period.

DEFINITIONS

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for changes to our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of CMT and the expiration of certain acquired contractual obligations.  Adjusted EBITDA does not represent and should not be considered an alternative to net income or operating income under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures in other businesses.  Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of the operating performance and liquidity of the Partnership's net assets and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions.  Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures and because it eliminates items that have less bearing on our operating performance and liquidity.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 
Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXCP equals Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
Distributable Cash Flow equals Adjusted EBITDA plus sponsor support and Coal Logistics deferred revenue; less net cash paid for interest expense, ongoing capital expenditures, accruals for replacement capital expenditures and cash distributions to noncontrolling interests; plus amounts received under the Omnibus Agreement and acquisition expenses deemed to be Expansion Capital under our Partnership Agreement.  Distributable Cash Flow is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that management and external users of SXCP's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies use to assess: 

SXCP's operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships, without regard to historical cost basis; 
the ability of SXCP's assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to SXCP's unitholders; 
SXCP's ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and 
the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.


We believe that Distributable Cash Flow provides useful information to investors in assessing SXCP's financial condition and results of operations.  Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.  Distributable Cash Flow has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities and used in investing activities.  Additionally, because Distributable Cash Flow may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, our definition of Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.

Ongoing capital expenditures ("capex") are capital expenditures made to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and/or to extend their useful lives.  Ongoing capex also includes new equipment that improves the efficiency, reliability or effectiveness of existing assets.  Ongoing capex does not include normal repairs and maintenance, which are expensed as incurred, or significant capital expenditures. For purposes of calculating distributable cash flow, the portion of ongoing capex attributable to SXCP is used and includes capital expenditures included in working capital at the end of the period. 
Replacement capital expenditures ("capex") represents an annual accrual necessary to fund SXCP's share of the estimated costs to replace or rebuild our facilities at the end of their working lives. This accrual is estimated based on the average quarterly anticipated replacement capital that we expect to incur over the long term to replace our major capital assets at the end of their working lives.  The replacement capex accrual estimate will be subject to review and prospective change by SXCP's general partner at least annually and whenever an event occurs that causes a material adjustment of replacement capex, provided such change is approved by our conflicts committee.

 (1) 
 The Partnership recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt as a result of its debt refinancing activities during the second quarter of 2017. The Partnership recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt as a result of senior note repurchases through the first half of 2016. 






 (2) 
 In January 2017, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") announced its decision to exclude cokemaking as a qualifying income generating activity in its final regulations (the "Final Regulations") issued under section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the qualifying income exception for publicly traded partnerships. However, the Final Regulations include a transition period for activities that were reasonably interpreted to be qualifying income and carried on by publicly traded partnerships prior to the Final Regulations. The Partnership previously received a will-level opinion from its counsel, Vinson & Elkins LLP, that the Partnership's cokemaking operations generated qualifying income prior to the Final Regulations. Therefore, the Partnership believes it had a reasonable basis to conclude its cokemaking operations were considered qualifying income before the issuance of the new regulations and as such expects to maintain its treatment as a partnership through the transition period. Cokemaking entities in the Partnership will become taxable as corporations on January 1, 2028, after the transition period ends.   







 As a result of the Final Regulations, the Partnership recorded deferred income tax expense of $148.6 million to setup its initial deferred income tax liability during the first quarter of 2017, primarily related to differences in the book and tax basis of fixed assets, which are expected to exist at the end of the 10-year transition period when the cokemaking operations become taxable.

LISLE, Ill., July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 

Net loss attributable to SXCP was $12.9 million in the second quarter 2017, down $25.0 million versus the prior year period primarily driven by $19.9 million of debt extinguishment costs related to our debt refinancing activities in the current year period 
Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXCP was $42.2 million for the quarter, up $1.3 million versus the prior year period 
Second quarter 2017 Distributable Cash Flow ("DCF") and Distribution Cash Coverage Ratio ("Cash Coverage") of $18.0 million and 0.61x, respectively, include $8.4 million repayment of deferred corporate costs and IDRs to SXC; excluding the repayment, DCF and Cash Coverage were $26.4 million and 0.89x, respectively 
Declared second quarter 2017 distribution of $0.5940 per unit 
Reaffirm full-year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXCP guidance of $210 million to $220 million









SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE:    SXCP) today reported results for the second quarter 2017, which reflect comparable consolidated operating results and current period charges related to debt refinancing completed in the quarter.
"Our second quarter operating performance finished in line with our expectations and positions us to achieve our financial guidance targets in 2017," said Fritz Henderson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P.  "Additionally, in the quarter we successfully completed our debt refinancing which extends our revolver and note maturities and provides the flexibility to execute our growth and capital allocation strategies going forward."

Revenues in second quarter 2017 increased $19.2 million from the same prior year period, reflecting the pass-through of higher coal prices in our Domestic Coke segment as well as higher sales volumes in our Coal Logistics segment.
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter increased $1.3 million primarily due to higher sales volumes in our Coal Logistics segment as compared to the same prior year period. This improvement was partially offset by the impacts of a planned outage at our Granite City facility in the current quarter. 
Net loss attributable to SXCP in the second quarter 2017 was $12.9 million, compared to a net gain of $12.1 million in the prior year period.  This $25.0 million change is primarily driven by $19.9 million of debt extinguishment costs related to our debt refinancing activities in the current year period, compared to $3.5 million of debt extinguishment gains recorded in the prior year period.
SECOND QUARTER SEGMENT INFORMATION
Domestic Coke
Domestic Coke consists of cokemaking facilities and heat recovery operations at our Haverhill, Middletown and Granite City cokemaking facilities, located in Franklin Furnace and Middletown, Ohio, and Granite City, Illinois, respectively.

Revenues increased $14.5 million, reflecting the pass-through of higher coal prices in our Domestic Coke segment, partially offset by lower energy sales due to the planned outage at our Granite City facility in the current year period. 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.6 million, driven primarily by lower energy sales and higher operating and maintenance spend for the planned Granite City outage described above.

Coal Logistics
Coal Logistics consists of the coal handling and mixing services operated by SXCP at Convent Marine Terminal ("CMT") located on the Mississippi river in Louisiana, Lake Terminal in East Chicago, Indiana and Kanawha River Terminals, LLC ("KRT"), which has terminals along the Ohio and Kanawha rivers in West Virginia.

DEFINITIONS

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for changes to our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of CMT and the expiration of certain acquired contractual obligations.  Adjusted EBITDA does not represent and should not be considered an alternative to net income or operating income under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures in other businesses.  Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of the operating performance and liquidity of the Partnership's net assets and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions.  Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures and because it eliminates items that have less bearing on our operating performance and liquidity.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 
Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXCP equals Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
Distributable Cash Flow equals Adjusted EBITDA plus sponsor support and Coal Logistics deferred revenue; less net cash paid for interest expense, ongoing capital expenditures, accruals for replacement capital expenditures and cash distributions to noncontrolling interests; plus amounts received under the Omnibus Agreement and acquisition expenses deemed to be Expansion Capital under our Partnership Agreement.  Distributable Cash Flow is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that management and external users of SXCP's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies use to assess: 

SXCP's operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships, without regard to historical cost basis; 
the ability of SXCP's assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to SXCP's unitholders; 
SXCP's ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and 
the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.


We believe that Distributable Cash Flow provides useful information to investors in assessing SXCP's financial condition and results of operations.  Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.  Distributable Cash Flow has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities and used in investing activities.  Additionally, because Distributable Cash Flow may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, our definition of Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.

Ongoing capital expenditures ("capex") are capital expenditures made to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and/or to extend their useful lives.  Ongoing capex also includes new equipment that improves the efficiency, reliability or effectiveness of existing assets.  Ongoing capex does not include normal repairs and maintenance, which are expensed as incurred, or significant capital expenditures. For purposes of calculating distributable cash flow, the portion of ongoing capex attributable to SXCP is used and includes capital expenditures included in working capital at the end of the period. 
Replacement capital expenditures ("capex") represents an annual accrual necessary to fund SXCP's share of the estimated costs to replace or rebuild our facilities at the end of their working lives. This accrual is estimated based on the average quarterly anticipated replacement capital that we expect to incur over the long term to replace our major capital assets at the end of their working lives.  The replacement capex accrual estimate will be subject to review and prospective change by SXCP's general partner at least annually and whenever an event occurs that causes a material adjustment of replacement capex, provided such change is approved by our conflicts committee.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Some of the statements included in this press release constitute "forward-looking statements."  Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and may be identified by the use of such words as "believe," "expect," "plan," "project," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "continue," "may," "will," "should" or the negative of these terms or similar expressions.  Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties (many of which are beyond the control of SXCP) that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic, political, business, operational, competitive, regulatory, and/or market factors affecting SXCP, as well as uncertainties related to: pending or future litigation, legislation or regulatory actions; liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations; gains and losses related to acquisition, disposition or impairment of assets; recapitalizations; access to, and costs of, capital; the effects of changes in accounting rules applicable to SXCP; and changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations applicable to SXCP's businesses.
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, but are based upon the current knowledge, beliefs and expectations of SXCP management, and upon assumptions by SXCP concerning future conditions, any or all of which ultimately may prove to be inaccurate.  The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release.  SXCP does not intend, and expressly disclaims any obligation, to update or alter its forward-looking statements (or associated cautionary language), whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after the date of this press release except as required by applicable law.
SXCP has included in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission cautionary language identifying important factors (but not necessarily all the important factors) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by SXCP.  For information concerning these factors, see SXCP's Securities and Exchange Commission filings such as its annual and quarterly reports and current reports on Form 8-K, copies of which are available free of charge on SXCP's website at www.suncoke.com.  All forward-looking statements included in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by such cautionary statements.  Unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this release also could have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

 (1) 
 The Partnership recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt as a result of its debt refinancing activities during the second quarter of 2017. The Partnership recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt as a result of senior note repurchases through the first half of 2016. 






 (2) 
 In January 2017, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") announced its decision to exclude cokemaking as a qualifying income generating activity in its final regulations (the "Final Regulations") issued under section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the qualifying income exception for publicly traded partnerships. However, the Final Regulations include a transition period for activities that were reasonably interpreted to be qualifying income and carried on by publicly traded partnerships prior to the Final Regulations. The Partnership previously received a will-level opinion from its counsel, Vinson & Elkins LLP, that the Partnership's cokemaking operations generated qualifying income prior to the Final Regulations. Therefore, the Partnership believes it had a reasonable basis to conclude its cokemaking operations were considered qualifying income before the issuance of the new regulations and as such expects to maintain its treatment as a partnership through the transition period. Cokemaking entities in the Partnership will become taxable as corporations on January 1, 2028, after the transition period ends.   







 As a result of the Final Regulations, the Partnership recorded deferred income tax expense of $148.6 million to setup its initial deferred income tax liability during the first quarter of 2017, primarily related to differences in the book and tax basis of fixed assets, which are expected to exist at the end of the 10-year transition period when the cokemaking operations become taxable.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
