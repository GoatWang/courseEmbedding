Dime Community Bancshares Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying And 3.69% Yield (DCOM)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Ex-Div Reminder For Dime Community Bancshares (DCOM)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 1/29/15, Dime Community Bancshares, Inc will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.14, payable on 2/10/15. As a percentage of DCOM's recent stock price of $15.21, this dividend works out to approximately 0.92%, so look for shares of Dime Community Bancshares, Inc to trade 0.92% lower — all else being equal — when DCOM shares open for trading on 1/29/15.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. Announces The Pricing Of $115 Million Subordinated Debt Offering






GlobeNewswire



Jun 8, 2017 5:05 PM EDT













 


















































 BROOKLYN, N.Y., June 08, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. (the "Company") (NASDAQ:DCOM), the holding company for Dime Community Bank (the "Bank"), today announced that it has priced an underwritten public offering of $115 million aggregate principal amount of its fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes (the "Notes") due June 15, 2027. The Notes will initially bear a fixed interest rate of 4.50% per year. Commencing on June 15, 2022, the interest rate on the Notes will reset on a quarterly basis to the three-month LIBOR rate plus a spread of 266 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. The offering is expected to close on June 13, 2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.  The Company plans to use the net proceeds from the offering to redeem the $70.7 million of trust preferred securities currently paying a 7.00% annual coupon (expected in the third quarter) of Dime Community Capital Trust I and for general corporate purposes, including the payment of dividends and funding potential strategic growth opportunities, including, but not limited to, acquisitions.  Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. is acting as the sole book-running manager and Piper Jaffray & Co. is acting as co-manager for the offering.  Luse Gorman, PC is serving as outside legal counsel to the Company.  Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP is serving as outside legal counsel to the underwriters. The Notes will be issued pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement (File No. 333-207228) (including base prospectus) and, in each case, a preliminary prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and a final prospectus supplement to be filed with the SEC. Copies of the preliminary prospectus supplement and the base prospectus, as well as the final prospectus supplement, when available, can be obtained without charge by visiting the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, or may be obtained from Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., 1251 Avenue of the Americas, 6th Floor, New York, New York 10020, (866) 805-4128. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the Notes in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. Any offering of the Notes is being made only by means of a written prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Dime Community Bancshares Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying And 3.69% Yield (DCOM)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Ex-Div Reminder For Dime Community Bancshares (DCOM)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 1/29/15, Dime Community Bancshares, Inc will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.14, payable on 2/10/15. As a percentage of DCOM's recent stock price of $15.21, this dividend works out to approximately 0.92%, so look for shares of Dime Community Bancshares, Inc to trade 0.92% lower — all else being equal — when DCOM shares open for trading on 1/29/15.
