The Closed Loop Fund is a social impact fund investing $100M to increase the recycling of products and packaging.









By 2025, We Aim To



Eliminate more than 50 million tons of greenhouse gas



Divert more than 20 million cumulative tones of waste from landfills



Create 20,000+ local jobs across the United States



Save nearly $1.2 billion for American cities



Prove replicable models that will help unlock additional investment in recycling









Investment Strategy
Our goal is to strategically remove the key obstacles to expanding recycling in order to:



Attract additional, more affordable capital to the industry




Increase recycling access




Help scale solutions that improve recycling profitability








Investment Criteria
Every Closed Loop Fund investment in recycling infrastructure deliver measurable financial and environmental returns.  First, it is a loan and it must pay back.  Equally important, each investment must divert significant tonnage from landfill to the recycling stream.  Leveraging pay-for-success as much as possible, each loan must have transparent reporting and clear line of site to repayment to allow for easy replication by other cities and companies.






We Invest In Recycling

We provide zero interest loans to cities and below market loans to companies for recycling infrastructure to prove the market for single-stream expansion and modernization by maximizing recycling profitability.
We leverage best practices in communication, education, operations, and public policy.
We prioritize the ability to enhance existing infrastructure and close the loop on materials.






Investment Categories



Collect Recyclable Material
We invest in replicable projects that expand curbside programs that accept a wide range of materials.



Sort Recyclables Into Marketable Commodities
We invest in replicable and economically viable technology, systems and business models that build MRF capacity and upgrade sorting technology to ensure MRF profitability and help MRFs evolve to the changing material stream.



Process Into New Life
We envision profitable markets for processing those commodities. We look for technology and capacity building opportunities for glass, film, and flexible packaging.


Apply For Funding









We Leverage Our Network For Impact
We aim to harness the power of our network to influence the market to increase capital investment and demand for recycled content.  Our network of brands, retailers, recycling companies, and cities affords us a unique view of the full system and opportunity to influence the markets that will support our investment strategy.








Advance Recyclable Packaging and Recycled-Content
We help brands understand how their packaging choices affect the health of the recycling system.
We help recycling companies gain confidence in demand for PCR and prepare for new materials and markets.



Engage Consumer Influencers
Our insights can help key consumer influencers understand the reality of recycling issues and where maximum impact is with consumer change.



Disseminate and Propogate
As our investments and research deliver financial and recycling returns, we will produce and actively promote market-proving research and case studies with our partners.



Optimize Business Relationships
Through convenings and our investment portfolio, we can drive development of incentive-based contracting and new off-take markets for recycling commodities, especially in problem areas like glass and plastics.

Closed Loop Ventures invests in Rebound Technologies
Closed Loop Ventures invests in Rebound Technologies
<![CDATA[Closed Loop Ventures (CLV), an early-stage equity fund that invests in consumer goods, advanced recycling technologies and services supporting the circular economy, has announced an investment in Rebound Technologies, Boulder, Colorado.  
Rebound has developed IcePoint, a disruptive technology marking the first major innovation in refrigeration in 100 years, according to the company. IcePoint is a low temperature refrigeration cycle for supermarkets. The liquid sub-cooling product plugs into refrigeration systems to boost performance of industrial freezers. CLV invested alongside the nonprofit PRIME Coalition and Investors’ Circle, an investment fund based in Durham, North Carolina.  
Chris Cochran, executive director of the multistakeholder nonprofit ReFed, says, “Cold chain management improvements have the capacity to reduce U.S. food waste by 18,000 tons annually, generating millions of dollars of savings for consumers and businesses.”
 Kevin Davis, CEO of Rebound Technologies, says, “Our proprietary technology allows cold storage logistics companies and food processors to freeze more food in less time, using 40 percent less energy compared to legacy equipment. This means less food waste and more revenue for farmers.”
Davis continues, “IcePoint not only provides unprecedented efficiency gains, but it also provides the operational flexibility to enable bursts of high capacity, on-demand cooling. This unique characteristic can speed up blast freezing times or mitigate peak electricity expenses, depending on the user’s optimization preference. CLV’s investment in our company will both help us successfully deliver our first pilot later this year and because CLV specializes in the circular economy, we think of it as smart capital that will help us make important connections to grow our business as well.”
Project Drawdown, a climate change mitigation project initiated by Paul Hawken, ranked refrigeration management and reducing food waste as the No. 1 and No. 3 most substantive solutions to global warming, respectively. 
As reported in the Washington Post, 40 percent of all foods require refrigeration and as much as 20 percent to 30 percent of food loss during shipping is caused by breaks in the cold chain, which Rebound’s technology is directly improving, says CLV.
A facility using two IcePoint units annually is projected to divert 4,400 tons of food waste, decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 23,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, and save 14 billion gallons of water. This impact is realized while also increasing earnings by $275,000 per unit. 
CLV says it has made six investments since its inception, including AMP Robotics, a Denver-based robotics company solving for recycling inefficiency; HomeBiogas, a residential-scale anaerobic digestion company solving for food waste; and Evrnu, a Seattle-based fiber technology company turning textile waste into new fibers).  
“Rebound Technologies directly addresses a huge driver of waste in the food supply chain—inefficiencies in the freezing process between the farm and the retailer,” says Rob Kaplan, CLV managing director. “Based on our work with retailers and consumer product companies, we believe there is a strong demand for this technology.”
CLV a global equity fund that invests in early stage consumer goods, advanced recycling technologies and services supporting the circular economy. CLV is the venture arm of Closed Loop Partners, an investment firm that also manages the Closed Loop Fund, a project finance fund that invests in scaling recycling infrastructure and sustainable manufacturing technologies, and Closed Loop Foundation, a nonprofit that does research and development of technologies and business models both focused on building the circular economy.

Recycling project is the winner of #youforG20




 















More than 220 initiatives applied. “Vicfold Recyclers” from Nigeria convinced the community – and the Jury.




The “Vicfold Recyclers” project in Nigeria has won the #youforG20 competition. The initiative champions recycling plastic waste. At the same time, it creates job opportunities. In the federal state of Kwara “Vicfold Recyclers” has established a network of deposit points and plastic collectors (above all unemployed women and young people) gather empty bottles and other waste products at the doorstep and in this way earn a little money. As a result, countless families have now managed to improve their incomes.
The concept won over the six-person jury consisting of representatives of the German Federal Foreign Office and the editorial desk of deutschland.de as well as the testimonials of the campaign. “Vicfold Recyclers” will receive financial support totalling 15,000 Euros to help move the project forward.
More than 220 initiatives from all over the world competed in the #youforG20 contest. The call was for projects that in a very emphatic manner tackled a social or economic issue, or a matter of environmental policy and help improve people’s living conditions.

Closed Loop Ventures invests in Rebound Technologies

Closed Loop Ventures (CLV), an early-stage equity fund that invests in consumer goods, advanced recycling technologies and services supporting the circular economy, has announced an investment in Rebound Technologies, Boulder, Colorado.  Rebound has developed IcePoint, a disruptive technology marking the first major innovation in refrigeration in 100 years, according to the company. IcePoint is a low-temperature refrigeration cycle for supermarkets. The liquid subcooling product plugs into refrigeration systems to boost performance of industrial freezers. CLV invested alongside the nonprofitPRIME Coalition and Investors’ Circle, an investment fund based in Durham, North Carolina.  Chris Cochran, executive director of the multistakeholder nonprofit ReFed, says, “Cold chain management improvements have the capacity to reduce U.S. food waste by 18,000 tons annually, generating millions of dollars of savings for consumers and businesses.” Kevin Davis, CEO of Rebound Technologies, says, “Our proprietary technology allows cold storage logistics companies and food processors to freeze more food in less time, using 40 percent less energy compared to legacy equipment. This means less food waste and more revenue for farmers.”Davis continues, “IcePoint not only provides unprecedented efficiency gains, but it also provides the operational flexibility to enable bursts of high capacity, on-demand cooling. This unique characteristic can speed up blast freezing times or mitigate peak electricity expenses, depending on the user’s optimization preference. CLV’s investment in our company will both help us successfully deliver our first pilot later this year and because CLV specializes in the circular economy, we think of it as smart capital that will help us make important connections to grow our business as well.”Project Drawdown, a climate change mitigation project initiated by Paul Hawken, ranked refrigeration management and reducing food waste as the No. 1 and No. 3 most substantive solutions to global warming, respectively. As reported in the Washington Post, 40 percent of all foods require refrigeration and as much as 20 percent to 30 percent of food loss during shipping is caused by breaks in the cold chain, which Rebound’s technology is directly improving, says CLV.A facility using two IcePoint units annually is projected to divert 4,400 tons of food waste, decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 23,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, and save 14 billion gallons of water. This impact is realized while also increasing earnings by $275,000 per unit. CLV says it has made six investments since its inception, including AMP Robotics, a Denver-based robotics company solving for recycling inefficiency; HomeBiogas, a residential-scale anaerobic digestion company solving for food waste; and Evrnu, a Seattle-based fiber technology company turning textile waste into new fibers).  “Rebound Technologies directly addresses a huge driver of waste in the food supply chain—inefficiencies in the freezing process between the farm and the retailer,” says Rob Kaplan, CLV managing director. “Based on our work with retailers and consumer product companies, we believe there is a strong demand for this technology.”CLV a global equity fund that invests in early stage consumer goods, advanced recycling technologies and services supporting the circular economy. CLV is the venture arm of Closed Loop Partners, an investment firm that also manages the Closed Loop Fund, a project finance fund that invests in scaling recycling infrastructure and sustainable manufacturing technologies, and Closed Loop Foundation, a nonprofit that does research and development of technologies and business models both focused on building the circular economy.
