About LMI AEROSPACE, INC.

   LMI Aerospace makes key airplane structures such as cockpit window frames, fuselage skins, and interior components. Its aerostructures segment fabricates, machines, finishes, and integrates more than 40,000 aluminum and specialty alloy components for commercial, corporate, and military aircraft. The engineering services unit (D3 Technologies) provides design, engineering, and program management services for aircraft. The Intec division designs and tests composites for production parts. The company also makes components for laser equipment used by semiconductor makers and reusable containers with industrial and military applications. In early 2017, it agreed to be acquired by Belgium-based Sonaca Group.
  
Operations

   The aerostructures segment, 80% of sales, serves aircraft OEMs and aerospace suppliers, including Gulfstream Aerospace, Boeing, and Sikorsky Aircraft, through long-term contracts as single-source providers of many of its products. The engineering services unit, D3 Technologies, supports an aircraft throughout its entire lifecycle, from conceptual design to service life extension. Specific services include system design, stress element analysis, tool design, and avionics software development for such aircraft technologies as airframes and electro/mechanical and hydraulic/pneumatic systems. Customers of the engineering services segment include Boeing (once again), Bombardier, and Mitsubishi Aircraft.
  

   The aerostructures and engineering services segments work together to provide coordinated service for the company's clients. Most of aerostructures' revenue is recorded when a delivery is made or services given. Engineering services takes in most of its revenue through cost-plus reimbursement contracts. LMI as a whole is dependent on three major customers for much of its sales: Boeing (14%), Gulfstream (15%), and Spirit AeroSystems (about 29%).
  
Geographic Reach

   Based in St. Louis, LMI has operations in 27 locations across the US as well as internationally in Australia, the UK, Mexico, and Sri Lanka. It has nearly 20 fabrication and assembly facilities in North America.
  
Financial Performance

   LMI has enjoyed steady growth over the last three years, with revenues surging 48% from $279 million in 2012 to $413 million in 2013, a historical milestone for the company. However, in 2013 LMI posted its first net loss ($58 million) in 10 years.
  

   The revenue growth for 2013 was due to a 90% spike in Aerostructures Segment sales, resulting from increased sales from large commercial aircraft. It also experienced higher sales from military products, and components for corporate and regional aircraft attributable to a previous acquisition.
  

   The company's net loss for 2013 was the result of a spike in cost of sales related to its Valent acquisition. Its bottom line also suffered from increased restructuring expenses related to the closure of a machine facility. LMI's operating cash flow has steadily declined over the years. It posted negative cash flow of $8 million cash in 2013 due to increases in inventory to support investments in new programs and higher interest costs.
  
Strategy

   LMI's strategy is focused on its operations in high speed, hard metal machining, design-build, and composites to meet the needs of the growing number of aircraft OEMs and suppliers who rely on outsourcing. The company also cushions itself against such vicissitudes as military budget cuts or airline industry doldrums by balancing its customer mix, ensuring that the large commercial, corporate, regional, and military aircraft sectors each serve at least three large customers. Globally the company seeks low cost sourcing as a balance to its US engineering and build operations.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   The company has achieved record-setting revenue growth through the use of acquisitions. In 2012 it acquired Valent Aerostructures, a provider of complex sub-assemblies and machined parts to airframe manufacturers in the commercial aerospace and military industries, for $237 million. Also in 2012, LMI acquired TASS, an after-market engineering and support services firm. TASS delivers engineering products to aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and MRO companies worldwide.

	Section 1 - Conflicts Minerals Disclosure









	Item 1.01 Conflict Minerals Disclosure and Report









	LMI Aerospace, Inc. (the “Company,” “it,” “our,” or “we”) has evaluated its current product lines and has determined that certain of the products we manufacture or contract to manufacture contain Conflict Minerals (as defined in Rule 13p-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Rule”)) that are necessary to the production or functionality of those products. Accordingly, the Company has filed a Conflict Minerals Report attached as Exhibit 1.01.









	Conflicts Mineral Disclosure









	The Company performed analysis and undertook due diligence measures to determine the country of origin of any Conflict Minerals used by our suppliers. Currently, we do not have sufficient information from our suppliers or other sources to determine the country of origin of the Conflict Minerals used in our products or sufficient information to identify the facilities used to process these Conflict Minerals. As a result, the Company cannot exclude the possibility that some of these Conflict Minerals may have originated from Covered Countries (as defined in the Rule) or otherwise benefited armed groups operating in those Covered Countries.

	Exhibit 1.01









	LMI Aerospace, Inc.




	Conflict Minerals Report




	For The Year Ended December 31, 2016









	This Conflicts Minerals Report for the year ended December 31, 2016, is presented to comply with Rule 13p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Rule”). The Rule was adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, to implement reporting and disclosure requirements for SEC registrants whose manufactured products contain “Conflict Minerals” that are necessary to the production or functionality of such products. Under the Rule, Conflict Minerals are defined as gold as well as columbite-tantalite, cassiterite, wolframite, and their derivatives, which are limited to tin, tantalum, and tungsten, unless the U.S. Secretary of State determines that additional derivatives are financing conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country (collectively, the “Covered Countries”). The purpose of the Rule is to reduce a significant source of funding for armed groups that are committing human rights abuses and contributing to conflict in a Covered Country.









	If a registrant can establish that the registrant’s products contain Conflict Minerals that originated from sources other than a Covered Country or from recycled and scrap sources, the registrant must submit a Form SD which describes the Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (“RCOI”) that it completed. If a registrant has reason to believe that any of the Conflict Minerals in their supply chain may have originated in the Covered Countries, then the registrant must exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody of the Conflict Minerals. The registrant must annually submit a Conflict Minerals Report to the SEC that includes a description of those due diligence measures undertaken pursuant to the Rule.









	Per SEC guidance, if a registrant affirmatively determines that the Conflict Minerals in its products did not directly or indirectly finance or benefit an armed group in a covered country it may, but is not required to, describe its products as “DRC conflict free.” A registrant’s voluntary designation of its Conflict Minerals as “DRC conflict free” is only permissible if the registrant has obtained an independent private-sector audit (“IPSA”). Pending further SEC guidance, an IPSA of a registrant’s conflict minerals report is only required under these circumstances. If a registrant does not affirmatively determine that the Conflict Minerals in its products did not directly or indirectly finance or benefit an armed group in a covered country, the registrant must make additional disclosures including, with the greatest possible specificity, a description of the facilities used to produce the Conflict Minerals in its products, the country of origin of the minerals and the efforts to determine the mine or location of origin. The registrant is not required to describe its products as having “not been found to be DRC conflict free” or “DRC conflict undeterminable.”









	Certain statements in this report constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include expectations concerning the Company’s future actions to engage suppliers, to identify to the extent possible the source of Conflict Minerals in its products and to take other actions regarding its product sourcing. The Company’s actual actions or results may differ materially from those expected or anticipated in the forward-looking statements due to both known and unknown risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, decisions to make changes in the Company’s continual improvement efforts and delays or difficulties in engaging suppliers and identifying the source of Conflict Minerals contained in the Company’s products, as well as those risk factors detailed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on April 4, 2017, and any other risk factors set forth in the Company’s other filings with the SEC.

	3. Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry and Due Diligence









	We developed a listing of suppliers that provided us raw materials and components with the possibility of providing Conflict Minerals and whether those Conflict minerals were necessary to our products' production or functionality. As a result of this analysis, we established with a considerable degree of confidence that certain raw materials and components we purchase contain Conflict Minerals. We then surveyed all direct raw material and component suppliers in our supply chain where opportunity existed to provide raw materials and components that contained Conflict Minerals.









	Due to the complexity of our products and the number of suppliers in our supply chain, we rely on our direct suppliers to provide the relevant information on the origin of any Conflict Minerals that may be contained in the products they supply to us. To conduct our RCOI, commercially available software, which utilizes the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), developed jointly by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition and Global e-Sustainability Initiative (“EICC/GeSI”) was utilized to request and consolidate Conflict Minerals information from our suppliers. This same process was used as newly identified suppliers were added (after our initial survey circulation), reminder requests were sent or phone calls were made to suppliers that failed to provided responses to our survey or that were incomplete or otherwise required further clarification, or provided responses to our initial survey that indicated that their components contained Conflict Minerals that may have come from a Covered Country.









	We received responses from approximately 89% of the more than 366 suppliers surveyed and are continuing efforts to follow-up with unresponsive suppliers or responsive suppliers with incomplete or unclear answers. There were a number of suppliers whose responses and documentation indicated that their components did not contain Conflict Minerals and thus, required no additional follow-up. We conducted additional follow-up with the remaining suppliers to clarify certain responses that were provided.









	It will take time for the remaining suppliers to verify the origin of all of the Conflict Minerals that are included in the raw materials and components we purchase from them. The majority of responses that were received provided data at a broader company level and as such, the information provided may not be directly applicable to the specific products supplied to LMI. Additionally, a number of these suppliers were not able to determine with any certainty the country of origin of the Conflict Minerals in their products. These suppliers were also unable to represent to us the smelters or refiners that they use as the source of the Conflict Minerals actually included in the product they supplied to us. Therefore, we are unable to provide any smelter or refiner names to list in this report. We expect that our continued communication and coordination with our suppliers will further develop transparency into our supply chain.

	Conflict Minerals Analysis and Conclusion









	We believe our due diligence process was reasonably designed, conducted in good faith, and generally consistent with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Due Diligence Guidance (“OECD Guidance”) to determine the origin of the Conflict Minerals identified as necessary to our products’ production or functionality. However, we do not currently have sufficient information from a number of our suppliers or other sources to determine the country of origin of the Conflict Minerals contained in some of our products. Accordingly, the Company cannot rule out the possibility that some of these Conflict Minerals may have originated from a Covered Country and may have been used to finance or otherwise benefit armed groups operating in those Covered Countries.









	5. Next Steps









	The Company has implemented the following Conflict Minerals Policy which is available on its website at


	http://www.lmiaerospace.com/supplier-management/


	.









	LMI is committed to compliance with Section 1502 of the U.S. Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. To satisfy customer requirements and the goals of the Act, LMI and its suppliers will strive to provide only conflict free products through responsible and appropriate sourcing activities. LMI's approved suppliers, both public and private, are required to conduct due diligence on the presence of Conflict Minerals in their supply chain and provide accurate reporting and certifications on the presence of Conflict Minerals in products provided to LMI. Suppliers unwilling to implement procedures which assure only conflict free products are supplied to LMI may be ineligible for LMI approved supplier status.




	Additionally, the Company has included instructional information on its website, for the use of its suppliers, an overview of Conflict Mineral reporting and instruction on how to properly complete a conflict mineral reporting template.




	The Company will continue to look to industry guidelines and best practices to further refine its policies and procedures consistent with its Conflict Minerals Policy. Specifically, moving forward, the Company will take the following steps to improve its due diligence to mitigate the risk that Conflict Minerals in Company products benefit armed groups in the Covered Countries:


















	•






	continued refinement and strengthening of the Company’s established due diligence framework consistent with the OECD Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from conflict-affected and high risk-areas;





















	•






	evaluation of additional consequences for the Company’s new and existing suppliers that fail to comply with the Company’s Conflict Minerals Policy;





















	•






	coordination and communication with suppliers regarding their need to develop a robust chain of custody or traceability systems;





















	•






	additional evaluation of alternate commercially available software that leverages the EEIC/GeSI template to improve the RCOI process while providing improved compliance tracking; and





















	•






	additional training and outreach, as needed, on compliance with the Conflict Minerals Policy.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE




LMI AEROSPACE ACQUIRES VERSAFORM CORPORATION



Seeks further diversification of customer base and product offerings


ST.  LOUIS,  May 15, 2002 - LMI  Aerospace,  Inc.  (Nasdaq:LMIA)  today
announced that it has acquired Versaform  Corporation and affiliates,  which are
privately held aerospace metal forming  companies  based in Southern  California
and British Columbia,  Canada.  Terms of the transaction,  in which LMI acquired
the common stock of Versaform, were not disclosed.


The  Versaform  group  produces  large,  formed  metal  components  for
regional jet, business jet and military markets from its main plants in Southern
California,  as well as aerospace and  architectural  components from a plant in
British  Columbia.  Sales in the  twelve  months  ended  April  30,  2002,  were
approximately $12 million.


"This  transaction will be immediately  accretive to earnings per share
and add new core competencies," said Ronald Saks,  President and Chief Executive
Officer of LMI  Aerospace.  "Based on the  acquisition,  we project LMI's future
sales  distribution  will be  approximately  29 percent  military OEM and spares
components,  28 percent  commercial  OEM and  spares,  28 percent  regional  and
business jet, and 15 percent  semiconductor  and laser  components.  This mix is
consistent  with our stated  strategy to expand and  diversify our customer base
and provide higher level value added products to those customers.


"The  Versaform-LMI  combination  creates a supplier  which can offer a
wide range of metal  products to a more  diverse  customer  base,  thus  helping
ensure  continued  growth for LMI  Aerospace,"  Saks said.  "LMI will benefit by
adding the ability to make larger stretch products,  gaining new customers and a
larger share of Gulfstream  work,  and having  facilities  near LMI customers in
Southern California and Canada."


Saks noted that LMI will bring significant  improvements to Versaform's
production,  financial and marketing operations. These include expertise in lean
manufacturing  and  engineering,   front-end  tooling  production  and  back-end
chemical milling and finishing  capabilities,  a source of additional production
for both the California and Canadian  Versaform sites,  financial  resources for
expanding  product  offerings,  the  consolidation of two Oceanside,  California
facilities,  and new marketing expertise.  The combination also will provide for
near-term expansion into foreign markets.


The Company plans to fund the  acquisition  through a secured note with
its lender.  Versaform is LMI's fourth  acquisition  since the company's initial
public offering in 1998.


LMI Aerospace,  Inc. is a leading supplier of quality components to the
aerospace and technology  industries.  The Company operates eight  manufacturing
facilities  that fabricate,  finish and integrate  close tolerance  aluminum and
specialty  alloy  components for  commercial,  corporate,  regional and military
aircraft,  and  for  laser  equipment  used  in the  semiconductor  and  medical
industries.  Its products  include leading edge wing slats and lens  assemblies;
cockpit  window frame  assemblies;  fuselage  skins and supports;  passenger and
cargo door frames and supports; and excimer laser components.


This press release includes  forward-looking  statements related to LMI
Aerospace's  outlook  for 2002 and  future  periods,  which are based on current
management expectations.  Such forward-looking statements are subject to various
risks and uncertainties,  many of which are beyond the control of LMI Aerospace,
Inc. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking  statements
as a result,  among other things,  of the factors  detailed from time to time in
LMI Aerospace's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
