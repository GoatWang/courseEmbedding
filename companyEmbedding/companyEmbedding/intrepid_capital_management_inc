Our investment team is diligent in following a deliberate, disciplined process focused on finding value in the equity and fixed income markets. We seek to protect our clients' capital on the downside while participating in periods of market appreciation.  With our investment approach, we focus on the best value we can find in an attempt to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns.  We believe that sound strategies, executed consistently, are the keys to long-term success.

Balanced

Investment Objective: The primary investment objective of the Intrepid Balanced portfolio is long-term capital appreciation and high current income.
Investment Philosophy >>
Our goal is to provide positive absolute returns and relative outperformance against the benchmark index over a full market cycle. 

We seek to protect our clients’ capital on the downside while participating in periods of market appreciation.
We are focused on downside risk and will invest only when strict valuation criteria are met.
While much of the investment industry treats performance like a football game, measured in quarters, we view investing as a marathon of emotional discipline encompassing years of investment returns in favorable and unfavorable climates.


Investment Strategy >>
We focus on small-, mid-, and large-cap common stocks and below-investment grade corporate bonds that are not efficiently priced by the market.

We search for businesses that can be valued with a high degree of confidence, generate consistent free cash flow, have strong balance sheets, and are run by a proven management team with a solid record of capital allocation.  Often, the stocks or bonds of these businesses are suffering from issues that we determine to be temporary.
We often buy equity securities when they are trading around 10x the business's normalized free cash flow.
On the fixed income side, the objective is to generate an attractive spread over comparable maturity US Treasury securities without incurring a significant risk of default.  We aim to invest in securities of companies with low leverage ratios and a history of prudent capital allocation decisions.  Generally, the bonds in the portfolio are of a small issue size, typically less than $500 million in total size.
We employ a long-term investment outlook focused on absolute value.
Our process is designed to capitalize on fear, volatility, and the inevitable investment bargains they generate.
We are content to hold cash if we cannot identify enough undervalued opportunities to be fully invested.  Cash has historically comprised a larger percentage of the Fund after strong market gains and has been a smaller percentage of assets following steep market declines.


Portfolio Construction >>
We manage relatively concentrated portfolios that allow us to potentially benefit from individual stock selection while providing adequate diversification.

We generally own equity securities of approximately 20 to 75 different companies in the portfolio, and will typically hold high yield securities of approximately 10 to 40 companies or approximately 20% to 60% of total assets held in such high yield securities. Typically, our initial position size will be around 2% of Portfolio assets.   We will add to equity holdings as we become more comfortable with the company or if the share price declines without an equivalent decline in fundamentals, affording us an opportunity to purchase the name at a larger discount.
Our maximum position weight at purchase is 5%, and position size is dictated by the discount to intrinsic value and the quality of the holding.
Equity holdings are typically exited as their share price reaches intrinsic value.  Fixed income securities are typically exited either at maturity, or when the yield becomes unwarranted by business fundamentals.


Risk Control >>
Our definition of risk is losing money. We try to control risk by ensuring that we understand a business's operating characteristics, cash flows, balance sheet, and the motivations of management.  Then, we wait to buy shares until we believe there is at least a 20% discount to our fair value estimate.


Risk is controlled through two key mechanisms.

First, our investment process includes elements specifically designed to assess the risk associated with each security, including an evaluation of a company’s operational and financial risk.  We strive to avoid companies with both kinds of risk.
Position size is the second element we employ to control risk, and we will limit position sizes based on the risk profile presented by a prospective investment.


While we do not build positions based on sector/industry mandates, as we feel such requirements actually add risk to a portfolio, we do limit our exposure by not investing more than 6% in any one security. In conjunction with our valuation discipline, this limitation has historically limited our sector exposures and created a portfolio with an attractive risk-adjusted return profile.

Our goal is to provide positive absolute returns and relative outperformance against the benchmark index over a full market cycle.

We manage relatively concentrated portfolios that allow us to potentially benefit from individual security selection while providing adequate diversification.

We generally own 20 to 50 securities in the portfolio which typically includes approximately 10 to 40 high yield companies. Typically, our initial position size will be around 2% of Portfolio assets.  We will add to holdings as we become more comfortable with the company or if the bond price declines without an equivalent decline in fundamentals, affording us an opportunity to purchase the bond at a more attractive yield.

Risk is controlled through two key mechanisms.

First, our investment process includes elements specifically designed to assess the risk associated with each security, including an evaluation of a company's operational and financial risk.  We strive to avoid companies with both kinds of risk.  In addition, we favor companies with significant tangible assets.
Position size is the second element we employ to control risk, and we will limit position sizes based on the risk profile presented by a prospective investment.

Model Request for Information (RFI)
 
Model Request for Information (PDF)
The Funds investment objectives, risks charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The statutory and summary prospectuses contain this and other important information about the investment company, and it may be obtained by calling 866-996-FUND. Read it carefully before investing.
The Intrepid International Fund and the Intrepid Select Fund are non-diversified (meaning that compared to diversified mutual funds, the Fund may invest a greater percentage of its assets in a particular issuer).  A non-diversified Fund's shares may be more susceptible to adverse changes in the value of a particular security than would be the shares of a diversified mutual fund.  Thus, a non-diversified Fund may be more sensitive to economic, business and political changes, because of the larger impact of fluctuation in the values of securities of fewer issuers.  The Intrepid Capital, Endurance, Select and International Funds invest in smaller companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Intrepid Capital, Income and Disciplined Value Funds invest in debt securities, which typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer term debt securities. Investment by these Funds in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities.  The Funds may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The risks of owning ETFs generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities they are designed to track, although lack of liquidity in an ETF could result in it being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.  ETFs also have management fees that increase their costs versus the costs of owning the underlying securities directly.  ADRs may be subject to some of the same risks as direct investment in foreign companies, which includes international trade, currency, political, regulatory and diplomatic risks.Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect from loss in a declining market.
The Intrepid Capital Funds are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.

To find these companies, we search for those that can be valued with a high degree of confidence, generate consistent free cash flow, have strong balance sheets, and are run by a proven management team with a solid record of capital allocation.

Our maximum position weight at purchase is 5%, and position size is dictated by the discount to intrinsic value and the quality of the holding.
Holdings are typically exited as their share price reaches intrinsic value.


Risk Control >>
Our definition of risk is losing money. We try to control risk by ensuring that we understand a business's operating characteristics, cash flows, balance sheet, and the motivations of management.  Then, we wait to buy shares until we believe there is at least a 20% discount to our fair value estimate.


Risk is controlled through two key mechanisms.

First, our investment process includes elements specifically designed to assess the risk associated with each security, including an evaluation of a company’s operational and financial risk.  We strive to avoid companies with both kinds of risk.
Position size is the second element we employ to control risk, and we will limit position sizes based on the risk profile presented by a prospective investment.


While we do not build positions based on sector/industry mandates, as we feel such requirements actually add risk to a portfolio, we do limit our exposure by not investing more than 6% in any one security. In conjunction with our valuation discipline, this limitation has historically limited our sector exposures and created a portfolio with an attractive risk-adjusted return profile.

Disciplined Value

Investment Objective: The primary investment objective of the Intrepid Disciplined Value portfolio is long-term capital appreciation.
Investment Philosophy >>
Our goal is to provide positive absolute returns and relative outperformance against the benchmark index over a full market cycle. 

We seek to protect our clients’ capital on the downside while participating in periods of market appreciation.
We are focused on downside risk and will invest only when strict valuation criteria are met.
While much of the investment industry treats performance like a football game, measured in quarters, we view investing as a marathon of emotional discipline encompassing years of investment returns in favorable and unfavorable climates.


Investment Strategy >>
We focus on small-, mid-, and large-cap equity companies that are not efficiently priced by the market.

To find these companies, we search for those that can be valued with a high degree of confidence, generate consistent free cash flow, have strong balance sheets, and are run by a proven management team with a solid record of capital allocation.  Often, the stocks of these businesses are suffering from issues that we determine to be temporary.
We often buy companies when they are trading around 10x normalized free cash flow.
We employ a long-term investment outlook focused on absolute value.
Our process is designed to capitalize on fear, volatility, and the inevitable investment bargains they generate.
We are content to hold cash if we cannot identify enough undervalued opportunities to be fully invested.  Cash has historically comprised a larger percentage of the Portfolio after strong market gains and has been a smaller percentage of assets following steep market declines.


Portfolio Construction >>
We manage relatively concentrated portfolios that allow us to potentially benefit from individual stock selection while providing adequate diversification.

We generally own equity securities of approximately 20 to 75 different companies in the portfolio. Typically, our initial position size will be around 2% of Portfolio assets, and we will add to holdings as we become more comfortable with the company or if the share price declines without an equivalent decline in fundamentals, affording us an opportunity to purchase the name at a larger discount.
Our maximum position weight at purchase is 5%, and position size is dictated by the discount to intrinsic value and the quality of the holding.
Holdings are typically exited as their share price reaches intrinsic value.


Risk Control >>
Our definition of risk is losing money. We try to control risk by ensuring that we understand a business's operating characteristics, cash flows, balance sheet, and the motivations of management.  Then, we wait to buy shares until we believe there is at least a 20% discount to our fair value estimate.

About Us
Our story began in 1994 when Mark Travis and his father Forrest founded Intrepid in Jacksonville Beach, Florida, far from Wall Street. That decision set the tone for a company focused on our strategy and not "The Street." As Intrepid has grown, our independent thinking has remained steadfast.
Intrepid may take a contrarian approach to investing, but it's based on risk-control, not risk-taking.  Our definition of risk is losing money.  We are value investors, content to look different and hold cash when compelling opportunities are not present.  We aim to outperform over full market cycles by protecting capital on the downside and participating on the upside.  Our portfolios tend to be concentrated with only our best ideas.  Most importantly, we are invested alongside our shareholders.

 

Intrepid Capital Management may only provide investment advisory services to persons in states where Intrepid has filed a notice with the state securities administrator as a federally registered investment advisor or pursuant to an exemption from filing a notice in certain states.  The rendering of investment advisory services by Intrepid will not be made in states where it is not first notice filed or may rely on an exemption from such filing.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN


                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied. Did a status check to see where I sat with the promotion 80% at the spending goal and was told there was no promotion. So I closed all AMEX cards but this one and plan...show more

                                            WalletHub is by far my favorite credit monitoring tool and has made it really easy for me to gain an understanding of my score. Signing up was a very simple process and there were no extra strings attached.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            It's not the worst, but it's certainly deceptive. I can't trust a company that lies to me for two bucks.

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

                                            Grange Insurance added a 58% surcharge to our auto policy after a icy bridge weather related accident.  The increase totaled of $1042.00.
