Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Investment Philosophy & Process

Investment PhilosophyProfit Investments utilizes a valuation-sensitive growth investing style. Our investment philosophy is based on the belief that mispriced businesses can be found within the stock market at any point within the market cycle. Mispriced businesses occur for a variety of reasons, including stocks trading down in sympathy with the industry, another stock or the market. We look to own quality companies trading at a discount, that have a catalyst to help them reach their intrinsic value (i.e.  the value our analysts assign to a company) after a rigorous evaluation process. That evaluation process blends bottoms-up analysis, quantitative and qualitative analysis and risk-control guidelines.Investment ProcessUtilizing our investment philosophy, Profit Investments seeks to invest in companies that exhibit strong fundamentals, solid growth rates and attractive franchises, where the stock market price reflects a discount to a company's intrinsic values at the time of purchase. Our investment process includes thorough Research, developing a Stock Thesis, having Conviction on a stock and Monitoring that stock on an ongoing basis.

Managing Risk
Risk control is critically important to our firm.We build portfolios one stock at a time, based on fundamental valuation criteria. Our primary risk control measure is careful stock selection through fundamental financial statement analysis and investment thesis consideration.Profit Investments also has developed a warning system designed to identify potential underperformance in our portfolios. This system employs price triggers that call for reevaluation of the position to outright liquidation. We research each instance where the warning system is called to action to determine what, if any changes, need to be made to our investment process.

History[edit]
Profit Investment Management was founded in 1996 by Eugene Profit as Investor Resources Group. The firm began with $300,000 of capital under management. After taking over the position of portfolio manager on November 1, 1997, Eugene launched the Profit Fund, the firm’s flagship retail mutual fund.[1] Under Profit’s management, the Profit Fund rose 62% from late 1997 to 1999, compared with 51% for the S&P 500.[2]
On July 9, 1999, the Profit Fund was given a 5-star rating from Mutual Funds Magazine, and from then on has consistently provided rates of returns surpassing those of the S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000.[3]
On June 30, 2000, the Profit Fund was ranked Number 2 among 232 large-cap value funds with a three-year average annual return of 23.22%.[4]
In June 2008, Profit Investment Management was named one of the nation’s largest black-owned businesses by Black Enterprise Magazine, ranking 14th in the Asset Manager category. The firm had $1.358 billion under management at the time.[5]
As of December 31, 2009, the firm’s asset under management reached approximately $1.7 billion.[6]
Investment Style[edit]
Profit is often cited for its unique investment strategy which combines elements of value and growth investing. Over the firm's 14-year history, the strategy has evolved from a "value strategy with a growth overlay" to a "valuation-sensitive growth strategy,"[7] which selects growth stocks deemed as mispriced relative to their peers and their own price history. The expectation of the strategy is that a catalyst will eventually incite investors to re-evaluate such stocks, thereby causing prices of these equities to rise.[8]
Profit in the Media[edit]
Profit Investment Management has appeared on several financial media sources. The firm’s CEO and several of its employees have provided financial commentary on prominent financial news networks including Business Week,[9] SmartMoney, Black Enterprise,[10] Pension & Investments,[11] Investor's Business Daily,[12] Dow Jones Newswires,[13] The Wall Street Transcript,[14] Wall Street Week, Money Line, CNBC, and CNN.[15]

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

History[edit]
Profit Investment Management was founded in 1996 by Eugene Profit as Investor Resources Group. The firm began with $300,000 of capital under management. After taking over the position of portfolio manager on November 1, 1997, Eugene launched the Profit Fund, the firm’s flagship retail mutual fund.[1] Under Profit’s management, the Profit Fund rose 62% from late 1997 to 1999, compared with 51% for the S&P 500.[2]
On July 9, 1999, the Profit Fund was given a 5-star rating from Mutual Funds Magazine, and from then on has consistently provided rates of returns surpassing those of the S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000.[3]
On June 30, 2000, the Profit Fund was ranked Number 2 among 232 large-cap value funds with a three-year average annual return of 23.22%.[4]
In June 2008, Profit Investment Management was named one of the nation’s largest black-owned businesses by Black Enterprise Magazine, ranking 14th in the Asset Manager category. The firm had $1.358 billion under management at the time.[5]
As of December 31, 2009, the firm’s asset under management reached approximately $1.7 billion.[6]
Investment Style[edit]
Profit is often cited for its unique investment strategy which combines elements of value and growth investing. Over the firm's 14-year history, the strategy has evolved from a "value strategy with a growth overlay" to a "valuation-sensitive growth strategy,"[7] which selects growth stocks deemed as mispriced relative to their peers and their own price history. The expectation of the strategy is that a catalyst will eventually incite investors to re-evaluate such stocks, thereby causing prices of these equities to rise.[8]
Profit in the Media[edit]
Profit Investment Management has appeared on several financial media sources. The firm’s CEO and several of its employees have provided financial commentary on prominent financial news networks including Business Week,[9] SmartMoney, Black Enterprise,[10] Pension & Investments,[11] Investor's Business Daily,[12] Dow Jones Newswires,[13] The Wall Street Transcript,[14] Wall Street Week, Money Line, CNBC, and CNN.[15]

On July 9, 1999, the Profit Fund was given a 5-star rating from Mutual Funds Magazine, and from then on has consistently provided rates of returns surpassing those of the S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000.[3]
On June 30, 2000, the Profit Fund was ranked Number 2 among 232 large-cap value funds with a three-year average annual return of 23.22%.[4]
In June 2008, Profit Investment Management was named one of the nation’s largest black-owned businesses by Black Enterprise Magazine, ranking 14th in the Asset Manager category. The firm had $1.358 billion under management at the time.[5]
As of December 31, 2009, the firm’s asset under management reached approximately $1.7 billion.[6]
Investment Style[edit]
Profit is often cited for its unique investment strategy which combines elements of value and growth investing. Over the firm's 14-year history, the strategy has evolved from a "value strategy with a growth overlay" to a "valuation-sensitive growth strategy,"[7] which selects growth stocks deemed as mispriced relative to their peers and their own price history. The expectation of the strategy is that a catalyst will eventually incite investors to re-evaluate such stocks, thereby causing prices of these equities to rise.[8]
Profit in the Media[edit]
Profit Investment Management has appeared on several financial media sources. The firm’s CEO and several of its employees have provided financial commentary on prominent financial news networks including Business Week,[9] SmartMoney, Black Enterprise,[10] Pension & Investments,[11] Investor's Business Daily,[12] Dow Jones Newswires,[13] The Wall Street Transcript,[14] Wall Street Week, Money Line, CNBC, and CNN.[15]
