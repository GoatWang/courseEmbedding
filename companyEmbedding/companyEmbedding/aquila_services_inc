Aquila Resources Inc. is a permitting-stage company with strategic assets in the Great Lakes Region.








The company’s experienced management team is currently focused on advancing permitting activities for its 100%-owned zinc- and gold-rich Back Forty Project in Michigan. Aquila has received three of four final permits from Michigan’s Department of Environmental Quality following a rigorous public-hearing process.
Aquila’s flagship Back Forty Project is a volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit located along the mineral-rich Penokean Volcanic Belt in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. It currently demonstrates a 15.1Mt measured and indicated (M&I) resource containing close to 1 million ounces of gold and 1 billion pounds of zinc.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
