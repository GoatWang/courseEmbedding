Overview
Reviews



I am the owner of Hair Ty, LLC.  Please follow me on Instagram at: HairTyLLC. I specialize in natural hair, and have my natural hair license. I am a certified Sisterlock TM Consultant. I will not recommend styles that are not in the best interest of your particular hair. I also do not braid with too much tension, which causes traction alopecia. I provide services for men, women, and children. At Hair Ty, LLC we encourage every client to “Be YOU-tiful!”

I am new to the natural hair world. Tyisha has made the transition a whole lot easier! I was unsure about getting interlocks, but now I think they're the best thing ever. Tyisha  did the first shampoo I've ever had that didn't splash water all over my face. Usually, I have to put my makeup on again after I get my hair done, but I don't have to when Tyisha washes my hair. She also teaches me a lot about locs.

May you do well in your business venture. May you treat each customer with integrity, and as you'd like to be treated. Your past business protocol has left some undesirable feelings in past customers.


						Response from Hair Ty, LLC on August 3, 2016					
This listing is for Natural Essence by Tyisha. If I have treated you WITHOUT integrity or left you with undesirable feelings please allow me to at least be aware of what I may have done so that it NEVER happens again in the future. I would also like the opportunity to rectify whatever the situation may be. I believe in learning and growing from mistakes that I make. You can inbox a message to me on my Facebook page at Natural Essence BY TYISHA or email me at naturalessencebytyisha@gmail.com. 

If Monica has treated you WITHOUT integrity or left you with undesirable feelings please let HER know. You can message her on her Facebook page Natural Essence or email her at naturalessencebymj@gmail.com. 

I am sincerely sorry to hear that you didn't have a wonderful experience. I hope that you contact one of us in the very near future. 

Peace & blessings,
Tyisha
