FREMONT, Calif., July 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Vdopia, a global leader in mobile video advertising, announced the addition of Martin Price as Senior Vice President of Product, further filling out its team of adtech industry veterans.
Price is Vdopia's third high-profile hire in recent months and comes at an opportune time. eMarketer recently reported, "in the US, spending on mobile video advertising will grow more than 70% to reach $2.62 billion in 2015—over one-third of the estimated $7.77 billion to be spent on digital video ads."1 Earlier in June, Vdopia hired ex-Pubmatic Giuseppe Di Mauro as SVP of Engineering, and recently announced that John Lambertus, an agency trading desk and programmatic platform veteran, joined as VP Operations and Client Services.
Price, 37, will be based in the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and will focus on accelerating Vdopia's innovation in the mobile video space for brand advertisers, agencies and publishers alike. Vdopia operates the industry's only mobile video-only programmatic platform, called Chocolate, which is powered by its proprietary .VDO technology. Vdopia also recently launched InView, a native video ad format for mobile, which features measurable and transparent viewability – a much-talked-about topic in the industry.
"It's no secret that consumer time spent on mobile video is growing exponentially and brand advertisers have shifted their focus to reach those consumers in that space," said Saurabh Bhatia, CEO, Vdopia. "With Price and other key leaders in place, we're better equipped to continually improve our programmatic ad tech stack, enabling brand advertisers and publishers to buy and sell mobile video advertising more efficiently and succeed in that channel."
Price joins Vdopia from OpenX where he was Vice President Product Management, responsible for mobile, native & video across ad server, exchange & SSP enterprise products. Prior to OpenX, Price co-founded Productsy, a mobile start-up platform-as-a-service for app development. Other senior product roles in his career have included: GM & VP Product Management at Geodelic Systems (an innovative mobile location based commerce platform), Director, Product Management at CityGrid (the local advertising and content network division of IAC), and Senior Manager, Product Management at Yahoo!.
"I'm joining Vdopia's executive team at a true industry inflection point, when we can realize the potential of programmatic mobile video," said Price. "As a team, we'll work to disrupt a fast-growing industry by building and launching innovative products that extend Vdopia's platform."
About VdopiaVdopia is a global programmatic buying and selling platform for mobile video advertising. Powered by patent-pending, .VDO technology, Vdopia's programmatic platform, 'Chocolate', is a brand safe, viewable and transparent platform for complete planning, buying and measurement of mobile video ad campaigns. Vdopia Inc. is a privately held, venture-backed company headquartered in Silicon Valley with offices in Fremont, CA, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, India, Singapore & Australia.

Purchased the 7'3" Frog/Swimbait and it is so versatile. I've used Vendetta's, Bucoo's, Jason Christie series, and KVD's, but the Okuma TCS blows them all away for not a whole lot of money more. The balance of these rods are great, very light and very powerful, grips and handle are very comfy too. Can't say enough good about them. Great job Okuma, and Scott Martin. From: Unknown: 6/2/17 Comments: I have never used Okuma tackle, but I am a fan of Scott Martin, so I figured I would give these rods a shot.  I got the 7'3" H about a month and a half ago and have been putting it through its paces ever since.  I can't find a single thing I don't like about this rod.  The balance is perfect and it is very light.  This is now my go to rod.  The designation on this rod is frog/swimbait, but I have done everything on this rod from throwing shaky heads to an A-rig.  Aside from throwing a dropshot, I don't think there is anything I wouldn't use this rod for.  The guides are perfect size, they aren't completely micro, but they aren't big buy any means.  I saw a video where Scott described them as "medium micro guides".  I have flipped 50 lb braid to a 20 lb fluro leader with an alberto knot without a single issue with the knot passing through the guides.  I will definitely be getting more Okuma TCS rods. From: Dan: PA 5/23/17 Comments: I got the 7'6 h and it is absolutely amazing! It's so light and ans so well balanced. But the thing is, is that it's so weird how the 7'3 h is 17 to 65 lb. test and the 7'6 is 14 to 30 lb. test. But whatever, if you were ever going to get a flipping and pitching rod, I highly recommend that you should get it! From: Michael United States 5/9/17 Comments: I have the 7 foot 3 Frog/Swimbait rod and it is an awesome rod. Scott mentions in one of his videos how it is a great all around rod and I could not agree more. I use it for so many techniques from jigs, swimbaits, frogs, chatterbaits, just about anything. If you don't wanna spend over 150$ for a rod like myself this is a great rod for you. From: Bill: 5/7/17 Comments: The Matt Daddy TCS Extra Heavy is great for punching, flipping, & pitching !  Awesome, but not for casting. The action is superb, but with the first offset eye, casting distance over forty feet may result in a backlash. Awesome job on a rod for matt punching, pitching, & flipping, but this rod must be made for casting enthusiast as well !  The best rod action Okuma has ever built !!! From: William - Thomaston, GA 3/30/17 Comments: Just purchased the 7'11" xheavy mat daddy and a 7' heavy. I got to fish with them all weekend. They both appear to be constructed well with no flaws in craftsmanship, that I can find. The following is my assessment of both rods separately:7' heavy, is as light as a loomis and every bit as fishable. I threw a swim jig on it all weekend and never got a bite so, I cant attest to the sensitivity but it feels like it is right where it should be. very easy rod to handle. it is not as heavy as some "heavy" rods I have used. I don't know what has changed with rod makers in the last 5 years or so but when I used to look for medium heavy rods for certain applications, now it requires me to find a heavy rod. all things considered I am pleased with my purchase.7'11" xheavy, i have owned numerous high end flipping rods and I will say that this rod is the best out there for the price. I have NEVER fished a rod that can handle pitching heavy weights as smooth as this one does. EFFORTLESS. It is super light and sensitive. feels like a 7'3 rod in your hand because it is so well balanced and light. plenty of strength too. I am always skeptical of reviews that claim how light or sensitive a rod is. I always have to see for myself because i have been led astray too many times and i have the receipts to prove it. it blows away my fitzgerald 7'11 xheavy and is on par with my old kistler helium LTA. the biggest difference to me is this one is under $150. If you are looking for a flipping rod for heavy weights without having to spend a lot of $$$. this is your rod. From: Steve - Central Florida 3/13/17 Comments: I picked up the 7-3 frog/swimbait rod....  love it!!  Caught a 5 pounder in some heavy grass on it on a keitech fat impact on a 6/0 hook on 65lb braid... handled it no problem!!  Bought another same exact rod!! From: Mike: Slidell, LA 3/8/17 Comments: I have a 7'3 h frog rod and a 7' m+ crank/jerkbait rod. Both are just fantastic. Very well made. The 7' m+ has a beautiful action and keeps fish on trebles buttoned up well. I have abused the heck out of the 7'3 h frog rod- even caught a 12 and an 11 lber on it, and it handled them both beautifully. The 11 even buried itself in the weeds- the rod was about doubled over but it got the fish in with a nice side salad included. The tip has a great action and it transitions smoothly to a very strong backbone. I will never use a different frog rod. From: Pat 2/25/17 Comments: Flat out high end rod and feels like it! The handle on the top grip flares out a little bit on the end making is so comfortable, it just flat out works! From: Tony: CA 8/11/16 Comments: Got the 7 ft. 6 in. flipping/jig rod. I mostly am pitching and not exactly flipping (what was called once 'doodle-socking' in some places), so I need a rod where the upper 1/4 loads well enough with 3/8 oz bullet weights & jigs to help cast the lures. The more rigid, brutal rods make the 'casting' more like launching the lures more like a high speed derricking. I went through 6 or 7 different rods & configurations until I settled on this one. The TCS flipping/jig 7'6" had the optimum flex in the top 1/4 to pitch baits a good distance. It is very light. The ergonomics are quite good. The up-flared front grip feels great. The small guides are not so small that they snag on the knot between my braid and the monofilament leader. I have a 7' 3" 'frog' designated rod that prevents me from having much of a leader because the knot will snag if it's inside the guides. (The 'Micro' guide is a fad and is stupid. It creates problems.  Small guides are fine. Tiny clearance guides are asking for trouble with leaders.) The price was a bit above my $100 or so target but the extra $$ I spent didn't hurt me at all. Okuma has come from an unknown company 30-some years ago to making great rods. This is my 2nd Okuma rod. The other is a Citrix spinning rod. Excellent. Happy with both.  From: Jason: PA 6/29/16 Comments: I recently purchased two of the Mat Daddy 7'11" Heavy action rods for flipping the grass and buck brush here in east Texas. I find the rod to be a great value & very sensitive & light. It has a good parabolic bend which helps keep the fish pinned. One of my favorite things about the rod is the first eye being very near the reel seat. This helps manage braid very well. I wish I had gone with the extra heavy action instead of the heavy action. It just doesn't seem to have quite the backbone I was looking for. Overall a great rod at a fair price. 4/25/16 Comments: I've got 5 of these rods and they all have equally impressed me. The 7'11" H "Mat Daddy" rod is a brute. The 7'6" H "Flipping/Jig" rod has very strong backbone and but a soft enough tip not to compromise sensitivity. The 7'0" MH "Martin APC" rod is perfect for all of your moving baits from Swim Jigs to Crankbaits. The 6'6" M+ "Jerk/Crank" rod has a very soft tip but enough backbone to control a 5+ lb fish From: Daniel: Monroe, LA 2/13/16 Comments: These are super nice sticks. I use the 7mh for buzz baits, spinnerbaits, chatter baits & skipping docks. The 7h is a great frog rod in water willow or brush. I use the 7'3h as an all purpose jig stick & a 7'6"h for jungle warfare. From: T Maddux: Trion, GA 2/2/16 Comments: I purchased the 7'6" H Flippin/Jig rod and I am very impressed. The lightness of the rod is incredible and it has enough back bone to pull fish from heavy cover. I am looking forward to purchasing the Mat Daddy! From: Andreas: Chassell, MI 8/23/15 Comments:  this rod is awesome I have the 7ft 3 heavy and I teamed it up with a lews 7:3 for manly top water I pulled in a 5 pounder along with 3 pounds of weeds using my frog this rod has a lot of back bone it's an amazing rod I love it and will be buying a lot more of these rods especially for the price you cannot beat them great rods From: Joe: ID 7/15/15 Comments: Love these rods! I have 3 in rotation now and beat the living snot out of them with no issues. Problem is It  takes 10 purchases of the same model to find 4 that are consistant with the actions, weight and balance points. The guides sometimes come misaligned and crooked. Very poor Quality control! I'm glad I got them from Tackle Warehouse otherwise i'd be stuck with defective rods.  Get these in your hands before buying on line! From: Steve: NJ 7/7/15 Comments: Have used the 7' MH for about a year now and am very pleased.  Lure ratings are accurate and the mod fast action bends at probably 30-40% from tip.  I use the rod for shallow and medium cranks and haven't had an issue.  The rod is easy on the eyes and reel seat is comfortable.  The hook keeper is in a tricky spot at handle which may lead to trebles in hand.  Would probably be a good bladed jig and lipless crank rod too if I could ever put away squarebills. From: Montanaro: Touchdown City, WV 4/19/15 Comments: When people are going to buy this rod, they need to take into consideration that most of the rod actions are moderate fast here, that makes it feel "softer" than the usual fast and extra fast action. Hope this helps! From: Stephen: Manchester, CT 1/16/15 Comments: These are great rods that are often overlooked. I purchased one just to try it out, and then I purchased a few more afterward. Very light, sensitive and comfortable. Cosmetics are awesome as well. The action on these rods might be a bit softer that most people had already stated when in comparison to other brands, but it handled the fishes just fine for me. From: Chuong: San Jose, CA 12/1/14 Comments: I purchased The 6'9 MH, This rod is going to be my Crank bait/spinner bait rod. I love the guides they are smaller than traditional but not as tiny as micro. I agree with the review from K.G the rod feels more like a medium action than MH, this works for me tossing crank baits. From: CJ: Canada Comments: I purchased the 7ft Medium Heavy as a rod to use for every day jig and worm fishing. The first thing I noticed when I received the rod was how soft the action was. Definitely more of a Medium (bordering on ML) action than a MH. Much softer than any MH rod I've ever used or felt. The balance and sensitivity are nice, but It does not have enough strength to handle jigs over 1/4oz. This rod will make a very nice spinnerbait, senko, and crank bait rod, but that's not what I bought it for. My advice would be to get one of these in your hands before you buy it to make sure you get the proper action for it's intended use. I wish I had bought the Heavy action. From: K.G.

Scottish Perspectives on Upland Management

Description



Scotland is at the heart of modern, sustainable upland management. Large estates cover vast areas of the uplands, with a long, complex and emotive history of ownership and use.In recent decades, the Scottish uplands have increasingly been the arena for passionate debates over large-scale land management issues. Crucially, what kinds of ownership and management will best deliver sustainable futures for upland environments and communities?Although the globally unique dominance of private ownership remains a distinctive characteristic of Scotland>'s uplands, increasing numbers of estates are now owned by environmental NGOs and local communities, especially since the Land Reform (Scotland) Act of 2003. A decade after the passage of this landmark Act, this book synthesises research carried out on a diverse range of upland estates by the Centre for Mountain Studies at Perth College, University of the Highlands and Islands. The findings from privately-owned estates as well as those owned by communities, charities and conservation groups will prove enlightening and relevant to upland managers, policy makers, and researchers across Britain and Europe.With the Scottish Government promoting a vision of environmental sustainability, and with the new diversity of ownerships and management now appearing, this timely and topical book investigates the implications of these different types of land ownership for sustainable upland management.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
