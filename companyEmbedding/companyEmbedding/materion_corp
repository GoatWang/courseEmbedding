					Full Description



Materion Corporation, incorporated on February 1, 2000, through its subsidiaries, is an integrated producer of engineered materials used in a range of electrical, electronic, thermal and structural applications. The Company operates in four segments: Performance Alloys and Composites, Advanced Materials, Precision Coatings, and Other. Its products include precious and non-precious specialty metals, inorganic chemicals and powders, specialty coatings, specialty engineered beryllium and copper-based alloys, beryllium composites, ceramics and engineered clad, and plated metal systems. The Company's products are sold into various markets, including consumer electronics, industrial components, defense, medical, automotive electronics, telecommunications infrastructure, energy, commercial aerospace, science, services and appliance.Performance Alloys and CompositesThe Performance Alloys and Composites segment consists of businesses, such as Performance Metals and Technical Materials. Its Performance Metals includes Strip products, Bulk products, Beryllium hydroxide and Beryllium products. Performance Metals produces strip and bulk form alloy products, beryllium-based metals, beryllium and aluminum metal matrix composites, in rod, sheet, foil, and a range of customized forms, beryllia ceramics, and bulk metallic glass materials. This business also operates bertrandite ore mine and refinery, which is located in Utah, providing feedstock hydroxide for its beryllium business and external sales. Strip products include thin gauge precision strip and small diameter rod and wire. These products are made with copper, nickel, and/or beryllium alloys to provide combinations of conductivity, reliability, and formability for use as connectors, contacts, springs, switches, relays, shielding, and bearings. Its end markets for strip products include consumer electronics, telecommunications infrastructure, automotive electronics, aerospace, industrial, appliance, and medical.The Company's Bulk products are made with copper, nickel, and/or beryllium alloys in plate, rod, bar, tube, and other customized forms that, depending upon the application, may provide strength, corrosion or wear resistance, thermal conductivity, or lubricity. Applications for bulk products include oil and gas drilling and production components, bearings, bushings, welding rods, plastic mold tooling, and undersea telecommunications housing equipment. Its end markets for bulk products include industrial components, commercial aerospace, energy, and telecommunications infrastructure. Strip and bulk products are distributed internationally through a network of company-owned service centers, outside distributors, and agents. Beryllium hydroxide is produced at its milling operations in Utah from its bertrandite mine and purchased beryl ore. The hydroxide is used primarily as a raw material input for strip and bulk products and for beryllium products. Its Beryllium products business manufactures beryllium, beryllium aluminum, and aluminum metal matrix composites (MMCs), beryllia ceramics, and bulk metallic glass materials. These materials are used in applications that require stiffness and/or density. Defense and science are the end markets for beryllium products, while other markets served include industrial components, commercial aerospace, medical, energy, and telecommunications infrastructure. Products are also sold for acoustics, optical scanning, and performance automotive applications.The Company's Technical Materials business produces strip metal products with clad inlay and overlay metals, including metals electroplated systems, electron beam welded systems, contour profiled systems, and solder-coated metal systems. These specialty strip metal products provide a range of thermal, electrical, or mechanical properties from a surface area or particular section of the material. Its cladding and plating capabilities allow a metal or other base metal to be applied in continuous strip form. Major applications for these products include connectors, contacts, power lead frames, and semiconductors, while markets are automotive electronics, consumer electronics, energy and medical markets.Advanced MaterialsThe Advanced Materials segment produces chemicals, microelectronics packaging, precious metal, non-precious metal, and specialty metal products, including vapor deposition targets, frame lid assemblies, clad and precious metal pre-forms, high temperature braze materials, and ultra-pure wire. These products are used in semiconductor logic and memory, medical, energy, lighting, defense, optics, and wireless communications applications within the consumer electronics, industrial components, and telecommunications infrastructure end markets. Advanced Materials also has metal recovery operations and in-house refining that allow for the recycling of precious metals. Advanced Materials products are sold directly from its facilities throughout the United States, Asia, and Europe, as well as through direct sales offices and independent sales representatives throughout the world. These materials are used in wireless, light-emitting diode (LED), handheld devices and other applications, as well as in a various applications within the defense end market.Precision CoatingsThe Precision Coatings segment includes units, such as Precision Optics and Large Area Coatings. Precision Optics produces sputter-coated precision thin film coatings and optical filter materials. Based in Westford, Massachusetts, the Company has manufacturing facilities in the United States and China. Large Area Coatings produces sputter-coated precision flexible thin film materials. Based in Windsor, Connecticut, the business manufactures and distributes coated and converted thin film material solutions primarily for medical testing and diagnosis applications. Precision Coatings products are sold directly from its facilities throughout the United States and Asia, as well as through direct sales offices and independent sales representatives throughout the world.The Company competes with NGK Insulators, Global Brass, Copper, Inc., Wieland Electric, Inc., Aurubis Stolberg GmbH, Diehl Metall Stiftung & Co.
