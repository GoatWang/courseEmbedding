Lazard Asset Management Pacific Co. Privacy Policy and Disclosure Statement
In this Privacy Policy and Collection Statement the expressions "Lazard Pacific", “Lazard Pacific entity”, "we", "us" and "our" are references to Lazard Asset Management Pacific Co. ABN 13 064 523 619 AFS Licence 238432 and those Australian registered bodies corporate related to it.
We are subject to the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).
This Privacy Policy and Collection Statement explains how we protect the privacy of your personal information under the APPs. It also sets out the matters that we are required to explain to individuals under APP5. The principles set out in this document apply to any personal information we collect about you, whether you provide it to us via our web site or other method or under any agreement or arrangement with us and to information which we might collect about you from other sources.
This Privacy Policy and Collection Statement does not apply to acts and practices of Lazard Pacific which relate directly to the employee records of Lazard Pacific’s current and former employees.
How we collect and hold personal information
We generally collect your personal information directly from you. For example, we may collect personal information about you when you deal with us over the telephone, (including recordings of those telephone conversations of which we have made you aware), send us correspondence (whether by letter, fax or email) or contact us through our web site, subscribe electronically to our web site/publications if available, or when you have contact with us in person. We also collect personal information about you, when you apply for a position with us.
Generally, the type of personal information we collect about you includes your name, date of birth, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address and any other personal information required to identify you for the purposes of Australian anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing legislation. We may also collect your username and password to log in to our website and the organisation for which you work, your position in the organisation and the dealings we have had with you during your employment with that organisation. In certain circumstances, we may also collect sensitive information about you such as information about membership of a professional or trade association, or membership of a trade union or police records of prospective employees. We may also collect your tax file number and other details in relation to your taxation position, when you make an application for one of our products.
There may be occasions when we need to source personal information about you from a third party. For example, we may collect personal information from a company for whom you work, other organisations with whom you have any dealings, a recruitment agency, a credit-reporting agency in relation to employment checks, an information service provider or from a publicly maintained record.
We may also collect web site visitors' contact information (like their e-mail addresses). We utilise "cookies" which enable us to monitor traffic patterns and to serve you more efficiently if you revisit the site. A cookie does not identify you personally but it does identify your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and this will provide you with an opportunity to either accept or reject it in each instance.
You may choose not to identify yourself, or to use a pseudonym when you deal with us. However we will need to identify you if we are required or authorised by Australian law, (such as anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing legislation), or a court/tribunal order to do so or if it is impracticable for us to deal with you if you are not identified.
Purposes of collection
Lazard Pacific collects personal information for any one or some of the following purposes:

to provide you or your organisation with information about our product offerings;
to service our relationship with you, including managing your investments, responding to complaints or dispute you may have about our services and providing you with information from time to time about your investments;
to consider making offers of employment or for employment purposes;
to receive services from you or the organisation which employs you;
to advise you of new investment developments and to undertake other marketing activities such as informing you about any of our products and services that we think may be of interest to you,
to comply with our legal obligations.

If you do not provide some or all of the information requested, we may not be able either to provide you with an appropriate level of service or to fulfil another applicable purpose of collection.
We may disclose your personal information to our related bodies corporate, your consultant, custodian, asset consultant, broker, or financial adviser on your behalf or to your external professional service providers such as auditors, accountants or lawyers. If we receive personal information about you that we have not solicited, we will determine within a reasonable time if we could have collected it for any of the purposes listed above (which may require us to use or disclose it to do so). If we decide we could not have collected the information and it is not in a Commonwealth record, we will destroy or de-identify the information as soon as possible. Otherwise we will handle the information in accordance with this policy.
How we use or disclose your personal information
We will use and disclose personal information for the primary purpose for which it was collected or for any purpose for which you have consented. We may also use and disclose personal information for related purposes, such as dealing with any complaints or disputes you may have about our services and also to provide to you of information concerning investment developments and other services offered by us. We do not disclose personal information we collect to third parties for the purpose of allowing them to direct market their products and services to you. We engage third party contractors to perform services for us which involves the contractor handling personal information we hold. For example, we engage third party contractors such as Lazard Asset Management LLC, our parent company, to provide investment management services. In these situations, we prohibit the third party contractor from using personal information about you except for the specific purpose for which we supply it.
Direct marketing communications
We may from time to time send you promotional or marketing information about our products and services. You can ask to stop receiving direct marketing communications from us at any time by contacting us using the contact details below and expressing your preference to stop receiving some or all marketing communications or to only receive them in a particular way.
Other people's information which you provide to us
If you provide personal information to us about someone else (such as one of your directors or employees or someone with whom you have dealings) you must ensure that you are entitled to disclose that information to us and that, without us taking any further steps required by privacy laws, we may collect, use and disclose such information for the purposes described above. For example, you should take reasonable steps to ensure the individual concerned is aware of the various matters detailed in this Privacy Policy and any collection Statement provided to you, as those matters relate to that individual, including our identity, how to contact us, our purposes of collection, our information use and disclosure practices, the individual's right to obtain access to and correct their information and to make a complaint, how we will deal with these and the consequences for the individual if the information is not provided
Sharing information within the Lazard group
Each Lazard Pacific entity may disclose personal information to other Lazard Pacific entities, which will use and disclose the information only for the purpose for which it was originally collected. Contact details for all Lazard Pacific entities are as set out below.

							A Word On Risk

							Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Concentration in infrastructure-related securities involves sector risk and concentration risk, particularly greater exposure to adverse economic, regulatory, political, legal, liquidity, and tax risks associated with MLPs and REITS. Foreign investments involve additional risks including currency fluctuations and economic and political instability. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Common stocks are subject to market risk or the risk of decline. Small- and mid-cap stocks are subject to greater price volatility. The use of derivatives involves substantial financial risks and transaction costs. The Fund’s potential investment in other investment companies means shareholders bear their proportionate share of fund expenses and indirectly, the expenses of other investment companies. Fund investments in ETFs may involve tracking error. Preferred securities may involve greater credit risk than other debt instruments.

						








Returns quoted represent past performance which is no guarantee of future performance.  Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than their original cost. Due to market conditions, current performance may be higher or lower than the data shown. Returns without sales charge do not reflect the imposition of the maximum sales charge, which would reduce returns. Total returns for a period of less than one year are cumulative. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Class A shares have a 5.75% maximum sales charge. Class C shares have a 1% CDSC for redemptions within less than one year, which is not reflected in the one-year total return. Class I shares have no sales charge and may be purchased under limited circumstances or by specified classes of investors. Class R3 shares have no sales charge and are available only to certain retirement plan clients. Class R6 shares have no sales charge and are available to certain qualified retirement plans and other investors as set forth in the statement of additional information.Distribution Rate is the most recent dividend per share (annualized) divided by the respective price per share. The SEC 30-Day Yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and is based on the maximum offer price per share as of the date specified. The Distribution Rate also differs from the SEC 30-Day Yield because the Fund may be paying out more or less than it is earning and it may not include the effect of amortization of bond premium. Subsidized yields reflect fee waivers in effect. Without such waivers, yields would be reduced. Unsubsidized yields do not reflect fee waivers in effect.Expense ratios are based on the Fund's most recent fiscal year end. The net expense ratio reflects a contractual commitment by the Fund's investment adviser to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses through September 30, 2018. Absent the waiver and/or reimbursement, expenses would be higher and total returns would be less.

Brookfield Global Listed Infrastructure Income Fund
Overview

Objective and Strategy
The Fund's investment objective is to provide a high level of total return, with an emphasis on income. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in securities of publicly traded infrastructure companies.
Why Invest in Brookfield Global Listed Infrastructure Income Fund Inc.
Access to a Rapidly Growing Asset Class with Compelling Supply/Demand Characteristics
The growing need for infrastructure spending and the significant cost of funding such projects has led to significant growth in global listed infrastructure as an asset class. Historically, supply and demand characteristics have been compelling, driven by the combination of supply that has been constrained by high barriers to entry and relatively stable demand from essential services. 
The Attractive Investment Potential of Global Listed Infrastructure
The Fund invests in publicly traded infrastructure companies believed by Brookfield to have stable, long-lived assets that are essential to the global economy. Historically, attractive long-term total returns for the asset class have been tied to cash flows derived from long-term contracts, concessions and regulated revenues, which tend to be stable and correlated with inflation. As such, the Fund has the potential for the payment of attractive dividends that may grow over time. The Manager also believes that a portfolio composed of well diversified global infrastructure securities has the potential for capital appreciation and strong risk-adjusted investment returns.
Access to a Global Investment Platform and a Management Team with Longstanding Infrastructure Expertise
The Fund provides an opportunity to access a portfolio management team with deep operational and direct investment experience as well as track record investing in global listed infrastructure securities. The team also draws upon internal expertise and knowledge within Brookfield and its affiliates, which provides extensive owner/operator insights into industry drivers and trends.

Disclosure Information


NOT FDIC INSURED | NOT BANK GUARANTEED | MAY LOSE VALUE
Some funds may utilize leveraging to seek to enhance the yield and net asset value of its common stock, through bank borrowings, issuance of short-term debt securities or shares of preferred stock, or a combination thereof. However, these objectives cannot be achieved in all interest rate environments. While leverage may result in a higher yield for the fund, the use of leverage involves risk, including the potential for higher volatility of the NAV, fluctuations of dividends and other distributions paid by the fund and the market price of the fund's common stock, among others. Certain funds may invest assets in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, including issuers from emerging markets. Foreign investing involves special risks, including foreign currency risk and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments.

Any portion of the Fund’s distributions that is a return of capital does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income.” The tax status of distributions will be determined at the end of the taxable year.

Disclosure Information


Brookfield Investment Management Inc. expressly disclaims all liability for errors and omissions in these materials and for the use or interpretation by others of information contained on the site.
Performance data quoted represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Performance quoted without sales charges would be reduced if the sales charges were applied. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Performance includes the reinvestment of income, dividends and capital gain distributions. To obtain performance information current to the most recent month-end, please call (855) 777-8001.
Some funds may utilize leveraging to seek to enhance the yield and net asset value of its common stock, through bank borrowings, issuance of short-term debt securities or shares of preferred stock, or a combination thereof. However, these objectives cannot be achieved in all interest rate environments. While leverage may result in a higher yield for the fund, the use of leverage involves risk, including the potential for higher volatility of the NAV, fluctuations of dividends and other distributions paid by the fund and the market price of the fund's common stock, among others. Certain funds may invest assets in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, including issuers from emerging markets. Foreign investing involves special risks, including foreign currency risk and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments.
An investor should consider a fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.

Performance data quoted is based on average annualized returns and net of fees.
The source for all performance and index data is Morgan Stanley Investment Management Limited. 
Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. The value of the investments and the income from them can go down as well as up and an investor may not get back the amount invested. Returns may increase or decrease as a result of currency fluctuations. Performance data for funds with less than one year's track record is not shown. Performance is calculated net of fees. YTD performance data is not annualised. Performance of other share classes, when offered, may differ. Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund carefully before investing. The prospectus and key investor information document (KIID) contains this and other information about the fund. Please read the prospectus and KIID carefully before you invest.
The higher the category (1-7), the greater the potential reward, but also the greater the risk of losing the investment. Category 1 does not indicate a risk free investment. Refer to the fund's Key Investor Information document (KIID) under Resources for share class tailored risk rating and warnings.
The Ongoing Charges Figure (“OCF”) reflects the payments and expenses which cover aspects of operating the fund and is deducted from the assets over the period. It includes fees paid for investment management, trustee/custodian, and administration charges.
Total expenses ("TER") charged to the share class for the current reporting month, calculated net of any waivers and expressed as an annualised percentage of average net assets for the month.
Morningstar
 Ratings: The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Ratings do not take into account sales loads.

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.

            Strategy
        
The fund invests in the securities of companies whose principal business is the ownership, management, construction, operation, utilization or financing of infrastructure assets and which are located around the world, including emerging markets.
We combine top-down macro analysis with bottom-up research of individual stocks to locate investment opportunities.
While benchmark aware, we rely primarily on our team’s research and local expertise when making investment decisions.



            Benefits
        
Growth Potential. The fund provides access to a market with attractive growth potential that spans both developed and emerging markets.
Diversified Source of Income. Global listed infrastructure securities offer an added source of income beyond traditional fixed income asset classes, which could make the fund compelling to yield-oriented investors. 



Experienced Management. Franklin Real Asset Advisors has been investing globally since 1984.

            Investing In The Fund
        

What Are the Risks?

All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
Investments in infrastructure-related securities involve special risks, such as high interest costs, high leverage and increased susceptibility to adverse economic or regulatory developments affecting the sector.
Investments in utility company securities, if purchased for dividend yield, involve additional interest rate risks. When interest rates have risen, the stock prices of these companies have tended to fall. Thus, as the prices of utility company stocks in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund’s share price may decline.
By focusing on an industry or group of industries, the fund carries much greater risk of adverse developments and price movements in such industries than a fund that invests in a wider variety of industries.
Special risks are associated with foreign investing, including currency rate fluctuations, economic instability and political developments. The risks of foreign investing may be greater in developing or emerging markets.
Investors should be comfortable with fluctuations in the value of their investment, as small and mid-sized-company stocks can be volatile, especially over the short term.
Smaller or relatively new or unseasoned companies can be particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions, and their prospects for growth are less certain than those of larger, more established companies.
The fund’s use of derivatives and foreign currency techniques involve special risks as such techniques may not achieve the anticipated benefits and/or may result in losses to the fund.
These and other risk considerations are discussed in the fund’s prospectus.

Total Returns include change in share price, assume reinvestment of all distributions, and reflect the deduction of fund expenses and applicable fees. Total Returns With Sales Charge: returns reflect the deduction of the stated sales charge. Total returns, distribution rate, and yields reflect any applicable expense reductions, without which the results for those impacted funds would have been lower.
For more information on any of our funds, contact your financial advisor or download a free prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund's investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information.  Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
Most Franklin Templeton funds offer multiple share classes. Share classes are subject to different fees and expenses, which will affect their performance. In general, Class A shares have a maximum initial sales charge; Class C shares have a 1% contingent deferred sales charge; Class Z, Advisor Class and Class R6 shares have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees; Class R shares have no sales charges, but do have a Rule 12b-1 fee.
Performance data represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results. Current performance may differ from figures shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.

Footnotes

A statistical measurement of the range of a fund's total returns. In general, a higher standard deviation means greater volatility. Based on the fund's monthly returns over the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A statistical measurement of a fund's historical risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by taking a fund's excess return over that of the three-month Treasury bill divided by its standard deviation. Higher values generally indicate better historical risk-adjusted performance. Based on the 3 years ended as of the date of the calculation.
The annualized percentage difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance given its level of market risk, as measured by beta.  Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
The fund's 30-day standardized yield is calculated over a trailing 30-day period using the yield to maturity on bonds and/or the dividends accrued on stocks. It may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate, which reflects the fund's past dividends paid to shareholders.
Public Offering Price — Purchase price for each share of the fund on a given day. It includes the maximum initial sales charge, if any.
Net Asset Value — The amount per share you would receive if you sold shares that day.
Source: Morningstar®. The style box reveals a fund's investment style. The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). Placement is determined by fund portfolio holding figures most recently entered into Morningstar's database and corresponding market conditions. Shaded areas show the past 3 years of quarterly data. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Source: Morningstar®. For each mutual fund and exchange traded fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure against other funds in the same category. This measure takes into account variations in a fund's monthly performance, and does not take into account the effects of sales charges, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The weights are: 100% 3-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% 5-year rating/40% 3-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 5-year rating/20% 3-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent 3-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Morningstar Rating™ is for the named share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. Past performance is not an indicator or a guarantee of future performance.

A measure of the fund's volatility relative to the market, as represented by the S&P Global Infrastructure Index. A beta greater than 1.00 indicates volatility greater than the market. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Percentage of the fund's returns explained by movements in the S&P Global Infrastructure Index. 100 equals perfect correlation to the index. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
The Gross Expense Ratio does not include an expense reduction contractually guaranteed through 11/30/17. Fund investment results reflect the fee reduction; without this reduction, the results would have been lower. Please see the prospectus for additional information.
Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Franklin Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin California Ultra-Short Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.

Class A shares include maximum front-end sales charge of 5.50% (Alternatives), 5.25% (Equity) and 4.25% (Fixed Income).  Class B shares include deferred sales charge of 5.00% which declines to zero after sixth year.  Class C shares include deferred sales charge of 1.00% which declines to zero after first year. Class L shares, Class I, and Class IS shares are not subject to a sales charge.
Where the net expense ratio is lower than the gross expense ratio, certain fees have been waived and/ or expenses reimbursed. These waivers and/or reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of the applicable fund’s current prospectus (unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus) or until such time as the fund's Board of Directors/Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the fund's current prospectus. The minimum initial investment is $5,000,000 for Class I shares.
Note: On March 30, 2015, the Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc. Select Global Infrastructure was renamed Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc. Global Infrastructure Portfolio.
The Fund has suspended offering Class L shares of the Portfolio for sale to all investors.
Class IS shares, are  being offered only to eligible investors who must meet a minimum initial investment of $10,000,000 or be a defined contribution, defined benefit or other employer sponsored employee benefit plan, whether or not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), in each case subject to the discretion of the Portfolio's investment advisor.
Growth of Investment illustration is based on an initial investment of $10,000 made since fund inception, assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but does not include sales charges and fees. Performance would have been lower if sales charges and fees had been included. Results are hypothetical.

 Subject to change daily. Fund information, Portfolio Composition and Characteristics are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security or securities in the sectors and/or countries presented.

 Returns are net of fees and assume the reinvestment of all dividends and income. Returns for less than one year are cumulative (not annualized). Performance of other share classes will vary.

 Please keep in mind that double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.

 PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS DEFINITIONS
 The Net Asset Value (NAV) per share is determined by dividing the value of the fund's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the fund at a given time. Weighted average market capitalization is a stock market index weighted by the market capitalization of each stock in the index. In such a weighting scheme, larger companies account for a greater portion of the index. Most indexes are constructed in this manner, with the best example being the S&P 500. Weighted median market capitalization is the point at which half of the market value of a portfolio is invested in stocks with a greater market cap, and consequently the other half is invested in stocks with a lower market cap.

Turnover is sourced from the fund's current prospectus.

RISK/RETURN DEFINITIONS
 Alpha is the excess return or value added (positive or negative) of the portfolio’s return relative to the return of the benchmark. Beta is a measure of the relative volatility of a security or portfolio to the market's upward or downward movements. A beta greater than 1.0 identifies an issue or fund that will move more than the market, while a beta less than 1.0 identifies an issue or fund that will move less than the market. The Beta of the Market is always equal to 1. Information ratio is the portfolio’s alpha or excess return per unit of risk, as measured by tracking error, versus the portfolio’s benchmark. R squared measures how well an investment’s returns correlate to an index. An R squared of 100 means the portfolio performance is 100% correlated to the index’s, whereas a low r-squared means that the portfolio performance is less correlated to the index’s. Sharpe ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated as the ratio of excess return to standard deviation. The Sharpe ratio determines reward per unit of risk. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the historical risk-adjusted performance. Standard deviation measures how widely individual performance returns, within a performance series, are dispersed from the average or mean value. Tracking error is the amount by which the performance of the portfolio differs from that of the benchmark. Upside/downside market capture measures performance in up/ down markets relative to the market benchmark.
RISK CONSIDERATIONS
There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and that the value of Portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Companies within the infrastructure industry are subject to a variety of factors that may adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest, leverage and regulatory costs, difficulty raising capital, the effect of an economic slowdown or recession and surplus capacity, and increased competition. Other risks include technological innovation, significant changes in the number of end-users, an increasing deregulatory environment, natural and environmental risks, and terrorist attacks. Stocks of small- and medium- capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers so changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility in the portfolio. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk).
Morningstar
 Rankings: The percentile rankings are based on the average annual total returns for the periods stated and do not include any sales charges, but do include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains and Rule 12b-1 fees. The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1.
Ratings: The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Ratings do not take into account sales loads.

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)

		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
