USA Truck, Inc.



Public
Transportation





Following deregulation of the trucking industry in 1980, Arkansas Best Corporation (parent to ABF Freight System, Inc.) started a small, non-union truckload carrier named Crawford Produce, Inc.(CPI) in 1983. That small company began with less then 10 tractors, but turned a profit and slowly grew. In 1986, this small subsidiary was incorporated under the name USA Truck, Inc. Robert M. Powell, our former Chairman of the Board, was the Senior Vice President at ABF responsible for managing several of these small subsidiaries.On January 1, 1989, six principals, led by Mr. Powell, purchased USA Truck from Arkansas Best Corporation for $2.4 million in cash plus the assumption of over $25 million in debt. Three of these individuals, who had extensive experience in the trucking industry gained from their employment with Arkansas Best, were already fulfilling management roles with USA Truck. In March 1992, USA Truck completed its Initial Public Offering.
