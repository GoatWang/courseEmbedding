Item Description: Faber & Faber, 1966. First thus. First impression. Fine in a very good dust wrapper, slightly soiled to the rear panel. Douglas was arguably the most promising poet of his generation and Alamein to Zem Zem is one of the great prose works to come out of the 1939-45 war. An account of the author's experiences as a tank commander with the Sherwood Rangers at Alamein and elsewhere in the Western Desert; the vivid and acutely-observed narrative is unmistakably the work of a poet throughout. Douglas was killed in Normandy in June 1944 before he could undertake a final revision of the text for publication. Frontis portrait of Douglas together with seven of his line drawings in the text. Lawrence Durrell and Keith Douglas had met in Cairo, he published some of Douglas poetry in his magazine Personal Landscape and this Faber edition is enhanced by Durrell's Introduction, however, it omits the colour plates and middle-east poetry of the 1946 first edition.  Bookseller Inventory # 2882
