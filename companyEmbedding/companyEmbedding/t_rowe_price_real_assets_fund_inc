				Real Assets Fund

Investor Class
PRAFX

Invests at least 80% in "real assets" and securities of companies that are engaged in activities related to, or have substantial ownership of, real assets. Real assets include any assets that have physical properties, real estate, basic materials, equipment, utilities and infrastructure, and commodities. 
Because the fund focuses its investments in certain industries that involve activities related to real assets, the fund is more susceptible to adverse developments affecting one or more of these industries and may perform poorly during a downturn in any of those industries. During periods of low inflation, the fund's goal of investing in companies that offer some protection from accelerating inflation could lessen relative returns and cause the fund to underperform other stock funds. Since there is no limit on the fund's investments in foreign securities or emerging markets, it will be subject to the risk that some holdings will lose value because of unfavorable currency exchange rates or adverse political or economic developments overseas.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of a 2.00% redemption fee on shares held for 90 days or less; if it did, the performance would be lower.

The T. Rowe Price Funds - I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund (the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown above) and the actual performance results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed over the periods shown, would have been higher. 



All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Please visit a fund’s profile page for additional information on its investment objective, strategies, and risks. 



The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown next to the gross and net expense ratio values above. Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus. 



Closed to new investors except for a direct rollover from a retirement plan into a T. Rowe Price IRA invested in this fund.



Certain limited exceptions may apply to these scenarios. The funds reserve the right, when in the judgment of T. Rowe Price, it is not adverse to a fund's interest, to permit certain types of investors to open new accounts in a fund, to impose further restrictions, or to close a fund to any additional investments, all without notice.

Net of fees performance reflects the deduction of the highest applicable management fee ("Model Net Fee") that would be charged based on the fee schedule appropriate to you for this mandate, without the benefit of breakpoints. Please be advised that the composite may include other investment products that are subject to management fees that are inapplicable to you but are in excess of the Model Net Fee. Therefore, the actual performance of all the portfolios in the composite on a net fee basis will be different, and may be lower, than the Model Net Fee performance. However, such Model Net Fee performance is intended to provide the most appropriate example of the impact management fees would have by applying management fees relevant to you to the gross performance of the composite. Past performance cannot guarantee future results. 



Returns for time periods greater than one year are annualized.

The verification report is available upon request. Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
    

      TRP is a U.S. investment management firm with various investment advisers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, and other regulatory bodies in various countries and holds itself out as such to potential clients for GIPS purposes. TRP further defines itself under GIPS as a discretionary investment manager providing services primarily to institutional clients with regard to various mandates, which include U.S, international, and global strategies but excluding the services of the Private Asset Management group.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

Client Centered Approach
 Our Investment Process
 Personalized Service

 

Explore Private Asset Management at  T. Rowe Price


 Each portfolio should have an investment program tailor-made to fit the objectives of the individual
			investor, based on requirements for safety of principal, spendable income, or capital growth.
— Thomas Rowe Price, Jr.



T.  Rowe Price offers an approach to investment management that has been consistently applied over generations. 
			Whatever your objective—building and	preserving wealth, growing your income, creating a legacy, or meeting your 
			philanthropic target—the Private Asset Management Group brings investment management expertise and world-class 
			service to help you achieve your goals.






Focusing on our Client's Objectives is Our Foremost Priority



Our portfolio management process begins with you, the client. Through personal meetings and consultations, we 
					gain a full understanding of your investment objectives, return needs, risk tolerance, time horizon, liquidity 
					needs, tax considerations, and other critical factors that define your investment guidelines.

With a  clear mutual understanding of your investment objectives and guidelines, we will implement an asset 
					allocation strategy tailored to meet your goals. Our next step is to carefully construct a well-diversified portfolio 
					of securities that combines multiple asset classes and investment styles.





Our Process is Grounded in Comprehensive Research



 If you want to have an understanding of any business, 
						it is important to know the background of the people who started it and directed its past, and the hopes and 
						ambitions of those who are planning its future.
— Thomas Rowe Price, Jr.




T. Rowe Price emphasizes proprietary, fundamental research as the cornerstone of  our investment process. We offer 
					broad investment expertise in a wide array of U.S. and global equities and fixed income securities.

Our equity analysts conduct intensive research including meetings with company managements. These meetings can 
					take a variety of forms, including on-site visits, face-to-face discussions, attendance at industry and investment 
					conferences, as well as hosting companies in our offices. Security selection is driven by fundamental analysis to 
					identify companies that are expected to generate strong long-term returns.



Our fixed income analysts apply rigorous independent credit analysis for both tax-exempt and taxable securities. 
					We believe that superior long-term fixed income performance can be achieved by managing portfolio risk through fundamental 
					research and analysis, active duration management, and sector allocation management.

In today's global economy, we believe it is imperative to understand industry and company fundamentals from a worldwide 
					perspective. Research is conducted in our investment offices in Baltimore, as well as our offices in London, Hong Kong, 
					Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo.





We are Committed to Delivering Personalized Service



 A philosophy, a distinct point of view, and a deep 
						respect for the individual client's needs and wishes.
— Thomas Rowe Price, Jr.




T. Rowe Price believes that our clients are our most important asset. We work closely with our clients and provide 
					direct access to a dedicated portfolio manager who is responsible for actively managing the portfolio's assets.

We also work closely with our client's advisers, including legal and accounting professionals, family offices, 
					and investment consultants, to design investment portfolios that integrate with each client's overall financial strategy.



Finally, we believe in the importance of ongoing, detailed communications with our clients. We conduct regular face-to-face 
					meetings to measure progress toward goals or to adjust investment guidelines relative to changing needs. Clients receive 
					quarterly investment summaries, performance data, and investment letters.

If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

				Morningstar rated the Real Assets Fund among 
129,
129,
115
and 
N/A
Natural Resources
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-,

total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results.

Mutual Fund
Real Assets Fund


      Subscribe





Invests at least 80% in "real assets" and securities of companies that are engaged in activities related to, or have substantial ownership of, real assets. Real assets include any assets that have physical properties, real estate, basic materials, equipment, utilities and infrastructure, and commodities. Because the fund focuses its investments in certain industries that involve activities related to real assets, the fund is more susceptible to adverse developments affecting one or more of these industries and may perform poorly during a downturn in any of those industries. During periods of low inflation, the fund's goal of investing in companies that offer some protection from accelerating inflation could lessen relative returns and cause the fund to underperform other stock funds. Since there is no limit on the fund's investments in foreign securities or emerging markets, it will be subject to the risk that some holdings will lose value because of unfavorable currency exchange rates or adverse political or economic developments overseas.

Strategy






Investment Objective
		The fund seeks to provide long-term growth of capital.



Investment Approach
The strategy seeks to improve the long-term risk/return profile of a diversified equity portfolio by dampening the sensitivity to material changes in the prevailing inflation regime.The fund is designed as an asset allocation product that invests in the securities of companies that are engaged in activities related to real assets.“Real Assets” are assets that have physical properties, such as energy and natural resources, real estate, basic materials, equipment, utilities and infrastructure, and commodities. Such assets may produce cash flows and subsequent valuations that increase when the overall price level in the economy is rising.The fund is expected to respond more favorably to periods of high or rising inflation than the broad equity market does (where broad equity returns are relatively weak) at the cost of less favorable returns during periods of low or falling inflation (where broad equity returns are relatively strong). Thus, as a strategic component of a diversified portfolio, it seeks to dampen the long term volatility of the real (inflation-adjusted) returns of such a portfolio, which is expected to result in a relatively more consistent growth of capital for a long-term investor.Because the fund focuses its investments in certain industries that involve activities related to real assets, the fund is more susceptible to adverse developments affecting one or more of these industries and may perform poorly during a downturn in any of those industries. Since there is no limit on the fund's investments in foreign securities or emerging markets, it will be subject to the risk that some holdings will lose value because of unfavorable currency exchange rates or adverse political or economic developments overseas. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.



Portfolio Construction
Invests primarily in equity securities rather than in direct real assets.Typically 300-350 names in portfolio.Individual position sizes generally less than 5% of total assets.Global orientation.Broadly diversified across real asset sectors and market capitalization.

Benefits & Risks
Because the fund focuses its investments in certain industries that involve activities related to real assets, the fund is more susceptible to adverse developments affecting one or more of these industries and may perform poorly during a downturn in any of those industries.During periods of low inflation, the fund's goal of investing in companies that offer some protection from accelerating inflation could lessen relative returns and cause the fund to underperform other stock funds.Since there is no limit on the fund's investments in foreign securities or emerging markets, it will be subject to the risk that some holdings will lose value because of unfavorable currency exchange rates or adverse political or economic developments overseas.

GIPS® Information

      T. Rowe Price ("TRP") claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). TRP has been independently verified for the 10-year period ended June 30, 2016 by KPMG LLP. The verification report is available upon request. Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
    

      TRP is a U.S. investment management firm with various investment advisers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, and other regulatory bodies in various countries and holds itself out as such to potential clients for GIPS purposes. TRP further defines itself under GIPS as a discretionary investment manager providing services primarily to institutional clients with regard to various mandates, which include U.S, international, and global strategies but excluding the services of the Private Asset Management group.
    

      A complete list and description of all of the Firm's composites and/or a presentation that adheres to the GIPS® standards are 
      available upon request. 
      Additional information regarding the firm's policies and procedures for calculating and reporting performance results is

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
