                    This is a quiet community located north of Tampa, but has easy access to all the big city has to offer, now that the new Suncoast parkway (toll road) is completed. This town provides affordable housing , good schools and city services, easy access  to beaches, great dining and entertainment venues. Located approximately 25 miles north of downtown Tampa, many who work in the city commute daily with no problem, but find Springhill to offer some relief from the hustle and bustle of the big city.

Population trends of tundra-nesting birds at Cape Churchill, Manitoba, in relation to increasing goose populationsProduct Type: Journal ArticleYear: 2008Author(s): Sammler, J.E., D.E. Andersen, and S.K. SkagenSuggested Citation: Sammler, J.E., D.E. Andersen, and S.K. Skagen. 2008. Population trends of tundra-nesting birds at Cape Churchill, Manitoba, in relation to increasing goose populations. The Condor. 110(2): 325-334. To assess potential changes in tundra-nesting bird populations relative to increased herbivory by growing Lesser Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and Ross's Goose (C. rossii) populations, we estimated avian population densities in coastal tundra near Cape Churchill, Manitoba, Canada in June 1984, 1999, and 2000. We also compared bird abundance in altered and intact freshwater sedge (Carex spp.) meadows to assess bird response at a smaller spatial scale, the habitat patch. At the landscape scale, Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) densities were significantly greater in both 1999 and 2000 than 1984, and Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) and Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) densities were greater in 2000 than 1984...
