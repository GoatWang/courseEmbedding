Why do Catholic nuns take a different name?
     At one time all Catholic nuns adopted a new name, perhaps patterned after a saint they wished to emulate and they usually took "Mary" as their second name.  The practice… of taking a new name is now optional, some orders continue it, but many do not, so its common now to see a name like "Sister Barbara Jones".

What does a nun do?
 A nun is a religious woman under solemn vows living a cloistered, contemplative life in a monastery. Their primary vocation is the service of God in the Divine Office, which c…an take up to six and half hours a day to sing properly, and the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. Usually nuns do some other work which can be done in the monastery such as sewing vestments or altar linens, baking altar breads, etc. This is entirely different from a Sister who is a religious woman under perpetual or renewing vows, who lives in the world and usually teach, nurse, or assist in parishes. Confusingly, they are both addressed as "Sister" but have entirely different vocations, and are completely different under Canon law.

What do Nuns do?
 Nuns   . 
Origin and history   . 
The institution of nuns and sisters, who devote themselves in various religious orders to the practice of a life of perfection, dates from th…e first ages of the Church, and women may claim with a certain pride that they were the first to embrace the religious state for its own sake, without regard to missionary work and ecclesiastical functions proper to men. St. Paul speaks of widows, who were called to certain kinds of church work (1 Timothy 5:9), and of virgins (1 Cor., vii), whom he praises for their continence and their devotion to the things of the Lord. The virgins were remarkable for their perfect and perpetual chastity which the Catholic Apologists have extolled as a contrast to pagan corruption (St. Justin, "Apol.", I, c. 15; Migne, "P.G.", VI, 350; St. Ambrose, "De Virginibus", Bk. I, C. 4; Migne, "P.L.", XVI, 193). Many also practiced poverty. From the earliest times they were called the spouses of Christ, according to St. Athanasius, the custom of the Church ("Apol. ad Constant.", sec. 33; Migne, "P.G.", XXV, 639). St. Cyprian describes a virgin who had broken her vows as an adulteress ("Ep. 62", Migne, "P.L.", IV, 370). Tertullian distinguishes between those virgins who took the veil publicly in the assembly of the faithful, and others known to God alone; the veil seems to have been simply that of married women. Virgins vowed to the service of God, at first continued to live with their families, but as early as the end of the third century there were community houses known as  partheuones ; and certainly at the beginning of the same century the virgins formed a special class in the Church, receiving Holy Communion before the laity. The office of Good Friday in which the virgins are mentioned after the porters, and the Litany of the Saints, in which they are invoked with the widows, shows traces of this classification. They were sometimes admitted among the deaconesses for the baptism of adult women and to exercise the functions which St. Paul had reserved for widows of sixty years.  .

Do all nuns have the first name of Mary?
 Not necessarily. It was a standard practice in the Sisters of St Joseph, one religious order. names went like Sr. Mary Monica, etc.  sometimes it was abbreviated to just M on …tombstones , for example Sr. M Monica Gaffney, Mary being understood. the overdraft of Marie posed obvious personnel problems.  










Male and female names of nun?
 I cannot see any connection with Lions, so we will tackle your question about Nuns, I assume you mean female religious. I can't explain it but in some religious orders, it is …quite common for sisters to take names of Male saints and you will have such oddities as Sister Paul ( not Paula) in some cases basically male names are gender-adapted such as Sister Roberta, which is at least feminine, and there are also such odd combinations as Mary Luke, which mix genders, so to speak.l It would appear there are more female saints than male and there would be not problems of a shortage of feminine names. I could never entirely understand this practice. I knew of a Sister Saint Ignatius- obviously named after the Jesuit founder. This is very strange as there are NO Jesuit nuns! Sister St. Ignatius was of the IHM or Immaculate Heart of Mary, an originally French religious order widely engaged in the teaching apostolate. I don't know the reason.. Obviously convents try to prevent and control anything that smacks of Lesbianism, such as the ban on particular friendships.

Why do many nuns take men's names?
 There is no one answer to your question. Here are a few of the reasons:  In some communities, nuns have been assigned the names that they are known by in religious life. This …is an older tradition, not as common now as it once was, but it is true that some nuns have no say in what their religious idenitities will be.Sometimes, especially in past centuries but true even today, names were unisex or were pronounced differently for men and women. Julian is considered today to be a man's name, which puzzles some who wonder why Julian of Norwich had a "man's name," but in her day the feminine-version of the name was pronounced "Juli-anne." Today the same name is spelled "Julianne" when given to a woman.In some cases, when the choice has been the nun's, a particular name (whether male or female) is taken simply because the nun has a devotion to that particular saint. Indeed, in some communities there is a community-wide devotion to a particular saint and variations of that saint's name is given to all of the members. (This is why you'll sometimes find that entire communities of nuns all have double names that start or end with either "Mary" or "Joseph.")  The easy answer is tradition!- a Long-standing custom. It is true many religious orders, to which the Nuns belong ( there being no lay or unattached sisters) were founded by Men such as Saint Francis and St. Dominic- hence Franciscans, Dominicans. oddly there are more female than male saints- so there is no shortage of religious names without any Gender- hopping. Sometimes they will combine male and female names- such as a Sister Martin Mary of the IHM. ( no, she did not invert the name of the actress Mary Martin. Mary is of course the Blessed Virgin- but Martin is a male saint. You will also find such combinations as Mary Luke, and more normal-like male names adapted to a female role- I knew of a Sister Roberta. I suggest you ask about at a local convent or religious book store , they could shed some light on this veiled tradition, no pun intended. By the way both Sister Martin Mary and Sr. Roberta were both in the same order, the IHM ( Immaculate Heart of Mary).

Skeletons In The TV Stand: The Flying Nun        


retrophilia


            by Scott Lydon
7 years ago




It never hit the top ten, it's often the punchline to a joke, and the premise… well, nobody's ever dared a remake. But it's also still in syndication today, and even has a loyal fanbase. Today we're peeling open the dark corners of classic television to take a quick peek at the one of the most charmingly goofy ideas for a sitcom ever dreamed up by a studio:

That's right. Get ready, children, because after the jump, Scott's talking about The Flying Nun.
So let's be clear right off the bat: there are 82 episodes of The Flying Nun and I didn't watch all of them when preparing for this post. What I did do was watch sit down and watch the first half of the first season. I feel safe talking about the show after that because I'm pretty sure The Flying Nun won't throw in some amazing plot twist conversion to Islam as a first season cliffhanger. Just be aware in advance that the scope of my review might be limited.
 

 
But I have to say, and maybe it's just Stockholm Syndrome, but after about two hours The Flying Nun really began to earn my respect. The first episode covered the premise pretty well, introducing the sweet Sister Bertrille (Sally Field), a young novice who's come to Puerto Rico to learn how to be a nun. Of course, she has all sorts of "groovy" phrases that really "shake up" the other nuns, and she quickly offends her Mother Superior by being, well, too cool for Catholic school.
 
The power of Christ compels you

 
This isn't really anything groundbreaking, especially for those of us who survived the 80s. But this next part, this is where it gets a little more interesting. Because sitcoms just aren't sitcoms without the romantic male lead, or at least, that's what Hollywood assumes. And so, meet Carlos! Much like Job, he's about to be tested by God.

You see her too, right, honey?
 
Carlos is the first person Sister Bertrille meets in Puerto Rico. He's a non-religious gambler who also owns a nightclub and spends his free time trying to score with bikini models. This is the sort of lifestyle that really ends badly when a nun suddenly imprints on you and decides to be your special friend.
 

Sorry, Mr. Hefner, I thought the gate was locked.
 
And this is where the writing team really gets to shine. We all know the Hollywood formula has invented literally thousands of different ways to play "will they/won't they" with the main characters. Now think about how many shows went bad when the male and female lead hooked up. Moonlighting, X-Files, Batman: The Animated Series, all of them fell apart quickly when the gender tension vanished for good. But with a nun? That can never, ever, ever be a problem. She's not after his heart, she's after his soul! It's a brand new thing in same old drag, baby! Of course, it's still sort of creepy how many people in this show act like they're trying to score with a nun. But it was the swingin' Sixties, right? That was just how people acted back then.
 

This is exactly how Ellen stole Anne Heche from Steve Martin
 
And then there's the flying part. For people who haven't seen the show, "How can that nun fly?" is the second-biggest question, just after "Are you sure there isn't anything else on TV right now?" So how do the writers solve this issue? Is it some mutant power? Some divine gift from a loving God? Maybe alien nanites sent back through time? Nope. Stop thinking so 21st Century, people. In 1968, it's just plain old physics.
 

"When lift plus thrust is greater than load plus drag… well, anything'll fly!"
 
Read that quote again because there it is. That's the reason. That's why she flies. And even when other nuns try to make a big deal out of it, and they tell her that she's special, Sister Bertrille stays humble, and goes out of her way to stress that it's just regular old physics in action. This isn't the story of a saint with some weird Dr. Strange-style magic. This is the story of a lightweight lady with a big, solid hat on a very windy day. The faith presented here relies on a trust in God's greater plan, remembering that if He created the universe, He created physical laws too. I thought this made for a very nice character decision, as so many writers forget that Pride is also one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and the truly pious don't ever hold their blessings over other people's heads. We're all only human, but such modesty is a nice touch in a show about a nun.
And even better than that, the humble Sister Bertrille absolutely loves the idea of flying (and who wouldn't?) so she reads aerodynamics textbooks until she can control herself in the air. It's not some innate talent she's born with, it's just a skill she has to work to master (admittedly totally off camera, but one can only ask so much from 1967) and that makes her more Tony Stark than Clark Kent. There are times when she flies without wanting to fly. There are even a few times when she wants to, but can't get enough lift, and so ends up completely unable to fly. It's very strongly implied that, assuming that all the conditions were met, any one of God's children could be zipping around up there right beside her. Which, if you think about it, opens the door to redefining what genre this show is.

Technically still just as probable as Warp One
 
That one little idea, that a flying nun is just the result of solving an equation, that one little idea turns what seems to be a religious sitcom into a science-based fantasy obeying its own strict internal rules. In this universe, with the right hat and the right wind, you always fly! If we're being honest with ourselves, that's practically Arthur C. Clarke territory right there. Could The Flying Nun have been the most realistic sci-fi show that that late 60s had to offer? Oh, before you start yelling, Star Trek fans, a quick question… have you guys finished making your transporters yet? No? Well, then, you're still currently neck and neck with the theoretical physics shown by The Flying Nun. Try not to choke on your rage.
 

Hey, you ever fly so fast that you turned into a lizard? No?
 
Of course, there's lots of other stuff ripe for overthinking, from the very impressive lack of white authority figures (after all, why WOULDN'T Puerto Ricans be in charge of Puerto Rico?) to the ridiculous way Sister Bertrille always finds some excuse to fly ("Oh, Carlos! Your girlfriend lost her favorite parrot? Why, I should go look for it now!") but there's only so much room Jason's willing to offer me to make a post about The Flying Nun. So I'll end by saying that I think the show ultimately turns out to be a little more daring now than it appeared to be back then. And maybe after I'm done with all of Spartacus: Blood & Sand, I might just go back and check out The Flying Nun once more.

  "This photo was taken at a going away party for our sister who is becoming a nun. We used the Flying Nun (Sally Fields) as our inspiration. We put a picture of our sisters face in place of Sally Fields. It turned out fabulous and even more so on the neon pink shirt. CustomInk was great to work with. They were very accommodating since we needed this as soon as possible. The customer service was great and I will order future shirts from them! "

Company Description 






Citizen Pilates is a destination studio in Houston’s historic Heights neighborhood. The studio is revered for its upbeat, fitness-based group reformer classes, and its positive and inclusive environment has given members a fresh take on an otherwise stuffy
studio archetype.
Demand for classes has exceeded capacity at the first location, and Citizen is opening its second location in December.





Citizen first opened its doors in August 2015. Its founder and original Citizen, Jessica Hughes, had a vision for a fitness studio that stood out from what the market already offered. Citizen’s atypical approach to high level client service and intimacy,
coupled with affordable boutique pricing, welcomed members of all ages to experience Citizens’ strong culture. 
Over 11 million people practice Pilates as a form of exercise. Pilates is characterized by slow and controlled movements that make your muscles toned, long and lean. Reformer Pilates involves balancing and doing exercises on a customized machine, using
various pulleys to slowly tone muscles. The setup can be intimidating for newcomers, but Jess’s vision for the studio included personalized attention and small class sizes to help foster a more intimate class setting.








What makes a fitness studio is the classes it offers. But what makes a community are the relationships that are built and the culture that is created. Citizen has carefully crafted a community, both online and offline, to develop a winning formula for
both its members and the business.
Demand for classes at Citizen has outgrown the space. By March 2016, the studio began implementing an automated online wait-list to accommodate the excess demand. The original studio is currently offering 50-60 classes per week, with most days starting
as early as 5:30am and ending as late as an 8:30pm session. Even with classes throughout the day, reservations have filled up quickly. The sole complaint from members became, “We can never get into class.”
In August of 2016, Jessica Hughes secured Citizen’s second location, just 2 miles west of their flagship studio. The proximity of the two locations will serve as a carefully crafted ecosystem, allowing the studio to effectively double its capacity while
still maintaining the intimate experience and close community that it’s created.



Construction on the second location is already underway and is scheduled for a December opening – just in time for the new year!

Business Model 
Citizen Pilates is a service based boutique Reformer Pilates studio offering 60 group classes 7 days per week. Clients book and pay through its online site or branded app up to 60 days in advance. There are 3 options to purchase classes. 1) single drop
in 2) class packages ranging from 5 – 20 classes 3) monthly autopay membership contract. All class reservations are prepaid via credit card and processed by customized MINDBODY online scheduling and point of sale software. 





Citizen Pilates’ core values are centered around its members and the ability to service clients turned off by high-end boutique exclusivity. Its CRM systems allow managers and instructors to establish and retain genuine relationships with their clients
beyond class time in an effort to consistently grow membership.
The fitness industry continues to grow at a rapid pace. An estimated $25.8 Billion was generated by gym memberships in the United States in 2015, and nearly 42% of memberships are with boutique fitness
studios.


Specifically, Pilates and yoga studios are dominated by smaller, boutique single locations or smaller local chains. With less than 5% of the industries total revenue coming from the top 4 companies, this is an industry that thrives at the local level.
From 2010-2015, the Pilates and yoga industry saw 7.5% annual growth and $9 billion in revenue.

Early on, Citizen focused heavily on extending its culture online with a digital presence that reflected the ethos of the studio. Branding agency PinkCilantro President Basya Benshushan says, “In today’s digital age far too many companies miss a tremendous
opportunity to fuel offline brand experience and loyalty across a digital landscape. Citizen is not one of those companies. Jessica Hughes is the driving force behind Citizen’s strong brand culture. Her leadership and vision come from a highly
analytical point of view.”



Through targeted campaigns and genuine online interactions, Citizen’s instructors and clients engage with the studio more often and more deeply across social mediums. Their loyalty lives beyond a scheduled class. Attendance analysis supports Citizen’s
ability to attract and retain clients outside a 40-mile radius from its flagship location.



Citizen’s second location is strategically opening within a 10-minute drive of its current location. Membership demand remains high in the area, and the close proximity allows members and instructors to easily travel between the two based on availability
and demand.



The new studio is scheduled to open by year-end.

Both locations are in the Heights district of Houston, a community located just 4 miles from downtown. The Heights is one of the earliest planned communities in Texas, dating back to the 1800s and is well known for its historic homes.


The Heights population is diverse in all categories, as young couples, millennials and professionals, have been flocking to the Heights over the past decade for its prime real estate, growing restaurant and bar scene, and eclectic shops.


Due to its prime location and strong sense of community, the Heights real estate market has been one of the best performing neighborhoods in Houston over the past one, five and ten-year
periods. The neighborhood’s charm and small-town feel was also recognized by CNN Money, coming in at #4 on its 2013 ranking
of the Top 10 Big City Neighborhoods.




Yellow flags indicate Pilates and yoga studios in the vicinity




Because the first location has maintained close to maximum utilization, Citizen strategically sought expansion opportunities within close proximity to its first location. This will allow the business to service existing customers and draw new customers
in a centralized, prime location in Houston. The yellow flags in the map above represent yoga and Pilates studios. Among the greater Heights and surrounding downtown areas, very few locations offer Pilates, and fewer than a handful offer Reformer
Pilates.

In a one-mile radius of both locations, household income average is approximately 205% and 165% as compared to the national average, respectively. For the first and second locations, the population density is 2.5 and 3.6 times the national average, respectively.
Average annual expenditures are slightly above national spending for both locations. (Piinpoint Data)



The Heights is bounded by Interstate I-10 on the south, North Shepherd Drive on the west, Interstate 610 on the north and Highway 45 on the east, making this area extremely accessible from all directions. For residents of the Heights, it offers a short
work commute to downtown Houston, Houston’s Inner Loop, Medical Center and the Galleria. In addition to accessibility, many Houstonians visit the Heights area for its parks and trails. The Hike & Bike Trail connects the north side of Houston’s
Inner Loop with over hundred miles of city trails.
