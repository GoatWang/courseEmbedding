Glossary




Objective
The fund’s investment objective is to seek attractive total return with less volatility than the S&P 500 Index. 
    


Highlights
Provide the potential for:

Attractive quarterly distributions
Participation in S&P 500 Index returns
A measure of downside protection in declining markets1
Tax-advantaged distributions2




Investment Strategy
The fund also dynamically sells call options covering between 35% and 75% of the value of the fund’s equity portfolio, with a long-run target of 55%,  in seeking to enhance the portfolio's risk-adjusted returns.








Click on the labels above to hide/show the respective graph lines.


			The chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made on the date indicated. Original Investment & Cumulative Distributions is the original investment value added to the cash flow received from distributions. The total returns are not adjusted to reflect the effects of taxation and assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
		

			Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

More contact information







RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Common Stock Risk: Common stock returns often have experienced significant volatility.Call Option Risk: The value of call options sold (written) by the fund will fluctuate. The fund may not participate in any appreciation of its equity portfolio as fully as it would if the fund did not sell call options. In addition, the fund will continue to bear the risk of declines in the value of its equity portfolio.Index Call Option Risk: Because index options are settled in cash, sellers of index call options, such as the fund, cannot provide in advance for its potential settlement obligations by acquiring and holding the underlying securitiesTax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.


1The Funds' downside risk mitigation strategies do no guarantee against loss of principal.
2Advantageous tax treatment for dividends from common stocks & net gains from the option strategy.






†† Managed Distribution Policy

				Historical distribution sources have included net investment income, realized gains and return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time which may be viewed at nuveen.com/CEFdistributions. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholders’ 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year. You should not draw any conclusions about a fund’s past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate.
			

				Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.
