The presale report details how Fitch addresses the key rating drivers summarized below.KEY RATING DRIVERSHigh AG Concentration: The 2013-D collateral pool consists of 93.36% AG and 6.64% CO. While the 2013-D AG concentration is consistent with CNH Capital securitizations going back to 2009, the AG concentrations in all these transactions are significantly higher relative to CNH Capital transactions issued prior to 2009, which consisted of approximately 18% - 32% CO.Consistent Collateral Concentrations: The pool contains 49.94% used equipment and is, thus, comparable to the prior transactions, which typically had concentrations ranging from 46% - 50%. Furthermore, the pool consists of 74.43% annual-pay contracts, which historically have experienced a lower level of losses versus other payment types.Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Hard credit enhancement (CE) for the 2013-D transaction is unchanged from the prior five transactions. Class A hard CE remains at 4.50%. Expected excess spread of 1.70% (per annum ) is down from 2013-C's 1.96%.Quality Origination, Underwriting and Servicing Platform: CNH Capital has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and the managed portfolio.Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings to increased losses over the life of the transaction.Fitch's analysis found that the notes display limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing limited impact on the rating of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of at least two rating category under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the presale report dated Nov. 12, 2013. Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 'CNH Equipment Trust 2013-D - Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated April 17, 2012.Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the accompanying presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com' or by clicking on the below link.Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: CNH Equipment Trust 2013-D (US ABS)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextJeff Bezos Surpasses Bill Gates as World's Richest PersonBloombergEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredVerizon soars on beat, Starbucks' big China deal, AstraZeneca sinks as drug trial disappointsYahoo FinanceKristin Beck, transgender Navy SEAL hero: 'Let's meet face to face and you tell me I'm not worthy'Business InsiderMcDonald's swift to respond in China after moldy ice cream maker pictures go viral in U.S.ReutersDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredVerizon soars on beat, Starbucks' big China deal, AstraZeneca sinks as drug trial disappointsYahoo Finance VideoStocks surge to new highs as Facebook lifts NasdaqYahoo FinanceNintendo has a fiasco on its hands with the new Super Nintendo ClassicBusiness InsiderAre You Still Interested in a Travel Rewards Card?Wise BreadSponsoredA PGA Tour pro explained what separates Jordan Spieth from fellow stars like Rory McIlroy and Dustin JohnsonBusiness InsiderWall Street adds to record rally on strong earningsReutersVerizon Q2 Revenue Flat as Wireless Unit Sales Decline 1.9% Despite Subcriber ReboundVarietyA Penny-Crypto Miracle Making Some Americans RichAgora FinancialSponsoredTwitter's weak monthly user numbers leave investors cold, angryYahoo Finance VideoT.

Fitch Affirms and Upgrades CNH Equipment Trusts 2013-B & 2013-D Notes | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms and Upgrades CNH Equipment Trusts 2013-B & 2013-D Notes
    





May 21, 2015 01:21 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has taken various rating actions on CNH Equipment Trusts 
      2013-B and 2013-D as follows:
    

      CNH 2013-B
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook revised to Stable 
      from Positive.
    

      CNH 2013-D
    

      --Class A-2 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook revised to Stable 
      from Positive.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmation of the class A notes in both transactions reflects loss 
      coverage levels consistent with the current ratings. The upgrades to the 
      class B notes is largely attributable to growing hard credit enhancement 
      (CE) levels since close, and strong loss performance to date. Both 
      transactions are forecasting below Fitch's initial base case loss 
      proxies. The Outlook Stable designation for all notes reflects Fitch's 
      expectation for loss coverage and credit enhancement to continue to 
      improve as the transactions amortize.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxies which would impact available loss coverage. Lower loss 
      coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks, depending on the 
      extent of the decline in coverage. In Fitch's initial review of the 
      transactions, the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to 1.5x 
      and 2.5x higher of Fitch's base case loss expectations. Initial key 
      rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale reports dated August 26, 2013 for 2013-B and November 12, 2013 
      for 2013-D.
    

      To date, the transactions have exhibited strong performance with losses 
      inside Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss coverage and 
      multiple levels. As such, continued strong performance for these 
      transactions would most likely result in further stable ratings. 
      Conversely, a material deterioration in performance would have to occur 
      within the asset pools to have potential negative impact on the 
      outstanding ratings.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) for both 
      transactions can be found in 'CNH Equipment Trusts 2013-B - Appendix' 
      'CNH Equipment Trusts 2013-D - Appendix'. These R&W are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated March 26, 2015.
