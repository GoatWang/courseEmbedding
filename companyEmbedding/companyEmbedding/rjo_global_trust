Investigation: RJO Global Trust

By Fitapelli Kurta






 


Fitapelli Kurta is investigating complaints on behalf of investors who have invested money in the RJO Global Trust.  The RJO Global Trust fell 35 percent during the four years ended on Dec. 31 and it charges up to 7.25 percent in annual fees.
The RJO Global Trust is a type of investment fund known as a “managed future fund.”  Many brokers promote managed futures, such as RJO Global Trust, as protection against market declines.  However, the language in the prospectuses for these types of funds is not consistent with that notion.  In reality, managed future funds, like RJO Global Trust, are “noncorrelated,” which means that their performance does not track that of any other investments.  Investors often do not understand this.

“I actually would not even encourage most retail investors to be in managed futures…. it’s on the riskier end of the investment spectrum.” – Gerard Corcoran, RJO’s CEO


In a 2013 interview with Bloomberg, Gerald Corcoran, the CEO of the Chicago-based R.J. O’Brien & Associates LLC, said, “you’re going to lose money in managed futures over the course of a period of time. There’s no question…I mean, I’ve just experienced it myself.”
Managed-futures funds, such as the RJO Global Trust, are a subset of hedge funds. The funds are run by commodity-trading advisers, or CTAs.   Although most hedge funds typically charge a 2 percent management fee, managed-futures funds often charge clients 7 to 9 percent of assets invested annually. In this case, the RJO Global Trust charges up to 7.25 percent in annual fees.
If you or someone you know invested in the RJO Global Trust, please contact us today for a free consultation and evaluation of your complaint.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (a) Introduction  The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust organized on November 12, 1996 under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The business of the Trust is the speculative trading of commodity interests, including futures contracts on currencies, interest rates, energy and agricultural products, metals, commodity indices and stock indices, spot and forward contracts on currencies and precious metals and exchanges for physicals pursuant to the trading instructions of multiple Advisors. The Managing Owner acquired the managing owner interest in the Trust from RCMI on November 30, 2006. The Managing Owner of the Trust was initially formed as an Illinois corporation in November 2006, and became a Delaware Limited Liability Company in July of 2007. The Managing Owner is registered as a commodity pool operator under the CEAct, and is responsible for administering the business and affairs of the Trust. The Managing Owner is an affiliate of RJO. The Trust has no officers, directors or employees. The Managing Owner is responsible for selecting, monitoring, and replacing the Advisors to the Trust. The Managing Owner may change the allocation to each Advisor, or add, remove, or replace any Advisor without the consent of or advance notice to investors. Investors will be notified of any material change in the basic investment policies or structure of the Trust. As of March 31, 2013, the Advisors were:  The Trust was originally established and operated as a single-advisor commodity pool. John W. Henry & Company, Inc. ("JWH") served as the Trust's sole trading Advisor until October 31, 2008. As of November 1, 2008, the Trust became a multi-advisor commodity pool where trading decisions for the Trust were delegated to five independent Advisors: JWH, AIS Futures Management ("AIS"), Abraham Trading Corp. ("ATC"), Global Advisors LP ("GALP") and Peninsula LP ("PLP"), pursuant to Advisory Agreements executed between the Trust and each Advisor. Effective February 1, 2009, NW became the Trust's sixth Advisor. As of March 31, 2009, PLP was terminated as an Advisor to the Trust. Effective June 1, 2009, the Trust entered into an Advisory Agreement with Global Advisors (Jersey) Limited ("GAJL") to replace its Advisory Agreement with GALP, in connection with GALP's initiative to migrate all of its clients to its Jersey-based (UK) entity. As of June 30, 2009, AIS was terminated as an Advisor to the Trust and the Trust's assets were reallocated with equal weighting of 16.666% each to the remaining four Advisors along with Conquest Capital Group ("CCG") and Haar Capital Management ("HCM") beginning July 1, 2009. As of September 30, 2010, the Advisors to the Trust consisted of JWH, NW, ATC, GAJL, CCG, and HCM. Beginning October 1, 2010, the Trust entered into Advisory Agreements with two additional Advisors. On October 1, 2010 Trigon Investment Management ("TIM") and Dominion Capital Management Institutional Advisers, Inc. ("DCM") were each allocated approximately 8.33% of the Trust's assets. Those eight Advisors traded the Trust's assets from October 1, 2010 to March 31, 2012. As of April 1, 2012 GAJL was terminated and two new Trading Advisors were appointed and allocated less than 10% of the Trust's assets. At April 30, 2012, DCM, TIM, and HCM were terminated as Advisors. CCG was terminated as of June 30, 2012. At March 30, 2012, the Trust entered into an Advisory Agreement with LFG and HBC. At June 30, 2012, the Trust entered into an Advisory Agreement with AAM. At August 31, 2012, the Trust entered into an Advisory Agreement with GA. As such, as of March 31, 2013, the Trust's assets were allocated to the following Advisors: NW (21.54%), HBC (3.35%), LFG (22.11%), AAM (21.45%), and GA (18.69%), with the remaining percentage allocated to cash.  Effective July 1, 2011, the Managing Owner discontinued the public offering of the Units and began offering the Units on a private placement basis only.  (b) Capital Resources  The Trust's capital resources fluctuate based upon the purchase and redemption of Units and the gains and losses of the Trust's trading activities. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2013, no units were purchased in Class A and Class B by beneficial owners. The Managing Owner purchased no Units during this time. For the three-month period ending March 31, 2013, the unitholders redeemed a total of 15,176 Class A Units for $1,161,686 and 1,902 Class B Units for $157,329.  The Trust's involvement in the futures and forward markets exposes the Trust to both market risk - the risk arising from changes in the market value of the futures and forward contracts held by the Trust - and credit risk - the risk that another party to a contract will fail to perform its obligations according to the terms of the contract. The Trust is exposed to a market risk equal to the value of the futures and forward contracts purchased and theoretically unlimited risk of loss on contracts sold short. The Advisors monitor the Trust's trading activities and attempt to control the Trust's exposure to market risk by, among other things, refining their respective trading strategies, adjusting position sizes of the Trust's futures and forward contacts, and re-allocating Trust assets to different market sectors. The Trust's primary exposure to credit risk is through the non-performance of the Trust's forward currency broker, Citibank, N.A ("Citibank"). Citibank generally enters into forward contracts with large, well-capitalized institutions and then enters into a back-to-back contract with the Trust. The Trust also may trade on exchanges that do not have associated clearing houses whose credit supports the obligations of its members and that operate as principals markets, in which case the Trust will be exposed to the credit risk of the other party to such trades.  The Trust's trading activities involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet risk whereby changes in the market values of the futures and forward contracts underlying the financial instruments or the Trust's satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount reported in the statement of financial condition of the Trust.  The amount of assets invested in the Trust generally does not affect its performance, as typically this amount is not a limiting factor on the positions acquired by the Advisors, and the Trust's expenses are primarily charged as a fixed percentage of its asset base, however large, or by number of investors. To a lesser extent, some expenses are incurred as minimums regardless of the size of the asset base, such as audit and legal fees.  The Trust borrows only to a limited extent and only on a strictly short-term basis in order to finance losses on non-U.S. dollar denominated trading positions pending the conversion of the Trust's U.S. dollar deposits. These borrowings are at a prevailing short-term rate in the relevant currency. They have been immaterial to the Trust's operation to date and are expected to continue to be so.  During the three-month period ending March 31, 2013, the Trust had no material credit exposure to a counterparty which is a foreign commodities exchange.  There are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes, to the Trust's capital resource arrangements at the present time.  (c) Liquidity  The Trust's net assets are held in brokerage accounts with RJO. Such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the Trust's trading. Except in very unusual circumstances, the Trust should be able to close out any or all of its open trading positions and liquidate any or all of its securities holdings quickly and at market prices. This should permit the Advisors to limit losses as well as reduce market exposure on short notice should their programs indicate reducing market exposure.  The Trust earns interest on 100% of its average daily balances on deposit with RJO during each month at 100% of the average four-week Treasury bill rate for that month in respect of deposits denominated in U.S. dollars. For deposits denominated in other currencies, the Trust earns interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR less 100 basis points. For the quarters ended March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012, the Trust has received or accrued to receive trading interest of $355 and $125, respectively from RJO.  Additionally, effective October 6, 2010, the Managing Owner retained RJOIM, an affiliate of the Managing Owner, to serve as a cash manager to the Trust. The Trust's assets which are managed by the cash manager are held by Wells as custodian to the Trust. As of March 31, 2012, Wells held approximately $17.2 million of the Trust's assets. For the quarters ended March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012, the assets held in this account earned $80,860 and $98,815 of interest income, respectively.  Most U.S. commodity exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation in commodity futures contract prices during a single trading day by regulations. These regulations specify what are referred to as "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits." The daily limits establish the maximum amount the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous trading day's settlement price at the end of the session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular commodity, no further trades may be executed at a price beyond the limit. Positions in the commodity could then be taken or liquidated only if traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit during the period for trading on such day. Because the "daily limit" rule only governs price movement for a particular trading day, it does not limit losses. In the past, futures prices have moved the daily limit for numerous consecutive trading days and thereby prevented prompt liquidation of futures positions on one side of the market, subjecting commodity futures traders holding such positions to substantial losses for those days.  It is also possible for an exchange or the CFTC to suspend trading in a particular contract, order immediate settlement of a particular contract, or direct that trading in a particular contract be for liquidation only.  There are no known material trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the Trust's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. Additionally, no material deficiencies in liquidity were identified, and there are no material unused sources of liquid assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2013.  (d) Results of Operations  The Trust's success depends on the Advisors' ability to recognize and capitalize on major price movements and other profit opportunities in different sectors of the world economy. Because of the speculative nature of its trading, operational or economic trends have little relevance to the Trust's results, and its past performance is not necessarily indicative of its future results. The Managing Owner believes, however, that there are certain market conditions - for example, markets with major price movements - in which the Trust has a better opportunity of being profitable than in others.  Certain Advisors to the Trust are technical traders, and as such, their programs do not predict price movements. No fundamental economic supply or demand analysis is used in attempting to identify mispricings in the market, and no macroeconomic assessment of the relative strengths of different national economies or economic sectors is made. However, there are frequent periods during which fundamental factors external to the market dominate prices. For the discretionary Advisors, economic fundamentals and macroeconomic assessments are made.  The performance summaries set forth below outline certain factors that affected the performance of the Trust for the periods presented. The fact that certain trends or market movements were captured does not imply that others, perhaps larger and potentially more profitable trends or market movements, were not missed or that the Advisors will be able to capture similar trends or movements in the future. Moreover, the fact that the programs were profitable in certain market sectors in the past does not mean that they will be so in the future.  The performance summaries are an outline description of how the Trust performed in the past, not necessarily any indication of how it will perform in the future. Furthermore, the general causes to which certain trends or market movements are attributed may or may not in fact have caused such trends or movements, as opposed to simply having occurred at about the same time.  Fiscal Quarter ended March 31, 2013  The Trust recorded net trading loss of $(295,521) or $(1.12) per trading Unit for Class A Units and a loss of $(6,248) or $(0.81) per trading Unit for Class B Units in the first quarter of 2013 (*** Please see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in Part I - Item 1 for explanation of net asset value/Unit pursuant to events of October 2005, as the following excludes the Trust's Non-Trading accounts). As of March 31, 2013, the Trust (Class A Units) has lost 7.34% since its inception in June 1997. Class B Units have lost 30.87% since their inception in January of 2009.  As of March 31, 2013, the Trust's assets were allocated to the following Advisors as follows: NW (21.54%), HBC (3.35%), LFG (22.11%), AAM (21.45%), and GA (18.69%), with the remaining percentage allocated to cash.  Several reports out in January 2013 noted that market participation by governments and central banks around the world reached unprecedented levels over the last few years. This participation has suppressed market volatility and put off an ultimate response to ballooning global debt problems. The U.S. Congress and President have pushed back budget discussions until late spring. The stock market did not experience negative effects as a result. The S&P 500 jumped out to a 5% gain in January. Interest rates, on the other hand, have not reacted favorably to the recent developments. The interest rate on the 10-Year U.S. treasury, while still low by historical standards, has crept back into the 2% range after spending much of last year between 1.5% and 1.8%. Crude is creeping back towards $100 per barrel and other commodities appear to be well bid for.  In February, the S&P 500 continued its climb and tested the all-time highs established back in October 2007 by adding a 1.4% profit to its 5% gain in January. Sell offs in crude and gold led the commodity sector lower. The Dow Jones UBS Commodity Index was down over 4% in February and is now negative for the year. Yield on the 10-Year U.S. treasury found support at the 2% level and has now drifted back to 1.85%. In part, the commodity sell off and bounce in the treasury market was in response to the U.S. government sequester that took place at month end February and was signed into law on March 1. The automatic spending cuts are expected to dampen economic activity and temporarily put off inflation concerns. Governments around the world continue to participate in the markets, postponing more lasting solutions to the global economic challenges. The ultimate market response to this unprecedented government participation is expected to be significant and could offer some investment opportunities in the managed futures sector.  In March, the S&P 500 posted new all-time highs, rising 3.75% and finishing the quarter up nearly 11% for year-to-date. The 10-year US Treasury returned 0.26%. The commodity sector, as reflected by the Dow Jones UBS Commodity Index, rose 0.67% during March but remains in negative territory for the year, down 1.13%. Governments and central banks around the world remain engaged and very active in their respective economies as they try to manage a fragile global economic recovery. The strengthening U.S. dollar and the rising U.S. stock market appear to be the result of bleak situations in the European economies rather than outright strength of the U.S. economy.  Fiscal Quarter ended March 31, 2012  The Trust recorded net trading loss of $(1,742,789) or $(4.95) per trading Unit for Class A Units and a loss of $(58,427) or $(4.80) per trading Unit for Class B Units in the first quarter of 2012 (*** Please see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in Part I - Item 1 for explanation of net asset value/Unit pursuant to events of October 2005, as the following excludes the Trust's Non-Trading accounts). As of March 31, 2012, the Trust (Class A Units) had gained 5.58% since its inception in June 1997. Class B Units have lost 22.79% since their inception in January of 2009.  As of March 31, 2012, the Trust's assets were allocated to the following Advisors as follows: ATC (16.66%), CCG (16.66%), NW (16.66%), JWH (8.33%), HCM (8.33%), DCM (8.33%), TIM (8.33%), Hyman Beck & Company, Inc. (8.33%), and Liberty Funds Group Inc. (8.33%).  With short-term interest rates at or near zero and no implosion in the European debt saga, the stock market continued to drift higher with little resistance during January. Bonds were choppy but only slightly lower on the month as interest rates inched higher. Commodities were higher as a sector thanks to strength in crude oil, cattle, and soybean markets. Gold, corn, and natural gas markets were a drag on the sector finishing flat to lower on the month. In February, the stock market moved ahead on light volume during the month and posted its best February since 1997. Bonds and Commodities also posted small gains to start the year. The managed futures industry continues to struggle. A violent reversal by grains, bonds, and some metals caused losses during the month. The Barclay Top 50 which is representative of all managed futures strategies and over 50% of the industry's assets finished 2012 with its worst 36 month performance period since the index began in 1987. Erratic volatility, fluctuating volume, and government intervention in Europe, Asia, the U.S., and China have been blamed by traders for the difficult environment. The index finds itself two standard deviations from its positive historical average annual return. Some would argue that the U.S. Federal Reserve is already in the middle of its third round of quantitative easing. With short-term interest rates continuing at or near zero and no further shocks in the European debt saga, the stock market continued a climb higher during March and posted its best first quarter in 14 years. Bonds were lower posting their worst quarter in two years. The commodity sector was lower on the month due to weakness in the energy, base metals, meats, and corn markets.  (e) Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements; Disclosure of Contractual Obligations  The Trust does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Regulation S-K 303(a)(4)(ii)) that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
