Fund Fact Sheet
Overview

Wedgewood seeks to make investments in approximately 20 companies, with market capitalizations         in excess of $5 billion, which it believes have above-average growth prospects.         Wedgewood invests in businesses that it believes are market leaders with long-term         sustainable competitive advantage. It patiently waits for opportunities to purchase         what it believes are great businesses at attractive prices. While Wedgewood invests         in growth it believes that valuation is the key to generating attractive returns         over the long-term. Unlike most growth investors, Wedgewood is not a momentum investor         but rather a contrarian growth investor. Wedgewood is a firm that believes in investing         as opposed to trading and generally experiences portfolio turnover of less than         50% annually.

            Mutual fund investing involves risk including loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may
involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. The RiverPark Long/Short Opportunity Fund uses leverage. If the securities decrease in value, the Fund may suffer a greater loss than would have resulted without the use of leverage. With, short sales, losses are potentially unlimited and the expenses involved with the short strategy may impact the performance of the Fund. "The value of the Fund's positions in index options fluctuates in response to changes in the value of the underlying index. Selling index call options can reduce the risk of owning stocks, but it limits the opportunity to profit from an increase in the market value of stocks in exchange for up-front cash at the time of selling the call option. Unusual market conditions or the lack of a ready market for any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the fund's option strategies, and for these and other reasons the Fund's option strategies may not reduce the Fund's volatility to the extent desired. Accordingly, the purchase of Fund shares should be viewed as a long-term investment. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its stated objectives. With the exception of RiverPark/Wedgewood, RiverPark Focused Value, and RiverPark Floating Rate CMBS Fund, each Fund is "diversified", as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940. Bonds and bond funds are subject to credit risk, default risk, and interest rate risk and will decline in value as interest rates rise. High yield bonds involve greater risks of default or downgrade and are more volatile than investment grade securities, due to the speculative nature of their investments. Securities backed by commercial real estate assets are subject to securities market risks similar to those of direct ownership of commercial real estate loans including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, declines in rental or occupancy rates and risks related to general and local economic conditions. There can be no assurance that a Fund will achieve its stated objectives.
		

To determine if a Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider
                the Fund's investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing.
