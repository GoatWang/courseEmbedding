Hersha Hospitality Trust Coses on the Sale of Three Suburban Extended Stay Hotels - Acquires the Westin Philadelphia

July, 20 2017
Hersha



Hersha Hospitality Trust Completes 24 Month Capital Recycling Campaign





Hersha Hospitality Trust (NYSE: HT) announced it has completed its        capital recycling campaign with the disposition of three extended stay        hotels for $130.5 million and the acquisition of the Westin Philadelphia        for $135 million.
Disposition of Three Suburban West Coast Hotels
The Company announced the completion of the sale of three Hyatt House        hotels which were sold unencumbered of debt and generated taxable gains        of approximately $67 million. The portfolio sale included the 142-room        Hyatt House in Pleasant Hill, CA, the 128-room Hyatt House in        Pleasanton, CA, and the 164-room Hyatt House in Scottsdale, AZ for        $130.5 million or approximately $301,000 per key.
“The successful closing of this transaction marks the 24th month of our        capital recycling campaign during which we sold approximately $850        million of mature, stabilized hotels and successfully deferred $270        million of taxable gains with $816 million of accretive acquisitions. In        addition to refining our portfolio’s market mix to urban gateway and        coastal destinations, our improved portfolio quality focuses our        capabilities on hotels with higher RevPAR and EBITDA growth potential in        our core markets. Proceeds from the sale provide financial flexibility        as we continue to execute our business plan and ongoing ROI projects,”        stated Mr. Jay H. Shah, Hersha’s Chief Executive Officer.
Mr. Shah continued, “We have owned these hotels for 10 years and they        have proven to be very productive investments. The combined EBITDA        generated at the three hotels at the time of sale was 60% above prior        peak and 233% above the trough of 2010. We look to drive similar success        from our most recent acquisitions in Philadelphia, Boston, Santa Monica,        Seattle, and Miami.”
Acquisition of The Westin, Philadelphia
The Company also announced the acquisition of the AAA Four-Diamond 294-room Westin Hotel in Philadelphia, PA for $135 million.        The investment represents a purchase price of $459,000 per key and a        trailing LTM cap rate of 7.8%.
Mr. Shah commented, “We are pleased to acquire the Westin at an        attractive basis expanding our Philadelphia cluster to include the        leading corporate hotel in the market. The Westin is particularly well        located in the heart of Philadelphia’s 45 million square foot office        district in close proximity to Center City’s unique demand generators        including the new Comcast Innovation and Technology Center, Rittenhouse        Square, City Hall, the Pennsylvania Convention Center, and University        City. The Westin is also part of the iconic Liberty Place mixed use        complex that includes 2.4 million square feet of office, retail, food        hall and residential space in addition to an underground parking garage.        The hotel was originally opened as the Ritz-Carlton in 1990 and has        maintained the brand’s hallmarks including marble finishes, extensive        handcrafted millwork, and oversized guestrooms and bathrooms. In        addition, the Westin has 16,600 square feet of meeting space including a        7,500 square foot ballroom. Our Philadelphia cluster also includes The        Rittenhouse Hotel and the Hampton Inn Convention Center and will benefit        from increased economies of scale from this acquisition. The Westin’s        superior asset quality and strong cash flow yield makes the investment        immediately accretive to our portfolio FFO, NAV and RevPAR.”
Hersha Hospitality Trust (HT) is a self-advised real estate        investment trust in the hospitality sector, which owns and operates high        quality upscale hotels in urban gateway markets. The Company's 51 hotels        totaling 7,804 rooms are located in New York, Washington, DC, Boston,        Philadelphia, South Florida and select markets on the West Coast.

Industry Update




Press Release 3 May 2016Hersha Hospitality Trust Closes Manhattan 7-Hotel Joint-Venture with Cindat

Hersha Hospitality Trust (NYSE: HT) ("Hersha" or the "Company"), owner of upscale hotels in urban gateway markets, announced the Company has closed on the joint venture for seven of the Company's premium limited service hotels in Manhattan with Cindat Capital Management Limited ("Cindat"), a China based investment management platform with offices in Beijing, Shanghai and New York City, for a total purchase price, including closing and capital improvement costs, of $571.4 million, or $526,000 per key.

Cindat, backed by investors including China Cinda Asset Management Co. and Taikang Life Insurance and its affiliate, is the senior preferred joint venture partner holding a 70.0% ownership stake, while Hersha retains a 30.0% equity interest, as well as a $37.0 million preferred equity interest in the venture at a 9.0% fixed coupon.

"We are pleased to close our previously announced joint venture with Cindat, and look forward to capitalizing on future opportunities within this venture with a sophisticated and strategic long-term partner. These seven high-quality, cash-flowing hotels, located in dynamic and diverse submarkets in Manhattan, will continue to benefit from strong demand for core real estate and lodging assets given the city's preeminence as a global financial, cultural, and technological hub. Cindat's investment expertise in global gateway market real estate, combined with Hersha's fifteen-year track record of owning and operating hotels in the most valuable and liquid real estate market in the world, form a strong foundation for a long-term partnership," stated Neil H. Shah, Hersha's President and Chief Operating Officer.
Greg Peng, Cindat's Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Demand for high-quality U.S. real estate assets is great from Chinese investors. Limited service hotels in Manhattan, in our opinion, offer steady cash flow with relatively low volatility, and hence, good risk-adjusted investment returns. Hersha is one of the best investors and managers in the hotel industry, and Cindat is very pleased to form this partnership with Hersha to grow its hotel investment portfolio in the U.S."
Natixis Real Estate Capital, LLC led a syndicate of international and domestic financial institutions and provided $285 million of senior acquisition financing to the joint venture, while an affiliate of Oaktree Real Estate Finance, LLC provided $50 million of mezzanine financing to the venture. Hunton & Williams LLP served as legal counsel to Hersha on the transaction, while Sidley Austin LLP served as legal counsel to Cindat. Both law firms collectively advised the newly formed joint venture. Solid Rock Advisors advised Cindat on the transaction.

Hersha Hospitality Trust (HT) is a self-advised real estate investment trust in the hospitality sector, which owns and operates high quality upscale hotels in urban gateway markets. The Company's 56 hotels totaling 8,892 rooms are located in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Miami and select markets on the West Coast. The Company's shares are traded on The New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "HT".

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
