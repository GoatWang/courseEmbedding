Your setting will likely change over time as your body and support needs change, yet whether it’s your first or your 500th night in your bed, the steps to finding your Sleep Number<sup>®</sup> setting will stay the same. Sleeping with a partner? They should follow these same steps, to find their own setting. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Steps to finding your Sleep Number<sup>®</sup> setting</h2>\n<p>When you follow these steps, you’ll experience a range of Sleep Number<sup>®</sup> settings, from the firmest (100) to a very soft setting. Experiencing the entire range will make it easier to determine what level of support feels best to you.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Lie on your bed</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">With your remote in hand, lie down in your normal sleeping position—whether that’s your back, side or stomach.

Again, pay attention to how your body feels as the bed gets softer.</p>\n<p><strong>Find your ideal level of support—your Sleep Number</strong><sup>®</sup> <strong>setting</strong></p>\n<p>Next, your bed will gradually increase in firmness.

Until now, an airbed could only be adjusted for firmness, not support.  With our new innovative zone technology, you have the ability to adjust the lumbar zone separately to add low back support like you can in some automobiles.  This offers a truly supportive and individually customizable system for your body!




Poor Spinal Alignment Caused By Hammocking Of Mid-Section







Spinal Straightening With Air-Pedic™ Lumbar 3 and 6-Zone Technology











"The Air-Pedic makes such a big difference being able to have a separate zone for the lumbar region..."
															-Carla Workman (previous Sleep Number®      owner).













Optional Patented* Airflow Transfer System
If your body type generates extra heat or you just want to sleep cooler, all our memory foam beds come with the option of adding on our patented Airflow Transfer System, which allows cooler air to flow in two directions even when you sleep in the same position all night. Cooler air will enter through the many small holes that go down through the surface of the memory foam and out through the convoluted channels on the firmer 2nd layer of foam.  The air chambers are below these layers and will not be affected by this what so ever, so it is just an add-on to all for a full airflow circulation to reduce unnecessary body heat build-up. 
**The optional Airflow Transfer System™  is   protected by U.S. Patent No. 7,334,280.

Mattress and Sleep Assessment Apps.

  (Available in the Apple App. Store)
While there are plenty of technologies for evaluating how much sleep you are getting, only our doctor created  Mattress Checker App. can actually evaluate your spinal alignment to help find the correct firmness needed to keep your back in check.  You can also compare one mattress to another or in the case of an Air-Pedic, actually change the zone pressure to find the best spinal support settings.  You can now download our Mattress Checker App. by going to the iTunes App. store. 
*Interested in tracking how much more sleep you will get on your Air-Pedic?  The Motion X 24/7 Sleep Tracker offers the most highly advanced way to track your quality and quantity of sleep right from your own iPhone! 













A Doctor's Perspective
"The Air-Pedic offers the first real solution for back pain sufferers that want true lumbar support.  It also offers the ability to dial in a customized comfort level for yourself, as well as your partner separately.  Whether you like the memory foam contouring comfort or traditional pillow-top feel, the Air-Pedic will provide the support you need to keep your spine in proper alignment all night long.  The great thing about the Air-Pedic Tri-Zone system is that each side can adjust the lumbar section more than the head and shoulder sections.  This means that even if you go with more surface plush designs like the Air-Pedic 1000 or 1200 models, you can still vary the softness of the shoulders vs. the low back and hips to allow the spine to remain in alignment, despite the extra overall sinking in that will occur.  Until the Air-Pedic, I have never recommended air mattresses due to the hammock effect that happens when you only have the one chamber system per side, which allows air to displace from the heavier mid-section of your body to the lighter head/shoulders and leg/foot regions.  With the 3-zone per side support system of the Air-Pedic, this issue has really been solved and I can now truly feel confident in recommending the Air-Pedic to back pain sufferers and customers who just want to be able to take control over their own comfort and support preference.  If you have any questions, please feel free to  email me personally."

															Regular air bed designs use only a 2-zone system that allows you to change the comfort and support of each side separately.  Our 6-zone adjustable air system allows this same dual side adjustability that enables you to change the overall comfort from the shoulders down to your legs, but unlike the 2-zone systems, with our 6-zone system, you can also specifically adjust the support level for shoulders and leg sections, independent of the lumbar mid-section.  By using a special 4 port pump, instead of the 2 pump that other competitors use, you can easily toggle between mid-section lumbar zone and the head and leg zones.  This works extremely well if you are someone who likes more pressure relief where the shoulders are, but also desires more support under the low back and hip region.  As an example, you can change the digital number to 35 where the shoulders are and 70 in the lumbar section and you will have twice the support in the middle of the mattress, the region that many air, spring and memory foam mattresses fail to provide proper support for.  Additionally, even if you keep all three zones at the same pressure, the chamber partitions prevent the air from displacing as the heavier body parts push away the air towards the lighter parts.  This is what happens with one solid chamber airbeds and accounts for the heavier low back and hips sinking in too much, while the lighter shoulders don't penetrate into the bed and thereby, allow the spine to be put into a hammock like position.
Will you feel the separate partitions between each of the zones?
															No, we have purposely put together a system that allows for the partitions between zones, but no spatial separations, for a seamless feeling support!
I head that your competitors warranties do not cover the foam in the mattress itself.  Does the Air-Pedic's 30-year limited warranty cover the foam as well?
															Yes!  Our industry leading 30-year warranty even includes the foam itself, with a very strong coverage from sag of only 3/4 of an inch!  See our  warranty page for more details.
Will I feel a difference in the middle of the mattress compared to each side when I roll over?
															No, all of our Air-Pedic mattresses are made with a very flexible and indiscernible center support, that when combined with our edge to edge comfort layers, make for an even feel across the whole mattress with no dips or valleys, as well as no center humps.
Why have I head that some types of airbeds can form Mildew and/or Mold inside the mattress.  What is the reason for this and is this a concern with the Air-Pedic?
															Some of the competitors use natural (untreated) vulcanized rubber chambers that can dry out and allow fissures and cracks, whereby mildew and mold can hide out and multiply over time.  Our Air-Pedic's use 100% Urethane chambers that inherently resists bacteria and mold without the necessity of added chemicals, making it safe enough to use in a hospital setting and less of a concern for those who might be sensitive to mold eliminating chemical treatments.
Will I have to worry about air leaking from the seams of the chamber walls?
															No.  The Air-Pedic 15 mil size walls are not only considered very thick for the very strong and durable 100% Urethane material, but unlike rubber and vinyl, they don't require gluing and instead make an air tight and durable seam due to the RF (radio frequency) welding.  This is why we can offer an industry leading 30-year warranty.
Is the pump quiet and will it turn on in the middle of the night?
															We extensively tested pumps on the market and chose one that had special sound dampening.  Despite this extra quiet technology, our pump is still inflates extremely fast.  Our pumps even have a one second delay feature that prevents it from turning on should you accidentally bump it in the middle of the night.  Also, with our airtight, RF welded chambers, you really can set it and forget it, as it will hold the air on an ongoing basis and should rarely require an adjustment once you dial yourself in perfectly!
How is the Air-Pedic able to make the chambers flexible, when many other types of urethane and rubber chambers are rigid and unforgiving?   
															The flexibility of our chambers are due to the fact that we use thick 100% Urethane, so no inflexible nylon coating is needed to support them.  This allows the chambers to flex a bit with your weight, so you avoid the bottoming out issues that come with non-flexible chamber systems.  
Does the Air-Pedic 1000 feel like a memory foam mattress or a traditional pillow-top mattress?
															It feels more like a traditional pillow-top, only much better!  The Air-Pedic 1000's wonderful pillow-top feel does have some memory foam in the layering, but with most of the layers are springy and soft, so you still have complete ease of movement, but with less motion transfer than traditional pillow-top mattresses and best of all, the most cloud-like comfort available in a pillow-top product! 
Is the foam used in the Air-Pedic CertiPur-US certified?
															Yes.  It is fully CertiPur-US certified for low V.O.C.'s (Volatile Organic Compounds) and environmentally friendly attributes.  Additionally, all of our foam is high density and made right here in the U.S.A., thereby, allowing us to warranty it for the full 30-years.
Can the Air-Pedic mattresses be used with an adjustable bed?
															Yes.  We now make every Air-Pedic mattress with a very special notched railing system that allows it to flex and contour adjustable bed frames perfectly.
Does the Optional patented Airflow Transfer System really help the foam sleep cooler than other mattresses?
															Yes! The patented Airflow Transfer System has been implemented in order to channel your own body's heat away from you, while allowing cooler air to flow through the the top layer for a cooling effect.  Other mattresses may claim to have ventilation on the surface of the foam, but with no airflow channels underneath, there can be no open circulation effect.  Other mattresses claim to have airflow underneath the foam layers, but it is a well known fact that good quality foam, especially high density memory foam, does not breathe well.  Only our patented Airflow Transfers System offers both, allowing the many small holes to connect with open channels below, thereby creating full airflow circulation.  
Can you feel the pincore holes of the optional Airflow Transfer System when you lay on the top of the mattress?
															No.  Due to the very conforming and soft attributes of the foam, as well as the small diameter of the hole size, you will not feel the holes with your body and when the cover is on, you will not even feel them with your hands.  The feel of the mattress is smooth, silky, and supportive.
Does the all the small holes used in the optional Airflow Transfer System weaken the foam and cause it to break apart?
															No.  We space the foam holes an inch a part, so there is more than enough foam in between to keep the strength.  Also, the compression strength of the of foam (the aspect of the foam that determines its longevity over time) is not affected by the holes whatsoever, but the ventilation that it allows for, will help the foam last even longer, as heat and perspiration are the enemy of all foams!

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

A "sleep number" store in Miamisburg, Ohio.


Select Comfort is a U.S.-based manufacturer that manufactures the Sleep Number and Comfortaire beds as well as foundations and bedding accessories. The company is based in Plymouth, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. In addition to its Minnesota headquarters, Select Comfort has manufacturing and distribution facilities in South Carolina and Utah. As of 2015, the company employed 3,098 people across the United States.
In 1980, the category of adjustable air-supported sleep systems was invented by a private company, Comfortaire Corporation, of South Carolina [3] Bob Walker left Comfortaire and formed a new company in 1987 called Select Comfort.[4] Select Comfort acquired Comfortaire in 2013.[5]
The company's TV commercials used to feature actress Lindsay Wagner.[6] Other endorsers include conservative radio talk show hosts Glenn Beck, Paul Harvey and Laura Ingraham; Rush Limbaugh also previously advertised the product, but the company pulled its advertising in the wake of the Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy.[7]
Select Comfort was founded in 1987 by Robert "Bob" Walker and his wife JoAnn Walker. As of December 2011[update], Select Comfort holds 23 issued or pending U.S. patents and 40 issued or pending foreign patents for its products.[2] Select Comfort products are sold through 477 company-owned stores located across the United States; direct marketing operations; and online at sleepnumber.com. The current CEO is Shelly Ibach.
Sleep Number bed[edit]
The company's signature product is the Sleep Number bed, an adjustable air mattress. The "sleep number" is a setting that adjusts the firmness of the mattress, adjusted by air pressure, with higher numbers (up to 100) denoting higher pressure and more firmness. In addition, each side of full size and larger beds has its own chamber to allow for separate adjustment. There are different models of Sleep Number beds with various features, and Select Comfort has introduced a memory foam version of the Sleep Number mattress as well.[8]

A "sleep number" store in Miamisburg, Ohio.


Select Comfort is a U.S.-based manufacturer that manufactures the Sleep Number and Comfortaire beds as well as foundations and bedding accessories. The company is based in Plymouth, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. In addition to its Minnesota headquarters, Select Comfort has manufacturing and distribution facilities in South Carolina and Utah. As of 2015, the company employed 3,098 people across the United States.
In 1980, the category of adjustable air-supported sleep systems was invented by a private company, Comfortaire Corporation, of South Carolina [3] Bob Walker left Comfortaire and formed a new company in 1987 called Select Comfort.[4] Select Comfort acquired Comfortaire in 2013.[5]
The company's TV commercials used to feature actress Lindsay Wagner.[6] Other endorsers include conservative radio talk show hosts Glenn Beck, Paul Harvey and Laura Ingraham; Rush Limbaugh also previously advertised the product, but the company pulled its advertising in the wake of the Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy.[7]
Select Comfort was founded in 1987 by Robert "Bob" Walker and his wife JoAnn Walker. As of December 2011[update], Select Comfort holds 23 issued or pending U.S. patents and 40 issued or pending foreign patents for its products.[2] Select Comfort products are sold through 477 company-owned stores located across the United States; direct marketing operations; and online at sleepnumber.com. The current CEO is Shelly Ibach.
Sleep Number bed[edit]
The company's signature product is the Sleep Number bed, an adjustable air mattress. The "sleep number" is a setting that adjusts the firmness of the mattress, adjusted by air pressure, with higher numbers (up to 100) denoting higher pressure and more firmness. In addition, each side of full size and larger beds has its own chamber to allow for separate adjustment. There are different models of Sleep Number beds with various features, and Select Comfort has introduced a memory foam version of the Sleep Number mattress as well.[8]
