History[edit]
Kempen & Co was established in 1903 in Amsterdam by Arines Johannes Kempen with his companion Martinus Dirk de Lange as an independent stockbroker. The commodities exchange, the Beurs van Berlage had opened only a month before, and it was this exchange that was used by Kempen & Co for its trading. The company began by specialising in the trade of listed companies that operated in the Dutch East Indies.
In 1952 Piet Harms, who had been with the firm since 1936, is promoted to co-head of the firm. After the departure of De Lange jr in 1968, Harms continues as sole head of the firm and is responsible for a period of significant growth. The customers at this time were mainly private investors.
In 1972 the bank was sold to the British bank Slater Walker and then became the British bank's international division. After problems at Slater Walker two years later, the bank was sold to the Belgium firm Peterbroeck, Van Campenhout & Cie (Petercam N.V.). The bank continued to grow and got an exchange listing in 1983. The bank had by then built a strong reputation in investment banking, and in 1993 Joop Krant was made managing director. He directed the bank to European expansion with a focus on research and corporate finance activities.
Under ownership of Dexia[edit]
In 2001 the company was purchased by Belgian bank Dexia and delisted from the exchange. Dexia's ambition was to use Kempen & Co as its base for developing a strong presence in securities and capital markets in Europe. It was merged with Bank Labouchere which Dexia had acquired earlier. This gave the combined bank 1,250 employees. However, due to the differences in culture between the two banks and the Labourcher share-affair, the merger was quickly undone and by 2003 Kempen & Co was operating as an independent entity again within the Dexia group. A year later Kempen & Co becomes a separate company again after a management buyout of the company with the support of HAL Investments, Friesland Bank and NPM Capital.
Acquisition by Van Lanschot[edit]
In 2007 Dutch investment bank Van Lanschot acquired the company for €300 million which saw the end of the independent Kempen & Co.[2] HAL investments was also a major investor in Van Lanschot, and so helped arrange the deal in which it made approx €46 million. Van Lanschot continued to use the Kempen & Co name but integrated the securities and asset management business into its own operations.
Kempen & Co is a subsidiary of F. Van Lanschot Bankiers N.V. (Van Lanschot). As banks, Van Lanschot and Kempen & Co are subject to the supervision of De Nederlandsche Bank and have been issued licenses on the basis of Article 2.11 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft). Van Lanschot and Kempen & Co are also registered as financial institutions with the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) in Amsterdam.

Van Lanschot continued to use the Kempen & Co name but integrated the securities and asset management business into its own operations.
Kempen & Co is a subsidiary of F. Van Lanschot Bankiers N.V. (Van Lanschot). As banks, Van Lanschot and Kempen & Co are subject to the supervision of De Nederlandsche Bank and have been issued licenses on the basis of Article 2.11 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft). Van Lanschot and Kempen & Co are also registered as financial institutions with the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) in Amsterdam.

History[edit]
Kempen & Co was established in 1903 in Amsterdam by Arines Johannes Kempen with his companion Martinus Dirk de Lange as an independent stockbroker. The commodities exchange, the Beurs van Berlage had opened only a month before, and it was this exchange that was used by Kempen & Co for its trading. The company began by specialising in the trade of listed companies that operated in the Dutch East Indies.
In 1952 Piet Harms, who had been with the firm since 1936, is promoted to co-head of the firm. After the departure of De Lange jr in 1968, Harms continues as sole head of the firm and is responsible for a period of significant growth. The customers at this time were mainly private investors.
In 1972 the bank was sold to the British bank Slater Walker and then became the British bank's international division. After problems at Slater Walker two years later, the bank was sold to the Belgium firm Peterbroeck, Van Campenhout & Cie (Petercam N.V.). The bank continued to grow and got an exchange listing in 1983. The bank had by then built a strong reputation in investment banking, and in 1993 Joop Krant was made managing director. He directed the bank to European expansion with a focus on research and corporate finance activities.
Under ownership of Dexia[edit]
In 2001 the company was purchased by Belgian bank Dexia and delisted from the exchange. Dexia's ambition was to use Kempen & Co as its base for developing a strong presence in securities and capital markets in Europe. It was merged with Bank Labouchere which Dexia had acquired earlier. This gave the combined bank 1,250 employees. However, due to the differences in culture between the two banks and the Labourcher share-affair, the merger was quickly undone and by 2003 Kempen & Co was operating as an independent entity again within the Dexia group. A year later Kempen & Co becomes a separate company again after a management buyout of the company with the support of HAL Investments, Friesland Bank and NPM Capital.
Acquisition by Van Lanschot[edit]
In 2007 Dutch investment bank Van Lanschot acquired the company for €300 million which saw the end of the independent Kempen & Co.[2] HAL investments was also a major investor in Van Lanschot, and so helped arrange the deal in which it made approx €46 million.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Chart Industries (NASDAQ:GTLS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 5 Hold Ratings, 3 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.38)Consensus Price Target: $39.00 (11.40% upside)

Kempen & Co is a Dutch merchant bank providing financial services in asset management, securities broking, and corporate finance. Clients include institutional investors, companies, financial institutions, (semi)public institutions, foundations, and high-net-worth individuals. It has been part of Dutch private bank Van Lanschot since 2007.[1]

History[edit]
Kempen & Co was established in 1903 in Amsterdam by Arines Johannes Kempen with his companion Martinus Dirk de Lange as an independent stockbroker. The commodities exchange, the Beurs van Berlage had opened only a month before, and it was this exchange that was used by Kempen & Co for its trading. The company began by specialising in the trade of listed companies that operated in the Dutch East Indies.
In 1952 Piet Harms, who had been with the firm since 1936, is promoted to co-head of the firm. After the departure of De Lange jr in 1968, Harms continues as sole head of the firm and is responsible for a period of significant growth. The customers at this time were mainly private investors.
In 1972 the bank was sold to the British bank Slater Walker and then became the British bank's international division. After problems at Slater Walker two years later, the bank was sold to the Belgium firm Peterbroeck, Van Campenhout & Cie (Petercam N.V.). The bank continued to grow and got an exchange listing in 1983. The bank had by then built a strong reputation in investment banking, and in 1993 Joop Krant was made managing director. He directed the bank to European expansion with a focus on research and corporate finance activities.
Under ownership of Dexia[edit]
In 2001 the company was purchased by Belgian bank Dexia and delisted from the exchange. Dexia's ambition was to use Kempen & Co as its base for developing a strong presence in securities and capital markets in Europe. It was merged with Bank Labouchere which Dexia had acquired earlier. This gave the combined bank 1,250 employees. However, due to the differences in culture between the two banks and the Labourcher share-affair, the merger was quickly undone and by 2003 Kempen & Co was operating as an independent entity again within the Dexia group. A year later Kempen & Co becomes a separate company again after a management buyout of the company with the support of HAL Investments, Friesland Bank and NPM Capital.
Acquisition by Van Lanschot[edit]
In 2007 Dutch investment bank Van Lanschot acquired the company for €300 million which saw the end of the independent Kempen & Co.[2] HAL investments was also a major investor in Van Lanschot, and so helped arrange the deal in which it made approx €46 million. Van Lanschot continued to use the Kempen & Co name but integrated the securities and asset management business into its own operations.
Kempen & Co is a subsidiary of F. Van Lanschot Bankiers N.V. (Van Lanschot). As banks, Van Lanschot and Kempen & Co are subject to the supervision of De Nederlandsche Bank and have been issued licenses on the basis of Article 2.11 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft). Van Lanschot and Kempen & Co are also registered as financial institutions with the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) in Amsterdam.

Our brand story
The year is 1903 and the Amsterdam stock exchange opens its doors in the form of ‘De Beurs van Berlage’ (Berlage’s stock market). Very much like the coming of the world wide web, this seemingly insignificant event soon becomes a milestone in global history and a game changer in worldwide trade.
As with the coming of the Internet, most people don’t understand the initial fuss. However, Arines Kempen is not ‘most people’. Arines looks at the market building, in fact, it could be said he stares right into the light coming from the opening of its doors. It doesn’t blind him; instead it opens his eyes. That very same month, he starts his own securities company.

Arines’ eyes continue to stay open as he picks financial talent Martinus de Lange as his right hand man. Kempen might have been the company’s godfather, but de Lange is the ‘& Co’ in the full—and now registered— trade name ‘Kempen & Co’.

In the century that follows, Kempen & Co very modestly gain fame as both an innovative company and a highly trustworthy operation with a unique style of conduct. We come up with the first securities research publication almost by accident, and in doing so invent the métier of the research analyst, In the latter half of the century, we fine-tune our signature long term participation and start a highly involved style of shareholding. 

We can’t help but attract the interest of major foreign players in the field and as we steer closer towards the turn of the millennium, the Kempen ship sails under numerous (international) flags. That is, until we become an independent department of the Van Lanschot Group in the year 2007.

Since then we’ve united an esteemed capital manager with a somewhat rowdier merchant bank in a mutual quest to create progress and value for all our clients. We’re a dynamic duo with a shared, stereotype-busting mentality. Simply put, we work hard and create value through our expertise and esprit de corps. 

We’re exclusive rather than ‘all over the place’. So while we’re non-existent in most areas, we’re serious contenders in others. The result is a clear portfolio that guarantees all clients get our signature high-level attention. 

From the 30-year-in-the-business senior partner in the corner office to the excited trainee with a head full of ideas, our collective expertise keeps us on par with our clients’ specialized enterprises and enables us to be an important part of the conversation.

Our dedication knows no boundaries. We contemplate our client’s cases when we’re in the shower, over tea, out jogging and even when we sleep.

Corporate Governance




Mandatory Information















Profile Kempen & Co
Kempen & Co is a Dutch merchant bank providing financial services in securities broking,corporate finance, and through Kempen Capital Management N.V., asset management. Our clients include institutional investors, companies, financial institutions, (semi)public institutions and foundations.
Since its foundation in 1903, Kempen & Co has been cultivating its expertise, offering first-class advice through personal and long-lasting relationships with clients. It is precisely in an era in which information is easier than ever to come by that Kempen & Co strives to operate selectively. It does so by focusing its services on segments in which in-depth research and advice can add real value, such as small and medium-sized listed businesses, biotech and real estate companies.
Subsidiary of F. Van Lanschot Bankiers N.V
As an investment firm, Kempen & Co is subject to the supervision of the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) and holds a license on the basis of Article 2:96 of the Dutch Act on Financial Supervision (Wet op het financieel toezicht). Kempen & Co is a subsidiary of F. Van Lanschot Bankiers N.V. (‘Van Lanschot’). As a bank, Van Lanschot is subject to the supervision of De Nederlandsche Bank N.V. and has been issued a license on the basis of Article 2.11 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft). Van Lanschot is also registered as financial institution with the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) in Amsterdam.






Annual reports
As of 2 January 2007, Kempen & Co became part of Van Lanschot. Van Lanschot has issued a 403 declaration for Kempen & Co in which it states that it is jointly and severally liable for any debts arising from any legal acts conducted by Kempen & Co. Kempen & Co is therefore exempt from the obligation to publish an annual report. 
From 2007, Kempen & Co’s annual figures will be consolidated into Van Lanschot’s annual report. 
Download Van Lanschot’s annual report 2016
403 declaration
Article 2:403 of the Dutch Civil Code states that companies may be exempt from the obligation to publish and audit annual reports if their financial data is consolidated into that of the parent company. This is only the case, however, on condition that the parent company has declared in writing that it is severally liable for any debts arising from any legal acts conducted by the subsidiary, such as entering into a contract. The declaration of liability (known as the ‘403 declaration’) must be lodged with the Chamber of Commerce’s trade register.
