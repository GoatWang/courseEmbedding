Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Merger Agreement
On September 19, 2016, Tessera Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Tessera"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger
Agreement"), dated as of September 19, 2016, by and among Tessera, DTS, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("DTS"), Tempe Holdco Corporation, a Delaware corporation
and wholly owned subsidiary of Tessera ("Holdco"), Tempe Merger Sub Corporation,
a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco ("Parent Merger
Sub") and Arizona Merger Sub Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Holdco ("Company Merger Sub"). The Merger Agreement provides
that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Parent
Merger Sub will merge with and into Tessera (the "Parent Merger"), with Tessera
as the surviving corporation, and (immediately thereafter) Company Merger Sub
will merge with and into DTS (the "Company Merger" and, together with the Parent
Merger, the "Mergers"), with DTS as the surviving corporation. As a result of
the Mergers, both DTS and Tessera will become wholly owned subsidiaries of
Holdco, and their equity securities will cease to be publicly traded. Holdco,
which will be renamed upon the closing of the Mergers, intends to apply to have
its common stock listed on NASDAQ, as is the case today with DTS and Tessera
common stock.
At the effective time of the Parent Merger, each share of Tessera common stock
will be converted into one share of Holdco common stock. At the effective time
of the Company Merger, each share of DTS common stock (other than each share of
DTS common stock that is owned by Tessera, Holdco or any of their respective
subsidiaries, DTS or any wholly owned subsidiary of DTS, or held by a holder who
has properly made a demand for appraisal of such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law) will be converted into the
right to receive $42.50 in cash (the "Merger Consideration"). DTS has agreed to
convene a meeting of its stockholders to consider and vote upon the approval of
the Mergers and the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
At the effective time of the Parent Merger, (i) each then outstanding option to
purchase shares of Tessera common stock will be assumed by Holdco and converted
into an option to purchase shares of Holdco common stock, (ii) each then
outstanding share of Tessera restricted stock will be assumed by Holdco and
converted into an award of Holdco restricted stock, and (iii) each then
outstanding Tessera restricted stock unit award will be assumed by Holdco and
converted into a Holdco restricted stock unit award, in each case with
substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to such Tessera equity
award immediately prior to the effective time of the Parent Merger.
At the effective time of the Company Merger, (i) each then outstanding,
in-the-money, vested option to purchase shares of DTS common stock will be
canceled, and the holder of such option will be entitled to receive cash as set
forth in the Merger Agreement; (ii) each then outstanding, out-of-the-money,
vested or unvested option and each then outstanding, in-the-money, unvested
option to purchase shares of DTS common stock will be assumed by Holdco and
converted into an option to purchase shares of Holdco common stock pursuant to
the exchange ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement; (iii) each vested DTS
restricted stock unit award will be canceled, and the holder of such restricted
stock unit award will be entitled to receive cash as set forth in the Merger
Agreement; (iv) each unvested DTS restricted stock unit award will be assumed by
Holdco and converted into a Holdco restricted stock unit award pursuant to the
exchange ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (v) each then outstanding
DTS performance-based restricted stock unit award (treating for this purpose any
performance-based vesting condition to which such DTS performance-based
restricted stock unit award is subject as of the effective time of the Company
Merger or was as of the date of the Merger Agreement as having been attained at
the "target level") will become fully vested and canceled, and the holder of
such performance-based restricted stock unit award will be entitled to receive
cash as set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including
(i) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the United States
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976; (ii) the absence of
injunctions or other legal restraints prohibiting the Mergers; (iii) the
approval of the Mergers and the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the
stockholders of DTS; (iv) the accuracy of Tessera's and DTS's representations
and warranties; (v) performance by Tessera and DTS of their respective
obligations, covenants and agreements under the Merger Agreement; and (vi) the
absence of any material adverse effect on DTS.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tessera and DTS may each terminate the Merger Agreement under certain
circumstances, and in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement
under specified circumstances, DTS may be required to pay Tessera a termination
fee of $25.5 million.
Tessera's obligations under the Merger Agreement are not subject to any
financing condition.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties from both
Tessera and DTS. It also contains customary covenants, including covenants
providing for each of the parties to use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Merger to be consummated, and covenants requiring DTS, subject to certain
exceptions, to carry on its business in the ordinary course of business and not
solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage any
alternative acquisition proposal or proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, an alternative acquisition proposal.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, the full text of which is
attached as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated
herein by reference. The Merger Agreement and this summary are not intended to
modify or supplement any factual disclosures about Tessera or DTS or their
respective subsidiaries, affiliates, businesses or equityholders, and should not
be relied upon as disclosure about Tessera or DTS without consideration of the
periodic and current reports and statements that Tessera or DTS file with the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The terms of the
Merger Agreement govern the contractual rights and relationships, and allocate
risks, among the parties in relation to the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement. In particular, the representations and warranties made by the
parties to each other in the Merger Agreement reflect negotiations between, and
are solely for the benefit of, the parties thereto and may be limited or
modified by a variety of factors, including: subsequent events, information
included in public filings, disclosures made during negotiations, correspondence
between the parties and disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement.
Accordingly, the representations and warranties may not describe the actual
state of affairs at the date they were made or at any other time and you should
not rely on them as statements of fact. Tessera acknowledges that,
notwithstanding the inclusion of the foregoing cautionary statements, it is
responsible for considering whether additional specific disclosures of material
information regarding material contractual provisions are required to make the
statements in this Form 8-K not misleading in any material respect.
Commitment Letter
In connection with the Merger Agreement, Tessera entered into a commitment
letter (the "Commitment Letter") dated as of September 19, 2016, with Royal Bank
of Canada ("RBC"), pursuant to which, among other things, RBC has committed to
provide a $600,000,000 senior secured term loan facility (the "Facility"),
subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Facility is
available to (i) finance the acquisition of DTS, (ii) repay existing
indebtedness of DTS under its existing credit facility, and (iii) pay fees and
expenses related thereto. Under the terms of the Commitment Letter, RBC will act
as a joint lead arranger and a joint bookrunning manager. The actual
documentation governing the Facility has not been finalized, and accordingly,
the actual terms may differ from the description of such terms in the Commitment
Letter.
The foregoing description of the Commitment Letter does not purport to be
complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by the full text of
the Commitment Letter, a copy of which is being filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and
is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On September 20, 2016, Tessera issued a joint press release with DTS announcing
the execution of the Merger Agreement. The full text of the joint press release
and investor presentation are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and 99.2,
respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. Tessera also distributed the
following materials with respect to the proposed transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, the full text of which are attached hereto as Exhibits
99.3-99.6 and incorporated herein by reference:



  •   E-Mail from Tom Lacey to Tessera Employees (Exhibit 99.3)




  •   Invensas Customer E-Mail for DTS Acquisition (Exhibit 99.4)

99.6         Questions and Answers Relating to the Transactions


Forward Looking Statements
This material or any statements incorporated by reference herein, including, for
example, the expected date of closing of the transaction and the potential
benefits of the transaction, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. These forward-looking statements are based on Tessera's current
expectations, estimates and projections about its business and industry,
management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by Tessera and DTS, all of
which are subject to change. In addition, forward-looking statements also
consist of statements involving trend analyses and statements including such
words as "will," "may," "anticipate," "believe," "could," "would," "might,"
"potentially," "estimate," "continue," "plan," "expect," "intend," and similar
expressions or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology that
convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements address matters that
involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are
not guarantees of future results. Accordingly, there are or will be important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance
on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on
forward-looking statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not
limited to, the following: 1) uncertainty as to whether Tessera will be able to
enter into or consummate the proposed transaction; 2) failure to realize the
anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, including as a result of delay
in completing the transaction or integrating the businesses of Tessera and DTS;
3) uncertainty as to the long-term value of DTS; 4) unpredictability and
severity of natural disasters; 5) the resolution of intellectual property
claims; 6) pricing trends, including Tessera's and DTS's ability to achieve
economies of scale; 7) Tessera's ability to implement its business strategy; 8)
retention of key executives; 9) intense competition from a number of sources;
10) future regulations and policies affecting Tessera's and DTS's businesses;
11) general economic and market conditions; 12) the integration of businesses
Tessera may acquire or new business ventures Tessera may start; 13) the evolving
legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which we operate; 14) the expected
amount and timing of cost savings and operating synergies; 15) failure to
receive the approval of the stockholders of DTS; 16) recent and proposed changes
to U.S. patent laws, rules, and regulations; 17) continued involvement in
material legal proceedings; 18) issues with Tessera's ability to integrate
acquired technologies and 19) other developments in the markets Tessera and DTS
operate, as well as management's response to any of the aforementioned factors.





*  Certain schedules and exhibits omitted pursuant to Item 601(b)(2) of
   Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. Tessera agrees to furnish
   supplementally a copy of any omitted schedule or exhibit to the SEC upon
   request


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The foregoing review of important factors should not be construed as exhaustive
and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are
included herein and elsewhere, including the Risk Factors included in our most
recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and other documents of Tessera and DTS
on file with the SEC. Our SEC filings are available publicly on the SEC's
website at www.sec.gov. Any forward-looking statements made or incorporated by
reference in this material are qualified in their entirety by these cautionary
statements, and there can be no assurance that the actual results or
developments anticipated by us will be realized or, even if substantially
realized, that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, us or
our business or operations. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we
undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking
statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or
otherwise.
Additional Information and Where to Find It
In connection with the proposed transaction, DTS will file a proxy statement
with the SEC. Additionally, DTS will file other relevant materials with the SEC
in connection with the proposed acquisition of DTS by Tessera pursuant to the
terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Tessera, DTS and the other
parties thereto. The materials to be filed by DTS with the SEC may be obtained
free of charge at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Investors and security
holders of DTS are urged to read DTS's proxy statement and the other relevant
materials when they become available before making any voting or investment
decision with respect to the proposed transaction because they will contain
important information about the transaction and the parties to the transaction.
DTS, Tessera and their respective directors, executive officers and other
members of their management and employees, under SEC rules, may be deemed to be
participants in the solicitation of proxies of DTS stockholders in connection
with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders may obtain more
detailed information regarding the names, affiliations and interests of certain
of DTS's executive officers and directors in the solicitation by reading DTS's
proxy statement for its 2016 annual meeting of stockholders and the proxy
statement and other relevant materials filed with the SEC in connection with the
transaction when they become available. Investors and security holders may
obtain more detailed information regarding the names, affiliations and interests
of certain of Tessera's executive officers and directors in the solicitation by
reading Tessera's proxy statement for its 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.
Information concerning the interests of DTS's participants in the solicitation,
which may, in some cases, be different than those of DTS's stockholders
generally, will be set forth in the proxy statement relating to the transaction
when it becomes available. Additional information regarding DTS directors and
executive officers is also included in DTS's proxy statement for its 2016 annual
meeting of stockholders.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
