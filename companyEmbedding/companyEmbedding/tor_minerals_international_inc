Reports First Quarter Financial ResultsPR NewswireApril 26, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareCORPUS CHRISTI, Texas, April 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- TOR Minerals International, Inc. (TORM), producer of high performance specialty minerals, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Highlights for the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016 include:1Q17 revenue increased 12 percent to $10.7 million1Q17 net loss of ($132,000), versus 1Q16 net income of $244,000.1Q17 diluted net loss per share of ($0.04), versus 1Q16 net income per share of $0.08  Revenue by Product Group (in 000's)     1Q17     1Q16     % Change 2017 vs. 2016     Specialty Aluminas    $   5,743    $   4,834    19%     Barium Sulfate and Other Products    2,350    2,329    1%     TiO2 Pigments    2,603    2,409    8%     Total    $   10,696    $   9,572    12%  During the first quarter ended March 31, 2017, revenue increased 12 percent to $10.7 million, versus $9.6 million reported during the same period of 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily due to continued growth in specialty alumina sales, as well as incremental growth in TiO2 pigment sales.  The increase in specialty alumina sales was due to strong growth to both existing and new customers in the U.S. and Europe, as well as increased volumes from a significant U.S. customer. The increase in TiO2 pigment sales was primarily due to significant growth in volume in Europe and Asia, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. sales and a mid-single-digit decrease in average selling price.During the first quarter of 2017, gross margin decreased 3.3 percentage points to 10.5 percent of sales. The decrease in gross margin was primarily related to a temporary increase in maintenance activities and costs at the U.S. and Netherlands-based manufacturing facilities, which negatively affected utilization and efficiencies of these operations.  During the first quarter, SG&A expenses were $1.2 million, versus $0.8 million during the first quarter of 2016.  SG&A costs during the first quarter of 2016 benefited by $273,000, from the reversal of a bad debt expense, which had previously been deemed uncollectable.  Excluding this from the comparison, SG&A costs increased seven percent year over year, which was primarily due to increases in sales commissions and salaries and benefits.  During the first quarter of 2017, the net loss was ($132,000), or ($0.04) per diluted share, as compared to net income of $244,000, or $0.08 per diluted share, during the prior year."We had mixed results during the first quarter with strong revenue growth offset by a temporary decrease in gross margin performance.  While extended-maintenance affected our margin performance during the first quarter, we expect the level of maintenance activity will return to normal during the balance of the year," commented Dr. Olaf Karasch, Chief Executive Officer.  "First quarter marked a clear turning point in the health of our TiO2 business with the first positive year-over-year comparison in more than three years. We have recently implemented price increases for TiO2 pigments in certain geographies and have added distribution capabilities.  As we enter the seasonally strong period for TiO2, the segment is well-positioned to deliver profitable growth for the year.  We also expect profitable growth from our specialty alumina business this year as efforts to diversify the revenue mix are gaining traction with new and existing customers in new application areas and new geographies.  Overall we remain confident that we are well-positioned to deliver double-digit revenue growth during 2017, as well as further improve profitability and returns for our shareholders."TOR Minerals will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern, 4:00 p.m. Central Time, on April 26, 2017, to further discuss first quarter results. The call will be simultaneously webcast, and can be accessed via the News section on the Company's website, www.torminerals.com.  Investors and interested parties may participate in the call by dialing 877-407-8033 and referring to conference ID # 13659260.Headquartered in Corpus Christi, Texas, TOR Minerals International is a global manufacturer and marketer of specialty mineral and pigment products for high performance applications with manufacturing and regional offices located in the United States, Netherlands and Malaysia.This statement provides forward-looking information as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and, therefore, is subject to certain risks and uncertainties.

The Company's specialty mineral products, which include flame retardant and smoke suppressant fillers, engineered fillers, and titanium dioxide (TiO2)-color hybrid pigments, are designed for use in plastics, coatings, paints and catalysts applications, as well as a range of other industrial applications. The Company's manufacturing plant in the United States is located in Corpus Christi, Texas. The Asian Operation, TOR Minerals Malaysia, Sdn. Bhd. (TMM), is located in Ipoh, Malaysia, and the European Operation, TOR Processing and Trade, BV (TPT), is located in Hattem, The Netherlands. HITOX, BARTEX, HALTEX, OPTILOAD and TIOPREM are the products produced at the manufacturing plant. TMM processes synthetic rutile (SR) into HITOX and TIOPREM. TPT is engaged in the manufacturing of alumina products ALUPREM and BAYRPREM for use across the world. The Company and its subsidiaries operate in the business of pigment manufacturing and related products in three geographic segments, namely, United States, European and Asian. All the United States manufacturing is done at the facility located in Corpus Christi, Texas. Foreign manufacturing is done by the Company's subsidiaries, TMM and TPT.ALUPREMPremium Alumina Trihydrate (ATH) and Boehmite (AMH) products are produced at the Company's European operation. ALUPREM TB and SR Boehmite alumina products are suitable for a range of applications, including wire and cable, catalysts, coatings and pigments. ALUPREM XHL is specially designed ATH for Extra High Loading to meet stringent flame retardant and smoke suppressant requirements for sheet molding compound (SMC), bulk molding compound (BMC), pultrusion and other thermoset composite applications.

Barium Sulfate's high density is one of the primary reasons it is used as a pigment. Suitable for use in both acid and basic conditions, BARTEX gives weight and body to products ranging from powder coatings to rubber products and plastics. BARTEX is also used as an extender pigment in top coats and primers.OPTILOADOPTILOAD ATH offers a halogen-free solution for passing the stringent flame retardant and smoke suppressant requirements. Produced at the Company's United States operation, the low viscosity OPTILOAD series offers a range of thermoset composite applications, including SMC, BMC, pultrusion, resin infusion and spray-up / hand lay-up.HALTEXHALTEX ATH is a non-toxic, flame retardant and smoke suppressant filler produced at the Company's United States operation for supply to the North American market.

It is suitable for a range of uses, including electrical components, SMC, BMC, adhesives and sealants, roof coatings, foam insulation and rubber mining belts.TIOPREMTIOPREM is a TiO2 colored hybrid pigment produced at both the United States and Asian operations.
