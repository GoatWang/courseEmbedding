These Factors Might Hurt Archer Daniels (ADM) Q2 Earnings


July 25, 2017, 09:09:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

  Archer Daniels Midland Company ADM  is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1. The question lingering in investors' minds is whether this food processing behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company delivered a negative earnings surprise in the last reported quarter and has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the past four trailing quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.       Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price and EPS     Surprise           Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price and EPS     Surprise      |          Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Quote    What to Expect?    The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 54 cents, reflecting year-over-year increase of about 32%. However, we note that our earnings estimate has declined by 4 cents over the last seven days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $15.8 billion, up a little over 1% from the year-ago quarter.    Archer Daniels forms part of the Consumer Staples sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends  , the sector's earnings are expected to rise 3.1%, while revenues are expected to climb 1.2%.   Factors at Play    Archer Daniels has tumbled 9.3% so far this year, as against the sector's growth of 10%. Well, this could be largely accountable to the company's dismal sales surprise history. Evidently, Archer Daniels has been missing sales estimates for over three years now. In fact, the company's bottom line has not been impressive too, as the last reported quarter marked its second straight earnings miss. The murky performance can be mainly attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.       Further, management expects the global landscape in the second half of 2017 to be competitive for the Agricultural Services segment. Also, results at the Oilseeds segment are anticipated to be in a range of flat to down year over year. The company expects soybean crush margins to remain pressurized on account of excess supply and competition. While export volumes in Brazil are expected to improve, margins are likely to be dented by sluggish commercialization. On the other hand, results at the Corn Processing and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segments are expected to show better results in the second quarter, as compared with the last year. However, the aforementioned obstacles make us anxious about Archer Daniels' upcoming results.   What the Zacks Model Unveils?    Our proven model does not conclusively show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .    Archer Daniels has an Earnings ESP of -1.85% as the Most Accurate estimate of 53 cents is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents. Further, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. The combination of Archer Daniels' dismal Zacks Rank and negative Earnings ESP makes us apprehensive about the stock.   Stocks with Favorable Combination    Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:    Dollar General Corporation DG  has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .    Costco Wholesale Corporation COST  has an Earnings ESP of +0.50% and a Zacks Rank #3.    Nordstrom, Inc. JWN  has an Earnings ESP of +4.92% and a Zacks Rank #3.

In 1902, George A. Archer and John W. Daniels began a linseed crushing business in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 1923, Archer-Daniels Linseed Company acquired Midland Linseed Products Company, and the Archer Daniels Midland Company was formed. ADM expanded its agribusiness to include milling, processing, specialty food ingredients, and cocoa.[8]

In 1970, Dwayne Andreas became the chief executive officer of ADM, and is credited with transforming the firm into an industrial powerhouse. Andreas remained CEO until 1997 before his nephew G. Allen Andreas was named to this position.[9] He was one of the most prominent political campaign donors in the United States,[10] having contributed millions of dollars to Democratic and Republican candidates alike.
In 2001, Paul B. Mulhollem became the company's president.[11] Under his guidance, the company was the first U.S. company to sign a contract with Cuba since the embargo against Cuba was imposed October 1960.[12]
In May 2006, Patricia A. Woertz became the company's chief executive officer.[13][14] Formerly of Chevron, she was expected to focus on developing ethanol and biofuels. In February 2007, Ms. Woertz was elected Chairman of the Board at ADM.[15]
Starting in October 2012, the company sought to acquire strategic holdings to support serving Asian markets through acquisition of GrainCorp, an Australian grain firm with a network of storage and port facilities in Australia.[14] On 29 Nov 2013, this acquisition was blocked by the Australian Treasurer.
On July 7, 2014, the company said that it will buy Swiss-German natural ingredient company Wild Flavors for $3 billion, a move aimed at diversifying the company and helping brands appeal to consumers who increasingly favor foods with natural ingredients and flavorings.[16]
On November 5, 2014, ADM announced that effective January 1, 2015, Juan Luciano will become the company's new CEO.[17] Luciano was hired on in 2011 as the company's Chief Operating Officer. Woertz will retain the position of Chairman of the Board until 2016 when she is expecting to retire.
In October 2015, ADM announced the sale of its global cocoa business to Olam. The sale is valued at about $1.2 billion. Approximately 1,500 employees transferred to Olam with the sale.[18]
In January 2017, Archer Daniels Midland agreed to sell its crop risk services (insurance) unit to Validus Holdings for $127.5 million.[19]
Criticism[edit]
Sherman Antitrust Law Violation[edit]
In 1920 the US Department of Justice brought suit against the National Linseed Oil Trust for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Several co-defendants were named, including the Archer-Daniels Manufacturing Company. The suit alleged all of these companies were acting in collusion to raise prices, citing a spike in linseed oil costs between 1916 and 1918, when the price rose from $.50 per gallon to $1.80.[20]
Price fixing[edit]
See also: Lysine price-fixing conspiracy
In 1993, the company was the subject of a lysine price-fixing investigation by the U.S. Justice Department. Senior ADM executives were indicted on criminal charges for engaging in price-fixing within the international lysine market. Three of ADM's top officials, including vice chairman Michael Andreas were eventually sentenced to federal prison in 1999. Moreover, in 1997, the company was fined $100 million, the largest antitrust fine in U.S. history at the time.[21] Mark Whitacre, FBI informant and whistleblower of the lysine price-fixing conspiracy, would also find himself in legal trouble for embezzling money from ADM during his time as an informant for the FBI. In addition, according to ADM's 2005 annual report, a settlement was reached under which ADM paid $400 million in 2005 to settle a class action antitrust suit.[22]
The Informant is a nonfiction thriller book [23] that documents the mid-1990s lysine price-fixing conspiracy case and the involvement of ADM executive Mark Whitacre. The book was adapted into the 2009 film The Informant!. This case has also been featured on episode 168 of This American Life called The Fix Is In.
Violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act[edit]
On December 20, 2013 the SEC announced that it had charged ADM for failing to prevent illicit payments (bribes) made by its foreign subsidiaries to Ukrainian government officials in violation of the FCPA. ADM agreed to pay more than $36 million to settle the SEC's charges.[24]
Environmental record[edit]
See also: Gran Chaco § Conservation issues
The company has been the subject of several major federal lawsuits related to air pollution. In 2001, it agreed to pay a $1.46 million fine for violating federal and Illinois clean-air regulations at its Decatur feed plant and to spend $1.6 million to reduce air pollution there.[25] In 2003, the company settled federal air pollution complaints related to the its efforts to avoid New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act that require pollution control upgrades when a plant is modernized. The company paid $4.5 million in penalties and more than $6 million to support environmental projects. In addition, ADM agreed to eliminate more than 60,000 tons of emissions of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, organic volatile chemicals and other pollutants from 42 plants in 17 states at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.[26]
ADM is involved in a joint project with Daimler AG and Bayer CropScience to develop jatropha as a biofuel.[27]
In an attempt to reduce its carbon footprint, the company has partnered with the Midwest Geological Sequestration Association and other organizations to test the disposal of carbon dioxide emissions underground. If testing is successful, beginning in late 2010 the company expected to dispose of 1,000 metric tons per day of carbon dioxide emissions currently being released to the atmosphere.[28]
Agricultural subsidies[edit]
The company lobbies for agricultural subsidies and price supports including sugar and ethanol. According to a 1995 report by the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, "ADM has cost the American economy billions of dollars since 1980 and has indirectly cost Americans tens of billions of dollars in higher prices and higher taxes over that same period. At least 43 percent of ADM's annual profits are from products heavily subsidized or protected by the American government. Moreover, every $1 of profits earned by ADM's corn sweetener operation costs consumers $10, and every $1 of profits earned by its bioethanol operation costs taxpayers $30."[29]

In 1970, Dwayne Andreas became the chief executive officer of ADM, and is credited with transforming the firm into an industrial powerhouse. Andreas remained CEO until 1997 before his nephew G. Allen Andreas was named to this position.[9] He was one of the most prominent political campaign donors in the United States,[10] having contributed millions of dollars to Democratic and Republican candidates alike.
In 2001, Paul B. Mulhollem became the company's president.[11] Under his guidance, the company was the first U.S. company to sign a contract with Cuba since the embargo against Cuba was imposed October 1960.[12]
In May 2006, Patricia A. Woertz became the company's chief executive officer.[13][14] Formerly of Chevron, she was expected to focus on developing ethanol and biofuels. In February 2007, Ms. Woertz was elected Chairman of the Board at ADM.[15]
Starting in October 2012, the company sought to acquire strategic holdings to support serving Asian markets through acquisition of GrainCorp, an Australian grain firm with a network of storage and port facilities in Australia.[14] On 29 Nov 2013, this acquisition was blocked by the Australian Treasurer.
On July 7, 2014, the company said that it will buy Swiss-German natural ingredient company Wild Flavors for $3 billion, a move aimed at diversifying the company and helping brands appeal to consumers who increasingly favor foods with natural ingredients and flavorings.[16]
On November 5, 2014, ADM announced that effective January 1, 2015, Juan Luciano will become the company's new CEO.[17] Luciano was hired on in 2011 as the company's Chief Operating Officer. Woertz will retain the position of Chairman of the Board until 2016 when she is expecting to retire.
In October 2015, ADM announced the sale of its global cocoa business to Olam. The sale is valued at about $1.2 billion. Approximately 1,500 employees transferred to Olam with the sale.[18]
In January 2017, Archer Daniels Midland agreed to sell its crop risk services (insurance) unit to Validus Holdings for $127.5 million.[19]
Criticism[edit]
Sherman Antitrust Law Violation[edit]
In 1920 the US Department of Justice brought suit against the National Linseed Oil Trust for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Several co-defendants were named, including the Archer-Daniels Manufacturing Company. The suit alleged all of these companies were acting in collusion to raise prices, citing a spike in linseed oil costs between 1916 and 1918, when the price rose from $.50 per gallon to $1.80.[20]
Price fixing[edit]
See also: Lysine price-fixing conspiracy
In 1993, the company was the subject of a lysine price-fixing investigation by the U.S. Justice Department. Senior ADM executives were indicted on criminal charges for engaging in price-fixing within the international lysine market. Three of ADM's top officials, including vice chairman Michael Andreas were eventually sentenced to federal prison in 1999. Moreover, in 1997, the company was fined $100 million, the largest antitrust fine in U.S. history at the time.[21] Mark Whitacre, FBI informant and whistleblower of the lysine price-fixing conspiracy, would also find himself in legal trouble for embezzling money from ADM during his time as an informant for the FBI. In addition, according to ADM's 2005 annual report, a settlement was reached under which ADM paid $400 million in 2005 to settle a class action antitrust suit.[22]
The Informant is a nonfiction thriller book [23] that documents the mid-1990s lysine price-fixing conspiracy case and the involvement of ADM executive Mark Whitacre. The book was adapted into the 2009 film The Informant!. This case has also been featured on episode 168 of This American Life called The Fix Is In.
Violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act[edit]
On December 20, 2013 the SEC announced that it had charged ADM for failing to prevent illicit payments (bribes) made by its foreign subsidiaries to Ukrainian government officials in violation of the FCPA. ADM agreed to pay more than $36 million to settle the SEC's charges.[24]
Environmental record[edit]
See also: Gran Chaco § Conservation issues
The company has been the subject of several major federal lawsuits related to air pollution. In 2001, it agreed to pay a $1.46 million fine for violating federal and Illinois clean-air regulations at its Decatur feed plant and to spend $1.6 million to reduce air pollution there.[25] In 2003, the company settled federal air pollution complaints related to the its efforts to avoid New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act that require pollution control upgrades when a plant is modernized. The company paid $4.5 million in penalties and more than $6 million to support environmental projects. In addition, ADM agreed to eliminate more than 60,000 tons of emissions of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, organic volatile chemicals and other pollutants from 42 plants in 17 states at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.[26]
ADM is involved in a joint project with Daimler AG and Bayer CropScience to develop jatropha as a biofuel.[27]
In an attempt to reduce its carbon footprint, the company has partnered with the Midwest Geological Sequestration Association and other organizations to test the disposal of carbon dioxide emissions underground. If testing is successful, beginning in late 2010 the company expected to dispose of 1,000 metric tons per day of carbon dioxide emissions currently being released to the atmosphere.[28]
Agricultural subsidies[edit]
The company lobbies for agricultural subsidies and price supports including sugar and ethanol. According to a 1995 report by the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, "ADM has cost the American economy billions of dollars since 1980 and has indirectly cost Americans tens of billions of dollars in higher prices and higher taxes over that same period. At least 43 percent of ADM's annual profits are from products heavily subsidized or protected by the American government. Moreover, every $1 of profits earned by ADM's corn sweetener operation costs consumers $10, and every $1 of profits earned by its bioethanol operation costs taxpayers $30."[29]

The Corn Processing segment converts corn into sweeteners and starches, and bioproducts. Its products include ingredients used in the food and beverage industry including sweeteners, starch, syrup, glucose (dextrose). Dextrose and starch are used by the Corn Processing segment as feedstocks for its bioproducts operations.[7]
Agricultural Services[edit]
ADM's Agricultural Services segment uses its U.S. grain elevator, global transportation network, and port operations to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients and as raw materials for the agricultural processing industry.[7]

In 1902, George A. Archer and John W. Daniels began a linseed crushing business in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 1923, Archer-Daniels Linseed Company acquired Midland Linseed Products Company, and the Archer Daniels Midland Company was formed. ADM expanded its agribusiness to include milling, processing, specialty food ingredients, and cocoa.[8]

Juan Luciano


In 1970, Dwayne Andreas became the chief executive officer of ADM, and is credited with transforming the firm into an industrial powerhouse. Andreas remained CEO until 1997 before his nephew G. Allen Andreas was named to this position.[9] He was one of the most prominent political campaign donors in the United States,[10] having contributed millions of dollars to Democratic and Republican candidates alike.
In 2001, Paul B. Mulhollem became the company's president.[11] Under his guidance, the company was the first U.S. company to sign a contract with Cuba since the embargo against Cuba was imposed October 1960.[12]
In May 2006, Patricia A. Woertz became the company's chief executive officer.[13][14] Formerly of Chevron, she was expected to focus on developing ethanol and biofuels. In February 2007, Ms. Woertz was elected Chairman of the Board at ADM.[15]
Starting in October 2012, the company sought to acquire strategic holdings to support serving Asian markets through acquisition of GrainCorp, an Australian grain firm with a network of storage and port facilities in Australia.[14] On 29 Nov 2013, this acquisition was blocked by the Australian Treasurer.
On July 7, 2014, the company said that it will buy Swiss-German natural ingredient company Wild Flavors for $3 billion, a move aimed at diversifying the company and helping brands appeal to consumers who increasingly favor foods with natural ingredients and flavorings.[16]
On November 5, 2014, ADM announced that effective January 1, 2015, Juan Luciano will become the company's new CEO.[17] Luciano was hired on in 2011 as the company's Chief Operating Officer. Woertz will retain the position of Chairman of the Board until 2016 when she is expecting to retire.
In October 2015, ADM announced the sale of its global cocoa business to Olam. The sale is valued at about $1.2 billion. Approximately 1,500 employees transferred to Olam with the sale.[18]
In January 2017, Archer Daniels Midland agreed to sell its crop risk services (insurance) unit to Validus Holdings for $127.5 million.[19]
Criticism[edit]
Sherman Antitrust Law Violation[edit]
In 1920 the US Department of Justice brought suit against the National Linseed Oil Trust for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Several co-defendants were named, including the Archer-Daniels Manufacturing Company. The suit alleged all of these companies were acting in collusion to raise prices, citing a spike in linseed oil costs between 1916 and 1918, when the price rose from $.50 per gallon to $1.80.[20]
Price fixing[edit]
See also: Lysine price-fixing conspiracy
In 1993, the company was the subject of a lysine price-fixing investigation by the U.S. Justice Department. Senior ADM executives were indicted on criminal charges for engaging in price-fixing within the international lysine market. Three of ADM's top officials, including vice chairman Michael Andreas were eventually sentenced to federal prison in 1999. Moreover, in 1997, the company was fined $100 million, the largest antitrust fine in U.S. history at the time.[21] Mark Whitacre, FBI informant and whistleblower of the lysine price-fixing conspiracy, would also find himself in legal trouble for embezzling money from ADM during his time as an informant for the FBI. In addition, according to ADM's 2005 annual report, a settlement was reached under which ADM paid $400 million in 2005 to settle a class action antitrust suit.[22]
The Informant is a nonfiction thriller book [23] that documents the mid-1990s lysine price-fixing conspiracy case and the involvement of ADM executive Mark Whitacre. The book was adapted into the 2009 film The Informant!. This case has also been featured on episode 168 of This American Life called The Fix Is In.
Violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act[edit]
On December 20, 2013 the SEC announced that it had charged ADM for failing to prevent illicit payments (bribes) made by its foreign subsidiaries to Ukrainian government officials in violation of the FCPA. ADM agreed to pay more than $36 million to settle the SEC's charges.[24]
Environmental record[edit]
See also: Gran Chaco § Conservation issues
The company has been the subject of several major federal lawsuits related to air pollution. In 2001, it agreed to pay a $1.46 million fine for violating federal and Illinois clean-air regulations at its Decatur feed plant and to spend $1.6 million to reduce air pollution there.[25] In 2003, the company settled federal air pollution complaints related to the its efforts to avoid New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act that require pollution control upgrades when a plant is modernized. The company paid $4.5 million in penalties and more than $6 million to support environmental projects. In addition, ADM agreed to eliminate more than 60,000 tons of emissions of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, organic volatile chemicals and other pollutants from 42 plants in 17 states at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.[26]
ADM is involved in a joint project with Daimler AG and Bayer CropScience to develop jatropha as a biofuel.[27]
In an attempt to reduce its carbon footprint, the company has partnered with the Midwest Geological Sequestration Association and other organizations to test the disposal of carbon dioxide emissions underground. If testing is successful, beginning in late 2010 the company expected to dispose of 1,000 metric tons per day of carbon dioxide emissions currently being released to the atmosphere.[28]
Agricultural subsidies[edit]
The company lobbies for agricultural subsidies and price supports including sugar and ethanol. According to a 1995 report by the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, "ADM has cost the American economy billions of dollars since 1980 and has indirectly cost Americans tens of billions of dollars in higher prices and higher taxes over that same period. At least 43 percent of ADM's annual profits are from products heavily subsidized or protected by the American government. Moreover, every $1 of profits earned by ADM's corn sweetener operation costs consumers $10, and every $1 of profits earned by its bioethanol operation costs taxpayers $30."[29]

Announcement




ADM Animal Nutrition™, a division of Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM), is recalling 50-pound bags of Rough-N-Ready 14 BT cattle feed, product number 54787BHB24, because the product contains elevated levels of monensin beyond the recommended dosage, which could be harmful to cattle. At elevated levels, monensin can be toxic to cattle and can cause colic-like symptoms, hypokalemia, myoglobinuria, chronic cardiovascular issues, and possible death.There is one lot number involved in this recall: Lot # 2WS01717. The product was distributed between Jan. 19, 2017, and Feb. 2, 2017, and could have been purchased directly from ADM Animal Nutrition or through one of three distributors including: Midwest Fertilizer, Inc. in Iola, Kansas; CW Feeds in Wichita, Kansas and Northtown Ace in Mountain Grove, Missouri.ADM Animal Nutrition received reports from two customers claiming this feed may have resulted in death loss on their respective farms. The company immediately began investigating and initiated the recall upon receiving confirmation that the feed contained elevated levels of monensin due to a temporary breakdown in the packaging process, which has now been corrected. ADM has been in direct contact with the distributors involved in this recall, and all product has been removed from retail shelves. ADM is also working directly with the customers involved.The lot number, 2WS01717, can be found at the bottom of the label. Click here to view an image of the label.

Archer Daniels Midland: Strong Operator With Long-Term Tailwinds - Archer Daniels Midland Co. (NYSE:ADM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Archer Daniels Midland: Strong Operator With Long-Term TailwindsJun.28.17 | About: Archer Daniels (ADM) Jonathan Wheeler Growth at reasonable price, long-term horizon, dividend growth investingSummaryADM is a leader in the processing, storage, and transportation of raw ingredients globally.
        Population growth and continued global expansion will remain tailwinds for the company.
        Tough competition, a shifting product landscape, and tight margins are key risks going forward, but the stock is trading around fair value and will likely drive meaningful long-term returns.
        

 Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) is a food products company that specializes in processing raw ingredients and providing transportation and storage services. The business is highly cyclical due to commodity prices and the nature of crop fluctuations, but it has managed to hike its dividend every year for 42 consecutive years, making it a Dividend Aristocrat. The company's moat lies in its infrastructure, but poor returns on capital and tight margins are definite risks going forward. The stock is trading at fair value, and population growth remains a strong tailwind for the company. 

 Source: Analyst Presentation ADM operates in a tough business due to the cyclical nature of its products, the tough competition, and the thin margins in the best of times. Therefore, it is even more impressive that the company has maintained its dividend streak. It is a testament to the conservative nature of the company, since many cyclicals cut the dividend the moment the macro environment shifts. The current CEO, Juan Ricardo Luciano, is only the 9th in the history of the 112 year old company.
 Close to 60% of revenues are derived from outside the United States, and that is where the majority of the company's growth will be found. China remains a strong market for the company's products, and the company has continued to expand there as well as other emerging markets. Population growth leads to a larger demand for foods, more feed requirements for livestock, and increased use of the processed ingredients that ADM offers. The global nature of the business leads to significant currency risk, which has weighed on many multinationals over the last couple of years. 

Source: Analyst Presentation 

 Source: Analyst Presentation ADM had a tough 2016, dipping below $30 a share for a short time due to depressed earnings early in the year. That made the comparison this last quarter much better, with earnings growing by about 50% on an adjusted basis. In the annual report, the CEO had this to say about last year's difficult environment: With relatively few exceptions, 2016 unfolded as we expected. The macroeconomic and industry conditions that weighed down our financial results in 2015 — including large global crop supplies, and both low prices and volatility that limited merchandising opportunities — persisted through much of the first half of 2016. During this period, we implemented operational efficiency projects that, by year’s end, resulted in over $300 million in run-rate cost savings. We captured nearly $540 million in incremental revenues from recent investments. And, we monetized nearly $700 million of assets that were no longer strategic for ADM, which allowed us to redeploy this capital toward more productive uses. We anticipate reaching $1 billion in monetized assets by the end of 2017.
 The key to a great company operating in a cyclical industry is the ability to maintain costs in lean times and to deploy cash when times are tough by acquiring companies or taking market share. ADM has been pretty acquisitive, as management continues to hone the company's footprint and portfolio to maximize the revenue base and thin margins. Underperforming businesses have been divested, and the acquisition of Wild Flavors and companies like Chamtor, a French sweetener company, should help diversify ADM away from some of the more cyclical products that it processes. Additionally, the company continues to engage in joint ventures across the globe to expand its facility footprint and open new growth runways. 

 Source: Analyst Presentation However, the company doesn't have the moat that many of its Dividend Aristocrat peers have. Although the company has obviously been managed well to have been able to hike its dividend for 42 years while maintaining a ~50% payout ratio today, its low returns on capital and margins show that it is in a highly competitive and capital intensive industry. Additionally, the products that the company sells aren't really that different from its competitors. Due to the huge scale of its processing facilities worldwide, it isn't likely that an upstart company will be able to mimic the company's cost benefits. However, it takes constant improvement and investment to hold on to market share.  A final risk to consider is that 2 of the larger products that ADM produces are ethanol and high fructose corn syrup. Changes to the ethanol requirements for gasoline could have a material impact on results going forward. There is a possibility of ethanol blending requirements increasing or decreasing in the future. Either way, it is out of the company's hands. Additionally, the pushback on high fructose corn syrup is one of the reasons that the company has been investing in its recent acquisitions. Just like many consumer staples companies, ADM will benefit from shifting towards more natural ingredients to suit today's consumers. 
 

ADM Free Cash Flow (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsADM has a conservative payout ratio around 50% of earnings, and its long term debt is reasonable. Dividend growth was slow this last year, which is fine considering the depressed earnings the company was dealing with. Capital expenditures have been stable, which allow the company to generate close to $1B in free cash flow pretty consistently. All in all, the financial picture looks pretty healthy. 

 

ADM looks to be trading right around fair value today. Its dividend yield at ~3% is at or above its long term average, and the P/E ratio is not a reliable indicator due to depressed earnings. However, looking at the graph above, one can see that the stock will be trading right around the company's long term average once earnings recover later in the year.  

An investment today would yield ~9% annualized on a return to the company's long-term valuation based on analyst estimates. I see ADM as a great operator in a tough business, which will continue to reward shareholders over the long-term. Long-term tailwinds from population growth and expansion into new global markets will likely drive strong results despite the headwinds discussed in the article, and today's prices represent a good entry point for the stock.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
