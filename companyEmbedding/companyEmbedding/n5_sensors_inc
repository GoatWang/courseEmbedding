We have developed a novel chemical and gas sensor architecture by combining the sensitive transduction capability of semiconducting nanostructures together with the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of nanoclusters. This new sensor technology can produce sensors whose selectivity can be precisely tuned to any small set of chemicals through the design of the nanocluster, something currently not possible with any other technology.

	Interview conducted by:


	Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, CEOCFO Magazine, Published - April 24, 2017

 


CEOCFO: Dr. Motayed, what is the 
	idea behind N5 Sensors?


Dr. Motayed: 
At N5 we leverage 
	smart materials and cutting-edge engineering to bring smart sensors that 
	provides gas detection capability for next-generation of smart and connected 
	devices. We wanted to develop reliable gas sensor chips that can 
	bridge the gap that exists between need for environmental detection in smart 
	devices and the mature sensor technologies that are available in the market.
	

 



	CEOCFO: What can the new sensors do? 
	


Dr. Motayed: 
	The sensors that we have developed are essentially gas and chemical sensors 
	inside a microchip. Think of a microchip doing computations and so forth in 
	your cell phone and laptop and whatever other devices you have! Now imagine 
	a chip like that inside all those devices that now have the ability to 
	detect different air toxins or different air qualities features in your near 
	surrounding. That means using that you can now get real-time data on what is 
	happening to your environment and how that affects or impacts your health, 
	safety and well-being. Whether you are in your home, working at your office, 
	running outside, working outside if you are an industrial worker; our 
	sensors can provide individuals with real-time information on the dangers 
	present in the environment and also the long-term impacts on being in such 
	environments. Information of that nature can not only improve individual 
	safety, but also can have profound impact on our long-term health.

 


CEOCFO: How are you able to accomplish 
	this? What needs to be in that chip?  


Dr. Motayed: 
We have designed 
	and perfected an architecture that allows us to combine the high performance 
	of the nanomaterials with high throughput manufacturing that is commonly 
	used in semiconductor manufacturing. We combine them together to produce the 
	ultra-sensitive and very specific micro scale chemical sensors. We put all 
	of that together into a tiny chip, the size of smaller than a postage stamp. 
	Basically, that is the heart of our chemical sensors. Using all of the 
	innovations that we have done in different things like sensor design, 
	materials, manufacturing, packaging and algorithm development, we have 
	developed a really smart robust sensors, but at a price point of a consumer 
	device. Traditionally, gas detection technology has been for industrial use: 
	high cost, high maintenance and what we have done is to bring industrial 
	grade detection capability to regular use � such as personal devices, smart 
	home systems, and smart offices. 

 


CEOCFO: Have similar concepts been tried?



Dr. Motayed: 
Yes. We do have 
	competitors in the market. What differentiates us from the competitors is 
	the innovative architecture, which is a patented IP, that we have licensed 
	it from one of the universities. This architecture allows us to build 
	sensors that are very selective, precise, and robust. It provides the user 
	with more reliable data and a longer operating sensor at a lower power and a 
	single chip can read multiple gasses. What that means for the end user is 
	that our technology can provide timely data and they do not have to service 
	or maintain the sensors frequently. If you deploy our sensors in a system, 
	such as a smart home, it can serve in multiple ways. It can provide 
	information on long-term trends, such as how daily activities affect the air 
	quality inside your home. However, it can also provide immediate alarms for 
	dangerous situations. For example, if you have a carbon monoxide buildup or 
	if you have a natural gas leak. That is because our individual sensors can 
	do multiple gasses, so the end user is provided with more information and 
	more value. 

 


CEOCFO: Are you still in the development 
	stage? Do you have products commercially available?  



Dr. Motayed: 
We have a product 
	pipeline. Some of the designs are still in the development or prototyping 
	stage. Some are more advanced. We have some that are commercially available 
	for customers to evaluate and design their systems around them. Some are 
	still going through testing and evaluation, so we have a product pipeline 
	with products in different stages of development.  

 


CEOCFO: How do you get attention 
	from the appropriate people? Have people been looking for something like 
	this? How do you get to the mainstream?  


Dr. Motayed: 
We have a 
	strategy. This is a new technology. In order to gain traction we have to 
	educate different tiers of your customers and end-users. We have gone out to 
	trade shows and demonstrated and exhibited our technology to get customer 
	traction, to get customers through the door, show them what it can do when 
	they integrate our sensors into their systems. Then we have done several 
	evaluations with interested customers, which led to further engagements. Our 
	business model is almost an OEM model, where it is essential to engage the 
	customer but also it is important to bring in the end-user in the loop. This 
	ensures we create a demand for the end-product and functionality, which in 
	turn will create the demand for our components. We have been working with 
	different customers, and end users at the same time to validate the need for 
	these types of sensors and products and the data this product provides to 
	the user. 

 


CEOCFO: What have you learned as you have 
	started to work with different people? What has changed from your original 
	concept? 


Dr. Motayed: 
Definitely, a lot 
	has changed since the early days of N5. One of the cornerstones of lean 
	startup methodology and lean manufacturing is that you develop a minimum 
	viable product with minimum feature sets, as fast as one can and with the 
	least cost possible, and get it to the customers, have them evaluate it and 
	then listen to the feedback and iterate rapidly. Some of the things we have 
	learned from our customers are things like what kind of packages are needed 
	for the chips for different applications, what type of detection capability, 
	operational boundaries, which are all essential information for success of a 
	product. For example, when we started this we were thinking of packing-in 
	more sensors in one device and the logic was more is better. However, it 
	turned out that most customers only wanted one or two gas sensors on one 
	single chip! Insights into the customers� needs and what the market really 
	wants is essential in developing a new product.

 


CEOCFO: Are you funded for your next 
	steps? Are you seeking partnerships or investment? 



Dr. Motayed: 
We have funding 
	from the US government for our R&D projects. Currently, we have several SBIR 
	programs from the Dept. of Homeland Security and NASA. Recently, we have 
	raised a Seed Round of investment with Blu Venture Investors leading the 
	round. However, for the next staging of scaling up, and addressing different 
	markets and applications, we are looking for strategic partnerships and 
	funding. That funding will help us execute the milestones needed for the 
	next stages of growth, scaling-up of our production, and for products that 
	we have in the pipeline. 

 


CEOCFO: Why does N5 Sensors 
	standout? 


Dr. Motayed: 
N5 Sensors� 
	mission is to make the world a safer place using our smart sensors. We are 
	positioned perfectly to make a big impact into the next generation of IoT 
	devices, connected devices, smart home systems; with our patented, smart gas 
	sensor technology that will enable the desperately-needed missing 
	environmental sensing modality on all of these devices. This represents a 
	significant market and business opportunity, if you consider billions of 
	connected devices that are going to be manufactured, and installed in smart 
	homes, smart cars, wearables, and industrial IoT platforms. N5 Sensors� 
	technology can be deployed in all of these applications, which not only 
	represents a significant return on investment for the investors, but also a 
	tremendous growth opportunity for N5 and the technology to address new and 
	emerging markets worldwide.
