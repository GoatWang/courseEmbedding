Company Description


Chatham Capital Group begins their investment process with a confidential meeting with clients to gather information on the client's total financial picture. At this stage, the firm's principals act as financial consultants carefully helping define financial objectives and designing a plan to achieve those objectives.The selection procedure for new securities begins when an analyst or a principal identifies an interesting company via quantitative screens of their database, or through insights regarding an emerging industry trend. A research report is prepared and the case is presented and debated at weekly research meetings. This allows Chatham to reach buy and sell decisions through their own internal efforts. Each investment idea is viewed within the context of the same five-year overall investment outlook used in the asset allocation decision-making process.Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors, Chatham identifies companies that meet the following criteria: high quality, strong management, expectation for sustainability of growth and low debt. They then evaluate stocks based on the market's expectation for growth versus the firm's expectation and p/e relationship. Client portfolios hold a limited but diversified number of stocks, usually about forty. They are not a short-term trading firm.Though not limited by sector, Chatham tends to invest in the stocks of US companies in the consumer non-durables, health technology, producer manufacturing, technology services, electronic technology  and industrial services sectors. The firm invests across all market-caps and maintains a very low turnover rate.Chatham's fixed-income investment process consists of interest rate anticipation and spread analysis. Based on the economic outlook, the firm targets certain maturity ranges in bond holdings. They also consider spread analysis. The fixed-income portion of balanced accounts consists of high quality bonds. These are usually municipal obligations rated AA or better for taxable accounts, and US Government, Treasury Inflation Protection Securities (TIPS), or high quality corporate bonds for tax-exempt accounts.

What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CA (NASDAQ:CA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.13)Consensus Price Target: $34.85 (1.26% upside)
