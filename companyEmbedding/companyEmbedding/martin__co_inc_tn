Martin & Company, Inc. Key Developments

Vertafore Enhances its Information Solution with Partnership from Martin & Company to Integrate its 50 State Filing Database into ReferenceConnect
Mar 4 16
Vertafore announced a partnership with Martin & Company to include M&C's FilingsDirect.com database as part of the industry's only integrated insurance search engine, ReferenceConnect information solution. The addition of this public information will allow ReferenceConnect carrier, MGA, and broker clients a new capability to access filed and approved Department of Insurance (DOI) rules, rates, and forms nationwide. The benefit of accessing this information in the ReferenceConnect search engine improves productivity for users of ReferenceConnect, eliminating the need to search through multiple sites or DOI databases. The competitive analysis capability now available through access to this filing information will be a tremendous advantage to insurance executives trying to understand how their products compare. Vertafore and Martin & Company have already started development on this integration and expect to be ready for market release in early third quarter of 2016.
