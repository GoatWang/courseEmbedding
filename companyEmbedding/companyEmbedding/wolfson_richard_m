Wolfson, Richard M.




Generation and propagation of Raman solitons at high intensity

Order No. 8921896

This research is a theoretical study of the generation and propagation of solitons in stimulated Raman scattering at high intensity. This study extends previous research by incorporating, in particular, effects of the Stark shift and medium saturation, in addition to the detuning of the fields off medium resonance and the broadening of the Raman linewidth due to collisions in the medium (collisional coherence decay). The main result is that by balancing the above effects, the maximum pump intensity can increase over propagation even with damping from collisional coherence decay.

The research employs both numerical and analytic techniques. The analytic method from soliton perturbation theory assumes soliton solutions of the damped equations to be of the one-soliton form as functions of time. Good agreement is found between the analytic results and direct numerical integration. Source: DAI, 50, no. 06B, (1989): 2475

    Professor
    Richard Wolfson, Ph.D.











                                    Middlebury College                                



                                    Dartmouth College                                









                    Physics explains the workings of the universe at the deepest level, the everyday natural phenomena that are all around us, and the technologies that enable modern society. It's an essential liberal art.                 


Dr. Richard Wolfson is the Benjamin F. Wissler Professor of Physics at Middlebury College, where he also teaches Climate Change in Middlebury's Environmental Studies Program. He completed his undergraduate work at MIT and Swarthmore College, graduating from Swarthmore with a double major in Physics and Philosophy. He holds a master's degree in Environmental Studies from the University of Michigan and a Ph.D. in Physics from Dartmouth. 
Professor Wolfson's published work encompasses diverse fields such as medical physics, plasma physics, solar energy engineering, electronic circuit design, observational astronomy, theoretical astrophysics, nuclear issues, and climate change. His current research involves the eruptive behavior of the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, as well as terrestrial climate change and the sun–Earth connection. 
Professor Wolfson is the author of several books, including the college textbooks Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Essential University Physics,and Energy, Environment, and Climate. He is also an interpreter of science for the nonspecialist, a contributor to Scientific American, and author of the books Nuclear Choices: A Citizen's Guide to Nuclear Technology and Simply Einstein: Relativity Demystified. 









Testimonials
"Dr. Wolfson covers his topics in physics thoroughly and in an entertaining fashion. His sequence of subjects is novel and he manages transitions and cross-references extremely well."
 
"Professor Wolfson lectures were superb, enthusiaistic, never dull. He is an excellent teacher. Highly recommended, I wish I could go back to college and take more courses from him!"
 
"Professor Wolfson is easily the most gifted lecturer I have ever encountered including in 5 years of college and 2 years of grad school."
 

"One can't beat Richard Wolfson as a coherent, organized, knowledgable and effective lecturer."

    Professor
    Richard Wolfson, Ph.D.











                                    Middlebury College                                



                                    Dartmouth College                                









                    Physics explains the workings of the universe at the deepest level, the everyday natural phenomena that are all around us, and the technologies that enable modern society. It's an essential liberal art.                 


Dr. Richard Wolfson is the Benjamin F. Wissler Professor of Physics at Middlebury College, where he also teaches Climate Change in Middlebury's Environmental Studies Program. He completed his undergraduate work at MIT and Swarthmore College, graduating from Swarthmore with a double major in Physics and Philosophy. He holds a master's degree in Environmental Studies from the University of Michigan and a Ph.D. in Physics from Dartmouth. 
Professor Wolfson's published work encompasses diverse fields such as medical physics, plasma physics, solar energy engineering, electronic circuit design, observational astronomy, theoretical astrophysics, nuclear issues, and climate change. His current research involves the eruptive behavior of the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, as well as terrestrial climate change and the sun–Earth connection. 
Professor Wolfson is the author of several books, including the college textbooks Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Essential University Physics,and Energy, Environment, and Climate. He is also an interpreter of science for the nonspecialist, a contributor to Scientific American, and author of the books Nuclear Choices: A Citizen's Guide to Nuclear Technology and Simply Einstein: Relativity Demystified. 









Testimonials
"Dr. Wolfson covers his topics in physics thoroughly and in an entertaining fashion. His sequence of subjects is novel and he manages transitions and cross-references extremely well."
 
"Professor Wolfson lectures were superb, enthusiaistic, never dull. He is an excellent teacher. Highly recommended, I wish I could go back to college and take more courses from him!"
 
"Professor Wolfson is easily the most gifted lecturer I have ever encountered including in 5 years of college and 2 years of grad school."
 

"One can't beat Richard Wolfson as a coherent, organized, knowledgable and effective lecturer."

Richard M Wolfson's Experience
Title: 
               Company: Kipp Academy Nashville
Job Details
               KIPP Nashville provides the following services to support students in each of the five factors:Supporting high school graduation: All KTC alumni are assigned advisors starting in 9th grade. Our advisors contact students at least once per quarter and visit them on campus as well. Our advisors build critical relationships with each alum, track their academic progress, give quarterly reports to parents, provide programming for students to expose them to career and college and more. By building relationships that yield a detailed understanding of each alum's circumstances, our advisors are able to help them address specific issues as they arise, steer them toward resources and solutions and teach them how to better advocate for themselves. Preparing for the Cost of College: Staring with a financial literacy curriculum in our middle schools, preparing for the cost of college is stressed at every stage of preparing students for college. Our KTC team offers programming for students and families around understanding the cost of college, saving for college, applying for scholarships and more. We also have a comprehensive financial aid program that helps our high school seniors track their progress towards financial aid completion. Match Matters: Finding a college that is a good match and fit for our students is critical to their ability to graduate from college. Starting in 9th grade we help students know their numbers and understand how selective colleges are, attend college visits to see a variety of schools, and research colleges in our time together. Starting in 11th grade we offer an ACT prep program and begin building a comprehensive college application list. Alumni receive support throughout the entire application process from essay writing, application submission, to final matriculation decisions. College Support: All KTC alumni are assigned advisors after they graduate from high school. Advisors reach out to students anywhere between weekly and quarterly, checking in on college milestones such as picking classes, buying books, going to office hours, tutoring, exams and more. Advisors track students' progress towards their academic goals and majors, as well as helping students and families keep track of financial aid responsibilities. KTC advisors also reach out to alumni who are potentially stalled on their school and career paths.
