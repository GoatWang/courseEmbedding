Memorial Trees by Honoring a Life




    When you choose to have a memorial tree planted for your loved one, you are doing more than simply putting a plant in the ground.
    You are making a long-term commitment to the environment and implanting the memories of your loved one in our planet for countless
    years to come. A memorial tree is a unique tribute which provides global benefits like no other memorial gift could.




        What is a memorial tree?
    



What you receive:

A memorial tree planted in the area of greatest need, according to the planting schedule of the American Forests Organization. 
A memorial card to be sent to your home, or a person of your choosing which demonstrates the gift you have given.
Your name and message listed in this online memorial, and on the honoringalife.org website.



                    In today’s changing world with climate change and environment concerns, “Honoring a Life” allows for 
family and friends to plant a memorial tree in honor of their loved one and friend. The purchase of a tree creates a beautiful permanent record on the Honoring a Life website, www.honoringalife.org. Each tree is planted through the efforts of Forestry Services throughout North America who determine where the greatest needs for reforestation are. Once planted, the geographical location where the tree is planted will be added to the record. A beautiful card is also sent to the family signifying your thoughtful gesture.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
