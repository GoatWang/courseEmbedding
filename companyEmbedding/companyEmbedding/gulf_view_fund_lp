Coral Reef Capital has made an investment in Covington, Louisiana-based Krewe Energy LLC, an oil and gas company. No financial terms were disclosed.
PRESS RELEASE
New York, NY (January 9th, 2017) – Coral Reef Capital is pleased to announce a new investment in Krewe Energy, LLC (“Krewe Energy” or the “Company”) to recapitalize the Company and further support its growth. Funds provided by CRC Resources Fund II LP and CRC Energy Fund LP were used to pay off all outstanding senior bank indebtedness of the Company, fund the acquisition of the Coquille Bay Field, and redeem an interest in the Company from its existing sponsor, Sage Road Capital. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Krewe Energy was formed in 2013 by its founders, Tom De Brock and Barry Salsbury, in partnership with Houston, Texas-based Sage Road Capital. Based in Covington, Louisiana, Krewe Energy engages in the acquisition, exploitation and development of oil and gas assets, with a specific focus on conventional production opportunities in South Louisiana.
Barry Salsbury, Managing Partner of Krewe Energy, commented, “The Coral Reef team’s view of risk and capital allocation closely aligns with those of Krewe management and existing stakeholders. Since our founding in 2013, Krewe has completed several acquisitions and been successful in growing production and reserves substantially. With this transaction, we have created an exceptional partnership with two strong financial sponsors and positioned the Company with a strong balance sheet and access to additional growth capital. We look forward to continuing our acquisition and development strategy in the Gulf Coast market.” 





Jared Powell, a Partner at Coral Reef Capital, commented, “Coral Reef is thrilled to partner with such a high quality group. Barry, Tom and the rest of the Krewe team have consistently demonstrated their ability to create value in the Gulf Coast across market cycles. We expect to continue deploying both acquisition and development capital to expand the business together.”
