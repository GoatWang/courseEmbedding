Description

                    "This book answers 'why not' and 'how to' for health care accreditation bodies, quality experts, and frontline professionals, moving the reader from timely information, to inspiration, and through patient-centered action with practical tools and potent case studies." Paul vanOstenberg, DDS, MS, vice president, Accreditation and Standards, Joint Commission International "This superb guide from Planetree illustrates that providing high-quality, high-value, patient-centered health care is not a theoretical ideal. The case studies make clear that these goals are attainable; they are being achieved by leading health care organizations worldwide, and there is a clear road map for getting there  right here in this book." Susan Dentzer, senior policy adviser to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation "At IHI, we follow the principle, 'all teach, all learn'  the idea that everyone, everywhere has something to teach, and something to learn. This remarkable and indispensable guide is as pure an example of this principle as I've come across."
Maureen Bisognano, president and chief executive officer, Institute for Healthcare Improvement "The International Society for Quality in Health Care's mission is to inspire, promote, and support continuous improvement in the quality and safety of health care worldwide. It is in this spirit that we welcome this new book on patient-centered care. As in their previous work, the authors demonstrate just how critical it is to develop an organizational culture that puts patients first."

Description

                    The second edition of  Putting Patients First  showcases what Planetree facilities and the Planetree organization have learned about the commitments, conditions, practices, and policies that are needed to do more than give lip service to being--patient-centered.--It should be read by every student, nurse, physician, administrator, trustee, policy maker, and lay person who is committed to creating healing environments, holding facilities accountable for their rhetoric, and truly reforming health care.show more

Back cover copy

                            Putting Patients First, 2nd Edition "The second edition of Putting Patients First showcases what Planetree facilities and the Planetree organization have learned about the commitments, conditions, practices, and policies that are needed to do more than give lip service to being 'patient-centered.' It should be read by every student, nurse, physician, administrator, trustee, policy maker, and lay person who is committed to creating healing environments, holding facilities accountable for their rhetoric, and truly reforming health care."
 --Diana J. Mason, PhD, RN, FAAN, editor in chief, American Journal of Nursing

 "Putting Patients First may well revolutionize what you do and how you do it, and provide you far more satisfaction in your job." --Harvey Picker, founder, Picker Institute

 "This book is a model of 'best practices' for self and systems."
 --Jean Watson, PhD, RN, Distinguished Professor of Nursing, Murchinson-Scoville Endowed Chair in Caring Science, University of Colorado Denver

 "'Patient-centric' is not just a buzzword for this gang. They invented it and live it and extend it and reinvent it every day."
 --Tom Peters, co-author, In Search of Excellence

 "Of all the dimensions on which health care needs to improve, the most important is 'patient-centeredness.' In this timely volume, some of the best minds in the field guide us to rethink the very definition of that term, and show us both the boldness and the promise of new forms, systems, and attitudes that can help us become what we ought to be: not hosts to our patients, but well-behaved, respectful guests in their lives."

Susan Frampton 
 

Susan B. Frampton, PhDSusan Frampton is the President of Planetree International, a non-profit advocacy and membership organization that works with a growing network of healthcare provider organizations across the continuum to implement comprehensive person-centered models of care. 

Dr. Frampton, a medical anthropologist, has authored numerous publications, including the three editions of Putting Patients First (Jossey-Bass 2004, 2008, 2013), and served as lead author on the National Academy of Medicine’s Harnessing Evidence and Experience to Change Culture, released in early 2017. 
  Dr. Frampton chaired the National Academy of Medicine’s Scientific Advisory Panel on the Evidence Base for PatientCentered Care, which led to this ground-breaking publication. The resulting guiding framework for patient and family engaged care definitively answers the often posed question of whether resource investment in this area leads to better health outcomes. The quadruple aim of better culture, better care, better health and lower costs is clearly tied to a compelling collection of qualitative and quantitative evidence. 
Dr. Frampton leads Planetree’s advocacy efforts, currently chairs the National Quality Forum’s National Quality Partners Leadership Consortium, and has co-chaired NQF Action Teams on Advanced Illness Care, Patient-Family Engagement, and Decreasing Hospital (Re)Admissions. She serves on the Governing Board for the WHO-CC International Network of Health Promoting Hospitals, and the editorial board for the Journal of Compassionate Healthcare. 
  In addition to speaking internationally on culture change, quality, safety, and the patient experience, she was honored in 2009, when she was named one of “20 People who Make Healthcare Better” by Health Leaders Magazine.Related Links Susan's CV

Patient-centered care retreats as a method for enhancing and sustaining compassion in action in healthcare settingsFeatured PresentationsHarnessing Evidence  and Experience to Change Healthcare Culture: A Guiding Framework for Patient  and Family Engaged Care

  Patient and family engaged care (PFEC) has been identified as a cornerstone of the national strategy for delivering healthcare that results in better health at lower costs. But despite efforts to make PFEC a predominant feature in all healthcare interactions, it continues to be an aspirational aim. And so it will remain in the absence of 1.) clear direction on the specific, high impact elements necessary to create, sustain and measure a culture of PFEC; and 2.) a persuasive evidence base compelling healthcare practitioners and leaders to change business as usual.
 To address these persistent barriers, in 2016, the National Academy of Medicine convened a group of clinical and health service researchers, healthcare professionals and patient and family leaders to collaborate on the development of a Guiding Framework for Patient and Family Engaged Care. The framework depicts how a broad array of culture change strategies work together to yield results for better health, better care, greater value and better healthcare cultures. The multi-stakeholder development process yielded a framework that takes a broader view than previous patient and family engagement (PFE) frameworks through the inclusion of often overlooked dimensions of workplace culture, the physical environment, the quality of human interactions, communication approaches and other PFEC levers that impact healthcare culture, quality, experience and value.
 The guiding framework will be presented in this session, along with the evidence in support of its various elements. In addition, the presentation will share how the tool can be used to accelerate the advancement of PFEC, promote effective partnerships among healthcare executives and patient and family leaders, and guide broader policy efforts intended to pave the way for patient and family engaged care to become the norm in healthcare.


The Brave New World  of Patient and Family Engagement-2016 Policy and Practice Update
The engagement of patients and families in the design and coordination of health care services at the levels of policy, organization and direct delivery has become a centerpiece of current healthcare improvement efforts. Legislation supporting, and in some instances mandating, explicit and meaningful involvement is accelerating internationally, regionally and locally through efforts tied to the Affordable Care Act, including the CMS Partnership for Patients, Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH), Value-Based Purchasing and the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). Dr. Susan Frampton, patient rights advocate, patient-centered policy expert, and president of Planetree – the oldest patient and family engagement non-profit in the US, sits at the center of this movement. Dr. Frampton, a medical anthropologist, currently co-chairs the National Quality Forum’s National Quality Partnership Leadership Consortium, and chaired the National Academy of Medicine’s Scientific Advisory Panel on the Evidence-Base for Patient-Engaged Care. She understands what it takes to translate both research and policy into change strategies that deliver the practical outcomes our healthcare system is committed to accomplishing in the quest to reach the Quadruple Aim. 


  Quality  Checking Your Patient and Family Engagement Strategies  

  What do  Medicare Shared Savings/ACO regulations, Patient Centered Medical Home  standards, and Meaningful Use thresholds have in common? They all require the  engagement of patients in their own health care, and have thus catapulted  Patient Family Engagement- PFE- to the top of many healthcare providers’ priority  lists. But PFE will not occur simply by providing information to consumers.  Patients and families have experienced a system of patriarchal care that has  created passivity, and in some cases fear of retribution for being labeled  “difficult”. Deep culture change efforts are necessary to address the  environment –both physical and emotional - in which care is delivered. Concurrently,  finding ways to motivate patients and families to seek out and use relevant  information as they actively participate in their care requires not only a  change in the patient, but a change to the processes and expectations of  organizations across the continuum of care. It requires the adoption of new  perspectives and practices at the level of policy, organization, and individual  care. It also requires a framework with which to organize actions so that  priorities can be set in an efficient and effective manner. 

There  exists today an overwhelming plethora of potential engagement approaches,  ideas, and activities for providers to choose from. Many changes in practice  have been put in place at both organizational and direct care levels, but  little is done to assure that these initiatives remain active, effective, and  impactful.  Ensuring that your PFE  strategies are the right ones, in the right place, at the right time is  critical. Employing the right tools and strategies for quality checking your  PFE tactics will ensure that resources are dedicated to well-aligned  undertakings that achieve demonstrable outcomes.

Why Patient Centered Care Is Essential



Putting Patients First



Patients as Their Own







Speech Topics

The Brave New World of Patient & Family Engagement - Policy & Practice Update

The engagement of patients and families in the design and coordination of health care services at the levels of policy, organization and direct delivery has become a centerpiece of current healthcare improvement efforts. Legislation supporting, and in some instances mandating, explicit and meaningful involvement is accelerating nationally, regionally and locally through efforts tied to the Affordable Care Act, including the CMS Partnership for Patients, Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH), Value-Based Purchasing and the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). Dr. Susan Frampton, patient rights advocate, patient-centered policy expert, and president of Planetree – the oldest patient and family engagement non-profit in the US, sits at the center of this movement. Dr. Frampton, a medical anthropologist, currently co-chairs the National Quality Forum’s National Quality Partnership and their Advanced Illness Care Action Team, and chairs the National Academy of Medicine’s Scientific Advisory Panel on the Evidence-Base for Patient-Engaged Care. She understands what it takes to translate both research and policy into change strategies that deliver the practical outcomes our healthcare system is committed to accomplishing in the quest to reach the Triple Aim.



Putting Patients First: Lessons Learned from Over Three Decades of Patient-Centered Care

Long before patient-centered care became a centerpiece of healthcare reform efforts or a media buzz word, Dr. Susan Frampton and the non-profit advocacy organization Planetree have been defining not only what it means to be patient centered, but practical and successful strategies to make it a reality. Decades of listening to patients and their families, and partnering with organizations to design and implement patient-centered approaches to care, have resulted in an incomparable evidence-based for innovation in care delivery. Dr. Frampton is the authority on what it takes to transform healthcare systems to put patients first. In this presentation, Susan will share personal perspectives and stories that bring to life the five simple but profoundly important lessons that any organization working to deliver patient-centered care, can use to accelerate efforts and improve outcomes. We are all human, we all have to work as a team in order to take care of people and at the end of the day, we have all been - or will be -patients.



Patient-Centered Leadership for Accountable Care 

Patient-centered healthcare is accountable care. It is accountable for quality, value, and patient satisfaction. Knowing how to build and operate a sustainable culture of patient-centered healthcare means looking beyond traditional views of what the patient wants and what your hospital can deliver. In this presentation, speaker Susan Frampton will share successful strategies for developing a patient-centered leadership culture that creates the foundation for accountable care. She will teach you how to educate physicians, nurses, and other caregivers in developing a new dynamic with patients, improving transitions of care, and reducing readmissions.



Compassion in Action

As patient-centered care gains traction as the optimal way to deliver healthcare, patients and professional caregivers are becoming more aware of the importance of better addressing human needs. For too long, patients experienced a system of patriarchal care that made them passive. To reverse this, we must create organizational cultures that value compassion at all levels, from the bedside to the boardroom. Speaker Susan Frampton invites audiences to reflect on the role of compassion, empathy, kindness, and respect in healthcare and shares viable strategies for embedding compassionate action into your organization.



Becoming a Healthcare Employer of Choice

Success in providing patient-centered care is rooted in organizational culture. It’s about building a culture of ownership by reconnecting employees with the reason healthcare was their calling and their passion in the first place and creating the opportunity for them to do the kind of work they were initially drawn to. Through a combination of data and storytelling about renowned healthcare employers, speaker Susan Frampton will examine the link between the patient experience and the employee experience and will provide concrete strategies for organizations to cultivate supportive work environments where caregivers—and their patients—can thrive.
