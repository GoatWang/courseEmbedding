Marathon gasoline is certified Top Tier, providing a higher level of STP detergent additive for an even greater cleaning power. Marathon gasoline fights the accumulation of harmful deposits and improves the performance of your vehicle's engine.










Optimizes Fuel Economy.Deposits in engines can reduce fuel economy. Compared to gasolines using only the minimum EPA required dose of detergent additives, Marathon gasolines with STP additives can increase fuel efficiency by improving the cleanliness of an engine’s intake valves.
Removes Deposit Buildup.Marathon gasolines with STP additives provide deposit control detergents that remove the buildup of performance-robbing deposits. Marathon gasolines are specifically formulated to help maintain engine cleanliness, therefore, improve engine quality.






Reduces Emissions.By keeping intake valves clean, engines have fewer deposits, which can lower harmful emissions like nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide in engine exhaust. Marathon gasolines with STP additives clean engine intake valves and reduce emissions.
Restores Lost Power.Marathon gasolines with STP additives can remove deposits in your engine’s intake valves. Lower quality gasolines have the potential to leave more deposits, which will have a negative impact on your vehicle’s performance. A cleaner engine will keep your vehicle running its best.

Asphalt
Marathon Petroleum Company LP (MPC) is a major producer and marketer of liquid asphalt used primarily as a binder in constructing and maintaining road surfaces. The liquid asphalt is combined with aggregate to produce Hot Mix Asphalt, used for roadways. Other uses for asphalt include the manufacture of roofing products.
Production Information  MPC has the largest domestic asphalt production capacity in the United States, producing base asphalt binders from four of its seven refineries which are: Canton, Ohio; Catlettsburg, Ky.; Detroit, Mich.; and Garyville, La.
Transportation  Asphalt must be kept hot to remain a liquid and is generally shipped at temperatures exceeding 270 degrees Fahrenheit via barge, rail or transport truck. Pipelines can not be used to move this product great distances efficiently due to temperature constraints.
MarketingMPC markets asphalt through 18 company-owned and -operated and two third-party terminals located throughout the Midwest and Southeast. The MPC customer base includes asphalt paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities, and townships), and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. In addition, MPC makes domestic U.S. barge sales in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions. Any export sale is sold F.O.B. Garyville, La., as inventories permit.

Current operations[edit]
As of December 31, 2015, the company had 2.163 billion barrels of oil equivalent (1.323×1010 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 44% was in the United States, 32% was in Canada, 12% was in Equatorial Guinea, and 11% was in other countries in Africa, primarily Libya.
The company has concessions with the Waha Oil Company in Libya. Libya accounts for 235 million barrels of oil equivalent (1.44×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, although the company did not sell any product from these operations in 2015 since operations were interrupted by civil and political unrest. [1]
In Canada, the company is focused on the Athabasca oil sands project, in which the company owns a 20% interest.[1]
The company's proved reserves consisted 40% of petroleum, 32% synthetic crude, 19% natural gas and 9% natural gas liquids.[1]
In 2015, the company sold 438 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (2,680,000 GJ) per day.[1]
In 2015, the company derived 13% of its revenues from sales to Irving Oil and 11% of its revenues from sales to Shell Oil.[1]
In 2016, the company plans to spend $1.4 billion on capital expenditures, of which $1.2 billion will be spent in North America, including $600 million in the Eagle Ford and $200 million in the Bakken formation.[1]
The company owns 277,000 net acres in the Bakken formation.[1]
History[edit]
Marathon began as The Ohio Oil Company in 1887. In 1889, it was purchased by John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. It remained a part of Standard Oil until Standard Oil was broken in 1911. In 1930, The Ohio Oil Company bought the Transcontinental Oil Company and established the "Marathon" brand name. In 1962, the company changed its name to "Marathon Oil Company".
In 1982, Mobil made a hostile offer to buy the company; however, the board of Marathon Oil rejected the offer and instead sold the company to United States Steel. A legal battle ensued thereafter. [2]
After the merger, the headquarters was moved to Houston, Texas in 1990 but the company's refining subsidiary maintained its headquarters in Findlay.
In 1984, Marathon purchased the U.S. unit of Husky Energy for $505 million.[3]
In 1998, Marathon and Ashland, Inc. contributed their refining operations to Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, now Marathon Petroleum.[4]
In 2001, USX, the holding company that owned United States Steel and Marathon, spun off the steel business and, in 2002, USX renamed itself Marathon Oil Corporation.[5]
In 2003, Marathon sold its Canadian operations to Husky Energy.[6]
In 2003, the company sold its interest in the Yates Oil Field to Kinder Morgan for $225 million.[7]
In late 2003, Marathon Oil and its partners Noble Energy and AMPCO started the Bioko Island Malaria Control Project (BIMCP) in Equatorial Guinea. Malaria control activities included indoor residual spraying, improved diagnosis and case management, and capacity building to contain future outbreaks. BIMCP had proven being successful in reducing malaria transmission, reducing the proportion of children with malaria parasites, and improving iron status. BIMCP is perceived as a model of hands-on corporate involvement in a humanitarian effort with government, non-profits and academic organizations to reduce the burden of malaria in countries located in Equatorial Africa. [8] The President of Equatorial Guinea, Obiang Nguema, is one of the world's worst dictators, according to Parade Magazine. Marathon's humanitarian efforts have mitigated some of the criticism resulting from its dealings with Nguema's regime. In 2008, Marathon Oil and Lestis Group started the Central Basin Control Project (CBCP)[9]
In 2007, Marathon purchased for approximately $6.6 billion, Marathon acquired Western Oil Sands and gained ownership of its 20 percent stake in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in northern Alberta and other assets in the midwestern United States. The Athabasca project's Muskeg River Mine was producing 155,000 barrels a day of bitumen at the time.[10]
In 2011, Marathon completed the corporate spin-off of Marathon Petroleum, distributing a 100% interest to its shareholders.[11]
In June 2013, Marathon sold its Angolan oil and gas field to Sinopec for $1.52 billion.[12]
In September 2013, Marathon announced it would sell a 10% stake in an oil and gas field offshore Angola for around $590 million to Sonangol Group.[13]
In June 2014, Marathon Oil Norge AS (“Marathon Norway") was acquired by Det Norske Oljeselskap ASA for USD $2.1 billon.[14]

In 1982, Mobil made a hostile offer to buy the company; however, the board of Marathon Oil rejected the offer and instead sold the company to United States Steel. A legal battle ensued thereafter. [2]
After the merger, the headquarters was moved to Houston, Texas in 1990 but the company's refining subsidiary maintained its headquarters in Findlay.
In 1984, Marathon purchased the U.S. unit of Husky Energy for $505 million.[3]
In 1998, Marathon and Ashland, Inc. contributed their refining operations to Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, now Marathon Petroleum.[4]
In 2001, USX, the holding company that owned United States Steel and Marathon, spun off the steel business and, in 2002, USX renamed itself Marathon Oil Corporation.[5]
In 2003, Marathon sold its Canadian operations to Husky Energy.[6]
In 2003, the company sold its interest in the Yates Oil Field to Kinder Morgan for $225 million.[7]
In late 2003, Marathon Oil and its partners Noble Energy and AMPCO started the Bioko Island Malaria Control Project (BIMCP) in Equatorial Guinea. Malaria control activities included indoor residual spraying, improved diagnosis and case management, and capacity building to contain future outbreaks. BIMCP had proven being successful in reducing malaria transmission, reducing the proportion of children with malaria parasites, and improving iron status. BIMCP is perceived as a model of hands-on corporate involvement in a humanitarian effort with government, non-profits and academic organizations to reduce the burden of malaria in countries located in Equatorial Africa. [8] The President of Equatorial Guinea, Obiang Nguema, is one of the world's worst dictators, according to Parade Magazine. Marathon's humanitarian efforts have mitigated some of the criticism resulting from its dealings with Nguema's regime. In 2008, Marathon Oil and Lestis Group started the Central Basin Control Project (CBCP)[9]
In 2007, Marathon purchased for approximately $6.6 billion, Marathon acquired Western Oil Sands and gained ownership of its 20 percent stake in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in northern Alberta and other assets in the midwestern United States. The Athabasca project's Muskeg River Mine was producing 155,000 barrels a day of bitumen at the time.[10]
In 2011, Marathon completed the corporate spin-off of Marathon Petroleum, distributing a 100% interest to its shareholders.[11]
In June 2013, Marathon sold its Angolan oil and gas field to Sinopec for $1.52 billion.[12]
In September 2013, Marathon announced it would sell a 10% stake in an oil and gas field offshore Angola for around $590 million to Sonangol Group.[13]
In June 2014, Marathon Oil Norge AS (“Marathon Norway") was acquired by Det Norske Oljeselskap ASA for USD $2.1 billon.[14]

Current operations[edit]
As of December 31, 2015, the company had 2.163 billion barrels of oil equivalent (1.323×1010 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 44% was in the United States, 32% was in Canada, 12% was in Equatorial Guinea, and 11% was in other countries in Africa, primarily Libya.
The company has concessions with the Waha Oil Company in Libya. Libya accounts for 235 million barrels of oil equivalent (1.44×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, although the company did not sell any product from these operations in 2015 since operations were interrupted by civil and political unrest. [1]
In Canada, the company is focused on the Athabasca oil sands project, in which the company owns a 20% interest.[1]
The company's proved reserves consisted 40% of petroleum, 32% synthetic crude, 19% natural gas and 9% natural gas liquids.[1]
In 2015, the company sold 438 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (2,680,000 GJ) per day.[1]
In 2015, the company derived 13% of its revenues from sales to Irving Oil and 11% of its revenues from sales to Shell Oil.[1]
In 2016, the company plans to spend $1.4 billion on capital expenditures, of which $1.2 billion will be spent in North America, including $600 million in the Eagle Ford and $200 million in the Bakken formation.[1]
The company owns 277,000 net acres in the Bakken formation.[1]

					  America's express pass to mobility
				





City light rail and metros together with inter-city passenger rail is giving a boost to regional economies, making it easier for people to move around, expand access to opportunity and improve quality of life. Rail and road solutions are also helping to reduce traffic congestion on roads and highways.












					
                    Siemens is working with cities and people to help move America forward
				








To modernize and revitalize cities, we make transportation more efficient, intelligent, and safe - while lowering environmental impact and creating a better traveler experience. We deliver cloud-based traffic management systems, locomotives, light rail and metros, rail signaling and electrification solutions. One in every 3 light rail cars operating in the U.S. was built by Siemens. Along with our rail electrification and rail signaling systems in the U.S., we bring advanced technologies that improve operator performance and passenger quality of life. For example:
 

 Communications-Based Train Control systems for New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority
 Light rail vehicles for the Twin Cities that reduce gas emissions by more than 70% vs. cars
 Traffic management systems that shorten commute times by 20% along routes in San Antonio, Texas

 
We live and work in the communities where we create Ingenuity for life, with 2,000 employees across North America and full-scale transportation manufacturing facilities in five U.S. locations.

Economic Impact in Salt Lake


































Cities make up only 2% our landscape, but produce 70% of the world’s CO2


Siemens technologies improve energy-efficiency, reduce C0₂ and get more people where theyneed to go, on time




Traffic congestion wastes 3 billion gallons of fuel & 4 billion hours.


Siemens S70s are made in California at a plant powered 80% by solar energy


The California rail plant recycles 82% of its non-food/ wet waste.




254 million motor vehicles in the US alone contribute to the CO2 problem.


The S70 light rail vehicle moves enough people to take 920 cars off the road.


S70s help the environment by saving 662K gallons of gas & eliminating 4,600 tons of CO2

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
