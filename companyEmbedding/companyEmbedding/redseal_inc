RedSeal, Inc. Key Developments

RedSeal, Inc. Expands its Hybrid Datacenter Modeling Capability with Seamless Integration with Cisco ACI
Jul 12 17
RedSeal, Inc. increased its capabilities for modeling complex networks by adding a new integration with Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI). The integration between RedSeal's network modeling and risk-scoring platform and Cisco ACI expands customers' ability to create one, unified model of their hybrid datacenters -- including devices that are on-premise, virtualized, and/or in a public cloud -- and to conduct queries across all of these environments. The digital infrastructure of modern enterprise includes a complex array of on-premise, cloud and virtualized networks, which are constantly changing, making a complete and detailed understanding of the current state of a network a time-consuming and complex task. RedSeal's ability to model complete hybrid datacenters -- including software-defined networks (SDNs) in VMware NSX and now Cisco ACI, as well as previously announced enhanced modeling of Amazon Web Services Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) -- gives customers a comprehensive view of their entire as-built network. The Cisco ACI integration builds on RedSeal's ability to provide critical visibility into access controls for these hybrid datacenter environments, as well as alert users to violations of customized policies they have established for their organizations. This capability also helps security teams be more productive by allowing them to quickly and accurately model devices and associated policies within the Cisco ACI fabric.

Apr 24 17
RedSeal, Inc. Presents at The 20th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference, May-01-2017 10:45 AM. Venue: The Beverly Hilton, 9876 Wilshire Boulevard, Beverly Hills, CA 90210, California, United States. Speakers: Ray A. Rothrock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.


RedSeal Extends Digital Resilience Platform Across Network Environments, Improves Security and Network Teams' Productivity with New Integrations
Feb 6 17
RedSeal, Inc. has announced enhancements and new integrations for its network modeling and risk scoring platform. The enhancements will give RedSeal users a single, comprehensive understanding of network security across their datacenter, cloud and software-defined networks. The enhancements also help security teams be more productive despite ever-increasing demands by delivering actionable intelligence from RedSeal's network modeling platform directly into Splunk's Enterprise Security SIEM, Rapid7's Nexpose vulnerability management software, and ForeScout's CounterACT. The digital infrastructures for nearly all Global 2000 companies [6] include on-premise, cloud and virtualized networks. The resulting networks are large, complex, and constantly changing, making a complete and detailed understanding of the current state of a network very difficult. To address this, RedSeal can now model complete networks -- including software-defined networks (SDNs) in VMWare NSX and enhanced modeling of Amazon Web Services Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). RedSeal provides critical visibility into access controls for these SDN environments, and alerts users to violations of customized policies they've established for their organizations. To streamline security teams' efforts, and further improve network security, RedSeal now integrates into the user interfaces of Splunk's Enterprise Security SIEM, Rapid7's Nexpose vulnerability management software, and ForeScout's CounterACT. This improves the efficacy of each of these products, giving their users unprecedented network context within the tools, and in the format, they're already using. Specifically: Integration with Splunk's Enterprise Security SIEM accelerates incident response efforts. RedSeal provides the SIEM with critical network context and identifies access paths to and from Indicators of Compromise (IOC) leading to other critical assets. Integration with Rapid7's Nexpose vulnerability management software identifies gaps in vulnerability scan coverage. Integration with ForeScout's CounterACT prioritizes hosts in terms of actual risk so appropriate action can be taken.

RedSeal. The foundation for digital resilience.
You invest significant time and money in making sure your business can stay in business when the inevitable incident happens. But how do you know those security investments actually give results that prepare you to respond and rebound without missing a beat? How do you measure your digital resilience?
Without RedSeal, you’re flying blind.
RedSeal software is the best way to measure and manage the digital resilience of your network.

 ►  HOW REDSEAL WORKS | 2:10 
 

 
Measure and actively manage how prepared you are.
With RedSeal’s network modeling and risk scoring platform, you’re able to understand the state of your network, measure digital resilience, verify compliance, and accelerate incident response.
RedSeal determines your RedSeal Digital Resilience Score(TM), a network cyber risk score modeled after a creditworthiness score, so you can accurately measure how prepared you are now and actively manage progress toward where you want to be.
RedSeal is the essential network modeling and risk scoring platform that puts decision-making power right in your hands.
Do you know your Digital Resilience Score? Is it better than yesterday?

Actively manage your digital resilience capabilities.
With your Digital Resilience Score in hand, you can make informed decisions to actively manage your digital resilience capabilities. RedSeal helps you prioritize and allocate your scarce human and capital resources where they have the biggest impact to protect your most valuable digital assets.
RedSeal puts power in decision makers’ hands with the essential cybersecurity platform for building digitally resilient organizations.
