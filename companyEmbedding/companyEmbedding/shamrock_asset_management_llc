Why Shamrock






 



Experienced, Disciplined, Research Driven





At Shamrock, preparation meets opportunity at the crossroads of global markets.
We seek to protect our clients from the dangers of emotion-driven decision-making which has historically resulted in the worst of both worlds for investors: experiencing fully severe bear markets and not capturing enough of a bull market’s advance. Our first priority is preservation of capital and avoiding significant drawdowns with a secondary objective of achieving substantial upside capture by leaning into rising markets.
Keep in mind that volatility matters and large losses can have a greater impact on your long-term returns than large gains. Our approach attempts to protect against large losses and capture gains in rising markets which, we believe, has the potential to deliver more attractive long-term returns than traditional, benchmark-centric approaches.

Shamrock Asset Management Disclosures
The information on this site is not to be construed as investment advice; it is for educational purposes only.
Shamrock Asset Management, LLC (“Shamrock”) is an SEC registered investment adviser headquartered in Dallas with an office located in Boca Raton.
Shamrock and its investment adviser representatives are in compliance with the current filing requirements imposed upon SEC registered investment advisers by those states in which Shamrock maintains clients. Shamrock may only transact business in those states in which it is registered, or qualifies for an exemption or exclusion from registration requirements. Shamrock’s Web site is limited to the dissemination of general information pertaining to its advisory services, together with access to additional investment-related information, publications, and links. Accordingly, the publication of Shamrock’s Web site on the Internet should not be construed by any consumer and/or prospective client as Shamrock’s solicitation to effect, or attempt to effect transactions in securities, or the rendering of personalized investment advice for compensation, over the Internet.
For information pertaining to the registration status of Shamrock, please contact the SEC or the state securities law administrators for those states in which Shamrock maintains a notice filing. Shamrock does not make any representations or warranties as to the accuracy, timeliness, suitability, completeness, or relevance of any information prepared by any unaffiliated third party, whether linked to Shamrock’s Web site or incorporated herein, and takes no responsibility thereto. All such information is provided solely for convenience purposes only and all users thereof should be guided accordingly.
Past performance may not be indicative of future results. Therefore, no current or prospective client should assume that future performance of any specific investment, investment strategy (including the investments and/or investment strategies recommended or undertaken by Shamrock) or product made reference to directly or indirectly by Shamrock on its Web site, or indirectly via a link to an unaffiliated third party Web site, will be profitable or equal the corresponding indicated performance level(s). Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific investment will either be suitable or profitable for a client or prospective client’s investment portfolio. Historical performance results for investment indices and/or categories generally do not reflect the deduction of transaction and/or custodial charges, the deduction of an investment management fee, nor the impact of taxes, the incurrence of which would have the effect of decreasing historical performance results.
Certain portions of Shamrock’s Web site (i.e. newsletters, articles, commentaries, etc.) may contain a discussion of, and/or provide access to, Shamrock’s (and those of other investment and non-investment professionals) positions and/or recommendations as of a specific prior date. This information may have been previously disseminated by Shamrock to its clients or associates. Due to various factors, including changing market conditions, such discussion may no longer be reflective of current position(s) and/or recommendation(s). Moreover, no client or prospective client should assume that any such discussion serves as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized advice from Shamrock, or from any other investment professional. You should not treat any opinion expressed as a specific inducement to make a particular investment or follow a particular strategy.
Shamrock is neither an attorney nor accountant, and no portion of the Web site content should be interpreted as legal, accounting or tax advice. Furthermore, the prospective client is solely responsible for determining whether any investment, security or strategy, or any other product or service, is appropriate or suitable for the prospective client based on the prospective client’s investment objectives and personal and financial situation. The prospective client should consult with an investment professional, or an attorney or tax professional regarding their specific investment, legal or tax situation.
Opinions expressed on this site or in the articles accessible are subject to change without notice and, due to the rapidly changing nature of the security markets, may quickly become outdated. Opinions are based upon information considered reliable, but neither Shamrock nor its affiliates and/or subsidiaries warrant its completeness or accuracy, and it should not be relied upon as such. Although all information presented is believed to be true and accurate at the time of publication, Shamrock is under no obligation to update or correct any information provided on this website.
