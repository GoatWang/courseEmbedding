DragonWave Awarded Product And Services Contract For SmartSky Networks




Ottawa, ON (Marketwired) - DragonWave Inc., (TSX:DRWI)(NASDAQ:DRWI) a global supplier of packet microwave radio systems, announced today that it has been awarded a product supply and installation services contract from SmartSky Networks, a North American 4G LTE inflight service provider.
SmartSky will deploy DragonWave's Harmony Enhanced and Harmony Enhanced MC products to provide high-capacity backhaul for its ground to air 4G LTE network. Harmony Enhanced MC was selected for the high capacity delivered through its 2048QAM and dual channel capabilities. In addition, the high system gain of the Harmony Enhanced MC makes it ideally suited for the long path lengths in the SmartSky network.
"The DragonWave Harmony Enhanced MC product solution offers our desired capacity requirements for SmartSky," said SmartSky Networks Vice President of Services and Architecture Dave Claassen. "Harmony Enhanced MC delivers simple installation, operation and sophisticated remote management, so we are thrilled to partner with them to further enhance SmartSky's capabilities."
SmartSky accomplished the threshold technical and business milestones needed to close a major capital formation step as it recently announced securing its $170 million series B financing. Thus, SmartSky is moving rapidly with the deployment of its coast-to-coast national network to bring users fast, seamless connectivity in the air.
"DragonWave is excited to be working with SmartSky on its innovative high capacity and low latency inflight offering. This application is ideally suited for Harmony Enhanced MC." said DragonWave President and CEO Peter Allen. "We are also proud to be delivering engineering and installation services in support of this network."
