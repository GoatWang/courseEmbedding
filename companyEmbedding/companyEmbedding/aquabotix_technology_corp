Aquabotix Technology Corporation Brief Aquabotix Technology Corporation Luxury Yacht Charter & Superyacht News


Superyacht toy HydroView by Aquabotix launched
May 30, 2012Written by Zuzana Bednarova

The availability of the Aquabotix HydroView has been recently presented by Aquabotix, a marine technology company bringing the accessibility of consumer electronics products to the complex world of underwater video. The Aquabotix HydroView is an affordable as well as easy-to-use remote-operated underwater vehicle that instantly beams a high definition video back to the surface.

Underwater vehicle HydroView - a superyacht toy launched by Aquabotix

 Controlled wirelessly with an iOS tablet, smartphone or any laptop, the HydroView shoots full 1080p HD video and still images, while users intuitively navigate the depths simply by tilting the wireless device and controlling speed and video commands via the touch screen.
For some, the HydroView will be an addictively fun way to enjoy the ocean and see what lies beneath. For others it will offer a valuable tool for underwater inspection of vessels and structures, expand the classroom to view undersea life, or explore the depths during fishing or diving trips.
Complete with on-board LED lights to provide added visibility in low-light conditions, the HydroView travels at up to five knots forward and one knot in reverse while shooting video or capturing still images and simultaneously collecting data on water conditions from up to 150 feet deep. Users can then easily share their experience with friends online or create unique deliverables for student presentations, a take-away for charter guests or first-person inspection reports.
The HydroView communicates wirelessly from the user’s handheld device to the HydroView’s top-side box, which is in-turn connected to the submersible via a cable tether. Aquabotix has plans to diversify the HydroView lineup to include varying vessel specifications and accessory packages, but this initial offering, the HydroView Sport, comes standard with a 75 foot cable and battery pack that powers up to three hours of underwater exploration.
Aquabotix also offers fully customizable cable lengths for added range. Designed as a compact solution for shipboard stowage, the HydroView measures just 14.6x19x7 inches and weighs nine pounds. All components fit easily in to the provided waterproof, hard travel case when not in use.
“Every kid dreams of exploring the oceans but few of us truly experience life under the sea. Now, with the HydroView, if you can operate an iPad you can ply the depths like Jacques Cousteau,” said Durval Tavares, President & CEO of Aquabotix.
“Whether you are a charter boat owner looking to entertain your guests, a commercial captain looking to confirm vessel conditions below the waterline or a first responder looking for a quick and safe way to survey a submerged scene, the HydroView delivers a safe and dry, up-close experience with the underwater world.”
The HydroView Sport costs $3,995.00.
Also available from Aquabotix, the AquaLens employs similar video capabilities as the submersible and is designed to be mounted on the end of a standard boat hook or guide pole, sending live video back to a wrist-mounted LCD screen. MSRP for the AquaLens is $475.00.
Dealers interested in carrying Aquabotix products can contact Michael DeChambeau at michael.dechambeau@aquabotix.com.








Underwater Vehicle HydroView – a new superyacht toy by Aquabotix
February 28, 2012Written by Zuzana Bednarova

HydroView was created by US-based Aquabotix Technology Corporation, which is a privately funded company that develops fun and exciting consumer as well as commercial products for underwater observation and exploration. HydroView is a light-weight, remote operated underwater vehicle with a high definition video camera and LED lights.
 

Aquabotix underwater vehicle HydroView

 
 HydroView gives the possibility to see the underwater world through live video, capture still shots, upload recorded images to social media sites, and navigate through the water using iPad, iPhone, Android phone or laptop.
HydroView is a fun, safe way to see marine life in its natural environment, look for underwater relics or find possessions that fell off a dock or a yacht. The HydroView is a must-have tool for boaters to inspect the bottom of the yacht, check on anchor setting or mooring, and check out underwater environments that may damage one´s watercraft.
HydroView’s design is inspired by nature. The Aquabotix engineers studied the movements of marine life and blended that knowledge with the latest technology in flight. The result? An innovative vehicle that flies in the underwater world.
The HydroView’s sleek design packs sophisticated robotics, built-in energy efficient lights and an HD camera into a submersible vehicle that is the size of a typical backpack. Weighing less than 10 pounds, the HydroView offers the latest technology in an incredibly portable and affordable package.

Your personalized new promotional products will do more than offer people an item that they can use constantly; they will promote your business and remind people that you are just a phone call away.

At National Pen, we have several new promotional products that will impress anyone who receives them. As with all our pens, you can personalize the new promotional products to bear your company's name, the street address, the telephone number and your website address. These pens can even be printed with your logo in full color. Our online tools with a wide selection of colors and fonts makes it easy to customize a new promotional product that will market your brand and help people remember you.

All our custom new promotional products are low priced to easily fit into your advertising budget. They are highly cost-effective, but they are also of extremely high quality. National Pen products are built to last so that they can keep your company's name in your customers' minds. You will always be proud to hand out our personalized pens to promote your company.

Sending your regular customers promotional pens is a great way to remind them that you appreciate their business. Customized products are also good for attracting new clients. If you're going to participate in a trade show, giving away pens would encourage the passers-by to remember your booth and select your services. Any time that you need to market your business at a corporate event, customized pens will be a gift that the recipient can remember. Whether as a giveaway prize or part of a marketing set, new promotional products by National Pen can help set your company apart from the competition.
