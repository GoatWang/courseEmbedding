Our Mission 








Our mission is to address unmet medical needs by developing novel immunotherapies against medically-relevant targets irrespective of their location (i.e. extracellular, intracellular, or membrane-bound antigens) utilizing Sorrento’s unique portfolio of proprietary OnTarget antibody technologies.
Sorrento is an antibody-centric, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of safe and effective immunotherapies for oncology and autoimmune/inflammation diseases. Sorrento’s lead programs consist of four Phase III BioSimilar/BioBetter antibodies, which address an established market of more than $13 billion, and two Phase I CAR-T programs for treatment of solid tumors. Sorrento also is advancing a portfolio of adoptive cellular therapies, immuno-oncology mAbs, and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). Sorrento partnered with City of Hope to form LA Cell subsidiary to focus on developing cell-internalizing mAbs against undruggable intracellular targets.
“We believe our unique portfolio of OnTarget immunotherapies is unrivaled in the industry. It includes intracellular antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as well as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based cellular therapies.”
– CEO Dr. Henry Ji

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
