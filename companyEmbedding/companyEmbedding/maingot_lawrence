Lawrence J. ‘Foo’ Trudeau



Jul 6, 2015

In August of 1946, Lawrence enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he served during the World War II era, until his honorable discharge.  On Sept. 27, 1952. Lawrence was united in marriage to the former Patricia Stone at All Saints Catholic Church and together the couple made their home, raised their family and spent their entire lives together in Gladstone. Lawrence loved his family and friends. He led his life as an example of how to love your neighbor, lend a helping hand, help one another and work hard. He loved to spend time with his family and extended all these wonderful qualities to them.  Lawrence was a member of All Saints Catholic Church in Gladstone and Whitetails Unlimited. He enjoyed going to camp, hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, and water skiing with his notorious Chris Craft boat “Lady Corrine.” He took pride in his family, his yard and his prize geraniums. He will be forever missed by family and friends.
Survivors include: sons, Larry (Cyna) Trudeau of Escanaba, Mich., James Trudeau of Watson, Mich., Paul (Lynn) Trudeau of Gladstone, Mich,: daughters, Chris (Mike) Quinn of Rapid River, Mich., Vickie Shampo of Cornell, Mich., Penny (Mark) West of Gladstone, Mich., Mary (Terry Weaver) Maingot of Tampa, Fla. Also surviving are 15 grandchildren, 21 great-grandchildren and two greats on the way, one great-great-grandchild and numerous nieces, nephews and cousins.
Lawrence was preceded in death by his loving wife Patricia on Dec. 20, 2014; his parents, Edward and Mary; brothers, Joe, Ernest, and Leo Trudeau; sisters,  Jenny Bergeon and Cecile Terrian; sons-in-law, Jim Shampo and Gordon Maingot.
Lawrence’s family will receive friends on Tuesday from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. at the Skradski Funeral Home in Gladstone. Mass of Christian Burial will follow visiting hours at 6 p.m. at All Saint Church in Gladstone with Rev. Fr. Jamie Ziminski officiating.
