Friday’s big news that e-commerce mammoth Amazon is buying specialty grocery Whole Foods Market is being met with optimism by the Triangle entrepreneurs whose products are distributed in its stores.
Whole Foods Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: WFM) is Raleigh flip-flops maker Feelgoodz's largest customer, says CEO Mark Saad. Feelgoodz is on track to sell more than $2 million to the chain in 2017. The footwear and apparel brand made its debut at Whole Foods in 2009 and is now in all of its retail locations. Saad is optimistic about the deal, having seen “solid growth” each year at the chain. “We’re excited about this development,” he says in an email Friday, adding that, from what he understands, the Whole Foods brand will remain as is “and they will continue to bring in trusted vendors like Feelgoodz.”

He says the deal should allow Whole Foods to grow “rapidly,” helping the chain realize a goal of 1,200-plus locations nationwide in the next five years. He hopes that means more shelf space for Feelgoodz.
Tatiana Birgisson, CEO of Mati Energy, brewed her first energy tea batches in a Duke University dorm room. Today, cans are being sold at multiple retailers– including at Whole Foods.
Birgisson is traveling abroad and heard about the buy in a text from her fiancé. In an email, she says, “I do hope to see [Whole Foods] lean more heavily into data-driven decisions if the acquisition goes through.”
Patrick Mateer, CEO of Chapel Hill-based Seal the Seasons, which offers frozen local produce to retailers– including 33 Whole Foods locations, says he heard about the news Friday morning. “My phone blew up with texts from everyone, the mood seems excited and positive, yet uncertain – this is new territory,” he says in an email.
He hasn’t heard anything from Whole Foods, but is optimistic about the deal outcome as “both organizations could learn a lot from each other and create a better food distribution system as a result of this merge.”





 


Neal McTighe, the Raleigh entrepreneur behind Nellino’s Sauce Company, says he was also surprised to learn of the pending buyout of his retail partner.
“My gut reaction is a positive one, as I believe that [Whole Foods] will be able to capitalize on many of the strengths that Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) presents: whether it is improving grocery delivery, offering prepared meals delivery, or putting into place much needed supply chain improvements,” he says in an email.
Adrian Larrea, whose Raleigh kombucha startup Tribucha just secured a wider, Southeast distribution with Whole Foods, predicts the deal bodes well for his firm. Tribucha’s first large-scale manufacturing batches will be canned next week in time for a wider Whole Foods launch July 1. A former tech entrepreneur, Larrea points to Amazon’s “incredible resources” as assets, from Amazon Prime Now to Alexa.
“And one of the things we’re doing as a brewery is our goal to bring the prices down of high quality products,” he says. “That’s what Amazon is all about, so we’re already coming in low compared to all the other kombucha companies out there, even though there are a lot that are bigger than us.”
Initially, the wider distribution deal has 70 percent of Tribucha’s sales targeted at Whole Foods – but that’s now. Other distribution deals are in the works that will diversify that mix.
