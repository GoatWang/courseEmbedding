CROE, INC.

The Company

CROE, INC. is a developmental stage fitness apparel company with the  mission of creating the most supportive, protective, innovative sports bras and  fitness apparel on the market.  We were  incorporated on December 2, 2013.  Our  logo is FEARLESS DETERMINATION.  We hope to inspire people to fearlessly  create the life they want to live.  To be determined to live a strong,  healthy lifestyle through exercising, eating healthy, and setting goals.CROE  has been organized as a Utah corporation.   Our business office and mailing address is 11650 South State Street,  Suite 240, Draper, Utah 84020.  Our  telephone number is (801) 816-2522.
The Athletic  Apparel Industry
  The national athletic apparel  market continues to dominate the U.S. retail segment of the economy. According  to the New York Times, athletic and sports footwear made up about $21 billion  dollars of the $63 billion dollar sporting goods market in 2015.  Internationally, sports apparel and footwear sales have jumped 42% to $270  billion over the past seven years.  

  According to a new report by  Allied Market Research titled, "World Sports Apparel - Market  Opportunities and Forecasts, 2014-2020", the world sports apparel market  is expected to generate revenue of $184.6 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of  4.3% during the forecast period, 2015-2020. Growing health awareness,  increasing disposable income and a surge in female participation in sports are  the major factors driving the growth of the world sports apparels market.
  The sports apparel market is  categorized, based on end users, into apparels for men, women and kids. The men  segment dominates the world sports apparel market, constituting around 52% of  the total market revenue. The women segment is the second biggest contributor,  expected to grow at a relatively higher CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast  period, on account of the growing interest and participation of women in  different sports activities.

  Due to the extreme growth in  athletic apparel, a significant number of start-ups are getting into the  business.  However, most lack the  relationships, experience and resources to be successful. One of the most  daunting challenges any company faces is being able to manufacture, produce and  effectively market their products for their product sales initiatives. We believe  that CROE has the relationships, experience, and resources to do just that.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares by the

Competitive pressures in our markets could adversely affect our competitive
position, leading to a possible loss of customers or a decrease in prices,
either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits. Our competitors
are numerous, ranging from large multinational corporations, which have
significantly greater capital resources than us, to relatively small and
specialized firms. We also compete with the major manufacturers. Our business
could be adversely affected because of increased competition from these athletic
apparel companies.
---

The fitness apparel industry is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Our
ability to compete depends upon many factors within and outside our control,
including the timely development and introduction of our fitness clothing and
its enhancements, its functionality, performance, reliability, customer service
and support and marketing efforts. Due to the relatively low barriers to entry
in the textiles market, we expect additional competition from other emerging
companies. Many of our existing and potential competitors are substantially
larger than us and have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing
resources. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to fashion
changes and have greater resources for the development and promotion of their
products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully
against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not have
a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition.


Company Description
We were incorporated in the state of Utah on December 2, 2013, to engage in the
development and sale of women's fitness clothing.
---

Our operations to date have been devoted primarily to start-up and development
activities, which include: (i) formation of the Company; (ii) development of


 our
business plan; (iii) development of our water and radio-wave resistant sports
bra pocket ("CroeNest") and other fitness apparel; (iv) development of our
brand; (v) and marketing and sales of Croe hats and jewelry. We have not
completed development of our CroeNest and apparel and there is no assurance that
we will be successful in completing the development.

We are developing a pocket, or CroeNest, to hold your phone while you are
exercising or going about your daily activities. This is the hallmark product
of our company. The CroeNest has been developed with a radiation repellent
material that blocks the 99.9% of the radiation and radiowave.

We have found skin compatible fabrics for radio frequency shielding (cellphones
and cell tower radiation, cordless phones, wi-fi, radar, microwave oven leakage,
TV broadcast etc). Extremely thin silver coated copper wires are spun with
cotton or polyester yarns, then woven into washable, comfortable, and durable
fabrics with the look and feel of normal fabric.

The fabrics we are testing materials to use for the CroeNest have the following
characteristics:

· ecological cotton fabric without chemicals

· contain no harmful substances

· independently tested for shielding performance

· non-conductive surface

· no grounding needed

· translucent

· unbleached ecological cotton fabric

· extremely wide format (8.2 feet wide)

· washable, easy to iron, cut and sew

Technical data

· raw materials: 82% cotton, 17% copper, 1% silver

· attenuation: 38 dB at 1 GHz

· color: Ecru-White

· weight: 69 g/m²

· dimension stability: 3 %

We have also found a light weight water resistant material to add to our
CroeNest to keep your phone dry while you sweat.The finalization of the CroeNest
does not require any more capital to develop. It will require additional capital
to incorporate the CroeNest into the design of our sports bras and other
products.

We have developed six different prototypes of sportsbras with the CroeNest. We
have tested our sports bras by having friends and family wear the bras while
exercising three times a week, washing the bras after every use, testing the
durability of the CroeNest material with a radio sensor device, and getting
feedback. The feedback has included, comfort level, accessibility of the cell
phone while working-out, water resistant satisfaction, and durability. We are
satisfied with the CroeNest exactly as we have developed it. We are still trying
to find the proper materials and manufacturer for the other parts of our
sportsbras, shorts, and yoga pants.

We plan to develop our Croe brand to be functional and protective. Our team
plans to develop a product that every runner, cyclist and active person may
want.  

Our plan for bringing this product to the national and international retail
distribution market is five-fold:

· Acquire investment capital to design and manufacture our fitness apparel.

· Create a systematic, duplicable process within our business for inventory      
  management and order fulfillment.                                              

· Utilize an aggressive marketing platform including sales team, social media,   
  trade shows, athletic events and sponsored events to drive a product demand; as
  well as any publicity resulting from our philanthropic endeavors.              

· Penetrate the U.S. market.

· Penetrate the international market, beginning with Canada, Australia and the   
  UK. Once established in these markets, we have goals to expand into Europe,    
  South America, South Africa, and Southeast Asia.                               

Consistent with Croe’s philosophy of encouraging individuals to pursue their
passions, the company is dedicated to supporting and promoting causes in the
areas of health, education, and athletics. With the resources acquired through
business expansion, Croe is committed to assisting individuals and communities
achieve a higher quality of life through these three areas.

To secure the future of our brand, Croe will continue investing in its 
leadership marketing team and strategic partners to develop and further the
business.  Insisting upon evolving with the ever-changing trends of the
marketplace, our goal is to always utilize the necessary assets for brand growth
and sustainability.  We aim to capitalize on the same opportunities that enable
our competitors to thrive and to surpass them through the universal appeal of
our philosophy and vision.

Our revenue thus far has been created by the sale of accessories including hats
and jewelry with our Croe brand and logo. We plan to continue producing these
items, but our main focus will be to get our sports bras through design and into
production.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
