Welcome to the 2016 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for AgroFresh Solutions. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
The comments during today’s call and the accompanying presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts are considered forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs as well as a number of assumptions concerning future events. Such forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Some of these risks and uncertainties are identified and discussed in the company’s filings with the SEC.
In addition, during the course of this call, we will be presenting quarterly results under the assumption that AgroFresh has been operating as an independent public company in the first seven months of 2015, which you will see in the tables in the press release and in the 10-Q being referred to as part of the predecessor period, because AgroFresh was not an independent company in the predecessor period, amounts pertaining to the predecessor period are not comparable to the first seven months of 2016 referred to as part of the successor period when AgroFresh was operating as an independent company.
In such instances, we will provide a comparative context to assist with the analysis of year-over-year results. We’ll also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the table’s attached to the slides that accompany this presentation, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Trevor, our member of the AgroFresh Board of Directors and Former Co-Acting Chief Executive Officer.
Stephen Trevor
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I’m joined today by our new leadership team, Jordi Ferre, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Harper, our Chief Financial Officer. Nance Dicciani and I have been impressed by the immediate impact both have made on the organization in one short month and look forward as Board members to supporting both of them as they help AgroFresh to realize its full potential.
Over the last seven months, Nance and I approached our job as Interim Co-CEOs with a sense of urgency and a great deal of change has been instituted in the organization to begin the necessary work to meet our commitment to growth. If you refer Slide 3, we’ve done well on a number of fronts. But in the face of increased competition for our flagship product, we needed to make a strategic balancing decision.
First, to ensure pricing that reflected our leadership position, while acknowledging a competitive dynamic. And second, to maintain market share and customer relationships for the long-term, as we expand our offerings to our significant customer base. Nance and I wanted to take the responsibility to address these issues specifically, as these choices were made on our watch.

As we announced this morning, our estimation is now that we will not be able to make a prior full-year guidance for either revenue or adjusted EBITDA. The principal reasons for this are shown on Slide 4.
First, when we reported our first-half results despite the smaller than expected apple crop harvest in the Southern Hemisphere, we remain confident about our full-year guidance, because all external sources pointed to a significantly larger harvest in the all important U.S. market. However, while the U.S. apple harvest this year appears to be up versus the harvest in 2015, it is now projected to be a 3% increase versus the previously forecasted gain of a 11%.
Second, as I just mentioned, we experienced greater than anticipated competitive pricing pressure and decided to adjust price in order to maintain our market leadership and customer relationships for the longer-term, all while still commanding a premium price. On the positive side, as we expected, we maintained our 90%-plus share of the market for treated apples with our highest share position still in the U.S.
Third, we fell short of our original projections on the adoption of Harvista. Although, we have seen 50% growth in Harvista applications this year, treating about 30,000 acres in the first nine months of 2016, this fall short of our expectations to treat 40,000 acres. We’ve gained significant experience with the product this year in terms of how and when it works best. How it is valued by customers and what varieties of apples and pears it is optimized. And we continue to believe, Harvista will grow as a percentage of our revenue mix.
Turning to Slide 5. As I mentioned, the U.S. crop is forecasted to be up 11% at the time of our last earnings call. Ever since then, expectations for the U.S. harvest have dropped to year-over-year growth of just 3%, while the European crop outlook has remained consistent with previous forecasts.
In summary, we now anticipate that full-year revenue will be between $160 million and $165 million and 2016 adjusted EBITDA will be between $77 million and $82 million. This is certainly not the situation we want to hand over to new management. That said, Jordi and Kathy have taken these challenges on with new thinking and dynamic leadership.
Nance and I are confident that they can lead the organization through these short-term competitive challenges and make the necessary corrections to achieve our longer-term growth objectives.
I’ll turn the call over to them now to talk about these growth challenges, as well as more specifics on the third quarter. Most important, they’re taking on the leadership of the company that is far stronger than it was at this point a year ago and one where the groundwork has been laid for long-term success even in the face of short-term issues.
I’d now like to introduce Jordi Ferre, the new CEO of AgroFresh.
Jordi Ferre
Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I’m delighted to be here with you as a new CEO of AgroFresh. Even as we face some immediate challenges to the business, I see untapped opportunities to generate new revenue sources and accelerate our product diversification.
Please turn to Slide 6. Kathy will provide a detailed walk through of our third quarter results. But let me provide you with a high-level summary. Revenue for the third quarter was $61.2 million, roughly flat versus the third of 2015 revenue of $61.8 million.
As Steve said, we took proactive steps to defend our leading position in the face of increased competition and protect this business for the longer-term. While we adjusted our price in the U.S., we believe that we were able to continue to command a premium price due to our superior value proposition as a leading solutions provider in the post-harvest space.

From adjusted EBITDA perspective, we were down versus the third quarter of 2015. Kathy will provide more details on EBITDA in her section. As Steve has just explained, in 2016, we have seen an increase in competitive activity that affected the pricing dynamics for SmartFresh. Stepping back from the decision made this year, it’s clear that the AgroFresh organization has operated largely in a world with limited competition. We now need to adapt quickly to the new reality, the smarter and more aggressive competitive strategies.
Let me explain on this concept as shown on Slide 7. My initial assessment is that as market leaders, we need to reinforce our go-to-market strategy by increasing our service platform that is the breadth of the offerings we have in our toolkit and bring more value to our customers that bills off the SmartFresh franchise. Services are already underway to conduct an advanced customer segmentation and find new ways to tailor our offerings in order to best meet the needs of each segment of customs.
Having been at the company for five weeks now, I’m encouraged by many of the things I see at AgroFresh. We have untapped value in several forms.
First, we have industry-leading knowledge, technical expertise, and know-how of plant physiology that we are not converting into revenue streams to-date. We have over 400 granted patents and 500 pending patent applications globally.
A significant part of our workforce is employed in research and development activities, and R&D spending is 10% of our revenue, a ratio that is double the average for companies in the U.S. We have over 400 active product registrations for different crops in different geographies.
And although, many are in use to-date, over 80% of our revenue is still derived from one crop. I have challenged the team to immediately identify opportunities to expand our revenue base in ways that can contribute meaningfully and quickly to earnings growth.
Second, we have not fully leveraged our relationship network with over 3,000 customers worldwide in terms of our ability to provide them with a broader array of products and services. And this customers are not distributors or agents, but end customers with whom we maintain a direct relationship and from whom we derive over 90% of our revenue.
We operate a sophisticated service model with a truly global reach, selling directly in over 40 countries. We can do better than just offer them one or two product choices and we’re actively scoring for those opportunities with our customers input.
Third, I could see immediately that we should be pursuing opportunities to partner with other parties, which would allow us to tap our technical and commercial value faster and diversify quickly into different applications and products.
And finally, we intend to work on optimizing our cost base. During 2017, we will work towards streamlining the company’s cost structure, focusing our spending on initiatives that we believe will produce the best return for the organization. Growth and innovations will be our guiding principles, but we still believe, we can do this in a much more efficient way.
Turning to Slide 8, I’m taking the lead on this personally and I see three immediate routes for us to pursue. The first is commercial and distribution agreements. We’re identifying a list of potential target products and services in the post-harvest space, where we can add value by providing a direct customer reach and technical expertise. This makes AgroFresh appealing to manufacturers, as they prefer go-to-market route.
The second is R&D development agreements. We can develop new and meaningful technologies who partnerships to coin this, bring to commercial scale, and pick to market more quickly and more broadly now we are currently doing on our own.

The third is commercial partnerships into new channels. We have already begun the process to identify and discuss with various potential partners about leveraging our technology into other channels, including pre-harvest, but also distribution, retail, and even consumer channels.
Turning to Slide 9. Now that I have outlined our plan for the future. I will provide an update about the progress this year to diversify our business. Let me first highlight that we plan to start reporting base business defined as SmartFresh post-harvest sales into the global apple market excluding Asia and pipeline opportunities, which include providing product offerings to other crops outside the core apple market, growth in our existing product portfolio other than SmartFresh, including Harvista, LandSpring and RipeLock and the development of new products and services and delivery methods that allow us to increase our presence throughout the value chain.
Apples are very important, but other crops make up 16% of our business today with pears being the next largest contributor at 7%. While diversification into new products and crops is important, protecting our base is equally important. It is this strong base from which we will build our diversification strategy. We will provide you more context on this and how it pertains to 2017 at a later date.
Please turn to Slide 10. I will address our base business performance. Again, we define base business as SmartFresh sales into the global apple crop, excluding Asia. The performance metrics shown in this slide include external factors, size of crop, and size of crop being stored, as well as percentage penetration of 1-MCP post-harvest treatments over total crop and estimated share of our SmartFresh product. In 2016, we project another share loss, which will be partially offset by an increasing penetration of global apple crop treated with 1-MCP.
Turning to Slide 11. Beyond our SmartFresh base business, the company’s fastest-growing product offering is Harvista, which was launched in 2011 as our first foray into the pre-harvest segment. This is a product that we believe provides benefits in quality and yield that will transform the market, thus providing meaningful growth opportunities both in apples, as well as other crops.
This season we treated 30,000 acres with Harvista, a 50% increase over 2015. We had a goal of treating up to 40,000 acres. But after a strong start in Argentina in the first-half of the year, our penetration in North America was below expectations. Additionally, shortfalls in Harvista sales in Turkey were the result of uncertainty associated with political unrest that occurred during the start of the apple season. We continue to see growth in Harvista moving forward and we will seek to accelerate that growth.
Please turn to Slide 12. We are also very excited about our other new product offerings. RipeLock continues to perform well in various tests we’re conducting in collaboration with retailers in the U.S. and Europe. Landspring has achieved its first commercial sales in the fourth quarter, although small.
AdvanStore is to become part of the SmartFresh quality system, we treated about 5,000 rooms this year and see this product is an important differentiator for us. We expect this products to make meaningful contributions to revenue growth, but the timeframe will be longer, given the regulatory approval processes require to expand our current geographic scope. This product also represent important steps to diversify our crop base into some of the largest markets and high-value fruits worldwide.
Please turn to Slide 13. I would like to finish with our growth metrics that summarizes our business model. We are targeting to become the global leader in the food quality preservation and waste reduction space. This includes providing proprietary quality systems that include advanced technologies such as SmartFresh or Harvista supported with data-driven solutions.

Our mission is to enable every step of the supply chain to maximize the percentage of products supplied to the market relative to the amount of products grown, as well as increase consumer appeal of products on retail. Every one of our current and future offerings addresses the specific products and supply chain segment, which business opportunity will be properly quantified.
With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Kathy for a more robust discussion of our financial results.
Katherine Harper
Thank you, Jordi, and good morning. I feel very excited to be here and look forward to working with, Jordi, and all of you to bring transparency and clarity to AgroFresh’s result.
Please turn to Slide 14. I’ll first walk you through the third quarter financial results then provide some comments on the balance sheet and cash flow. As Steve mentioned, revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was flat versus the prior year third quarter. SmartFresh gains in Asia and EMEA region in addition to Harvista growth in North America were offset by SmartFresh declines in North America. The impact of currency on sales was negligible in the third quarter of 2016 versus the same period in 2015, our largest exposure is to the euro.
Operating gross profit as a percentage of sales was 85% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 88% in the third quarter of 2015. The decline was driven by the mix impact of Harvista and lower average SmartFresh prices in the U.S.
AgroFresh posted net income of $7.3 million and EBITDA of $36.8 million for the third quarter 2016, flat as compared to last year’s third quarter’s EBITDA. Free cash flow was used in the quarter of $15 million with seasonal increases in working capital. On a year-to-date date basis, free cash flow improved $13 million over the first nine months of 2015. I have more detail on that in a subsequent slide.
Moving to Slide 15, I have a few comments on operating costs. R&D expenses were flat in the third quarter of 2016 versus the third quarter of 2015, as G&A expenses were up slightly in the quarter versus 2015. Increased severance and litigation-related expenses were offset by lower consulting costs. We still expect our SG&A costs to be in the range of approximately $11 per quarter starting in 2017.
On Slide 16, here you will find a bridge between GAAP net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. Jordi and I view EBITDA as the key measure to evaluate our earnings performance. Previously AgroFresh used adjusted EBITDA as our key earnings measure consistent with the definition of consolidated EBITDA in our credit agreement. We believe the change to EBITDA will prove the transparency of the business, increase the comparability of our results, and focus the AgroFresh team on improving the results.
I’m committed to continually improving transparency of our financial results for investors. Please note, we appreciate that changing isn’t always easy. We included a slide in the deck and a table at the end of the press release that walks through the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures. We also intend to furnish this information when we do our fourth quarter call, as well as furnish the same level of transparency for prior quarters shortly after this call.
Beginning with net income in the third quarter of 2016, we add back income taxes, inventory step-up amortization, depreciation and amortization, and interest expense to arrive at an EBITDA of $36.8 million for the quarter, which is slightly higher than the third quarter of 2015 of $36.1 million.
The increase was driven by non-cash accounting gains in the current year quarter and charges in the prior year quarter, mostly offset by impact of lower operating gross margin. The comment on interest expense. You may recall the borrowing that was put in place at the end of July of 2015. So for 2016, there are three months of interest expense in our third quarter results versus just two months of interest expense in the third quarter of 2015. The balance of the reconciliation details the adjustments allowed by the credit agreement, including nonrecurring charges, mark-to-market adjustments, severance and gain, loss on currency.

Please turn to Slide 17, for a discussion of free cash flow. Here we will walk from EBITDA to free cash flow. Similar to EBITDA, we are also changing to a more traditional free cash flow methodology. The cash flow slide shows both the quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Given the seasonality of the business, let’s look at the year-to-date cash flow results.
Starting with the EBITDA of $35.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, we add back non-cash stock-based compensation charges of $3.2 million. We paid $18.5 million of cash interest on our credit facility year-to-date in 2016. Interest expense on the profit and loss statement was $43.9 million in the first nine months of 2016. The difference between income statement and cash interest expense relates primarily to accretion on the fair value of contingent considerations of the Dow, which are recorded in liabilities.
We paid $2.5 million in cash taxes for certain U.S., state and foreign jurisdictions in the first nine months of 2016. We had a net increase in working capital and other of $21.5 million year-to-date in 2016, driven by higher prepaid expenses of $18 million associated with recoverable of that payment and higher accounts receivable of $8.5 million resulting from the seasonality of the business.
Receivables typically grown throughout the second-half of each year, as we’ve historically recognized approximately 70% to 75% of our annual revenue associated within the Northern Hemisphere crop. Accounts receivable then traditionally decreased about the first-half of the following year, as well as Northern Hemisphere receivables are collected.
Additionally, prepaid a component of other current assets grow as we accumulate that billings that are recoverable in the coming quarters. Working capital and other improved substantially versus the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In 2015, the company added significant assets and liabilities related to taxes that were not on the balance sheet, one of the business unit of Dow.
We had capital expenditures of $5.4 million in the first nine months of 2016, with more than $2 million invested in harvest disbursed that facilitated the growth we saw in this product. Thus free cash flow was a use of $10.5 million in the first nine months of 2016, a $13 million improvement over 2015.
Turning to Slide 18. Cash flow is truly the hallmark of AgroFresh with high margins and an asset-light business model. This company can expect to generate significant free cash flow each year. While some of that cash will be used in our early years, as we build out the business, you can expect that we will prudently put this cash to work to fund our R&D, provide returns to investors, and continue to evaluate accretive business development opportunities.
Turning to the balance sheet. We closed the period with liquidity of $70 million and nearly $45 million of cash on hand. Our debt maturity profile reflects the fact that the term loan doesn’t mature until 2021 and only requires 1% annual principal repayment. This is a moment of transition for AgroFresh, as Jordi and I step in. We’re committed to delivering on the great potential AgroFresh has to unlock. And we hope some of the changes you’ve seen today demonstrate our commitment to transparency and clarity in the AgroFresh results.
I’d now like to turn the call back over to Jordi for a discussion of our strategic priorities and some closing thoughts before we begin the Q&A.
Jordi Ferre
Thanks, Kathy. Although, there are short-term challenges that we will need to navigate. This company has many strengths and on top of the potential, including industry-leading knowledge, technical expertise, and know-how of plant physiology, our relationship network with over 3,000 direct customers worldwide, sophisticated service model with a truly global reach selling directly in over 401 countries.

We will use these strengths to capitalize on growth opportunities; diversify our revenue with new products, crops and geographies; R&D are taking a more commercially driven approach; partnerships and M&A need to be accretive in the short run. We’re on our way to becoming the company we set out to be. But there will be a lot of hard work required before we get there.
I’d like to thank Steve and Nance for their stewardship of the organization prior to my joining and look forward to working with them on the Board. In closing, Kathy and I couldn’t be more excited to be here and look forward to this journey with all of you.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Jester
Hi, good morning, everyone. So previously there had been a goal that new products like Harvista way cumulatively had about $140 million of revenue over the coming five years. Having stepped in, Jordi and look at the company, can you just give us your initial thoughts about how achievable growth is from some of these new products and any sort of initial expectations for how you’re thinking about growing that away from the base business?
Jordi Ferre
Yes. Thank you for the question. The first thing I’d like to say is clearly as my five weeks here, I can tell you that the potential is there. So those numbers were build, the potential is there. What we have to see is, how we’re going to get there? And I think if you’ve seen through my presentation, the message I try to convey is, we will take the strategies and make the decisions that are going to best get to that growth.
So when I lay out potential partnerships or other ways to go-to-market, the only goal for that is to actually get to that growth. So as I’m sitting here, the potential is there. I will always – we will be updating more about all the progress we are making towards that. But the potential is definitely there, so it’s going to be up to me and the new management team on how to really get those things pass that into it. So, yes, my general answer is positive on that sense.
Daniel Jester
Okay. Thank you. And then, for Harvista in the U.S. specifically, is there are any color that you can provide with regards to why it penetrated slower than you had expected? And as you talk to your U.S. customers, how are they thinking about their cost structure? I know that labor cost has been an issue in the past and it seems like labor costs could be an issue in the future. So I’m just wondering what you’re hearing from them about those two topics as well?
Jordi Ferre
Okay. So thanks for that question as well. I think the first part of your question was about Harvista. I think, as we see, we missed the projection that we have. But we actually still grew 50%. And when you grow 50% definitely is value there in that product. Where we missed it was, there was a particular variety of apples, where we believe that we will learn a lot this year and we have to adjust the value proposition into next year.
So I think that generally speaking the message on Harvista is going to be positive in the sense that where the outlook is, because as I said we will learn about some of the adjustments we need to make and we will those adjustments, and I’m going to be very personally involved in those.
So that’s number one. Number two, on the second part of it, I cannot comment too much. I have – actually have initial discussions with customers on this particular case and about the labor costs, it’s going to be one that I’m going to get into it. But I can’t really comment specifically at this point.

Daniel Jester
Okay. And then one last one from me and then I’ll jump back in the queue. With regards to SmartFresh, your encapsulation patent, in the U.S. expires in 2018. So given the pricing competition that you saw this year, how should we be thinking about the potential opportunities and risks that presents over the next couple of years? Thanks.
Jordi Ferre
Obviously, I’m not going to be naive here. And I want to say that competition, we see competition obviously increasing today and in the future as well. But I think that what we need to do is be much a lot more competitive what we do. We have to think a different approach on how we actually go about our offering, our knowledge, our service levels is on parallel, nobody can even get close to what we do, which is nice to say. What we need to make sure is that we actually are able to actually extract that value moving forward.
And you know there is a difference that approach here that we’re going to take and that approach is going to be about reinforcing our service model. We will be focusing more on overall quality systems rather than focusing on the individual solutions. That would include also adding other solutions that may not be a focus today, but they could be out there. And I think that we can add that in terms of becoming a more complete service provider.
We also think that we can – also thinking about customers offer some agreements ahead of the harvest season, which I think that are going to be meant to share some of the risk that can come associated with the crop and the actual back out of apples. And third, it will always be those customers that may just not appreciate the level of service and that’s fine. We will not provide service. We will just provide a very low price or more adjusted price offering.
I also want to say though that, although, you mentioned about the patent expiration, let’s not kid ourselves. We already have based on competition in some markets. So we are not completely coming out of this with low competition. But as I said, you have to be a lot more smarter. You have to change the approach and I’m personally going to be taking the lead of this. I’m going to be driving this very personally.
Daniel Jester
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nolan with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nolan
Hi, guys, I got a couple of questions. I can hop back in line if I get too long-winded. First of all, I’m interested in about your guidance update. You guys had an Investor Presentation post the Apple Conference – the Apple Marketing. Conference, and that was when the information came out that the U.S. apple crop is only going to be plus 3%, but you just change your estimates now. So I was wondering as to the timing of that, can you explain that?
Jordi Ferre
I will pass that question over to Steven.
Stephen Trevor
Sure. So, let me just share you a little bit about sort of the timing of our business and the timing of the harvest, so hopefully, we’ll give you a little clarity on that. And as you probably know, our harvest actually began in the Northern Hemisphere in August and it goes through November. And so one of the things we’ve been doing is aggregating third-party information to try to provide the best data series that we can understand if there’s no public information about some of the end market that we serve.
And in addition what we do, of course, is we talk regularly to customers. So in the middle part of September, we were actually out receiving some updates in terms of a third-party crop estimates, but also hearing from customers. At that time essentially, our customers were telling us that the crop was bigger than some of the data is here. And so, as we kind of came into the month of September and October, we had customers who had reviewed overall. We had some data and we’re watching it all very closely.

As we sit here in November towards the end of the harvest, it’s clear to us that the earlier more optimistic view of the goal that we intend to deal with these things, it ranges advance, and our ability was that – at this point, we have to come to the conclusion that crop in order comes into your perspective is lower than we were.
Brian Nolan
Okay. Thank you. And can you breakout Harvista as a percentage of revenues for this year and last year?
Stephen Trevor
Yes, I mean– so let me see if I can help a little bit with that. So Harvista is a product, we said, it’s somewhere between 5% and 10% of our sales on a consolidated basis. And so despite our Harvista sales being bit lower, we’re still in that range for calendar 2016. And as Jordi highlighted, this is a product that we will still at the beginning of its growth curve, it’s growing nicely this year. So we will continue to work at band as we unfold, but we expect it to be a bigger percentage of sales in years ahead.
Brian Nolan
Okay. And just two more quick questions, I think. First of all, TruPick, it doesn’t sound like it was even registered for this harvest season in the United States. So why did you take a kind of preemptive decision to cut pricing?
Jordi Ferre
Steve, I think I would like some…
Stephen Trevor
So let me just talk a little bit in kind of a competitive framework, because you’re asking about TruPick that we probably also should talk about the pieces of technology. So – and there are different competitive frameworks that we operated in around the world. And so, again, just to remind you historically more than a quarter of our business never had any patent protection. In some of those markets, we have existing competitors. So Argentina would be an example of that that we’ve shared with you in the past, where we had competition. We saw the leading market share. We saw very attractive margins.
But just the competition is not new to us, and the fact that we have pace of the potential competitor here something we’ve also been working on for last several years. They essentially created a new delivery mechanism that does something similar, not the same to what we do and they have been working with our customer base and so far have been some share, but that sort of single-digit amounts of total share. So they’re an important competitor, but somebody you hasn’t really gained significant share of the market as of now.
The specific question you asked though was about a new competitor in the form of a company called The Dow [ph]. They’ve announced a new product that product will be in the market at this point. And so it’s too easy to say what their particular impact on the market is more of a 2017.
Brian Nolan
Okay. One final question before I hop in the queue, I guess. You guys mentioned in the Investor Presentation that there’s no financial maintenance covenants on the term loan. Is that an amended situation, because I think I remember from the original credit agreement that there was a 4.75 times senior secured leverage ratio on the term loan, am I mistaken?
Katherine Harper
That’s on the revolver, not on the…
Brian Nolan
That’s on the revolver. Okay, understood. All right. Thank you, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Rystrom with Feltl and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Brent Rystrom
Yes, thank you. Just based on your comments earlier, how do we think about pricing for Harvista next year?
Jordi Ferre
Well, on Harvista itself, we do not see any major variation at all on Harvista pricing that’s the way we’ll look at it.
Brent Rystrom
All right. And then constructively at this point, how would you think about growth next year? Is the 50% an aberration and you expect faster growth, as you get better really in that product out, or is there a similar growth rate next year, how do you think Harvista will grow next year?

Jordi Ferre
I think we will, at least, getting that, having the same type of growth we have seen this year, at least.
Brent Rystrom
And then any updates on the thought? And I apologize, I haven’t looked at this in the few weeks, but on the two-year EBITDA performance kind of bonus to Dow. Have you guys updated your thoughts on that?
Jordi Ferre
I think I would prefer that Steve takes on that question.
Stephen Trevor
So let me just, again, kind of share a little bit of context. So as part of the initial transaction, there was an opportunity for Dow to get paid an additional $50 million if the business hit several years of an EBITDA target. And we – those two years are calendar 2016 and 2017, respectively.
So it’s too soon for us to say anything definitive in terms of whether the company will or won’t be in a position to make any further payments to Dow on that metric. We’re – for 2016, we’re definitely below, where that metric would – we need to believe that that’s going to happen, but it’s just a 2018 issue and it’s too soon to be commenting about G&A any specific manner.
Brent Rystrom
And then just final quick question. Jordi, you had mentioned the new markets, possibly new products, joint venture, or what have you, yes, are there a couple of spaces that you would target when you look outside of apples, outside of pears, looking at what you guys have announced with your entry into the great market in a few years? Where would be the couple of places that your placing your greatest hope as far as growth opportunities in other products?
Jordi Ferre
Yes, I understand. Your question is about crops, or not necessarily crops. But I think in crops, we do see obviously there’s still potential within apples, but we do see that in grapes. We do see that in other actually products like mangos. We do see that in other places where we will actually force our Southern Hemisphere. And I think that we will actually be going further on to a number of things that I can’t talk at this point in time. But we also have a number of work that we’ve done in the past that I’m going to make sure that that actually gets into the market through the best route to actually giving the opportunity.
In other words, other than the other fruits, bananas, apples, pears, mangos, et cetera that we see an opportunity in grapes. There is opportunities as well that we see in other crops. Additionally, let’s not forget and that’s what I put the growth metrics. There’s not always the growth potentially in terms of crops. There’s also the growth potentially into different parts of the supply chain.
We have a product at Landspring that actually goes into the nursery and grow aside on average like tomatoes. We also have RipeLock, which actually goes to the end of the supply chain towards the consumer and retailer that’s actually to-date in bananas, but could be expanded.
So again, we will talk about crops, no doubt, but we also will talk about different areas of the supply chain, which we will need to provide the right solutions. And that’s where I tied into my comment of our partnerships and distributions. I’m not necessarily married and fighting to-go-to market to my standard way to go-to-market. I will find the best way to go-to-market and make sure that these technologies and products, I give an opportunity earlier, faster, and more efficient.
Brent Rystrom
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nolan with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nolan Chase & Co.
Hi, guys. So, just a couple of follow-up questions. One of the things that we’ve never really gone much color on previously is where some of your geographical breakout is for revenue in Europe. Can you talk about where your biggest markets are there? Where your biggest sales exposure is?

Jordi Ferre
I think if I may say, because our sales are more dependent today on apples. And by the way, our index on pears is quite large in Europe. I would say that, obviously, logically, our largest markets are those that have the largest reduction of apples and pears. There’s no secret, our largest market in Europe is Italy. And then we have a number of markets that are quite well distributed in terms of the way they have, include France, Spain, Netherlands, Germany, and then we have other markets obviously like Turkey and Poland that are also added there.
So, I would say that, Italy is definitely our main market today. But the rest of the markets are quite spread. There’s not one market that’s greater and not bumping on the rest, it’s quite well spread into another markets that we sell.
Brian Nolan
Okay. And I saw one of the updates in terms of geographies is, it looks like you’re making a more concerted push into China now. Is there a reason that – it’s seems like they’re the largest apple market in the world. Is there a reason that this is a growth market for you now and not a focus historically?
Jordi Ferre
I think that China is definitely – if you look at statistics, is the largest market in the world for apple production, no doubt about it. Now, having said that, they’re also an evolving market. So it’s a market that you do not have the same structure that you have in Europe today, or you have in the U.S. in terms of more organized, better more sophisticated supply chain.
So you have a lot of smallholders and you have a myriad and network of agents that makes it different that what’s happened in the other countries. So why we have to put China has a place to grow them, by the way, we are investing in that market. So for two reasons, one is, we cannot ignore the number one producer of apples in the world, that’s number one, it’s very simple.
Number two, China continues to evolve. I have personally experienced in that market that a lot of the things you say about China today may not be true in two, three years. I mean, I was in the different market, where people say that Chinese will not be interested in calling sugar, they did, and they are more and more. And I think in this market, it is going to happen the same. You will see a reorganization in change in terms of the distribution challenge in China all the apples and all the actual whole supply chain is going to go.
We have to be there. We have to be there with specific Chinese strategists. It might not really show a very strong growth in the short-term, but we will definitely have that, as you know, pipeline for capitalizing in the next years how to actually get to that market. I’m not going to give up the China that I cannot do it. As CEO of this company will be at the service.
Brian Nolan
Okay, understood. Thank you. And two more quick questions. The – there was a lawsuit filed against TruPick. Are you able to speak about that, or is that still…?
Jordi Ferre
We’re not in a position to talk about pending litigation. We only will say that we are very very confident that our IP position is very strong.
Brian Nolan
Okay. And final question, have you guys released any information regarding some of the financial implications of the JVs with, whether it’s BotanoCap or whoever else, have you discussed how that’s going to impact your financials?
Jordi Ferre
So we haven’t actually disclosed it, obviously.
Brian Nolan
Okay.
Stephen Trevor
So what we said is that, add to that a little bit is, as these products are still some of them in testing and as we have both revenue and customers frameworks that we’ll be sharing details with you. But they’ll be kind of a cascade if you look at the chart that Jordi described products that we’ve introduced. There’s some products that we’re just explaining there’s a new end market that we’re entering to some products with our business arena, revenue base and we’re describing the curve of the revenue and EBITDA, and so you should expect that to be a continuous process from us as new products go to our network.

Jordi Ferre
Yes, building on what just Steve said, you saw that I made a lot of emphasis about being very clear and how we report base business and pipeline. And I intend to do that more and more on these calls with investors, because I think, you need to understand what is the dynamic for the base business? What is the dynamic on those pipeline that we’re building and always pipeline projects that we have will impact over time.
And I think this is something that we always to our investor community, but you also worry to ourselves. So we will be a lot more granular about these opportunities that we move forward. That’s the reason why I lay out the way we’re going to report in terms of based in pipeline.
Brian Nolan
Okay. And one last thing, I know, for competitive reasons, you may not be able to, but can you talk about the magnitude of the price cut, as it impact sales?
Jordi Ferre
Steve, you want to take that and set what’s in there?
Stephen Trevor
Yes. So, I think it’s worth spending just a moment kind of sharing with you what our pricing framework looks like for customers, because we have 3,000 customers, as Jordi described. We have customers who prefer to get services from us in a reasonably wide range of formats. So there are some customers, for example, who like the flexibility of being to have us come with one increment [ph] of the exact moment that they ask for. We have some customers who wants to run the entire season and they can fill and refill the warehouse and get mobile applications.
And so when it comes to describing our pricing framework to you and obviously, we’re not going to – customer – comment on any one customer’s information with respect to our customers. But we – as a result, we have a reasonably complex range of alternatives that are the way that our customers like to buy from us. And so, at this point, what I think, we can say is, we’ve given you that cascade, it gives you a sense of kind of the magnitude of the pricing change this year. And just to remind you, SmartFresh today is over 90%, or in the area of 90% of our total business.
So that pricing impact was important as it relates our third quarter and we obviously care a lot about it. But we’re talking about pricing impacts in terms of both preserving share, maintaining the regulations of our customers that are not radical or dramatic in anyway.
Brian Nolan
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. There no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Jordi Ferre
Yes, thank you so much everybody for attending this call. What I would like to say is certainly this is not the way I would expect that the call will go in terms of – the first call for me in this company and for Kathy, we’ll talking about revising guidance. Certainly, we’re facing some short-term challenges we recognized. But I would like everybody still to focus on the great strength that this company offers. And I think that, first of all, I cannot strengthening of our know-how of plant physiology, our knowledge, our technical expertise, our relationship with 3,000 customers, 90% of our sales are coming actually from these direct customers, which is quite a big strength that the company has.
We’re truly a global company. We actually sell to more than 40 countries. I still think we have a solid organization. Some things may have to be changed. But I don’t think that we have a very good people, very well committed. So my role here is going to be and Kathy’s role as new management will be to actually make sure that all of these strengths that we have in the company is turning to growth. The growth that everybody expected and still expect that we can deliver.
I just want to say one thing, putting this company back to road is a very personal thing for me. I did come in this company to actually, because I did see a growing business, and that’s how I see it. So that’s how I want to say, I will – working very hard to do that goal. Kathy will be along my side to reporting me and the whole team that I would face. So I appreciate again you attending this morning this call and I look forward to continue our dialogue.

I would now like to turn the call over to Jordi Ferre, Chief Executive Officer.
Jordi Ferre
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I’m joined today by Kathy Harper, our Chief Financial Officer. Let me start this morning by noting that we have had a strong first quarter with revenues up 15% from last year, while we continue to make progress in reducing operating cost, resulting in a significant improvement in profitability. Additionally, our recent Dow, Avenue agreements speak volumes about the confidence of two large shareholders having in our technology, management, and most importantly, growth strategy.
Let’s turn to Slide 3, where we can review some of the highlight for the quarter in more detail. Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $33 million, up 15% over last year’s first quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter of revenue growth versus a comparable period of the prior year, primary attributable to the solid performance of our core Post-Harvest business and our evolution from a single product to a quality system that includes other solutions, such as AdvanStore and Harvista. We also saw strong growth in Ethylbloc including increased demand in Columbia, where it is used to ensure the quality of flowers during a rainy season. In addition, Ethylbloc has been adopted as part of a standard quality programs for potted orchids in the Netherlands. We also saw encouraging progress in our New Business Development segment, where, although, from a still relatively low base, both RipeLock and LandSpring, saw our sales grow this quarter compared to the same quarter last year. We had another quarter of stable margins and further decreases in operating expenses. This led to a significant improvement in EBITDA and a reduction in our net loss, while also generating $9 million of cash so that we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $85 million. 

Our performance continues to be driven by the strength of SmartFresh, where sales increased in Latin America in the first quarter 2017, despite a continued increase in competition, especially in Argentina. Overall, pricing in the quarter was stable, evidence of the strength of our basic value proposition that apple and other fruit growers overwhelmingly choose SmartFresh when they need someone they can depend on to protect their investment. Harvista experienced double-digit growth in Argentina versus the first quarter of 2016. RipeLock revenues were also up versus the same quarter last year, although, from a low base. We believe this is the indication of the potential of this product. RipeLock is a big part of our retail strategy and our trials for the large retailers in the U.S. and U.K. are continuing to produce positive results. We are working with retailers to roll out RipeLock systemwide. Consequently, we believe overall first quarter results reflect the health of our business and provide an early indication that our new strategy and enhanced financial discipline are helping to improve performance.
Keep in mind, as we discussed in our last call, crop size can vary from year to year, therefore, we continue to expect some variability in our performance attributable to acute weather conditions that can have an impact on specific crops. Our strategy is to diversify the business to manage the challenges of weather-related crop impacts. While these diversification efforts are beginning to take root, they’ll need more time before helping us better manage our exposure.
Please turn to Slide 4. Since joining AgroFresh in October, Kathy and I have been working hard to implement changes we believe will unlock AgroFresh growth potential. We both came from competitive industries, so competition is not new to us. I have now visited all of the geographies in which we operate, meeting with a wide range of customers and potential partners. And engaging with our teams around the world in Washington State, Latin America, China, to discuss implementation of our new commercial strategy, this has provided me with a better appreciation of the outstanding professionals on our team. Our global infrastructure and our overall potential in the food waste prevention space and has strengthened my confidence in our strategy. We continue to believe AgroFresh has strong growth potential in the business of preserving and enhancing the quality and freshness of food, reducing food waste and improving productivity. We have developed a 4-point plan to implement our strategy. So let me provide you some updates on the progress being achieved across these broad initiatives.
Please turn to Slide 5. At the center of our strategy is our goal to strengthen the core Post-Harvest business, which is comprised of our SmartFresh, AdvanStore and existing Harvista-based business. Strengthening our core is the key to establishing a solid foundation that will support the various growth initiatives and provide sufficient time and resources for them to develop and mature. We are continuing to strengthen our SmartFresh Quality System with introduction of AdvanStore Phase 2, a program that provides risk prediction utilizing microbial volatile organic compounds gas detection and genomic testing. Scale-up preparations are in progress for both North America and Europe, and we’ll be completing before the Northern Hemisphere selling season. Additionally, in the second quarter, we also expect to be introducing a new product to the SmartFresh Quality System platform to further differentiate and strengthen our competitive positioning. In the appendix, we have a slide showing the long-term trends in the global apple crop. Since crop size, the proportion of apples actual stored and the degree of SmartFresh penetration affect the core Post-Harvest business.

Although, the crop performance can vary from year to year, over the long term, it tends to fall within a fairly predictable range. The average of the ranges what we are using as a steady-state crop size, as we believe, over time, it has shown to be fairly reliable. Relative to the steady rate scenario, there were a few variations that impacted the first quarter. Revenue in Latin America grew 20% from last year with a volume of apples treated in Brazil up 23%. Generally speaking, the 2017 Latin America harvest was also slightly earlier than last year. In Argentina, we increased our penetration, growing SmartFresh and Harvista volumes. Revenue in Australia and New Zealand was down 12% from last year, as the Australia 2017 harvest season was approximately two weeks later than 2016. We continue to work eventually on new registrations for the additional crops and in new geographies as a means to continue to expand our core SmartFresh franchise. To that end, we have recently received approval for the use of SmartFresh ProTabs in Germany on apples as well as on pears, plums and tomatoes. Consequently, we are starting to have success expanding SmartFresh to new crops. For instance, upwards of 40% of our first quarter revenue growth came from crops other than apples.
Turning to Slide 6, Harvista and LandSpring continue to be our primary pre-harvest products. Harvista remains a key element of our SmartFresh Quality System for integrated apple growers and packers. In addition, Harvista also has growth potential as a standalone product. For such opportunities, we believe it’s best to partner with companies that have the scale, resources and specialized expertise needed to succeed in the pre-harvest market, allowing us to concentrate our resources on strengthening our Post-Harvest franchise. As mentioned last quarter, we recently entered into an agreement with Red Gold, the recognized leader in the tomato industry, based on the positive impact LandSpring had on their tomato yield. In early April, LandSpring secured EPA approval for over 12 additional crops, including broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cantaloupe, cauliflower, cucumber eggplant, bell peppers, summer squash and watermelon. This doubles LandSpring’s potential acreage. Additionally, we are working with a number of potential pre-harvest partners to expand and diversify our one -MCP pre-harvest technology in crops such as cotton, melons and pineapples.
As seen on Slide 7, we are also making great progress with our third initiative, innovation. Our innovation strategy is focused on enhancing our food preservation and waste reduction technology solutions across the entire supply chain. And so we have defined 4 different innovation platforms. Food Fresheners and Preservation, Detection Systems, Software as a Service, and Post-Harvest Chemistry. During the first quarter of 2017, we have made two small investments for the purpose of gaining access to innovative technologies and in securing distribution rights, consistent with our strategic focus on food freshness, extension and waste reduction. First, we have made a small investment in an organic produced treatment that has the potential to dramatically extend the shelf life of fruits, such as cherries and strawberries. It also has antimicrobial properties. Our second investment was in the food sensor company, which has a technology that is designed to provide real-time freshness reporting anywhere in the world for just a few cents per carton. These are both early-stage innovating technologies and products in exciting areas off the Post-Harvest space. They also offer the opportunity to expand into new crops where one -MCP is less effective, especially high-value fruits, such as cherries and strawberries. We are in an evaluation process with each of these companies and we’ll provide more details of these evaluations progress.

On Slide 8, you will see the progress we have achieved with our fourth grow initiative, expansion into retail. Retail is the largest growth opportunity for AgroFresh. Food waste is an increasing global concern, with 2/3 of these losses occurring from harvest to retail. With our global footprint and proven food preservation technology, we believe that AgroFresh is ideally positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in retail. RipeLock is our first product entry in the retail market and it represents a substantial growth opportunity for our business. Though still small, revenues continue to grow with positive customer trials to date, showing that RipeLock helps reduce shrinkage by as much as 15% to 30%. As an example, based on positive test results, Toni Direito, Commercial Director, Compagnie Fruitiere, a leading supplier of bananas in the U.K. said, "It is eye-opening to see how effective RipeLock is. We added RipeLock to our program last year and immediately saw better quality and color in our bananas. It has helped us manage our banana supply, and our retailers and wholesalers like that the bananas have a longer shelf life." The key to success will be to rollout the RipeLock program in major retailers. And with our 2 largest shareholders agreeing to provide up to $100 million in loans for approved acquisitions, we have significantly expanded the range of candidates we could potentially acquire to reinforce our retail strategy.
Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Kathy Harper to go through the financial results in greater detail.
Kathy Harper
Thank you, Jordi, and good morning to everyone on the call. Let me review the first quarter financial highlights. The new year’s off to a strong start with improved top and bottom line performance.
Beginning with net sales, please turn to Slide 10. Net sales for the first quarter of 2017 were $33 million, up 15% from a year ago. Sales of Harvista and SmartFresh and apples made up 60% of this growth, with our largest contributions coming from Brazil and Chile. As Jordi noted, over 40% of the growth in the quarter came from crops other than apple, including pears, flowers, bananas and persimmon. Harvista, for other crops, also contributed meaningful growth as our business in Argentina continues to expand. The impact of currency on revenue was negligible in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. Operational gross margin of 82% was in line with the first quarter of 2016 and was the result of a relatively stable pricing environment and some impact of higher revenue against the fairly consistent fixed cost base.
Turning to Slide 11, we are continuing to reduce operating expenses with selling, general and administrative expenses down by over $4 million from a year ago quarter, due to efficiency and productivity improvements. There were a number of nonrecurring items, such as litigation cost and expenses associated with our strategic review included in SG&A this quarter, pricing us above our targeted run rate for the quarter.
That said, we made progress during this quarter with our ongoing efforts to embed efficient and effective systems and processes and still expect to have average SG&A of $11 million per quarter in 2017. Research and development costs were $3 million, which is $1 million less than the same quarter last year, reflecting our efforts to more intently concentrate on products supporting our strategy. Over time, we expect to achieve continued performance improvements in our business by further driving down operating expenses. Additionally, interest expense decreased by nearly $5 million from a year ago to $10 million for the quarter. This decrease was driven by lower non-cash accretion expense on the contingent consideration, otherwise known as the earn-outs.

As a result of the adjustment to the value of contingent consideration recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016, an additional adjustments arising out of our recently announced agreements with Dow and Avenue Capital, we expect interest cost to be reduced by $5 million per quarter compared to 2016.
On Slide 12, you will see we generated EBITDA of $11 million in the quarter, which is a $7 million improvement over the $4 million in EBITDA generated in the first quarter of 2016. The company also continues to generate strong cash flow with cash flow from operations of $9 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures from $1 million in the first quarter up marginally from a year ago quarter. For the full year, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly $7 million, with the majority of the increase versus 2016 attributable to standing-up our own independent IT infrastructure and ERP.
Turning to Slide 13, the balance sheet at March 31, 2017 was strong, including significant liquidity. Debt was $408 million and cash was $85 million with total liquidity of $110 million. In addition, we now have access to up to $100 million in loans from Dow and Avenue for approved acquisition. Since the Dow and Avenue agreements were executed subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we have included a couple of slides at the end of our presentation, summarizing the deal and reflecting its impact on our balance sheet and statement of operations. The net effect is that the agreements reduced liabilities by $85 million.
Now, I’ll turn the call back to Jordi for a discussion of our outlook for 2017 before opening the call to Q&A.
Jordi Ferre
Thank you, Kathy. Please turn to Slide 14. The year is off to a good start, and we are encouraged by the progress we achieved in the first quarter. Since our business is more heavily weighted towards the second half of the calendar year, we are working diligently to ensure we sustain our success over the remainder of the year. To that end, we reconfirm our full year views provided during the fourth quarter conference call. For gross profit margin, we expect a slight decline in percentage similar to what we experienced in 2016, driven mainly by product mix.
In terms of our balance sheet, we are taking deliberate actions to improve our working capital in 2017. From a cash flow perspective, we expect to continue generating significant cash from operations. We expect our ending cash balance in 2017 to grow before the impact of any acquisitions or strategic investments. Summarizing, in the first three months of 2017, we continue to make progress in all of the areas that are key to our long-term success, strengthening our business, reducing unnecessary operating cost and implementing our growth strategy. Our agreements with Dow and Avenue improve our financial flexibility and give us access to additional resources to implement our growth strategy. We are hard at work preparing for the balance of the year, where we believe the development of our new marketing strategy and the SmartFresh Quality System will sharpen our competitive edge. In the first quarter, we gain key insights as to our new marketing strategy. We are certain these insights will help improve our success in the upcoming Northern Hemisphere selling season. We want to thank you for all your continued support. Now I would like to open the line to Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator 
[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Daniel Jester of Citi. Please go ahead. 
Daniel Jester
So I thought I caught this in your prepared remarks, but could you say that the Latin America season was a bit early this year? And I was just wondering if you can comment about some of the weather issues in Argentina in the second quarter and just help us kind of bridge first quarter, second quarter in terms of seasonality this year for revenues?

Jordi Ferre
Yes. The crop, you’re correct. The crops that we saw, especially in Brazil was a little bit earlier this year. Concerning Argentina, I think, I may have mentioned Australia as potentially having some weather issues rather than Argentina, but as you saw that in first quarter, we already were -- we did not have stellar results in Australia. So that, I would say, that’s already accounted in the results on Q1.
Daniel Jester
Okay. And then, with regards to the M&A dry powder, which you referenced as part of the Dow, Avenue transaction. Is there, are there time restrictions in place? And maybe you can just kind of update us on sort of what you’re seeing out there in the M&A landscape?
Kathy Harper
Daniel, the time restrictions, you mean, on the debt facility available to us? We’ve got -- it’s out there till ‘19.
Daniel Jester
And then on sort of what’s the pipeline look like, updates from the fourth quarter?
Jordi Ferre
We, obviously, we have to be careful what we say, but let me just put it this way, we’ve been very active in building a strong pipeline of potential Q&A, sorry, of potential M&A. So you stay put for more news, but we haven’t been just sitting on this. We’ve been very actively working on this, and there’s a number of discussions and actions that we’re doing right now. And in near time, we will be able to announce.
Daniel Jester
Okay. And then, as you’ve been meeting with customers, can you give us any feedback on some of the changes you’re making in terms of how you go to market, particularly in U.S.? And any initial thoughts about the pricing environment for the upcoming U.S. season?
Jordi Ferre
I think the -- my observation is that customers have received very positively, the fact that we are expanding our platform of services. We have a good reputation. Our people are well liked and appreciated, the service we do. And the fact that we can actually extend it to other areas has been, generally, very well received. In terms of the pricing environment, I don’t think there’s any change of what I had already reported in the past. We have already facing competition and about, we estimate 50% of our revenue base. And I don’t think there’s going to be a big change this year. What’s going to change is the way we’re going to approach that by broadening our services. And in the next quarter, I’ll be able to announce a little bit more of what we are going to do, especially in Northern Hemisphere in that respect.
Daniel Jester
Okay. And then just a couple of quick ones maybe for Kathy, can you -- what’s the bridge between the 11 million run rate you mentioned for SG&A and the 16 million that you reported in the first quarter?
Kathy Harper
So in first quarter, I did note that we had a few onetime items. We had some significant litigation expense in the first quarter this year, which was round numbers, 2 million. We did have some cost associated with strategic review and other valuations, so it’s about 1 million. And we had incentive cost. We introduced a new long-term incentives plan that we booked some expense for, and then 331 period to incentivize national research, as well as fourth quarter of last year, we were well below the 11 million, and so just trying to give you a view.
We are at a target bonus accrual rate, where in December fourth quarter of ‘16, we actually, for bonuses in 2016, employees received 24%, not 100%. And so there was a credit in the fourth quarter and we’ve got a full 100% target in the first quarter, so. There is the chunk of the pieces.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And the next question will come from Brian Nolan of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Brian Nolan
I wanted to ask you quickly. Can you give us some more information regards to where you’re seeing more sales outside of apples? Are you getting from -- is it Brazil watermelons? And did that have carry overs into the North American season as well?

Jordi Ferre
Yes, we see more sales in areas like pears, kiwis and watermelons, yes. And obviously, we also mentioned this situation, we have very positively on flowers, where we’re making progress as well with our solution.
Brian Nolan
And also there’s something you mentioned during the call, Jordi, that I didn’t quite pick up. You had talked about gross margin expectations being similar to 2016? Is that correct or is there...
Jordi Ferre
That is correct. Sorry, yes. I was -- yes. Similar to 2016, we’ve potentially supplied degradation because of the change of product mix.
Operator
The next question will come from Michael [indiscernible] of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
In terms of, you mentioned 2 new competitors in Argentina, which it doesn’t look like they got much traction. But can you give a little more color around who that is? And exactly what’s going on down there?
Jordi Ferre
I would prefer not to mention any of our competitors. I would say that Argentina has been an open market for a while. We have faced some local competition and some of the more international companies have tried to get in. But what I was mentioning, I don’t know if had made that clear in the call is, in spite of increased competition, we actually increased market share. So I thought, I view that as very positive and I wanted to point it out during my call.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. No, I agree. Obviously, as I said, obviously, they’re not getting any traction against the increasing market share despite more competition is clearly very positive. The other question I guess with Kathy, in terms of just, is there sort of an adjusted EBITDA number more similar to like sort for the bank term loan definition you can provide? Just so we can sort of track that against where we are in terms of covenants in previous quarters?
Kathy Harper
No. We told you last year, we are shifting to the EBITDA. We manage the business by EBITDA.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. I guess, would something be posted on the SyndTrak site ultimately, for, lenders then?
Kathy Harper
Yes.
Operator 
The next question will be from Eric Gomberg of Dane Capital Management. Please go ahead. 
Eric Gomberg
Going back to the, I guess then, in the first question, I just wanted to get if you can provide any more clarity regarding on a like-for-like basis shifting for seasonality in harvest, what the growth looks like Q1 this year versus Q1 last year? To the extent you could provide that.
Jordi Ferre
That’s a little bit difficult to do, because in summer events, the, like in Latin America, we saw that a little bit earlier while in Australia and New Zealand, it was actually delayed. But I would say that I am going to give you an approx number. It’s fair to say that probably growth was -- would have been between 5% to 10%. So we still have, I mean, the fact that the crops in Latin America was a little bit earlier would all take away from the fact that we actually seen growth in this first quarter.
Eric Gomberg
That’s great. That’s helpful. And I assume the things that helped you grow on an organic kind of like-for-like basis in the Southern Hemisphere are things that ought to help in the Northern Hemisphere later this year, all things being equal in terms of the crop size.
Jordi Ferre
That’s correct.
Eric Gomberg
Okay. And and then just one other question. I just, just looking through the deck, it’s the way it reads to me, it sounds like Dow has not yet started buying back 10% of the stock. But I wasn’t clear on that. So I just wanted any color you can provide.
Kathy Harper
So Eric, the easiest way to track that would be to look for Dow filing.
Operator 
The next question will come from Kunal Banerjee of Brigade Capital Management. Please go ahead. 
Kunal Banerjee

First question on the LandSpring progress. You talked about Red Gold. Any other customers that are encouraged by what’s going on at Red Gold? And then, if you could just handicap the size of the Red Gold opportunity now with the doubling or potential doubling of the acreage there with the additional crops?
Jordi Ferre
First, yes, Red Gold, it’s seen as very positive and that will have an effect on other customers. I would like to remind the fact that the improving in United States is for everything but California. We’re still two third of the potential. So that is still not there in play. But in the rest of the United States, yes, we see that all these other approvals will double, basically, the potential we have in the U.S. ex California.
Kunal Banerjee
And what will it take for California to fall in line? Or is that just not going to happen?
Jordi Ferre
I will not like to comment on what we’re doing on regulatory. What I would like to say that obviously, we would like to see the whole of the U.S. using LandSpring.
Kunal Banerjee
Okay. And then -- and just in terms of handicapping, is it a low single-digit million dollars opportunity? Or -- just rough numbers there would be helpful.
Jordi Ferre
I think that when California comes in play, you will see a potential of a few million dollars.
Kunal Banerjee
Okay. And then just on the financials. I think there was a statement saying expected to be at an $11 million per quarter average for 2017, but you were over that, let’s say 16 million. So 11 times 4 is 44, and you had $16 million. So do the other three quarters then total 28 million? Is that the way we should look at it? Or are you just saying that it’s going to revert to 11 million? Or it’s going to track at $11 million quarterly for Q2 through Q4?
Kathy Harper
We do expect the balance of the quarters to fall below that $11 million run rate.
Kunal Banerjee
Okay. Okay. So okay. That’s good. And then just looking at the last Slide 20, your reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP to arrive at the 10.6 million of EBITDA, doesn’t seem like you excluded any of those oneoffs in the SG&A, such as litigation cost and strategic review. So is that -- am I right in that conclusion?
Kathy Harper
That’s correct. We had announced in the third quarter of 2016 that we were moving away from all those adjustments, because we think that management and stakeholders are better served by us managing the business by EBITDA not adjusted EBITDA.
Kunal Banerjee
Okay. But I mean, just qualitatively speaking, your quarter could’ve been better if those oneoff costs were not incurred, right? Your underlying business was actually reflective of something closer to 15 million? I mean, ex those costs, which aren’t going to recur.
Kathy Harper
Correct.
Operator
And the next question will come from Francesco Pellegrino of Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.
Francesco Pellegrino
Just a couple of questions. The first person was, could you guys briefly comment on the effectiveness of SmartFresh as part of the quality system in contrast to a standalone product?
Jordi Ferre
I think that SmartFresh has the same effectiveness whether it’s part of a quality system or it’s a standalone product. What happens is when you do a system, basically you have other things that, in combination, can give you better results, right? So, there is synergies in using Harvista and SmartFresh, for instance. So that is a positive. And there is other things as well that we’re doing there. The AdvanStore is basically measuring that effectiveness. So not all of that is being included in that system will necessarily have an impact. It has other role, like I say, AdvanStore will measure that effectiveness. Yes, but eventually like Harvista and SmartFresh adjust together, they have, one plus one makes three.

Francesco Pellegrino
Makes sense. And could you also comment on maybe some lessons learned from pricing in the Northern Hemisphere during the first quarter?
Jordi Ferre
I think that the biggest lesson we have learned in places like, just to give you an example, the market in Argentina, where we saw increased competition is that when you put the services together and you sell them as a platform, it’s very effective competitively. In Argentina, Harvista plays a big role, and Harvista and SmartFresh together, both in terms of the effectiveness that we just talked before, but also in terms of how you price it and approach customers does have a positive effect and impact. So we expect that, we take those lessons and actually we’ll bring more into it into the Northern Hemisphere, because we will have other elements as we already announced and others that will be announced that we’ll add on to that SmartFresh Quality System. One of them, obviously, is AdvanStore, which is very well received by our customers and has definitely a place and a role in detection of what’s going on in those rooms. For all the other things that I said, we’ll be announcing in Q2. We’re launching into that platform.
Operator 
The next question will be a follow-up from Brian Nolan of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Brian Nolan
One of the things you guys had mentioned on the previous call, you think you might look for alternative methods of distribution for Harvista. Have you made any progress on that side? Can we expect to see [multiple speakers] in North America?
Jordi Ferre
Yes. We, Yes, I made a reference. There is a number of ongoing discussions right now. I cannot make an announcement at this point, but I hope that next quarter probably, I will be able to make an announcement in that respect. But yes, we are very, very active in different discussions and engagements we’re having with partners that can complement what we already can do in the apple business.

PHILADELPHIA, July 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. ("AgroFresh" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:   AGFS), a global leader in produce freshness solutions, announced today that Jordi Ferre, 51, will join the company as chief executive officer, effective October 1, 2016.
Ferre will replace Nance Dicciani and Stephen Trevor, AgroFresh board members who have served as interim co-CEOs since March 2016.








Ferre brings more than 25 years of international experience in the food ingredients industry, most recently serving as the chief operating officer for PureCircle Limited, a global leader in natural food ingredients, including stevia sweetener.  At PureCircle, he implemented strategic changes that resulted in double-digit revenue growth, manufacturing improvements and cost reductions.  He also was directly involved with key global customers and with the investment community.
"We are delighted to have someone with Jordi's international operational and marketing expertise join AgroFresh as we work to expand the reach of our existing technologies by crop and by geography, and to explore new opportunities in the food freshness market segment," said Board Chair Nance Dicciani.  "The breadth of Jordi's experience, coupled with his excellent interpersonal and communications skills made him stand out against a strong pool of potential candidates to lead AgroFresh into its next phase of growth."
Over the course of his career, Ferre has been responsible for operations, manufacturing, finance, and sales and marketing at organizations such as Tate & Lyle PLC, Wise Foods Inc., Chupa Chups Group, and Warner Lambert Company.  He has successfully repositioned and relaunched multiple global and regional brands to drive substantial sales growth.  Ferre also has extensive experience managing joint ventures and strategic alliances, and has been the primary contact for international food industry accounts for several companies.
"AgroFresh is at an important juncture as a newly public company, and I'm delighted to be able to work with this experienced team to further unlock its growth potential and diversify the company's offerings in the global market to preserve and enhance food freshness," Ferre said.

How PureCircle is Investing in Growing Stevia – and Farmer Incomes – Sustainably

I’ve just arrived at Silvio Pettirosi Airport in the capital city of Asunción, in Paraguay. Mariano Demaria, who leads PureCircle Paraguay, is here to greet me. Together we will make the long journey to the stevia fields in Rio Verde, in the Northern region of the country. It’s only about 100 miles from Asunción, but it can take us over four hours – first by car before the roads get too rough and then we must switch to an ATV to navigate the distinctly, rich red clay-like dirt roads. 
It’s beautiful here – hot and moist and the sun is beating down on my head. I wish I had remembered to bring my hat. My discomfort aside, it does make for ideal year-round growing conditions for stevia. We have been working with hundreds of small- scale farmers here for many years, and I am always impressed by the warm yet reserved welcome of the people here. I can feel a sense of pride as they walk me through their stevia fields and show me all they have accomplished in the latest planting and harvesting season. I want to check on a new stevia variety we are growing here. We’ve been looking at how the plant does in the different soil conditions around the world and so far we’ve been making some incredible strides in Paraguay.
But my main focus for this week is to meet prospective new farmers and to hear about the progress we are making in recruiting new farmers to join us in our mission to make stevia available to millions around the world. Although the stevia plant is native to Paraguay, it is quite difficult to find farmers with the knowledge and skills to successfully grow stevia, as well as the willingness to take a risk and try something new. It’s why we have invited a group of prospective stevia farmers to our nurseries in Guayaiví, where our agronomists show them the type of support that we provide for them to be successful—everything from how to plant seedlings and use other growing materials we provide, the best way to irrigate their land, and how to reduce unnecessary waste. We will introduce them to the 7030 program, a collaboration between PureCircle and Paraguayan Ministry of Agriculture, which provides financial assistance and critical equipment to support small-scale farmers. Through this program, a first-year farmer can receive significantly greater income compared to other crops, resulting in substantial improvements in the standard of living for these farmers and their families.
Their success is vital to us. This is why I think of the farmers we partner with truly as our customers and believe in the importance of understanding what they need to be successful, in holistic and sustainable ways. It has not been easy. It’s a deep-rooted belief in the positive impact of stevia and passionate commitment to partnering directly with farmers and farming communities that has been the foundation of how we work here and it’s a commitment we share, as partners, with Coca-Cola. We plan to continue to invest in growing stevia at never-before-seen levels here.
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;
It’s the end of the day and I’m happy to see we have several farmers interested in doing trials with stevia. It may not seem like a significant number, but for us, it’s these small steps that are required to take leaps and bounds.
As I head back to the city, I think about my upcoming trip to Kenya next month. Although far apart, Paraguay and Kenya have become the ‘base’ for our stevia operations in South America and Africa, respectively, from which we have expanded to more than 15 countries. The farmers in Kenya are different in many ways, and yet, very much the same. I’m eager to see our progress firsthand!
