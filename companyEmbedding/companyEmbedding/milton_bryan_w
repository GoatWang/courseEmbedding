Milton Bryan is a village and civil parish located in Central Bedfordshire (the spelling Milton Bryant was also common). It lies just off the A4012 road, near to its junction with the A5 at Hockliffe. The parish includes the ancient hamlets of Potsgrove & Battlesden. Today, the village is best known for being the birthplace of Joseph Paxton, the designer of the Crystal Palace, who was born in Milton Bryan as the seventh son of a farming family along with its role in the Second World War.

South End[edit]
The village is divided into two distinct areas: Church End and South End. South End includes the Red Lion pub and an attractive duck pond. A Methodist Chapel was built by the pond in the 19th century, resting on the banks of the pond and overhanging the pond supported on stilts.
Church End[edit]
Church End includes St Peter's Church and the remains of a radio station (Soldatensender Calais) built in the Second World War to broadcast 'black propaganda' into Nazi Germany.[2]
St Peter's Church[edit]
St Peter's Church was initially a simple Norman structure with a chancel, nave and small timber bell turret, with a 15th-century east window, windows in the nave and doorways in chancel and nave. Then the Inglis family acquired the Milton Bryan Estate through marriage in 1784. The first major alterations took place in 1826 in memory of Sir Hugh Inglis, who had died in 1820, by his son Sir Robert Harry Inglis. A north transept was built and a family chapel over a vault, the architect seems to have been Sir Robert Smirke. A new tower and a porch were built in 1840-1841, designed by Lewis Nockalls Cottingham, the west window was reopened and a new west front gable were added. Ten years later a south transept was added at Sir Robert Harry Inglis' expense, after his death a stained glass window was installed in the north transept in 1857. Lady Paxton gave a stained glass window in 1867 in memory of her husband Sir Joseph Paxton, architect of the Crystal Palace, who was born in the village.[3]
Pond[edit]
In 1861, a chapel was built over the pond, supported by stilts and partially on land. This was a timber Chapel with a slated roof which, at a squash, could seat up to 50 people. The interior was very simple and austere. During its life, the Chapel was maintained meticulously by the villagers who ensured that the pews were kept polished and the wooden floor scrubbed. Very often, the sound of ducks under the Chapel could be heard during the sermons and hymns. A plaque was placed by the pond to commemorate both the Millennium 2000 and the site of the former Milton Bryan Methodist Chapel.
Surrounding area[edit]
The nearest large town to Milton Bryan is Leighton Buzzard, very closely followed by Dunstable. It is also a short distance away from the sizable villages of Toddington[4] and Woburn.

Milton Bryan is a village and civil parish located in Central Bedfordshire (the spelling Milton Bryant was also common). It lies just off the A4012 road, near to its junction with the A5 at Hockliffe. The parish includes the ancient hamlets of Potsgrove & Battlesden. Today, the village is best known for being the birthplace of Joseph Paxton, the designer of the Crystal Palace, who was born in Milton Bryan as the seventh son of a farming family along with its role in the Second World War.

South End[edit]
The village is divided into two distinct areas: Church End and South End. South End includes the Red Lion pub and an attractive duck pond. A Methodist Chapel was built by the pond in the 19th century, resting on the banks of the pond and overhanging the pond supported on stilts.
Church End[edit]
Church End includes St Peter's Church and the remains of a radio station (Soldatensender Calais) built in the Second World War to broadcast 'black propaganda' into Nazi Germany.[2]
St Peter's Church[edit]
St Peter's Church was initially a simple Norman structure with a chancel, nave and small timber bell turret, with a 15th-century east window, windows in the nave and doorways in chancel and nave. Then the Inglis family acquired the Milton Bryan Estate through marriage in 1784. The first major alterations took place in 1826 in memory of Sir Hugh Inglis, who had died in 1820, by his son Sir Robert Harry Inglis. A north transept was built and a family chapel over a vault, the architect seems to have been Sir Robert Smirke. A new tower and a porch were built in 1840-1841, designed by Lewis Nockalls Cottingham, the west window was reopened and a new west front gable were added. Ten years later a south transept was added at Sir Robert Harry Inglis' expense, after his death a stained glass window was installed in the north transept in 1857. Lady Paxton gave a stained glass window in 1867 in memory of her husband Sir Joseph Paxton, architect of the Crystal Palace, who was born in the village.[3]
Pond[edit]
In 1861, a chapel was built over the pond, supported by stilts and partially on land. This was a timber Chapel with a slated roof which, at a squash, could seat up to 50 people. The interior was very simple and austere. During its life, the Chapel was maintained meticulously by the villagers who ensured that the pews were kept polished and the wooden floor scrubbed. Very often, the sound of ducks under the Chapel could be heard during the sermons and hymns. A plaque was placed by the pond to commemorate both the Millennium 2000 and the site of the former Milton Bryan Methodist Chapel.
Surrounding area[edit]
The nearest large town to Milton Bryan is Leighton Buzzard, very closely followed by Dunstable. It is also a short distance away from the sizable villages of Toddington[4] and Woburn.

Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.

What Will Be the Lasting Impact of Brexit on US Mortgages?
Steve Cook
 Although Britain will not actually implement June’s Brexit referendum to leave the European Union until next March at the earliest, it has already made a major impact on US mortgage rates. Will the long term impact of Brexit be as significant?
Within days of the referendum, uncertainty about the potential impact of Brexit on European economies caused investors to sell riskier global stocks and buy safer...
