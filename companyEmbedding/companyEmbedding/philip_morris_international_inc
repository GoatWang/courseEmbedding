Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) is an American global cigarette and tobacco company, with products sold in over 180 countries outside the United States. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro.
Until a spin-off in March 2008, Philip Morris International was an operating company of Altria Group. Altria explained the spin-off, arguing PMI would have more "freedom" outside the constraints of US corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to "pursue sales growth in emerging markets.", while Altria focuses on the United States.[2] The shareholders in Altria at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.
The company's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, although the corporate headquarters remain in New York. It does not operate in the United States, with Philip Morris brands there still owned by PMI's former owner Altria.
Because tobacco, the main constituent of cigarettes, is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally[3] and is addictive, the company's operations (and its competitors') are highly controversial and are increasingly the subject of litigation and restrictive legislation from governments concerned about the health impacts of its products.
Philip Morris was a long-term main sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team until 2011 and continues its association with the team as of 2017, albeit on a more low-key basis and without overt advertising.[4]

History[edit]
The company states its history is traced to a London tobacconist's, Philip Morris’s, 1847 opening of a single shop on London’s Bond Street which sold tobacco and cigarettes.[5]
The current operations center of the company is located in Lausanne, Switzerland;[6] it owns 7 of the top 15 tobacco brands in the world.[7]
In April 2014, Philip Morris announced that it would close its Moorabbin plant in Australia by the end of 2014 after operating for 60 years, due to the gradual decline of sales in the last ten years and difficulties conforming to 2010 Australian government regulation about reducing fire risks.[8]
In 2015 it sold 850 billion cigarettes.[9]

Research[edit]
PMI has a research and development program, and declares its priority to be "developing products with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases." It says the focus of the program is reducing the levels of toxic chemical compounds.[12] So far, most extensive project is IQOS - a heat not burn tobacco product. [13]
Controversies and public health disputes[edit]
Australia[edit]




Example of Australian cigarette pack with health warning, as in December 2012: a variety of warning packages are in use.


The Australian Government announced it would introduce "Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws" on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation.[14] It was one of several tobacco companies to launch legal action against the Australian Government.[15] British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking.
Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia.
On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution.[16]
On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL) issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian-based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in plain packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.[16]
The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in 2017 supported Australia's right to enforce plain packaging.[17] In 2017 PMI was instructed to pay the Australia governments legal costs, an estimated 50 million dollars.[18]
Norway[edit]
Philip Morris also sued Norway over the country's ban on displaying tobacco products in stores. It lost the case in 2012.[19]
Uruguay[edit]
In 2010, the company lobbied against Uruguay's strong anti-smoking laws[20] and filed a complaint against the country (Philip Morris v. Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty.[21] On July 8, 2016, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled in favour of Uruguay.[22]
United Kingdom[edit]
In August 2014 the company foreshadowed legal action against the UK Government if it went ahead with plans to introduce plain packaging. In a submission to the government, Philip Morris International said it would seek compensation running into "billions of pounds," if the proposed legislation went ahead.[23]
Other[edit]
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Phillip Morris along with British American Tobacco, was involved in campaigns to undermine bans against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a "'fundamentalist’ who wishes to return to sharia law," and be "a threat to existing government as” according to leaked documents.[24] A 1985 report from Philip Morris squarely blamed the World Health Organization: “This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO … The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."[24] Philip Morris has refused to comment on these findings.[24]
Philip Morris International has announced an overhaul of its human rights protections of tobacco workers in Kazakhstan and 30 other countries after critical reports.[25]
The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]
Philip Morris Sports[edit]




Marlboro sponsored Ferrari Racing Team on 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix


Philip Morris sponsored sports event include Racing, Football, Badminton, Golf, Cricket, and Ice Hockey.
Philip Morris is a long-term main sponsor of Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari.[30] The sponsorship is subliminal in the logo these days due to restriction in tobacco sponsorship, but Marlboro-branded Ferrari and McLaren cars won several world titles with famous drivers such as Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. Philip Morris also sponsored several title winners in MotoGP in road racing and Indy Cars. The Ferrari Formula One deal before direct sponsorships was banned was estimated to be worth £45 million a year as well as paying the multi-million salary of Schumacher.[31] The current deal is estimated to be even more lucrative, in spite of its logo not being legally allowed to be displayed on the car.[32]
Philip Morris Racing Team outside the global series' sponsored by Marlboro & Dji Sam Soe 234, include Motorcycle Racing (for prohibited motorcycle racing, see on Malaysian Wikipedia : [Lumba haram, and see Mat Rempit), Rally Car, and Bicycle Racing Tour d'Indonesia (sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234). Jordan Grand Prix Car Racing Team is sponsored by Benson & Hedges (with British American Tobacco, Gallaher Group, and Japan Tobacco) from 1996-2005 with tagline : "Be On Edge" (Benson & Hedges). Philip Morris Dragon Boat is sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234.

Research[edit]
PMI has a research and development program, and declares its priority to be "developing products with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases." It says the focus of the program is reducing the levels of toxic chemical compounds.[12] So far, most extensive project is IQOS - a heat not burn tobacco product. [13]
Controversies and public health disputes[edit]
Australia[edit]




Example of Australian cigarette pack with health warning, as in December 2012: a variety of warning packages are in use.


The Australian Government announced it would introduce "Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws" on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation.[14] It was one of several tobacco companies to launch legal action against the Australian Government.[15] British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking.
Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia.
On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution.[16]
On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL) issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian-based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in plain packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.[16]
The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in 2017 supported Australia's right to enforce plain packaging.[17] In 2017 PMI was instructed to pay the Australia governments legal costs, an estimated 50 million dollars.[18]
Norway[edit]
Philip Morris also sued Norway over the country's ban on displaying tobacco products in stores. It lost the case in 2012.[19]
Uruguay[edit]
In 2010, the company lobbied against Uruguay's strong anti-smoking laws[20] and filed a complaint against the country (Philip Morris v. Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty.[21] On July 8, 2016, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled in favour of Uruguay.[22]
United Kingdom[edit]
In August 2014 the company foreshadowed legal action against the UK Government if it went ahead with plans to introduce plain packaging. In a submission to the government, Philip Morris International said it would seek compensation running into "billions of pounds," if the proposed legislation went ahead.[23]
Other[edit]
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Phillip Morris along with British American Tobacco, was involved in campaigns to undermine bans against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a "'fundamentalist’ who wishes to return to sharia law," and be "a threat to existing government as” according to leaked documents.[24] A 1985 report from Philip Morris squarely blamed the World Health Organization: “This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO … The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."[24] Philip Morris has refused to comment on these findings.[24]
Philip Morris International has announced an overhaul of its human rights protections of tobacco workers in Kazakhstan and 30 other countries after critical reports.[25]
The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]
Philip Morris Sports[edit]




Marlboro sponsored Ferrari Racing Team on 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix


Philip Morris sponsored sports event include Racing, Football, Badminton, Golf, Cricket, and Ice Hockey.
Philip Morris is a long-term main sponsor of Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari.[30] The sponsorship is subliminal in the logo these days due to restriction in tobacco sponsorship, but Marlboro-branded Ferrari and McLaren cars won several world titles with famous drivers such as Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. Philip Morris also sponsored several title winners in MotoGP in road racing and Indy Cars. The Ferrari Formula One deal before direct sponsorships was banned was estimated to be worth £45 million a year as well as paying the multi-million salary of Schumacher.[31] The current deal is estimated to be even more lucrative, in spite of its logo not being legally allowed to be displayed on the car.[32]
Philip Morris Racing Team outside the global series' sponsored by Marlboro & Dji Sam Soe 234, include Motorcycle Racing (for prohibited motorcycle racing, see on Malaysian Wikipedia : [Lumba haram, and see Mat Rempit), Rally Car, and Bicycle Racing Tour d'Indonesia (sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234). Jordan Grand Prix Car Racing Team is sponsored by Benson & Hedges (with British American Tobacco, Gallaher Group, and Japan Tobacco) from 1996-2005 with tagline : "Be On Edge" (Benson & Hedges). Philip Morris Dragon Boat is sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) is an American global cigarette and tobacco company, with products sold in over 180 countries outside the United States. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro.
Until a spin-off in March 2008, Philip Morris International was an operating company of Altria Group. Altria explained the spin-off, arguing PMI would have more "freedom" outside the constraints of US corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to "pursue sales growth in emerging markets.", while Altria focuses on the United States.[2] The shareholders in Altria at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.
The company's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, although the corporate headquarters remain in New York. It does not operate in the United States, with Philip Morris brands there still owned by PMI's former owner Altria.
Because tobacco, the main constituent of cigarettes, is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally[3] and is addictive, the company's operations (and its competitors') are highly controversial and are increasingly the subject of litigation and restrictive legislation from governments concerned about the health impacts of its products.
Philip Morris was a long-term main sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team until 2011 and continues its association with the team as of 2017, albeit on a more low-key basis and without overt advertising.[4]

History[edit]
The company states its history is traced to a London tobacconist's, Philip Morris’s, 1847 opening of a single shop on London’s Bond Street which sold tobacco and cigarettes.[5]
The current operations center of the company is located in Lausanne, Switzerland;[6] it owns 7 of the top 15 tobacco brands in the world.[7]
In April 2014, Philip Morris announced that it would close its Moorabbin plant in Australia by the end of 2014 after operating for 60 years, due to the gradual decline of sales in the last ten years and difficulties conforming to 2010 Australian government regulation about reducing fire risks.[8]
In 2015 it sold 850 billion cigarettes.[9]

Research[edit]
PMI has a research and development program, and declares its priority to be "developing products with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases." It says the focus of the program is reducing the levels of toxic chemical compounds.[12] So far, most extensive project is IQOS - a heat not burn tobacco product. [13]
Controversies and public health disputes[edit]
Australia[edit]




Example of Australian cigarette pack with health warning, as in December 2012: a variety of warning packages are in use.


The Australian Government announced it would introduce "Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws" on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation.[14] It was one of several tobacco companies to launch legal action against the Australian Government.[15] British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking.
Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia.
On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution.[16]
On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL) issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian-based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in plain packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.[16]
The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in 2017 supported Australia's right to enforce plain packaging.[17] In 2017 PMI was instructed to pay the Australia governments legal costs, an estimated 50 million dollars.[18]
Norway[edit]
Philip Morris also sued Norway over the country's ban on displaying tobacco products in stores. It lost the case in 2012.[19]
Uruguay[edit]
In 2010, the company lobbied against Uruguay's strong anti-smoking laws[20] and filed a complaint against the country (Philip Morris v. Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty.[21] On July 8, 2016, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled in favour of Uruguay.[22]
United Kingdom[edit]
In August 2014 the company foreshadowed legal action against the UK Government if it went ahead with plans to introduce plain packaging. In a submission to the government, Philip Morris International said it would seek compensation running into "billions of pounds," if the proposed legislation went ahead.[23]
Other[edit]
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Phillip Morris along with British American Tobacco, was involved in campaigns to undermine bans against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a "'fundamentalist’ who wishes to return to sharia law," and be "a threat to existing government as” according to leaked documents.[24] A 1985 report from Philip Morris squarely blamed the World Health Organization: “This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO … The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."[24] Philip Morris has refused to comment on these findings.[24]
Philip Morris International has announced an overhaul of its human rights protections of tobacco workers in Kazakhstan and 30 other countries after critical reports.[25]
The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]
Philip Morris Sports[edit]




Marlboro sponsored Ferrari Racing Team on 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix


Philip Morris sponsored sports event include Racing, Football, Badminton, Golf, Cricket, and Ice Hockey.
Philip Morris is a long-term main sponsor of Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari.[30] The sponsorship is subliminal in the logo these days due to restriction in tobacco sponsorship, but Marlboro-branded Ferrari and McLaren cars won several world titles with famous drivers such as Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. Philip Morris also sponsored several title winners in MotoGP in road racing and Indy Cars. The Ferrari Formula One deal before direct sponsorships was banned was estimated to be worth £45 million a year as well as paying the multi-million salary of Schumacher.[31] The current deal is estimated to be even more lucrative, in spite of its logo not being legally allowed to be displayed on the car.[32]
Philip Morris Racing Team outside the global series' sponsored by Marlboro & Dji Sam Soe 234, include Motorcycle Racing (for prohibited motorcycle racing, see on Malaysian Wikipedia : [Lumba haram, and see Mat Rempit), Rally Car, and Bicycle Racing Tour d'Indonesia (sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234). Jordan Grand Prix Car Racing Team is sponsored by Benson & Hedges (with British American Tobacco, Gallaher Group, and Japan Tobacco) from 1996-2005 with tagline : "Be On Edge" (Benson & Hedges). Philip Morris Dragon Boat is sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234.

Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) is an American global cigarette and tobacco company, with products sold in over 180 countries outside the United States. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro.
Until a spin-off in March 2008, Philip Morris International was an operating company of Altria Group. Altria explained the spin-off, arguing PMI would have more "freedom" outside the constraints of US corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to "pursue sales growth in emerging markets.", while Altria focuses on the United States.[2] The shareholders in Altria at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.
The company's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, although the corporate headquarters remain in New York. It does not operate in the United States, with Philip Morris brands there still owned by PMI's former owner Altria.
Because tobacco, the main constituent of cigarettes, is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally[3] and is addictive, the company's operations (and its competitors') are highly controversial and are increasingly the subject of litigation and restrictive legislation from governments concerned about the health impacts of its products.
Philip Morris was a long-term main sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team until 2011 and continues its association with the team as of 2017, albeit on a more low-key basis and without overt advertising.[4]

History[edit]
The company states its history is traced to a London tobacconist's, Philip Morris’s, 1847 opening of a single shop on London’s Bond Street which sold tobacco and cigarettes.[5]
The current operations center of the company is located in Lausanne, Switzerland;[6] it owns 7 of the top 15 tobacco brands in the world.[7]
In April 2014, Philip Morris announced that it would close its Moorabbin plant in Australia by the end of 2014 after operating for 60 years, due to the gradual decline of sales in the last ten years and difficulties conforming to 2010 Australian government regulation about reducing fire risks.[8]
In 2015 it sold 850 billion cigarettes.[9]

Research[edit]
PMI has a research and development program, and declares its priority to be "developing products with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases." It says the focus of the program is reducing the levels of toxic chemical compounds.[12] So far, most extensive project is IQOS - a heat not burn tobacco product. [13]
Controversies and public health disputes[edit]
Australia[edit]




Example of Australian cigarette pack with health warning, as in December 2012: a variety of warning packages are in use.


The Australian Government announced it would introduce "Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws" on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation.[14] It was one of several tobacco companies to launch legal action against the Australian Government.[15] British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking.
Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia.
On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution.[16]
On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL) issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian-based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in plain packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.[16]
The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in 2017 supported Australia's right to enforce plain packaging.[17] In 2017 PMI was instructed to pay the Australia governments legal costs, an estimated 50 million dollars.[18]
Norway[edit]
Philip Morris also sued Norway over the country's ban on displaying tobacco products in stores. It lost the case in 2012.[19]
Uruguay[edit]
In 2010, the company lobbied against Uruguay's strong anti-smoking laws[20] and filed a complaint against the country (Philip Morris v. Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty.[21] On July 8, 2016, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled in favour of Uruguay.[22]
United Kingdom[edit]
In August 2014 the company foreshadowed legal action against the UK Government if it went ahead with plans to introduce plain packaging. In a submission to the government, Philip Morris International said it would seek compensation running into "billions of pounds," if the proposed legislation went ahead.[23]
Other[edit]
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Phillip Morris along with British American Tobacco, was involved in campaigns to undermine bans against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a "'fundamentalist’ who wishes to return to sharia law," and be "a threat to existing government as” according to leaked documents.[24] A 1985 report from Philip Morris squarely blamed the World Health Organization: “This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO … The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."[24] Philip Morris has refused to comment on these findings.[24]
Philip Morris International has announced an overhaul of its human rights protections of tobacco workers in Kazakhstan and 30 other countries after critical reports.[25]
The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]
Philip Morris Sports[edit]




Marlboro sponsored Ferrari Racing Team on 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix


Philip Morris sponsored sports event include Racing, Football, Badminton, Golf, Cricket, and Ice Hockey.
Philip Morris is a long-term main sponsor of Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari.[30] The sponsorship is subliminal in the logo these days due to restriction in tobacco sponsorship, but Marlboro-branded Ferrari and McLaren cars won several world titles with famous drivers such as Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. Philip Morris also sponsored several title winners in MotoGP in road racing and Indy Cars. The Ferrari Formula One deal before direct sponsorships was banned was estimated to be worth £45 million a year as well as paying the multi-million salary of Schumacher.[31] The current deal is estimated to be even more lucrative, in spite of its logo not being legally allowed to be displayed on the car.[32]
Philip Morris Racing Team outside the global series' sponsored by Marlboro & Dji Sam Soe 234, include Motorcycle Racing (for prohibited motorcycle racing, see on Malaysian Wikipedia : [Lumba haram, and see Mat Rempit), Rally Car, and Bicycle Racing Tour d'Indonesia (sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234). Jordan Grand Prix Car Racing Team is sponsored by Benson & Hedges (with British American Tobacco, Gallaher Group, and Japan Tobacco) from 1996-2005 with tagline : "Be On Edge" (Benson & Hedges). Philip Morris Dragon Boat is sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234.

Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) is an American global cigarette and tobacco company, with products sold in over 180 countries outside the United States. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro.
Until a spin-off in March 2008, Philip Morris International was an operating company of Altria Group. Altria explained the spin-off, arguing PMI would have more "freedom" outside the constraints of US corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to "pursue sales growth in emerging markets.", while Altria focuses on the United States.[2] The shareholders in Altria at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.
The company's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, although the corporate headquarters remain in New York. It does not operate in the United States, with Philip Morris brands there still owned by PMI's former owner Altria.
Because tobacco, the main constituent of cigarettes, is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally[3] and is addictive, the company's operations (and its competitors') are highly controversial and are increasingly the subject of litigation and restrictive legislation from governments concerned about the health impacts of its products.
Philip Morris was a long-term main sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team until 2011 and continues its association with the team as of 2017, albeit on a more low-key basis and without overt advertising.[4]

History[edit]
The company states its history is traced to a London tobacconist's, Philip Morris’s, 1847 opening of a single shop on London’s Bond Street which sold tobacco and cigarettes.[5]
The current operations center of the company is located in Lausanne, Switzerland;[6] it owns 7 of the top 15 tobacco brands in the world.[7]
In April 2014, Philip Morris announced that it would close its Moorabbin plant in Australia by the end of 2014 after operating for 60 years, due to the gradual decline of sales in the last ten years and difficulties conforming to 2010 Australian government regulation about reducing fire risks.[8]
In 2015 it sold 850 billion cigarettes.[9]

The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]
Philip Morris Sports[edit]




Marlboro sponsored Ferrari Racing Team on 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix


Philip Morris sponsored sports event include Racing, Football, Badminton, Golf, Cricket, and Ice Hockey.
Philip Morris is a long-term main sponsor of Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari.[30] The sponsorship is subliminal in the logo these days due to restriction in tobacco sponsorship, but Marlboro-branded Ferrari and McLaren cars won several world titles with famous drivers such as Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. Philip Morris also sponsored several title winners in MotoGP in road racing and Indy Cars. The Ferrari Formula One deal before direct sponsorships was banned was estimated to be worth £45 million a year as well as paying the multi-million salary of Schumacher.[31] The current deal is estimated to be even more lucrative, in spite of its logo not being legally allowed to be displayed on the car.[32]
Philip Morris Racing Team outside the global series' sponsored by Marlboro & Dji Sam Soe 234, include Motorcycle Racing (for prohibited motorcycle racing, see on Malaysian Wikipedia : [Lumba haram, and see Mat Rempit), Rally Car, and Bicycle Racing Tour d'Indonesia (sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234). Jordan Grand Prix Car Racing Team is sponsored by Benson & Hedges (with British American Tobacco, Gallaher Group, and Japan Tobacco) from 1996-2005 with tagline : "Be On Edge" (Benson & Hedges). Philip Morris Dragon Boat is sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234.

Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) is an American global cigarette and tobacco company, with products sold in over 180 countries outside the United States. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro.
Until a spin-off in March 2008, Philip Morris International was an operating company of Altria Group. Altria explained the spin-off, arguing PMI would have more "freedom" outside the constraints of US corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to "pursue sales growth in emerging markets.", while Altria focuses on the United States.[2] The shareholders in Altria at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.
The company's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, although the corporate headquarters remain in New York. It does not operate in the United States, with Philip Morris brands there still owned by PMI's former owner Altria.
Because tobacco, the main constituent of cigarettes, is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally[3] and is addictive, the company's operations (and its competitors') are highly controversial and are increasingly the subject of litigation and restrictive legislation from governments concerned about the health impacts of its products.
Philip Morris was a long-term main sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team until 2011 and continues its association with the team as of 2017, albeit on a more low-key basis and without overt advertising.[4]

History[edit]
The company states its history is traced to a London tobacconist's, Philip Morris’s, 1847 opening of a single shop on London’s Bond Street which sold tobacco and cigarettes.[5]
The current operations center of the company is located in Lausanne, Switzerland;[6] it owns 7 of the top 15 tobacco brands in the world.[7]
In April 2014, Philip Morris announced that it would close its Moorabbin plant in Australia by the end of 2014 after operating for 60 years, due to the gradual decline of sales in the last ten years and difficulties conforming to 2010 Australian government regulation about reducing fire risks.[8]
In 2015 it sold 850 billion cigarettes.[9]

Research[edit]
PMI has a research and development program, and declares its priority to be "developing products with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases." It says the focus of the program is reducing the levels of toxic chemical compounds.[12] So far, most extensive project is IQOS - a heat not burn tobacco product. [13]
Controversies and public health disputes[edit]
Australia[edit]




Example of Australian cigarette pack with health warning, as in December 2012: a variety of warning packages are in use.


The Australian Government announced it would introduce "Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws" on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation.[14] It was one of several tobacco companies to launch legal action against the Australian Government.[15] British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking.
Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia.
On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution.[16]
On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL) issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian-based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in plain packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.[16]
The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in 2017 supported Australia's right to enforce plain packaging.[17] In 2017 PMI was instructed to pay the Australia governments legal costs, an estimated 50 million dollars.[18]
Norway[edit]
Philip Morris also sued Norway over the country's ban on displaying tobacco products in stores. It lost the case in 2012.[19]
Uruguay[edit]
In 2010, the company lobbied against Uruguay's strong anti-smoking laws[20] and filed a complaint against the country (Philip Morris v. Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty.[21] On July 8, 2016, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled in favour of Uruguay.[22]
United Kingdom[edit]
In August 2014 the company foreshadowed legal action against the UK Government if it went ahead with plans to introduce plain packaging. In a submission to the government, Philip Morris International said it would seek compensation running into "billions of pounds," if the proposed legislation went ahead.[23]
Other[edit]
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Phillip Morris along with British American Tobacco, was involved in campaigns to undermine bans against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a "'fundamentalist’ who wishes to return to sharia law," and be "a threat to existing government as” according to leaked documents.[24] A 1985 report from Philip Morris squarely blamed the World Health Organization: “This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO … The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."[24] Philip Morris has refused to comment on these findings.[24]
Philip Morris International has announced an overhaul of its human rights protections of tobacco workers in Kazakhstan and 30 other countries after critical reports.[25]
The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]

Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) is an American global cigarette and tobacco company, with products sold in over 180 countries outside the United States. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro.
Until a spin-off in March 2008, Philip Morris International was an operating company of Altria Group. Altria explained the spin-off, arguing PMI would have more "freedom" outside the constraints of US corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to "pursue sales growth in emerging markets.", while Altria focuses on the United States.[2] The shareholders in Altria at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.
The company's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, although the corporate headquarters remain in New York. It does not operate in the United States, with Philip Morris brands there still owned by PMI's former owner Altria.
Because tobacco, the main constituent of cigarettes, is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally[3] and is addictive, the company's operations (and its competitors') are highly controversial and are increasingly the subject of litigation and restrictive legislation from governments concerned about the health impacts of its products.
Philip Morris was a long-term main sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team until 2011 and continues its association with the team as of 2017, albeit on a more low-key basis and without overt advertising.[4]

History[edit]
The company states its history is traced to a London tobacconist's, Philip Morris’s, 1847 opening of a single shop on London’s Bond Street which sold tobacco and cigarettes.[5]
The current operations center of the company is located in Lausanne, Switzerland;[6] it owns 7 of the top 15 tobacco brands in the world.[7]
In April 2014, Philip Morris announced that it would close its Moorabbin plant in Australia by the end of 2014 after operating for 60 years, due to the gradual decline of sales in the last ten years and difficulties conforming to 2010 Australian government regulation about reducing fire risks.[8]
In 2015 it sold 850 billion cigarettes.[9]

Research[edit]
PMI has a research and development program, and declares its priority to be "developing products with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases." It says the focus of the program is reducing the levels of toxic chemical compounds.[12] So far, most extensive project is IQOS - a heat not burn tobacco product. [13]
Controversies and public health disputes[edit]
Australia[edit]




Example of Australian cigarette pack with health warning, as in December 2012: a variety of warning packages are in use.


The Australian Government announced it would introduce "Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws" on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation.[14] It was one of several tobacco companies to launch legal action against the Australian Government.[15] British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking.
Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia.
On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution.[16]
On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL) issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian-based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in plain packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.[16]
The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in 2017 supported Australia's right to enforce plain packaging.[17] In 2017 PMI was instructed to pay the Australia governments legal costs, an estimated 50 million dollars.[18]
Norway[edit]
Philip Morris also sued Norway over the country's ban on displaying tobacco products in stores. It lost the case in 2012.[19]
Uruguay[edit]
In 2010, the company lobbied against Uruguay's strong anti-smoking laws[20] and filed a complaint against the country (Philip Morris v. Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty.[21] On July 8, 2016, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled in favour of Uruguay.[22]
United Kingdom[edit]
In August 2014 the company foreshadowed legal action against the UK Government if it went ahead with plans to introduce plain packaging. In a submission to the government, Philip Morris International said it would seek compensation running into "billions of pounds," if the proposed legislation went ahead.[23]
Other[edit]
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Phillip Morris along with British American Tobacco, was involved in campaigns to undermine bans against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a "'fundamentalist’ who wishes to return to sharia law," and be "a threat to existing government as” according to leaked documents.[24] A 1985 report from Philip Morris squarely blamed the World Health Organization: “This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO … The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."[24] Philip Morris has refused to comment on these findings.[24]
Philip Morris International has announced an overhaul of its human rights protections of tobacco workers in Kazakhstan and 30 other countries after critical reports.[25]
The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]
Philip Morris Sports[edit]




Marlboro sponsored Ferrari Racing Team on 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix


Philip Morris sponsored sports event include Racing, Football, Badminton, Golf, Cricket, and Ice Hockey.
Philip Morris is a long-term main sponsor of Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari.[30] The sponsorship is subliminal in the logo these days due to restriction in tobacco sponsorship, but Marlboro-branded Ferrari and McLaren cars won several world titles with famous drivers such as Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. Philip Morris also sponsored several title winners in MotoGP in road racing and Indy Cars. The Ferrari Formula One deal before direct sponsorships was banned was estimated to be worth £45 million a year as well as paying the multi-million salary of Schumacher.[31] The current deal is estimated to be even more lucrative, in spite of its logo not being legally allowed to be displayed on the car.[32]
Philip Morris Racing Team outside the global series' sponsored by Marlboro & Dji Sam Soe 234, include Motorcycle Racing (for prohibited motorcycle racing, see on Malaysian Wikipedia : [Lumba haram, and see Mat Rempit), Rally Car, and Bicycle Racing Tour d'Indonesia (sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234). Jordan Grand Prix Car Racing Team is sponsored by Benson & Hedges (with British American Tobacco, Gallaher Group, and Japan Tobacco) from 1996-2005 with tagline : "Be On Edge" (Benson & Hedges). Philip Morris Dragon Boat is sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234.

Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) is an American global cigarette and tobacco company, with products sold in over 180 countries outside the United States. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro.
Until a spin-off in March 2008, Philip Morris International was an operating company of Altria Group. Altria explained the spin-off, arguing PMI would have more "freedom" outside the constraints of US corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to "pursue sales growth in emerging markets.", while Altria focuses on the United States.[2] The shareholders in Altria at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.
The company's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, although the corporate headquarters remain in New York. It does not operate in the United States, with Philip Morris brands there still owned by PMI's former owner Altria.
Because tobacco, the main constituent of cigarettes, is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally[3] and is addictive, the company's operations (and its competitors') are highly controversial and are increasingly the subject of litigation and restrictive legislation from governments concerned about the health impacts of its products.
Philip Morris was a long-term main sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team until 2011 and continues its association with the team as of 2017, albeit on a more low-key basis and without overt advertising.[4]

History[edit]
The company states its history is traced to a London tobacconist's, Philip Morris’s, 1847 opening of a single shop on London’s Bond Street which sold tobacco and cigarettes.[5]
The current operations center of the company is located in Lausanne, Switzerland;[6] it owns 7 of the top 15 tobacco brands in the world.[7]
In April 2014, Philip Morris announced that it would close its Moorabbin plant in Australia by the end of 2014 after operating for 60 years, due to the gradual decline of sales in the last ten years and difficulties conforming to 2010 Australian government regulation about reducing fire risks.[8]
In 2015 it sold 850 billion cigarettes.[9]

Research[edit]
PMI has a research and development program, and declares its priority to be "developing products with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases." It says the focus of the program is reducing the levels of toxic chemical compounds.[12] So far, most extensive project is IQOS - a heat not burn tobacco product. [13]
Controversies and public health disputes[edit]
Australia[edit]




Example of Australian cigarette pack with health warning, as in December 2012: a variety of warning packages are in use.


The Australian Government announced it would introduce "Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws" on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation.[14] It was one of several tobacco companies to launch legal action against the Australian Government.[15] British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking.
Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia.
On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution.[16]
On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL) issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian-based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in plain packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.[16]
The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in 2017 supported Australia's right to enforce plain packaging.[17] In 2017 PMI was instructed to pay the Australia governments legal costs, an estimated 50 million dollars.[18]
Norway[edit]
Philip Morris also sued Norway over the country's ban on displaying tobacco products in stores. It lost the case in 2012.[19]
Uruguay[edit]
In 2010, the company lobbied against Uruguay's strong anti-smoking laws[20] and filed a complaint against the country (Philip Morris v. Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty.[21] On July 8, 2016, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled in favour of Uruguay.[22]
United Kingdom[edit]
In August 2014 the company foreshadowed legal action against the UK Government if it went ahead with plans to introduce plain packaging. In a submission to the government, Philip Morris International said it would seek compensation running into "billions of pounds," if the proposed legislation went ahead.[23]
Other[edit]
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Phillip Morris along with British American Tobacco, was involved in campaigns to undermine bans against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a "'fundamentalist’ who wishes to return to sharia law," and be "a threat to existing government as” according to leaked documents.[24] A 1985 report from Philip Morris squarely blamed the World Health Organization: “This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO … The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."[24] Philip Morris has refused to comment on these findings.[24]
Philip Morris International has announced an overhaul of its human rights protections of tobacco workers in Kazakhstan and 30 other countries after critical reports.[25]
The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]
Philip Morris Sports[edit]




Marlboro sponsored Ferrari Racing Team on 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix


Philip Morris sponsored sports event include Racing, Football, Badminton, Golf, Cricket, and Ice Hockey.
Philip Morris is a long-term main sponsor of Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari.[30] The sponsorship is subliminal in the logo these days due to restriction in tobacco sponsorship, but Marlboro-branded Ferrari and McLaren cars won several world titles with famous drivers such as Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. Philip Morris also sponsored several title winners in MotoGP in road racing and Indy Cars. The Ferrari Formula One deal before direct sponsorships was banned was estimated to be worth £45 million a year as well as paying the multi-million salary of Schumacher.[31] The current deal is estimated to be even more lucrative, in spite of its logo not being legally allowed to be displayed on the car.[32]
Philip Morris Racing Team outside the global series' sponsored by Marlboro & Dji Sam Soe 234, include Motorcycle Racing (for prohibited motorcycle racing, see on Malaysian Wikipedia : [Lumba haram, and see Mat Rempit), Rally Car, and Bicycle Racing Tour d'Indonesia (sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234). Jordan Grand Prix Car Racing Team is sponsored by Benson & Hedges (with British American Tobacco, Gallaher Group, and Japan Tobacco) from 1996-2005 with tagline : "Be On Edge" (Benson & Hedges). Philip Morris Dragon Boat is sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234.

Research[edit]
PMI has a research and development program, and declares its priority to be "developing products with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases." It says the focus of the program is reducing the levels of toxic chemical compounds.[12] So far, most extensive project is IQOS - a heat not burn tobacco product. [13]
Controversies and public health disputes[edit]
Australia[edit]




Example of Australian cigarette pack with health warning, as in December 2012: a variety of warning packages are in use.


The Australian Government announced it would introduce "Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws" on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation.[14] It was one of several tobacco companies to launch legal action against the Australian Government.[15] British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking.
Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia.
On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution.[16]
On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL) issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian-based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in plain packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.[16]
The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in 2017 supported Australia's right to enforce plain packaging.[17] In 2017 PMI was instructed to pay the Australia governments legal costs, an estimated 50 million dollars.[18]
Norway[edit]
Philip Morris also sued Norway over the country's ban on displaying tobacco products in stores. It lost the case in 2012.[19]
Uruguay[edit]
In 2010, the company lobbied against Uruguay's strong anti-smoking laws[20] and filed a complaint against the country (Philip Morris v. Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty.[21] On July 8, 2016, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled in favour of Uruguay.[22]
United Kingdom[edit]
In August 2014 the company foreshadowed legal action against the UK Government if it went ahead with plans to introduce plain packaging. In a submission to the government, Philip Morris International said it would seek compensation running into "billions of pounds," if the proposed legislation went ahead.[23]
Other[edit]
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Phillip Morris along with British American Tobacco, was involved in campaigns to undermine bans against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a "'fundamentalist’ who wishes to return to sharia law," and be "a threat to existing government as” according to leaked documents.[24] A 1985 report from Philip Morris squarely blamed the World Health Organization: “This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO … The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."[24] Philip Morris has refused to comment on these findings.[24]
Philip Morris International has announced an overhaul of its human rights protections of tobacco workers in Kazakhstan and 30 other countries after critical reports.[25]
The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]
Philip Morris Sports[edit]




Marlboro sponsored Ferrari Racing Team on 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix


Philip Morris sponsored sports event include Racing, Football, Badminton, Golf, Cricket, and Ice Hockey.
Philip Morris is a long-term main sponsor of Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari.[30] The sponsorship is subliminal in the logo these days due to restriction in tobacco sponsorship, but Marlboro-branded Ferrari and McLaren cars won several world titles with famous drivers such as Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. Philip Morris also sponsored several title winners in MotoGP in road racing and Indy Cars. The Ferrari Formula One deal before direct sponsorships was banned was estimated to be worth £45 million a year as well as paying the multi-million salary of Schumacher.[31] The current deal is estimated to be even more lucrative, in spite of its logo not being legally allowed to be displayed on the car.[32]
Philip Morris Racing Team outside the global series' sponsored by Marlboro & Dji Sam Soe 234, include Motorcycle Racing (for prohibited motorcycle racing, see on Malaysian Wikipedia : [Lumba haram, and see Mat Rempit), Rally Car, and Bicycle Racing Tour d'Indonesia (sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234). Jordan Grand Prix Car Racing Team is sponsored by Benson & Hedges (with British American Tobacco, Gallaher Group, and Japan Tobacco) from 1996-2005 with tagline : "Be On Edge" (Benson & Hedges). Philip Morris Dragon Boat is sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234.

Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) is an American global cigarette and tobacco company, with products sold in over 180 countries outside the United States. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro.
Until a spin-off in March 2008, Philip Morris International was an operating company of Altria Group. Altria explained the spin-off, arguing PMI would have more "freedom" outside the constraints of US corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to "pursue sales growth in emerging markets.", while Altria focuses on the United States.[2] The shareholders in Altria at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.
The company's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, although the corporate headquarters remain in New York. It does not operate in the United States, with Philip Morris brands there still owned by PMI's former owner Altria.
Because tobacco, the main constituent of cigarettes, is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally[3] and is addictive, the company's operations (and its competitors') are highly controversial and are increasingly the subject of litigation and restrictive legislation from governments concerned about the health impacts of its products.
Philip Morris was a long-term main sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team until 2011 and continues its association with the team as of 2017, albeit on a more low-key basis and without overt advertising.[4]

History[edit]
The company states its history is traced to a London tobacconist's, Philip Morris’s, 1847 opening of a single shop on London’s Bond Street which sold tobacco and cigarettes.[5]
The current operations center of the company is located in Lausanne, Switzerland;[6] it owns 7 of the top 15 tobacco brands in the world.[7]
In April 2014, Philip Morris announced that it would close its Moorabbin plant in Australia by the end of 2014 after operating for 60 years, due to the gradual decline of sales in the last ten years and difficulties conforming to 2010 Australian government regulation about reducing fire risks.[8]
In 2015 it sold 850 billion cigarettes.[9]

Research[edit]
PMI has a research and development program, and declares its priority to be "developing products with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases." It says the focus of the program is reducing the levels of toxic chemical compounds.[12] So far, most extensive project is IQOS - a heat not burn tobacco product. [13]
Controversies and public health disputes[edit]
Australia[edit]




Example of Australian cigarette pack with health warning, as in December 2012: a variety of warning packages are in use.


The Australian Government announced it would introduce "Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws" on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation.[14] It was one of several tobacco companies to launch legal action against the Australian Government.[15] British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking.
Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia.
On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution.[16]
On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL) issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian-based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in plain packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.[16]
The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in 2017 supported Australia's right to enforce plain packaging.[17] In 2017 PMI was instructed to pay the Australia governments legal costs, an estimated 50 million dollars.[18]
Norway[edit]
Philip Morris also sued Norway over the country's ban on displaying tobacco products in stores. It lost the case in 2012.[19]
Uruguay[edit]
In 2010, the company lobbied against Uruguay's strong anti-smoking laws[20] and filed a complaint against the country (Philip Morris v. Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty.[21] On July 8, 2016, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled in favour of Uruguay.[22]
United Kingdom[edit]
In August 2014 the company foreshadowed legal action against the UK Government if it went ahead with plans to introduce plain packaging. In a submission to the government, Philip Morris International said it would seek compensation running into "billions of pounds," if the proposed legislation went ahead.[23]
Other[edit]
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Phillip Morris along with British American Tobacco, was involved in campaigns to undermine bans against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a "'fundamentalist’ who wishes to return to sharia law," and be "a threat to existing government as” according to leaked documents.[24] A 1985 report from Philip Morris squarely blamed the World Health Organization: “This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO … The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."[24] Philip Morris has refused to comment on these findings.[24]
Philip Morris International has announced an overhaul of its human rights protections of tobacco workers in Kazakhstan and 30 other countries after critical reports.[25]
The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]
Philip Morris Sports[edit]




Marlboro sponsored Ferrari Racing Team on 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix


Philip Morris sponsored sports event include Racing, Football, Badminton, Golf, Cricket, and Ice Hockey.
Philip Morris is a long-term main sponsor of Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari.[30] The sponsorship is subliminal in the logo these days due to restriction in tobacco sponsorship, but Marlboro-branded Ferrari and McLaren cars won several world titles with famous drivers such as Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. Philip Morris also sponsored several title winners in MotoGP in road racing and Indy Cars. The Ferrari Formula One deal before direct sponsorships was banned was estimated to be worth £45 million a year as well as paying the multi-million salary of Schumacher.[31] The current deal is estimated to be even more lucrative, in spite of its logo not being legally allowed to be displayed on the car.[32]
Philip Morris Racing Team outside the global series' sponsored by Marlboro & Dji Sam Soe 234, include Motorcycle Racing (for prohibited motorcycle racing, see on Malaysian Wikipedia : [Lumba haram, and see Mat Rempit), Rally Car, and Bicycle Racing Tour d'Indonesia (sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234). Jordan Grand Prix Car Racing Team is sponsored by Benson & Hedges (with British American Tobacco, Gallaher Group, and Japan Tobacco) from 1996-2005 with tagline : "Be On Edge" (Benson & Hedges). Philip Morris Dragon Boat is sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234.

Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) is an American global cigarette and tobacco company, with products sold in over 180 countries outside the United States. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro.
Until a spin-off in March 2008, Philip Morris International was an operating company of Altria Group. Altria explained the spin-off, arguing PMI would have more "freedom" outside the constraints of US corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to "pursue sales growth in emerging markets.", while Altria focuses on the United States.[2] The shareholders in Altria at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.
The company's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, although the corporate headquarters remain in New York. It does not operate in the United States, with Philip Morris brands there still owned by PMI's former owner Altria.
Because tobacco, the main constituent of cigarettes, is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally[3] and is addictive, the company's operations (and its competitors') are highly controversial and are increasingly the subject of litigation and restrictive legislation from governments concerned about the health impacts of its products.
Philip Morris was a long-term main sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team until 2011 and continues its association with the team as of 2017, albeit on a more low-key basis and without overt advertising.[4]

History[edit]
The company states its history is traced to a London tobacconist's, Philip Morris’s, 1847 opening of a single shop on London’s Bond Street which sold tobacco and cigarettes.[5]
The current operations center of the company is located in Lausanne, Switzerland;[6] it owns 7 of the top 15 tobacco brands in the world.[7]
In April 2014, Philip Morris announced that it would close its Moorabbin plant in Australia by the end of 2014 after operating for 60 years, due to the gradual decline of sales in the last ten years and difficulties conforming to 2010 Australian government regulation about reducing fire risks.[8]
In 2015 it sold 850 billion cigarettes.[9]

Research[edit]
PMI has a research and development program, and declares its priority to be "developing products with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases." It says the focus of the program is reducing the levels of toxic chemical compounds.[12] So far, most extensive project is IQOS - a heat not burn tobacco product. [13]
Controversies and public health disputes[edit]
Australia[edit]




Example of Australian cigarette pack with health warning, as in December 2012: a variety of warning packages are in use.


The Australian Government announced it would introduce "Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws" on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation.[14] It was one of several tobacco companies to launch legal action against the Australian Government.[15] British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking.
Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia.
On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution.[16]
On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL) issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian-based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in plain packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.[16]
The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in 2017 supported Australia's right to enforce plain packaging.[17] In 2017 PMI was instructed to pay the Australia governments legal costs, an estimated 50 million dollars.[18]
Norway[edit]
Philip Morris also sued Norway over the country's ban on displaying tobacco products in stores. It lost the case in 2012.[19]
Uruguay[edit]
In 2010, the company lobbied against Uruguay's strong anti-smoking laws[20] and filed a complaint against the country (Philip Morris v. Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty.[21] On July 8, 2016, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled in favour of Uruguay.[22]
United Kingdom[edit]
In August 2014 the company foreshadowed legal action against the UK Government if it went ahead with plans to introduce plain packaging. In a submission to the government, Philip Morris International said it would seek compensation running into "billions of pounds," if the proposed legislation went ahead.[23]
Other[edit]
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Phillip Morris along with British American Tobacco, was involved in campaigns to undermine bans against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a "'fundamentalist’ who wishes to return to sharia law," and be "a threat to existing government as” according to leaked documents.[24] A 1985 report from Philip Morris squarely blamed the World Health Organization: “This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO … The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."[24] Philip Morris has refused to comment on these findings.[24]
Philip Morris International has announced an overhaul of its human rights protections of tobacco workers in Kazakhstan and 30 other countries after critical reports.[25]
The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]
Philip Morris Sports[edit]




Marlboro sponsored Ferrari Racing Team on 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix


Philip Morris sponsored sports event include Racing, Football, Badminton, Golf, Cricket, and Ice Hockey.
Philip Morris is a long-term main sponsor of Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari.[30] The sponsorship is subliminal in the logo these days due to restriction in tobacco sponsorship, but Marlboro-branded Ferrari and McLaren cars won several world titles with famous drivers such as Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. Philip Morris also sponsored several title winners in MotoGP in road racing and Indy Cars. The Ferrari Formula One deal before direct sponsorships was banned was estimated to be worth £45 million a year as well as paying the multi-million salary of Schumacher.[31] The current deal is estimated to be even more lucrative, in spite of its logo not being legally allowed to be displayed on the car.[32]
Philip Morris Racing Team outside the global series' sponsored by Marlboro & Dji Sam Soe 234, include Motorcycle Racing (for prohibited motorcycle racing, see on Malaysian Wikipedia : [Lumba haram, and see Mat Rempit), Rally Car, and Bicycle Racing Tour d'Indonesia (sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234). Jordan Grand Prix Car Racing Team is sponsored by Benson & Hedges (with British American Tobacco, Gallaher Group, and Japan Tobacco) from 1996-2005 with tagline : "Be On Edge" (Benson & Hedges). Philip Morris Dragon Boat is sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234.

Tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc. said Tuesday it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market a new type of cigarette as potentially less harmful than conventional cigarettes.If the product gets clearance, Henrico County-based Altria Group Inc. — parent of top U.S. tobacco company Philip Morris USA — would have exclusive rights to sell it in the United States under a licensing agreement between the companies.Instead of burning tobacco, the alternative smoking device — called iQOS — electronically heats tobacco to produce a vapor.Philip Morris International claims the vapor has less than 10 percent of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but the FDA will have to verify that claim as part of the agency’s review of the application, which could take more than a year.Tobacco companies cannot make health-related claims about their products in the U.S. without FDA authorization.Under a 2009 federal law that gave the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products, companies can apply to the agency to market novel products as “modified risk” if they might be less hazardous to health. The FDA has not yet authorized any products as modified risk.Philip Morris International, which has its operational headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, could sell the iQOS product in the United States through Altria without making health claims, but it would still need to apply to the FDA to do so and undergo a separate approval process from the modified-risk application.Philip Morris International was spun off as a separate company from Altria Group in 2008, with Altria retaining rights to the U.S. market and Philip Morris International taking control of business in international markets.Some analysts have speculated that the two companies might reunite, given consolidation in the global tobacco industry.Getting a green light to sell the iQOS product in the United States could be a catalyst for the companies to merge, tobacco industry analyst Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo Securities wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday.“Given the companies’ history together and close working relationship now on iQOS, we continue to believe a reunification of (Philip Morris International and Altria) makes sense,” Herzog said.She estimated that 25 to 30 percent of the U.S. combustible cigarette market could be converted to iQOS by 2025.
Philip Morris International said it expects the FDA will take at least 60 days to complete an administrative review of the application. Then, the agency could take a year to make a final decision on whether to authorize the product as modified risk.Philip Morris International already sells the iQOS product without reduced harm claims in Japan, Italy and Switzerland, and in some cities in the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Portugal, Russia and Ukraine.More than 1 million smokers have switched to iQOS since it first went on sale in 2014, Bloomberg News reported. Demand has proved strongest so far in Japan, where the product has taken 5 percent of the market.Tobacco companies have been experimenting with novel products and diversifying into smokeless tobacco and electronic, “vapor” cigarettes as consumption of conventional cigarettes has declined, but the industry is divided on what alternative products might become most successful.Philip Morris International Chief Executive Officer Andre Calantzopoulos has said his company may one day stop making traditional cigarettes as the market for alternative products takes hold.

This Philip Morris International Product Is Flying Off the Shelves
The tobacco giant's strategy in emphasizing its reduced-risk portfolio is paying off.











                Dan Caplinger
            

                (TMFGalagan)



            
            Feb 3, 2017 at 10:24AM
            
            





Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) made its reputation by selling cigarettes, but the company has recently done an about-face with respect to its long-term strategy. Unlike its competitors, Philip Morris has unequivocally embraced the idea that it will eventually stop selling traditional cigarettes, instead moving to reduced-risk products that it argues have more favorable health effects and will more easily pass regulatory muster. In its full-year 2016 financial report, Philip Morris showed just how successful reduced-risk products have been, with early results from its heat-not-burn tobacco system looking extremely encouraging. Demand for iQOS devices and the specially formulated HeatSticks tobacco that the devices use has been extremely strong. Let's look more closely at how iQOS helped Philip Morris over the past year and what lies ahead for the heated-tobacco product going forward.

Image source: Philip Morris International.

Why Philip Morris International is so enthusiastic about iQOS
Philip Morris International's attitude toward reduced-risk products stems largely from the potential it has already seen in the alternative-products market. For 2016, full-year total revenue at Philip Morris climbed 4.4% on a currency-neutral basis, and CEO Andre Calantzopoulos pointed to "the strong performance of [reduced-risk products], notably HeatSticks and iQOS devices" for the gains.
In particular, Philip Morris brought in $733 million in net revenue from reduced-risk products. Although the profit margin on that revenue was fairly low, Calantzopoulos explained that the primary reason was that Philip Morris priced the iQOS device itself at an introductory discount in order to encourage smokers to switch to the heated-tobacco system. Like a razor-and-blade model, Philip Morris anticipates that margin will be more favorable with HeatSticks, and the company can also work on maximizing profit on the iQOS systems once they've gotten to be more readily available through national rollouts.
Consumers have snapped up iQOS aggressively, and that has actually proven to be a bit of a problem for Philip Morris. The company said that its HeatSticks production volume reached 7.4 billion units, reflecting its full manufacturing capacity for 2016. The CEO noted that volume "would have been much higher absent this capacity restriction, which obliged us to limit iQOS device sales in Japan since June." Market share in Japan hit 5.5% in late December, with offtake share rising to an even higher 7% level.

As the chart above shows, Japan has been the biggest success story for Philip Morris and iQOS, but it's far from the only one. In every market with a launch prior to the middle of 2016, offtake volume rose at a compounded weekly rate of 6%, which is similar to what Japan showed early on. Indeed, results in Portugal, Italy, and Romania have been particularly encouraging, and Russia has also shown substantial promise as well.
How Philip Morris intends to grow iQOS
Philip Morris International is going to move full steam ahead with iQOS as the premier product in its reduced-risk portfolio. The company has already launched iQOS in key cities within 20 different markets, including 11 in the European Union, six in the Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa segment, and Japan, New Zealand, and Canada. Philip Morris will expand its testing to go national in several of those markets, and it also intends to add another 10 to 15 new countries to the mix in 2017.
Moreover, Philip Morris is moving aggressively to meet anticipated higher demand. In 2016, the company had a capacity to produce roughly 15 billion HeatSticks. By the end of 2017, Philip Morris expects that number to have climbed to 50 billion, with 32 billion units available for commercial sale during the year. As Calantzopoulos explained, "We look forward to unleashing the true potential of iQOS once the pressure on HeatSticks capacity eases."





A big change for Philip Morris
After decades of success with traditional Marlboro cigarettes, Philip Morris is making a huge shift that shows how committed the company is to embracing the potential of reduced-risk products. A lot will depend on whether iQOS can continue to do as well as it has in early tests and get more smokers to switch from other manufacturers' cigarette brands to the heated-tobacco product in the long run.

Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) is an American global cigarette and tobacco company, with products sold in over 180 countries outside the United States. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro.
Until a spin-off in March 2008, Philip Morris International was an operating company of Altria Group. Altria explained the spin-off, arguing PMI would have more "freedom" outside the constraints of US corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to "pursue sales growth in emerging markets.", while Altria focuses on the United States.[2] The shareholders in Altria at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.
The company's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, although the corporate headquarters remain in New York. It does not operate in the United States, with Philip Morris brands there still owned by PMI's former owner Altria.
Because tobacco, the main constituent of cigarettes, is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally[3] and is addictive, the company's operations (and its competitors') are highly controversial and are increasingly the subject of litigation and restrictive legislation from governments concerned about the health impacts of its products.
Philip Morris was a long-term main sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team until 2011 and continues its association with the team as of 2017, albeit on a more low-key basis and without overt advertising.[4]

History[edit]
The company states its history is traced to a London tobacconist's, Philip Morris’s, 1847 opening of a single shop on London’s Bond Street which sold tobacco and cigarettes.[5]
The current operations center of the company is located in Lausanne, Switzerland;[6] it owns 7 of the top 15 tobacco brands in the world.[7]
In April 2014, Philip Morris announced that it would close its Moorabbin plant in Australia by the end of 2014 after operating for 60 years, due to the gradual decline of sales in the last ten years and difficulties conforming to 2010 Australian government regulation about reducing fire risks.[8]
In 2015 it sold 850 billion cigarettes.[9]

Research[edit]
PMI has a research and development program, and declares its priority to be "developing products with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases." It says the focus of the program is reducing the levels of toxic chemical compounds.[12] So far, most extensive project is IQOS - a heat not burn tobacco product. [13]
Controversies and public health disputes[edit]
Australia[edit]




Example of Australian cigarette pack with health warning, as in December 2012: a variety of warning packages are in use.


The Australian Government announced it would introduce "Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws" on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation.[14] It was one of several tobacco companies to launch legal action against the Australian Government.[15] British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking.
Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia.
On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution.[16]
On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL) issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian-based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in plain packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.[16]
The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in 2017 supported Australia's right to enforce plain packaging.[17] In 2017 PMI was instructed to pay the Australia governments legal costs, an estimated 50 million dollars.[18]
Norway[edit]
Philip Morris also sued Norway over the country's ban on displaying tobacco products in stores. It lost the case in 2012.[19]
Uruguay[edit]
In 2010, the company lobbied against Uruguay's strong anti-smoking laws[20] and filed a complaint against the country (Philip Morris v. Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty.[21] On July 8, 2016, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled in favour of Uruguay.[22]
United Kingdom[edit]
In August 2014 the company foreshadowed legal action against the UK Government if it went ahead with plans to introduce plain packaging. In a submission to the government, Philip Morris International said it would seek compensation running into "billions of pounds," if the proposed legislation went ahead.[23]
Other[edit]
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Phillip Morris along with British American Tobacco, was involved in campaigns to undermine bans against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a "'fundamentalist’ who wishes to return to sharia law," and be "a threat to existing government as” according to leaked documents.[24] A 1985 report from Philip Morris squarely blamed the World Health Organization: “This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO … The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."[24] Philip Morris has refused to comment on these findings.[24]
Philip Morris International has announced an overhaul of its human rights protections of tobacco workers in Kazakhstan and 30 other countries after critical reports.[25]
The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]
Philip Morris Sports[edit]




Marlboro sponsored Ferrari Racing Team on 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix


Philip Morris sponsored sports event include Racing, Football, Badminton, Golf, Cricket, and Ice Hockey.
Philip Morris is a long-term main sponsor of Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari.[30] The sponsorship is subliminal in the logo these days due to restriction in tobacco sponsorship, but Marlboro-branded Ferrari and McLaren cars won several world titles with famous drivers such as Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. Philip Morris also sponsored several title winners in MotoGP in road racing and Indy Cars. The Ferrari Formula One deal before direct sponsorships was banned was estimated to be worth £45 million a year as well as paying the multi-million salary of Schumacher.[31] The current deal is estimated to be even more lucrative, in spite of its logo not being legally allowed to be displayed on the car.[32]
Philip Morris Racing Team outside the global series' sponsored by Marlboro & Dji Sam Soe 234, include Motorcycle Racing (for prohibited motorcycle racing, see on Malaysian Wikipedia : [Lumba haram, and see Mat Rempit), Rally Car, and Bicycle Racing Tour d'Indonesia (sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234). Jordan Grand Prix Car Racing Team is sponsored by Benson & Hedges (with British American Tobacco, Gallaher Group, and Japan Tobacco) from 1996-2005 with tagline : "Be On Edge" (Benson & Hedges). Philip Morris Dragon Boat is sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234.

Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) is an American global cigarette and tobacco company, with products sold in over 180 countries outside the United States. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro.
Until a spin-off in March 2008, Philip Morris International was an operating company of Altria Group. Altria explained the spin-off, arguing PMI would have more "freedom" outside the constraints of US corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to "pursue sales growth in emerging markets.", while Altria focuses on the United States.[2] The shareholders in Altria at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.
The company's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, although the corporate headquarters remain in New York. It does not operate in the United States, with Philip Morris brands there still owned by PMI's former owner Altria.
Because tobacco, the main constituent of cigarettes, is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally[3] and is addictive, the company's operations (and its competitors') are highly controversial and are increasingly the subject of litigation and restrictive legislation from governments concerned about the health impacts of its products.
Philip Morris was a long-term main sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team until 2011 and continues its association with the team as of 2017, albeit on a more low-key basis and without overt advertising.[4]

History[edit]
The company states its history is traced to a London tobacconist's, Philip Morris’s, 1847 opening of a single shop on London’s Bond Street which sold tobacco and cigarettes.[5]
The current operations center of the company is located in Lausanne, Switzerland;[6] it owns 7 of the top 15 tobacco brands in the world.[7]
In April 2014, Philip Morris announced that it would close its Moorabbin plant in Australia by the end of 2014 after operating for 60 years, due to the gradual decline of sales in the last ten years and difficulties conforming to 2010 Australian government regulation about reducing fire risks.[8]
In 2015 it sold 850 billion cigarettes.[9]

Research[edit]
PMI has a research and development program, and declares its priority to be "developing products with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases." It says the focus of the program is reducing the levels of toxic chemical compounds.[12] So far, most extensive project is IQOS - a heat not burn tobacco product. [13]
Controversies and public health disputes[edit]
Australia[edit]




Example of Australian cigarette pack with health warning, as in December 2012: a variety of warning packages are in use.


The Australian Government announced it would introduce "Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws" on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation.[14] It was one of several tobacco companies to launch legal action against the Australian Government.[15] British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking.
Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia.
On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution.[16]
On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL) issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian-based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in plain packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.[16]
The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in 2017 supported Australia's right to enforce plain packaging.[17] In 2017 PMI was instructed to pay the Australia governments legal costs, an estimated 50 million dollars.[18]
Norway[edit]
Philip Morris also sued Norway over the country's ban on displaying tobacco products in stores. It lost the case in 2012.[19]
Uruguay[edit]
In 2010, the company lobbied against Uruguay's strong anti-smoking laws[20] and filed a complaint against the country (Philip Morris v. Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty.[21] On July 8, 2016, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled in favour of Uruguay.[22]
United Kingdom[edit]
In August 2014 the company foreshadowed legal action against the UK Government if it went ahead with plans to introduce plain packaging. In a submission to the government, Philip Morris International said it would seek compensation running into "billions of pounds," if the proposed legislation went ahead.[23]
Other[edit]
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Phillip Morris along with British American Tobacco, was involved in campaigns to undermine bans against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a "'fundamentalist’ who wishes to return to sharia law," and be "a threat to existing government as” according to leaked documents.[24] A 1985 report from Philip Morris squarely blamed the World Health Organization: “This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO … The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."[24] Philip Morris has refused to comment on these findings.[24]
Philip Morris International has announced an overhaul of its human rights protections of tobacco workers in Kazakhstan and 30 other countries after critical reports.[25]
The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]
Philip Morris Sports[edit]




Marlboro sponsored Ferrari Racing Team on 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix


Philip Morris sponsored sports event include Racing, Football, Badminton, Golf, Cricket, and Ice Hockey.
Philip Morris is a long-term main sponsor of Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari.[30] The sponsorship is subliminal in the logo these days due to restriction in tobacco sponsorship, but Marlboro-branded Ferrari and McLaren cars won several world titles with famous drivers such as Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. Philip Morris also sponsored several title winners in MotoGP in road racing and Indy Cars. The Ferrari Formula One deal before direct sponsorships was banned was estimated to be worth £45 million a year as well as paying the multi-million salary of Schumacher.[31] The current deal is estimated to be even more lucrative, in spite of its logo not being legally allowed to be displayed on the car.[32]
Philip Morris Racing Team outside the global series' sponsored by Marlboro & Dji Sam Soe 234, include Motorcycle Racing (for prohibited motorcycle racing, see on Malaysian Wikipedia : [Lumba haram, and see Mat Rempit), Rally Car, and Bicycle Racing Tour d'Indonesia (sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234). Jordan Grand Prix Car Racing Team is sponsored by Benson & Hedges (with British American Tobacco, Gallaher Group, and Japan Tobacco) from 1996-2005 with tagline : "Be On Edge" (Benson & Hedges). Philip Morris Dragon Boat is sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234.

Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) is an American global cigarette and tobacco company, with products sold in over 180 countries outside the United States. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro.
Until a spin-off in March 2008, Philip Morris International was an operating company of Altria Group. Altria explained the spin-off, arguing PMI would have more "freedom" outside the constraints of US corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to "pursue sales growth in emerging markets.", while Altria focuses on the United States.[2] The shareholders in Altria at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.
The company's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, although the corporate headquarters remain in New York. It does not operate in the United States, with Philip Morris brands there still owned by PMI's former owner Altria.
Because tobacco, the main constituent of cigarettes, is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally[3] and is addictive, the company's operations (and its competitors') are highly controversial and are increasingly the subject of litigation and restrictive legislation from governments concerned about the health impacts of its products.
Philip Morris was a long-term main sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team until 2011 and continues its association with the team as of 2017, albeit on a more low-key basis and without overt advertising.[4]

History[edit]
The company states its history is traced to a London tobacconist's, Philip Morris’s, 1847 opening of a single shop on London’s Bond Street which sold tobacco and cigarettes.[5]
The current operations center of the company is located in Lausanne, Switzerland;[6] it owns 7 of the top 15 tobacco brands in the world.[7]
In April 2014, Philip Morris announced that it would close its Moorabbin plant in Australia by the end of 2014 after operating for 60 years, due to the gradual decline of sales in the last ten years and difficulties conforming to 2010 Australian government regulation about reducing fire risks.[8]
In 2015 it sold 850 billion cigarettes.[9]

Research[edit]
PMI has a research and development program, and declares its priority to be "developing products with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases." It says the focus of the program is reducing the levels of toxic chemical compounds.[12] So far, most extensive project is IQOS - a heat not burn tobacco product. [13]
Controversies and public health disputes[edit]
Australia[edit]




Example of Australian cigarette pack with health warning, as in December 2012: a variety of warning packages are in use.


The Australian Government announced it would introduce "Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws" on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation.[14] It was one of several tobacco companies to launch legal action against the Australian Government.[15] British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking.
Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia.
On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution.[16]
On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL) issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian-based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in plain packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.[16]
The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in 2017 supported Australia's right to enforce plain packaging.[17] In 2017 PMI was instructed to pay the Australia governments legal costs, an estimated 50 million dollars.[18]
Norway[edit]
Philip Morris also sued Norway over the country's ban on displaying tobacco products in stores. It lost the case in 2012.[19]
Uruguay[edit]
In 2010, the company lobbied against Uruguay's strong anti-smoking laws[20] and filed a complaint against the country (Philip Morris v. Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty.[21] On July 8, 2016, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled in favour of Uruguay.[22]
United Kingdom[edit]
In August 2014 the company foreshadowed legal action against the UK Government if it went ahead with plans to introduce plain packaging. In a submission to the government, Philip Morris International said it would seek compensation running into "billions of pounds," if the proposed legislation went ahead.[23]
Other[edit]
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Phillip Morris along with British American Tobacco, was involved in campaigns to undermine bans against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a "'fundamentalist’ who wishes to return to sharia law," and be "a threat to existing government as” according to leaked documents.[24] A 1985 report from Philip Morris squarely blamed the World Health Organization: “This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO … The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."[24] Philip Morris has refused to comment on these findings.[24]
Philip Morris International has announced an overhaul of its human rights protections of tobacco workers in Kazakhstan and 30 other countries after critical reports.[25]
The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]
Philip Morris Sports[edit]




Marlboro sponsored Ferrari Racing Team on 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix


Philip Morris sponsored sports event include Racing, Football, Badminton, Golf, Cricket, and Ice Hockey.
Philip Morris is a long-term main sponsor of Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari.[30] The sponsorship is subliminal in the logo these days due to restriction in tobacco sponsorship, but Marlboro-branded Ferrari and McLaren cars won several world titles with famous drivers such as Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. Philip Morris also sponsored several title winners in MotoGP in road racing and Indy Cars. The Ferrari Formula One deal before direct sponsorships was banned was estimated to be worth £45 million a year as well as paying the multi-million salary of Schumacher.[31] The current deal is estimated to be even more lucrative, in spite of its logo not being legally allowed to be displayed on the car.[32]
Philip Morris Racing Team outside the global series' sponsored by Marlboro & Dji Sam Soe 234, include Motorcycle Racing (for prohibited motorcycle racing, see on Malaysian Wikipedia : [Lumba haram, and see Mat Rempit), Rally Car, and Bicycle Racing Tour d'Indonesia (sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234). Jordan Grand Prix Car Racing Team is sponsored by Benson & Hedges (with British American Tobacco, Gallaher Group, and Japan Tobacco) from 1996-2005 with tagline : "Be On Edge" (Benson & Hedges). Philip Morris Dragon Boat is sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234.

Business/July 28, 2017/31 views /NYSE:PMPhilip Morris International Inc.Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) Focus On Smoke-Free Product Facilityshare on:FacebookTwitterPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is planning to invest around €490 million to transform its cigarette manufacturing factory in Otopeni, near Bucharest, into a high-tech facility to produce HEETS, the tobacco segments used with the IQOS. The transformation of the factory into a HEETS manufacturing facility has already started and is anticipated to be fully operational and completed by 2020. This investment will create around 300 additional professions for highly-skilled personnel at the Romanian facility, which presently employs around 600 people.
The details
Romania will become a part of growing list of nations where Philip Morris produces heated tobacco segments for IQOS. The company also reported plans to execute two new high-tech manufacturing lines in Neuchâtel, to manufacture HEETS.
In June, Philip Morris reported that it would expand capacity at the firm’s heated tobacco unit production facility in Bologna, and also reported plans to establish a new center for HEETS in Dresden. In addition, the company will also convert its cigarette facilities in Russia and Greece by the close of 2018. It intends to have a total yearly installed capacity of around 100 billion heated tobacco segments.
HEETS and IQOS have been accessible in 16 towns throughout Romania from the start of this year. IQOS is presently accessible in major cities in over 27 markets across the world and is anticipated to be accessible in 30-35 markets, either major cities or countrywide by the close of 2017, as capacity allows.
Commenting on this update, André Calantzopoulos, the CEO of Philip Morris, reported that their investment in Romania further exhibits their commitment to an imminent period in which smoke-free offerings ultimately replace cigarettes. They are thrilled the 2.9 million smokers across the globe who have already left smoking and moved to IQOS. The company anticipate this momentum to continue and the transformation of the Romanian facility will assist them to meet the increasing demand from adult smokers for better options to cigarettes.

Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) is an American global cigarette and tobacco company, with products sold in over 180 countries outside the United States. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro.
Until a spin-off in March 2008, Philip Morris International was an operating company of Altria Group. Altria explained the spin-off, arguing PMI would have more "freedom" outside the constraints of US corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to "pursue sales growth in emerging markets.", while Altria focuses on the United States.[2] The shareholders in Altria at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.
The company's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland, although the corporate headquarters remain in New York. It does not operate in the United States, with Philip Morris brands there still owned by PMI's former owner Altria.
Because tobacco, the main constituent of cigarettes, is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally[3] and is addictive, the company's operations (and its competitors') are highly controversial and are increasingly the subject of litigation and restrictive legislation from governments concerned about the health impacts of its products.
Philip Morris was a long-term main sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team until 2011 and continues its association with the team as of 2017, albeit on a more low-key basis and without overt advertising.[4]

History[edit]
The company states its history is traced to a London tobacconist's, Philip Morris’s, 1847 opening of a single shop on London’s Bond Street which sold tobacco and cigarettes.[5]
The current operations center of the company is located in Lausanne, Switzerland;[6] it owns 7 of the top 15 tobacco brands in the world.[7]
In April 2014, Philip Morris announced that it would close its Moorabbin plant in Australia by the end of 2014 after operating for 60 years, due to the gradual decline of sales in the last ten years and difficulties conforming to 2010 Australian government regulation about reducing fire risks.[8]
In 2015 it sold 850 billion cigarettes.[9]

Research[edit]
PMI has a research and development program, and declares its priority to be "developing products with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases." It says the focus of the program is reducing the levels of toxic chemical compounds.[12] So far, most extensive project is IQOS - a heat not burn tobacco product. [13]
Controversies and public health disputes[edit]
Australia[edit]




Example of Australian cigarette pack with health warning, as in December 2012: a variety of warning packages are in use.


The Australian Government announced it would introduce "Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws" on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation.[14] It was one of several tobacco companies to launch legal action against the Australian Government.[15] British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking.
Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia.
On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution.[16]
On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL) issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian-based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in plain packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.[16]
The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in 2017 supported Australia's right to enforce plain packaging.[17] In 2017 PMI was instructed to pay the Australia governments legal costs, an estimated 50 million dollars.[18]
Norway[edit]
Philip Morris also sued Norway over the country's ban on displaying tobacco products in stores. It lost the case in 2012.[19]
Uruguay[edit]
In 2010, the company lobbied against Uruguay's strong anti-smoking laws[20] and filed a complaint against the country (Philip Morris v. Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty.[21] On July 8, 2016, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled in favour of Uruguay.[22]
United Kingdom[edit]
In August 2014 the company foreshadowed legal action against the UK Government if it went ahead with plans to introduce plain packaging. In a submission to the government, Philip Morris International said it would seek compensation running into "billions of pounds," if the proposed legislation went ahead.[23]
Other[edit]
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Phillip Morris along with British American Tobacco, was involved in campaigns to undermine bans against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a "'fundamentalist’ who wishes to return to sharia law," and be "a threat to existing government as” according to leaked documents.[24] A 1985 report from Philip Morris squarely blamed the World Health Organization: “This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO … The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."[24] Philip Morris has refused to comment on these findings.[24]
Philip Morris International has announced an overhaul of its human rights protections of tobacco workers in Kazakhstan and 30 other countries after critical reports.[25]
The company runs an information web site outlining the health issues of tobacco. However, it has been criticised in an article in the journal Public Health Nursing as merely a "public relations effort" intended to "undermine public health".[26]
In the 1930s, the company's tobacco advertisements were a steady source of income for numerous medical organizations and journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).[27]
In February 2015, John Oliver highlighted the company's many international legal cases on an episode of his television show Last Week Tonight. He also attempted to raise awareness for his campaign using the hashtag #JeffWeCan.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]
The company says it gives $25 million per year (approximately 0.29% of 2013 net income) to charitable causes including domestic violence, emergency housing, education, combating poverty, and teaching sustainable agriculture techniques in Africa.[29]
Philip Morris Sports[edit]




Marlboro sponsored Ferrari Racing Team on 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix


Philip Morris sponsored sports event include Racing, Football, Badminton, Golf, Cricket, and Ice Hockey.
Philip Morris is a long-term main sponsor of Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari.[30] The sponsorship is subliminal in the logo these days due to restriction in tobacco sponsorship, but Marlboro-branded Ferrari and McLaren cars won several world titles with famous drivers such as Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. Philip Morris also sponsored several title winners in MotoGP in road racing and Indy Cars. The Ferrari Formula One deal before direct sponsorships was banned was estimated to be worth £45 million a year as well as paying the multi-million salary of Schumacher.[31] The current deal is estimated to be even more lucrative, in spite of its logo not being legally allowed to be displayed on the car.[32]
Philip Morris Racing Team outside the global series' sponsored by Marlboro & Dji Sam Soe 234, include Motorcycle Racing (for prohibited motorcycle racing, see on Malaysian Wikipedia : [Lumba haram, and see Mat Rempit), Rally Car, and Bicycle Racing Tour d'Indonesia (sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234). Jordan Grand Prix Car Racing Team is sponsored by Benson & Hedges (with British American Tobacco, Gallaher Group, and Japan Tobacco) from 1996-2005 with tagline : "Be On Edge" (Benson & Hedges). Philip Morris Dragon Boat is sponsored by Dji Sam Soe 234.

(PMI) (NYSE/Euronext Paris: PM) announces plans to invest approximately USD 320 million in a new high-tech facility in Dresden, Germany, to produce HEETS, the tobacco units to be used with the electronic tobacco heating device IQOS.Construction of the 80,000 m2 facility is scheduled to begin in late 2017. Once fully operational in early 2019, the factory is expected to employ about 500 people.IQOS and HEETS have been available for adult smokers in Germany since June 2016, starting with pilot commercialization in Munich, Frankfurt and Berlin. IQOS is currently available in key cities in more than 25 markets around the world. Commenting on the announcement, André Calantzopoulos, PMI’s Chief Executive Officer, said:“This investment represents another step towards a future in which smoke-free products replace cigarettes. Already, over two million people have given up smoking and switched to IQOS, and we know this is just the beginning. We are fully committed to meet smoker demand for potentially less harmful alternatives to cigarettes.”Frederic de Wilde, President of PMI’s European Union Region added:“We are encouraged by the successful launch of IQOS in Germany and its performance in other European countries. Europe has become a hub for PMI’s research, development and investment in better alternatives to cigarettes.”With this announcement, Germany will join a growing list of countries where PMI manufactures tobacco units for IQOS, including Italy and Switzerland. In addition, PMI recently announced the conversion of the cigarette manufacturing facility of its affiliate in Greece. By the end of 2018, PMI plans to have a total annual installed capacity of heated tobacco units of approximately 100 billion units.IQOS is one of four scientifically substantiated smoke-free product platforms that PMI is developing to address adult smoker demand for better alternatives to cigarettes.Since 2008, PMI has hired more than 400 scientists and experts and invested over USD 3 billion in research, product development and scientific substantiation for smoke-free products. The company openly shares its scientific methodologies and findings for independent third-party review and verification, and has published its research in over 200 articles and book chapters since 2011.

Philip Morris International to Convert Cigarette Factory in Romania 
      into Smoke-Free Product Facility





        Another step towards a smoke-free future
      

        €490 million planned investment.
      

        300 new jobs to be created
      






July 25, 2017 03:57 AM Eastern Daylight Time



LAUSANNE, Switzerland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE/Euronext Paris: PM) is 
      planning to invest approximately €490 million to transform its cigarette 
      production factory in Otopeni, near Bucharest, Romania into a high-tech 
      facility to manufacture HEETS, the tobacco units used with the 
      electronic tobacco heating device IQOS.
    

      The conversion of the factory into a HEETS production facility 
      has already commenced and is expected to be completed and fully 
      operational by 2020.
    

      The investment will create about 300 additional jobs for highly-skilled 
      employees at the Romanian facility, which currently employs 
      approximately 600 people.
    

      Romania will join a growing list of countries where PMI manufactures 
      heated tobacco units for IQOS. Earlier this month, PMI announced 
      plans to install two new high-tech production lines in Neuchâtel, 
      Switzerland, to produce HEETS.
    

      In June, PMI announced it would expand capacity at the company’s 
      heated tobacco unit manufacturing facility in Bologna, Italy and also 
      announced plans to build a new facility for HEETS in Dresden, 
      Germany. In addition, PMI will also convert its cigarette factories in 
      Greece and Russia and by the end of 2018, PMI plans to have a total 
      annual installed capacity of approximately 100 billion heated tobacco 
      units.
    

IQOS and HEETS have been available for adult smokers in 
      Bucharest since November 2015 and in 16 cities throughout Romania from 
      the beginning of this year. IQOS is currently available in key 
      cities in more than 27 markets around the world and is expected to be 
      available in 30-35 markets, either key cities or nationwide by the end 
      of 2017, as capacity permits.
    

      Commenting on this announcement, André Calantzopoulos, PMI’s Chief 
      Executive Officer, said:
    

      “Our investment in Romania further demonstrates our commitment to a 
      future in which smoke-free products ultimately replace cigarettes. We 
      are encouraged by the 2.9 million smokers around the world who have 
      already given up smoking and switched to IQOS. We expect this momentum 
      to continue and the conversion of the Romanian facility will help us to 
      meet the growing demand from adult smokers for better alternatives to 
      cigarettes.”


IQOS is one of four scientifically substantiated smoke-free 
      product platforms that PMI is developing to address adult smoker demand 
      for better alternatives to cigarettes.
    

      Since 2008, PMI has hired more than 400 scientists and experts and 
      invested over USD 3 billion in research, product development and 
      scientific substantiation for smoke-free products. The company openly 
      shares its scientific methodologies and findings for independent 
      third-party review and verification, and has published its research in 
      over 200 articles and book chapters since 2011. Results of scientific 
      research conducted by PMI to date indicate that IQOS is likely to 
      reduce the risk of harm compared to cigarette smoking, and is a better 
      choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke.
