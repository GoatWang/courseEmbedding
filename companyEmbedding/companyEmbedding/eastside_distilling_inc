Eastside Distilling Inc : Eastside Distilling Reports Successful Launch of Big Bottom Products into Eastside's Tasting Rooms

PORTLAND, OR / ACCESSWIRE / June 19, 2017 / Eastside Distilling, Inc. (OTCQB: ESDID) (OTCQB: ESDI) ("Eastside" or the "Company"), a producer of award-winning craft spirits, announced today that the recent placement of Big Bottom Distilling's products into Eastside's existing Oregon retail tasting locations has exceeded expectations. Since launching the products into the tasting locations at the beginning of June 2017, Big Bottom product unit sales numbers are on track to be up by more than 200% over June of last year.
Eastside Distilling acquired a majority stake in Big Bottom Distilling on May 1, 2017. The extensive Big Bottom Distilling product portfolio includes several craft spirits that are highly complementary to Eastside's product line, including The Ninety-One Gin, Navy Strength Gin (114 proof), Delta Rye (111 proof) rye whiskey, and Calhoun Brothers Aged Rum, among others.
Grover Wickersham, Chairman of Eastside Distilling, said, "We are pleased our acquisition thesis of acquiring a smaller, super-premium brand, distributing it through Eastside's larger distribution and increasing sales is proving out quickly. Big Bottom's Ninety-One Gin, in particular, has been especially popular. I expect to see continued success when the resources of the Eastside wholesale sales team are brought to bear in the next phase of our integration of the Big Bottom line."
"Although the liquor industry has seen tremendous growth in craft spirits as a total percentage," Mr. Wickersham continued. "Many of the individual firms have limited distributions opportunities and few financial resources. We will continue identifying additional potential acquisition opportunities within the craft industry."
"We believe there is an opportunity for Eastside Distilling to grow its family of craft spirits producers, while continuing to add great people to our management team, like Travis Schoney, Big Bottom's Lead Distiller, formerly of High West Distilling."
"Our biggest problem with the Big Bottom acquisition so far is keeping the products in stock. Travis is working overtime making Ninety One Gin to keep up with demand. It is gratifying to our team that our products inspire this level of passion in customers. I believe the Big Bottom acquisition will be immediately accretive to Eastside's operating results," concluded Mr. Wickersham.

Eastside Distilling Reports Success With Big Bottom Products

Press Release Jun. 21, 2017 at 10:49 am









        More 











PORTLAND, OR — June 19, 2017 — Eastside Distilling, Inc. (OTCQB: ESDI)(“Eastside” or the “Company”), a producer of award-winning craft spirits, announced today that the recent placement of Big Bottom Distilling’s products into Eastside’s existing Oregon retail tasting locations has exceeded expectations.  Since launching the products into the tasting locations at the beginning of June 2017, Big Bottom product unit sales numbers are on track to be up by more than 200% over June of last year.
Eastside Distilling acquired a majority stake in Big Bottom Distilling on May 1, 2017.  The extensive Big Bottom Distilling product portfolio includes several craft spirits that are highly complementary to Eastside’s product line, including The Ninety-One Gin, Navy Strength Gin (114 proof), Delta Rye (111 proof) rye whiskey, and Calhoun Brothers Aged Rum, among others.

Grover Wickersham, Chairman of Eastside Distilling, said, “We are pleased our acquisition thesis of acquiring a smaller, super-premium brand, distributing it through Eastside’s larger distribution and increasing sales is proving out quickly. Big Bottom’s Ninety-One Gin, in particular, has been especially popular.  I expect to see continued success when the resources of the Eastside wholesale sales team are brought to bear in the next phase of our integration of the Big Bottom line.”
“Although the liquor industry has seen tremendous growth in craft spirits as a total percentage,” Mr. Wickersham continued, “many of the individual firms have limited distributions opportunities and few financial resources. We will continue identifying additional potential acquisition opportunities within the craft industry.”
“We believe there is an opportunity for Eastside Distilling to grow its family of craft spirits producers, while continuing to add great people to our management team, like Travis Schoney, Big Bottom’s Lead Distiller, formerly of High West Distilling.”
“Our biggest problem with the Big Bottom acquisition so far is keeping the products in stock. Travis is working overtime making Ninety One Gin to keep up with demand. It is gratifying to our team that our products inspire this level of passion in customers. I believe the Big Bottom acquisition will be immediately accretive to Eastside’s operating results,” concluded Mr. Wickersham.

The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
