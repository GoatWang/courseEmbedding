Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

     Nature of Business and Organization  VW Win Century, Inc. ("VW Win Century" or the "Company"), an Illinois corporation, was formed on March 3, 2013 as Cooling Technology Solutions, Inc. ("CTS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Epazz, Inc. ("Epazz"), an Illinois corporation. On September 19, 2013, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change the name from Cooling Technology Solutions, Inc. to Z Fridge, Inc. and was renamed Flexfridge, Inc. on May 29, 2014 and further renamed on September 12, 2016 to VW Win Century, Inc.   On September 7, 2013, the sole Director, and majority shareholder, holding over two thirds of the voting power of the Corporation's Class A and Class B Common Stock of Epazz, voted to approve the spin-off and stock dividend of Z Fridge, whereby each of Epazz' shareholders of record on September 15, 2013 received 1 share of Z Fridge for each 10 shares of Epazz Class A Common Stock as distributed on November 21, 2013.   On or about August 26, 2016, Shaun Passley, our former officer and director sold an aggregate of Two Hundred Sixty Two Million Nine Hundred Nine Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Five (262,909,255) shares of the Class A Common Stock of the Company (or 525,819 shares on a post-reverse split basis) to Teik Keng Goh in a private transaction.   As a result of the purchase, Teik Keng Goh became the majority shareholder of our Company and beneficially owned stock representing 75.45% of the issued and outstanding Class A Common Shares. In addition, Mr. Passley also sold Sixty Million (60,000,000) shares of Class B Common Stock and Twenty Million (20,000,000) shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Teik Keng Goh, representing all of the issued and outstanding shares of those series and classes.   Effective as of August 31, 2016, our board of directors appointed Teik Keng Goh and See Kuy Tan to fill vacancies on the board with Teik Keng Goh serving as Chairman.  The board of directors appointed See Kuy Tan as President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer and Kathleen Mary Johnston as Secretary of the Company.  The forgoing individuals will serve in their respective positions until their earlier resignation or removal.   In September 2016, VW Win Century Inc. acquired an OTC company named, Flexfridge Inc., which is a current reporting and fully audited company which is both DTC and DWAC eligible. Per OTC Markets, Flexfridge Inc. changed its name to VW Win Century Inc. and its OTC symbol to VWIN.  In the first quarter of 2017 the company will have acquired 100% of a Hong Kong registered company focusing on a Sturgeon Theme Park Business. The unique characteristics is that the Sturgeon Theme Park is the World’s First Sturgeon Aquaculture Theme Park.  The company intends to focus on existing opportunities in the Asian market that have above average operating margins, sustainable growth, and undervalued assets. This will insure a high potential for shareholder return. Important to this strategy is that the companies have the ability to expand into the worldwide market where they can also employ management’s highly successful entrepreneurial expertise.      Financial Reporting/Disclosure    Reporting Status U.S. Reporting: SEC Reporting   Audited Financials Audited   Latest Report Sep 30, 2016 10-Q   CIK 0001630391   Fiscal Year End 12/31   OTC Marketplace OTCQB      Profile Data    SIC - Industry Classification 3630 - Household Appliances   Incorporated In: IL, USA   Year of Inc. 2013   Employees 5 a/o Feb 16, 2016      Company Officers/Contacts    See Kuy Tan President, CEO, CFO   Kathleen Mary Johnston Secretary   W.
