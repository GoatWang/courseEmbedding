We provide this information to help Australians with their research in the intellectual property space but to also help inventors (first time or experienced) gain knowledge and make informed decisions about filing patents. Without data and insights into the industry it’s very difficult making informed decisions on the right patent attorney to use which is why beyond information we provide a service to assist individuals select the right patent attorney for them based on in-depth analytics we have compiled not just on firms but specific attorneys as it’s ultimately an individual who is going to be helping you and hence it’s individuals not firms you should be assessing. The costs associated with undertaking a patent can be significant and the process can span years so it’s extremely important to get the right partner.

My thoughts & condolences go out to all family and friends, especially Sharon & Mike & family, Laura, and also to Susan. I remember when I was little, looking forward to playing with my cousin Bradley every time we would drive back to IL to stay with my grandparents Walter & Minnie. I'll miss Bradley's Christmas cards he sent every year; it was always nice to hear from him. In deepest sympathy.

We enjoyed Bradley’s visits to us, the first when we lived in California and he came with his grandparents and Keith, when he was about 5. He visited us several times here in the Northwest, once when apricots were ripe, and he and his mother Eunice helped with drying them.  My deepest sympathy to all of you there,

My condolences to all the family in Illinois, especially Sharon and Mike, and Susan Long, and to Laura in Olympia.  I enjoyed Bradley’s occasional visits to the Northwest, and I’m sorry that we didn’t get back to Illinois more often to visit.  Some of us will be getting together tomorrow at my mother’s place, and we will be thinking of you.    My deepest sympathy,

Dear Sharon and Mike, I am so happy that I had many years of friendship with Bradley.  I will never forget the many good times.  Thank you so much for your kindness and consideration through all of this!  I am so sorry for the loss of your brother.  I have no doubt that Bradley is with Jesus and is very happy and content in His love.  I want very much to stay in touch with you.  If there is anything I can do for you just let me know.  I'll see you tomarrow.  Love, Susan

Buying Info


Videos




We can tell it's time for you to get a new watch. Fortunately, OpticsPlanet carries a wide selection of many types of wristwatch, from high performance fitness watches and GPS watches to nautical timepieces that will not only look great, but give you additional information for your next voyage on open waters. Selecting the right wrist watch for you is a matter of considering your activity, personal style and your price range. We have great options no matter what the combination of those elements you land on, but be sure to look at a few different watches before you decide. For instance, we offer GPS watches that are great for running and hiking, but there are also options available that are better suited to golf. If you find yourself needing to know the distance to the green, a golf watch will better suit you than a running watch with a built-in heart rate monitor. 

More About Watches

More and more watches today are including extra components like altimeters, GPS and pedometers, and while we have a great selection of these modern timepieces, we also strive to take care of those who want an old-fashioned watch that features advanced materials and engineering blended with a classic style. Check out some of the amazing watches from Wenger, Suunto and Garmin, and keep in mind that most orders over $49 receive Free Shipping! Still not sure what you're looking for? Check out this helpful GearExpert article on outdoor watches, or contact our product experts and they can help you find the perfect watch to fit your needs.

The Springfield is Smith & Bradley's answer to the classic American field watch that has donned the wrists of men for almost 100 years.  Inspired by the same watch US infantry was issued standard during World War II, the Springfield is a tribute to the heroes of the greatest generation.
Named after the Illinois state capital where Smith & Bradley started, the Springfield is hand built applying standards from the golden age of American watchmaking. The circa 20th century traditional military markings and technical specifications have made the original field watches highly coveted collector timepieces.

The founders of Smith & Bradley built the Springfield with the objective of enabling men to comfortably purchase a world-class timepiece that has a story to tell.  We did not sacrifice function or quality in order to deliver the Springfield at an entry level price point.  Whether you are a hardcore aficionado or simply need a dress to impress everyday watch, the Springfield's signature styling and versatility make it a must have statement timepiece.

Assignee/s:


Smith, Bradley






WO 2014/045060 PCT/GB2013/052478 Apparatus and Method for Making a Frozen Confectionary Product The present invention relates to apparatus and method for making a frozen confectionary product. US7754266 describes a method of making ice cream in which liquid nitrogen is 5 added to an unfrozen ice cream mix whilst being churned. The ice cream is made in situ within a paper cup. Liquid gas cannot be added into the bulk of the ice cream mix as the resulting rapid expansion of gas causes the ice cream mix to be projected out of the cup. Consequently, liquid gas is poured on top of the ice cream mix, freezing its upper 10 surface only. A centrifugal action from the rotation of the vessel forces the liquid-gas outwardly. This causes a build up of hard frozen ice-cream around the inside wall of the cup. The ice cream tends to freeze preferentially onto the mixing instrument. This clogging results in the frozen mix being moved around the cup on the mixing 15 instrument rather than being mixed. The epicyclic motion of the mixing instrument tends to splash liquid nitrogen sitting on the surface of the ice cream mix. A significant proportion of the splashed liquid gas is wasted as it evaporates away from the ice cream mix without contributing to the freezing process.

Existing churning apparatus moves a stirrer through the ice cream mix in an epicyclical motion. This tends to splash liquid nitrogen so that it evaporates without f4 contributing to the freezing of the ice cream. i the improved mixing method, the stirrer is repeatedly drawn against the inside wall(s) of the vessel. This reduces splashing of the liquid nitrogen. The drawing action also removes build up of frozen confectionary product on both the stirrer and the vessel walls and allows unfrozen confectionary mix to move to the edges of the vessel and be preferentially frozen.WO 2014/045060 PCT/GB2013/052478 Apparatus and Method for Making a Frozen Confectionary Product The present invention relates to apparatus and method for making a frozen confectionary product. US7754266 describes a method of making ice cream in which liquid nitrogen is 5 added to an unfrozen ice cream mix whilst being churned. The ice cream is made in situ within a paper cup. Liquid gas cannot be added into the bulk of the ice cream mix as the resulting rapid expansion of gas causes the ice cream mix to be projected out of the cup. Consequently, liquid gas is poured on top of the ice cream mix, freezing its upper 10 surface only. A centrifugal action from the rotation of the vessel forces the liquid-gas outwardly. This causes a build up of hard frozen ice-cream around the inside wall of the cup. The ice cream tends to freeze preferentially onto the mixing instrument. This clogging results in the frozen mix being moved around the cup on the mixing 15 instrument rather than being mixed. The epicyclic motion of the mixing instrument tends to splash liquid nitrogen sitting on the surface of the ice cream mix. A significant proportion of the splashed liquid gas is wasted as it evaporates away from the ice cream mix without contributing to the freezing process.WO 2014/045060 PCT/GB2013/052478 -2 According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a method of making a frozen confectionary product in which an unfrozen confectionary mix, agitated within a vessel, is cooled and frozen by a liquid gas; wherein an agitator agitating the mix has a motion which comprises repeatedly drawing the agitator substantially against an 5 inside wall of the vessel. The invention is particularly beneficial in the manufacture of personal sized portions of confectionary mixture as it significantly reduces the amount of splashing of both liquid gas and confectionary mix. Additionally, the contact between the agitator and the vessel removes build up of frozen mix on both parts thereby allowing: unfrozen 10 mix to move to the edges of the vessel and be preferentially frozen, and reducing the likelihood of mix clogging onto the agitator. It is preferred that the motion comprises repeatedly drawing the agitator substantially against a side wall of the vessel. It is preferred that the agitator is moved relative to the vessel in order to contact the 15 vessel wall, however it may be possible to move the vessel to the agitator, or both the agitator and vessel in order to achieve the same effect. Preferably the vessel is rotated in order that a subsequent motion causes the agitator to draw against a different portion of the inside wall of the vessel. In this preferred 20 method, substantially all of the circumference of the inside wall is scraped by the agitator.WO 2014/045060 PCT/GB2013/052478 -3 It is preferred that the agitator is drawn downwardly against the side wall of the vessel towards the base of the vessel. Preferably contact of the agitator and the vessel's inside wall starts above or substantially near the surface of the confectionary mix, and the agitator then drawn downwardly through the confectionary mix. 5 In order to increase the amount of mixing, it is preferred that the motion comprises an opposing movement in which the agitator moves away from the inside wall of the vessel. Preferably this is combined with an upward movement in order to bring the agitator out from the confectionary mix. 10 The supply of liquid gas in the apparatus described in US7754266 comprises a dewar vessel 6 having an outlet at its bottom and a valve 10, having a relatively large thermal mass, for controlling the flow of liquid gas through the outlet under gravity. Each time valve 10 is opened, the liquid gas the first portion of fluid will cool the valve 10 down to temperature. A portion of the liquid is wasted as it evaporates 15 during cooling of the valve 10. This also creates a delay in the supply of liquid gas to the vessel until the valve has cooled sufficiently. According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a reservoir for holding a liquid gas the reservoir having: 20 an outlet for allowing liquid gas to flow out from the reservoir; a valve, having a valve body, to control the flow of fluid through the outlet, the valve body being located within the reservoir so that when theWO 2014/045060 PCT/GB2013/052478 -4 reservoir is filled at least one outer surface in contact with liquid gas within the reservoir. Because the valve body is located within the reservoir, in contact with the liquid gas, the valve body is cooled down substantially to the temperature of the liquid gas. 5 When it is required to dispense an amount of liquid gas from the reservoir, none of the dispensed liquid is wasted through cooling of the valve body. As well as reducing waste of liquid gas, it also reduces the delay between opening the valve and liquid gas being dispensed to the confectionary mix. 10 It is preferred that the valve body is arranged to be at least partly submerged in the liquid gas. The invention will now be described by example with reference to the following figures in which: 15 Figure 1 is a schematic of apparatus for manufacturing a frozen confectionary product; Figure 2 is a perspective view of the mixer and vessel of Figure 1; Figure 3 is a further perspective view of the mixer and vessel of Figure 1; 20 Figures 4A-4H are side elevations of a mixer and vessel illustrating the motion of the agitator during mixing; and Figure 5 is a schematic of apparatus for manufacturing a frozen confectionary product which includes multiple mixers.WO 2014/045060 PCT/GB2013/052478 -5 Referring to Fig 1 there is illustrated schematically, apparatus for making a frozen confectionary product, such as ice cream. In overview, the apparatus comprises a paper cup 26 (or other vessel) for holding a single portion of confection mix 26A and 5 a mixer 20 having a mixing element 24 for mixing the confection mix within the cup 26 and means to supply a liquid gas into the cup 26 to freeze the confectionary mix. In detail, there is shown a dewer 1 holding a supply of liquid gas, commonly liquid nitrogen, a pump 2 for pressurizing the liquid gas within the dewer 1, a thermally insulated conduit 3 for carrying liquid gas under pressure from the dewer 1 to a 10 reservoir 4. The reservoir 4 comprises a thermally insulated container. In this instance the reservoir 4 comprises nested walls 4A, 4B, the cavity 4C therebetween between being partially evacuated. The reservoir 4 comprise an inlet 5 for receiving liquid gas from dewar 1, and a thermally insulated conduit 6 passing through walls 4A, 4B forming an outlet. Conduit 6 guides flow of the liquid gas from the reservoir 4 15 to mixing cup 26. In this example the conduit 6 passes through lower portion of walls 4A, 4B, though in alternative embodiments it may pass through an upper portion. Within the reservoir cavity formed within wall 4B sits a valve 7 comprising an inlet conduit 7A, valve casing 7B and valve element 7C operated by a solenoid mechanism 20 8. A further opening is formed in upper portions of walls 4A, 4B which provides an air vent 9. The vent may be opened or closed by a float valve 10. In operation liquid gas pressurised within dewar 1 flows along conduit 3 into and fills reservoir 4. The vent 9, which is open during the filling process, allows evaporated liquid gas to escape from the reservoir cavity 4. This is particularly important at theWO 2014/045060 PCT/GB2013/052478 -6 start of the filling process because a substantial volume of gas will be generated as the inner wall 4B and the valve 7 are cooled to the temperate of the liquid gas. Filling of the reservoir 4 continues until the pressure within the reservoir substantially equals that of the liquid gas flowing from dewar 1. 5 When it is wished to dispense liquid gas from the reservoir 4, solenoid mechanism 8, which lies at least partly outside of the reservoir cavity, is activated moving valve element 7C to allow a flow of liquid gas under pressure through outlet 6. Because the liquid gas flows under a pressure greater than gravity, it is possible to have the outlet 10 of the reservoir 4 formed in an upper part of the reservoir 4, or/and for the outlet of conduit 6 to be located above reservoir 4. This may be particularly advantageous where it is required that the reservoir 4 be held below the vessel 26. Valve 10 may also be periodically opened (manually or otherwise) to allow venting of gas, such as may be required if liquid gas is held within the reservoir 4 for a time. 15 Mixer 20 comprises stand 21 which carries a cantilevered arm 22. Arm 22 is carried by stand 21 via a linking mechanism 23 allowing arm 22 to rotate relative to stand 21. Mounted onto the free end 22A of arm 22 is an agitating assembly comprising an agitation element

Description


Product Inquiry



Product Description
Elgin, Illinois, Hamilton, Bulova all of these American watch companies produced high quality time pieces at affordable prices. They were not luxury items but rather tools for gentleman to wear each day. The Springfield is Smith & Bradley’s answer to the classic American field watch that has graced the wrists of men for almost 100 years. 
Named after the capital of our home state of Illinois, we designed the Springfield with the Golden Age of American watchmaking in mind. In particular we use as our inspiration the standard issue field watches the companies such as Hamilton, Illinois, and Elgin produced for the US military throughout the 20th century and which watch collectors and those of style have ferociously sought after for years. 
When we designed Springfield we envisioned a watch that did not sacrifice any functionality or quality, but at the same time could be delivered at a moderate price point.  After significant research and development we found the right design and components to create a rugged watch with a bold design that embodies the form and function our company tries to achieve.
The Details and Specifications:
Swiss Ronda Quartz Movement
C-3 Superluminova Hands
Domed Sapphire Crystal
10 ATM Water Resistance
316-L Stainless Steel case and case back
Enlarged Crown
12 and 24 hour markings
20 mm Lugs
Like the watch itself, the packaging is for the Springfield is simple and straightforward.  Each Springfield comes in the iconic Smith & Bradley waterproof box.
