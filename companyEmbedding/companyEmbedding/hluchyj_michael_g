Storage of data utilizing scheduling queue locations associated with different data rates



Patent number:  8799535
                                            

Abstract:  In one example, multimedia content is requested from a plurality of storage modules. Each storage module retrieves the requested parts, which are typically stored on a plurality of storage devices at each storage module. Each storage module determines independently when to retrieve the requested parts of the data file from storage and transmits those parts from storage to a data queue. Based on a capacity of a delivery module and/or the data rate associated with the request, each storage module transmits the parts of the data file to the delivery module. The delivery module generates a sequenced data segment from the parts of the data file received from the plurality of storage modules and transmits the sequenced data segment to the requester.

Publication number:  20090182790
                                            

Abstract:  In one example, multimedia content is requested from a plurality of storage modules. Each storage module retrieves the requested parts, which are typically stored on a plurality of storage devices at each storage module. Each storage module determines independently when to retrieve the requested parts of the data file from storage and transmits those parts from storage to a data queue. Based on a capacity of a delivery module and/or the data rate associated with the request, each storage module transmits the parts of the data file to the delivery module. The delivery module generates a sequenced data segment from the parts of the data file received from the plurality of storage modules and transmits the sequenced data segment to the requester.
