What are analysts saying about Avery Dennison Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Avery Dennison Corporation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "For 2017, Avery expects adjusted earnings per share to lie between $4.50 and $4.65. Avery's consistent execution of strategies continues to enhance competitive advantage while driving profitable growth. Focus on productivity, cost control and share repurchases will also drive results.  In sync with its strategy to expand in the medical sector, Avery Dennison has acquired Longford, Ireland-based Finesse Medical, a maker of materials used for wound care and skin treatments. The company has a positive record of earnings surprises in the last few quartere. Its shares have also outperformed the Zacks categorized Office Supplies & Forms sub industry year to date. However, choppy growth in Radio Frequency Identification products and raw material inflation remain near term concerns." (6/22/2017)
2. KeyCorp analysts commented, "We commend the Company on its continued robust organic growth (4% in 1Q17), but we continue to think the Company is at or near peak margins and the stock is trading well above its historical averages (AVY repurchased very little stock in the quarter, and we do not think that is a coincidence). We reiterate our Sector Weight rating on valuation." (4/26/2017)

What are analysts saying about Microchip Technology Incorporated stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Microchip Technology Incorporated stock: 
1. Mizuho analysts commented, "We were able to briefly catch up with MCHP management and, while we believe JunQ orders are strong, capacity constraints may be driving some challenges into the SepQ. Maintaining our Neutral, but raising estimates and our PT to $80. While MCHP is executing well under CEO Steve Sanghi, we believe at ~16x P/E the stock is fairly valued. With strong FCF we expect MCHP to focus on continuing M&A. MCHP noted broad strength in multiple verticals industrial, automotive which could be a positive for CY and ON. KeyPoints MCHP tightened its guidance to the high end of its range. MCHP narrowed its JunQ guide towards the higher end of the range given out on the MarQ earnings call." (6/7/2017)
2. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "During the past two days, we hosted a series of investor meetings in New York and Boston with Microchip’s CFO, Eric Bjornholt, and VP of Europe Finance and Investor Relations, Nawax Sharif. The company outlined multiple growth drivers including: MCU market growth/share gains (currently ~13% market share), an Analog attach strategy and the continued integration of Atmel/ open to more M&A. We are modeling non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 in 2018 and $5.00 in 2019 and a FCF margin of 30%." (3/10/2017)
3. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Microchip is one of the better-positioned companies in the semiconductor industry based on its product strength. The company's expanding product portfolio enables it to continuously outperform the broader industry. We believe that the company's impressive third-quarter fiscal 2017 results and positive outlook will help it sustain momentum going ahead. Moreover, acquisitions like that of Atmel are likely to expand its geographical presence, augment customer base, extend product portfolio and supplement operational excellence. We note that the company has outperformed the broader industry in the past one-year. However, high integration costs continue to be a drag on profitability. The semiconductor industry is also intensely competitive and is characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change." (2/10/2017)

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 11 Buy Ratings, 1 Strong Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.81)Consensus Price Target: $85.47 (3.36% upside)
