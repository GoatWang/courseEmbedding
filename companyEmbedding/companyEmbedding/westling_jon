        Just like having a laugh with mates.
My favorite podcast on the web. The two guys are hilarious as they just shoot what's on their minds and hold nothing back. Both hosts are very clear spoken and easy to listen to. Although a lot of the show is joking around, they give great in-depth analysis and opinions on all the latest from the wrestling world. They are very causal in their approach and they just let the conversation flow. It's just like having a great laugh about wrestling with your closest friends.

        The Review of The Round Eye

I've had years of surgeries and these guys have been there to constantly break the silence. can't thank these guys enough. they deserve to be number one on the list forevaaaaa, and I'm glad to see they are finally getting the recognition they deserve.

        Wrestling Knowledge and Entertaining
This show is a informative platform that gives wrestling fans the opportunity to express their discourse for WWE, Pro wrestling and the multitudes of other subjective subjects in a objective way. Great show and it's ironic that poor wrestling television,PPV and products make for more interesting objective subjects with wrestling and it exposes the b.s. that keeps wrestling from being good or as good as it should.

        Soup is my Guilty Pleasure Wrestling Podcast
I look forward to every Thursday Night to get my dose of Wrestling Soup. Mish and Joey have no filter and blast you with two barrels of comedy based on this crazy wrestling world I love and society in general. It's a great show.

In this role he was controversial B.U. president John Silber's top aide and twice served as acting president; first in 1987 while Silber was on sabbatical and again in 1990 while Silber was running for Governor.[1][2][3] In 1996, he was chosen to succeed Silber, who became Chancellor of the University after a 25-year tenure as president. Westling's tenure came to an end in July 2002, when he resigned the presidency to return to teaching and research as a Professor of History and Humanities. Silber stepped down as chancellor and reassumed the presidency on an interim basis until Aram Chobanian was appointed president ad interim in October 2003.
Controversy[edit]
During Westling's career as President of BU he made controversial statements about students with learning disabilities. "President Westling referred to students with learning disabilities as "a plague," and an indication of "a silent genetic catastrophe," and he has made similar statements in letters to the New York Times, the Boston Globe, campus newspapers, and students' parents." [4]

SKIP CLASS? YOU WON'T PASS.


                  Never handed back a single test or paper. Unclear grading standards. There is almost no work for this class and textbook is not necessary if you go to class.

                  If you are someone who has to put in effort to listen during lecture, I would not recommend this class. Professor Westling is a really nice, warm,  person but he often takes minutes to make one point. Unless you have a particular fascination with medieval English history, lectures will be monotonous. A shame because the subject is fascinating.

LECTURE HEAVY


                  Westling is nice, knowledgeable, approachable. He's lenient with grades and deadlines, typically. The lectures are incredibly boring though. He sits and talks for 50 minutes--every class. No use of the chalkboard, projector, videos, images, nada. If you listen and take decent notes though you don't need to read at all and you'll get a good grade.

GET READY TO READ


                  Professor Westling is good at explaining the material. However, it is tempting to fall asleep in lecture. If you pay attention is class, you don't have to read the book at all. It took him a while to give back the midterm. I got it back on the final review day. He gave excellent final review and he brought his dog. It was cute.

INSPIRATIONAL
AMAZING LECTURES


                  It's tempting to fall asleep during his lectures, but if you can listen, he is a fountain of information on the topics we studied. Such a smart guy and so nice too. Class was enjoyable - just attend them and listen and you won't have to do any of the reading. Gives a great finals review!

                  Great professor! And one of the easiest ones at BU too. He finally returns tests/papers now too. You never have to read the book, you just have to go to class and take notes. He's helpful during office hours as well.

                  Do not take this class. Westling may know the subject extremely well, but he is an awful teacher. He never, and I mean never returns grades. I just took the final, and I still don't know what I got on the midterm. Also, test questions are generally very specific, and unrelated to class material. DO NOT TAKE.

                  His lectures are extremely straight forward. Extremely. The book is great as a supplement, and you don't need to read as often as it seems (he tests you on info up to the time period he's reached in class). Takes forever to hand back papers and tests, and also almost never e-mails you back. But if you catch him before he leaves class, yay!

                  Boring. Really boring. But if you want a class that's an easy B+/A- then do it. A midterm, final, and one 6-page paper. That's it. All pretty straight forward too.

                  Westling is considered a bore by many but if you're passionate for history, you'll love Westling. He covers the important points very well and adds tangents that suit his pleasure. It's a nice change for a history lecture. The exams are fairly easy as is the paper. Not too hard to get a good grade if you are still breathing.

                  Westling's class was very easy, however his lectures, while easy to follow, were a little boring, and I found myself falling asleep on more than one occasion. I didn't use the textbook at all, and went strictly off of the notes I took, and still did well in the class. Overall though, he's not a bad professor.

                  Westling is one of the easiest professors to take notes off of and his tests are easy too. Just pay attention in lecture. I never opened the textbook and got an A.

                  Westling just doesn't care. He's an incredibly boring professor and doesn't engage the class at all. He's a really easy grader, but he also takes FOREVER to hand back papers.

                  A funny, quirky old man who used to be the president of the University. His lectures can be a little boring (there's A LOT of info), but his tests are really straightforward. The readings are intense, but you can get away with not doing them all if you go to Discussion. Ask him questions...he loves it. A great class if history interests you

                  Professor Westling's lectures are best described as low energy. It is very easy to have a wandering mind and get lost. However, if you pay attention you can learn a lot from this man. The bulk of the work associated with the class comes from the TA'. With a little background knowledge in history, this class can make your semester much easier.

                  While Professor Westling can be boring at times (my friends and i had to fight to stay awake in the first few lectures), he really grows on you. He is extremely knowledgable, and sometimes the onslaught of information can be overwhelming, but it is obvious that he loves what he teaches. Midterm was a piece of cake.

                  His lectures are jam-packed with information and his expansive knowledge is a bit intimidating. I really enjoyed the class, though. The two tests were pretty easy, as long as you study well. The research paper was more in-depth, but still not necessarily hard. He's very personable and is willing to help--don't be afraid to ask questions.

                  Hated his class. Lectures were boring, required a ridiculous amount of reading from irrelevant sources, especially the main textbook. Definitely knows a TON about history, but seemingly little about teaching. Tests are easy but his points system is messed up and unfair. Attendance is mandatory for his large lecture class, which is dumb.

                  Knowledgable, but extremely redundant. My class was supposed to cover European history from 1500 until present. We didn't make it past World War I. The TA, Mrs. Metcalfe, was awesome though.

                  Professor Westling clearly knows a lot about history, but his lectures are very boring.  The tests are pretty easy, but make sure you write a clear essay.  Decent class.

John Cena Talks Not Turning Heel, Current WWE Product, Being Away From The Company Injured

By Marc Middleton | April 21, 2016 









Source: Rolling StoneJohn Cena recently spoke with Rolling Stone for an in-depth piece on his WWE career, acting and more. The full article is at this link and also contains comments from Nikki Bella. Below are highlights:



Vince McMahon and the WWE product:
"I'm a 38-year-old man. I'd much rather it be a program geared toward me, whether that's TV-14 or sometimes even more graphic than that, which is what I like. For one thing, profanity brought fire out of people with personalities that backed the language. It's very difficult to say, 'Oh, you're being poopy,' especially when they're meant to be fighting words. And now, if someone starts to bleed, the referee intervenes to stop the bleeding. But before, you'd just let it fly. Blood is one of the things that made fights cool. Like, you knew it had gotten serious. I understand why we don't do it anymore. Vince has been a coach to me, a father figure, a boss and a friend, and his goal and my goal are the same: to make the company be as big as it can be. But, yeah, the blood is one thing I miss."
His injury and rehab:
"It's been two and a half months since the surgery and 107 rehab visits so far, and I'm already doing things they said would take nine months. I was antsy on Day Four. Being away from the product just makes me want it even more. Sure, OK, it's very easy to get too caught up. And not to mention the blur between real and not. I mean, anyone who brings up the word 'fake' with me is truly ignorant of what we do. We entertain. We're TV that develops right in front of you as it happens. People think we are who they see. That's kind of true, but not. I mean, we're as real as fake can get. Like, I'm Superman, but I'm not. Although a lot of people in the business don't know when to turn the switch off, I do, and I'm John."
Not turning heel:
"Look, your job as a superstar is to manipulate the audience and try to tell your story. I like the dynamic of the audience. Every single night it's different. But what's weird is that I'm a good guy because of all the kids and parents who like me, and a bad guy because I won't turn heel, which actually makes me both good guy and bad guy in one person."
