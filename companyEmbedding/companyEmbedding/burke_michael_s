Michael S. Burke





 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
 AECOM  

 
 
Tweet 













Michael S. Burke is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AECOM (NYSE: ACM), a premier, fully integrated infrastructure firm that designs, builds, finances and operates infrastructure assets in more than 150 countries. 
 
Mr. Burke has served as a key AECOM leader since he joined the company in 2005 and has been instrumental in the evolution of AECOM from a private company to a public firm whose staff of architects, engineers, designers, planners, scientists and management and construction professionals serve clients virtually anywhere in the world. He was named Chief Financial Officer in 2006 and, prior to his appointment as CEO in 2014, Mr. Burke had been president of the company since October 2011. 
 
During 2014, Mr. Burke led AECOM’s purchase of URS Corporation, an $11 billion, leading provider of engineering, construction, and technical services for public agencies and private-sector companies around the world. This acquisition was a transformational event for the industry and a critical step in advancing AECOM’s vision to be the world’s premier, fully integrated infrastructure firm.  
 
Mr. Burke also directed the company’s initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which was one of the 10 largest NYSE listings for 2007, and one of the largest engineering industry IPOs of all time. 
 
Prior to joining AECOM, Mr. Burke served as Western Area Managing Partner at KPMG LLP. He joined KPMG in 1990 and was admitted to the partnership in 1995. He also was a member of KPMG’s Board of Directors, a position he held for five years. As a member of the Board of Directors, he served as the chairman of the Board Process and Governance Committee and a member of the Audit and Finance Committee. 
 
Mr. Burke is also an active member of the community and serves on the boards for various nonprofit organizations. He is currently a member of the Board of Trustees for Providence Saint John’s Health Center, a nationally renowned hospital serving the West Los Angeles community since 1942, a member of the Board of Directors for LA 2024, the committee seeking to bring the 2024 Olympic Games to Los Angeles and a member of the Board of Directors for Children’s Bureau, which helps at-risk children through state-of-the-art child abuse prevention and treatment services. 
 
He graduated with a B.S. degree in accounting from the University of Scranton and earned a law degree from the Southwestern University School of Law in Los Angeles.
 
AECOM is built to deliver a better world, connecting knowledge and experience across a global network of experts to help clients solve their most complex challenges—from high-performance buildings and infrastructure, to resilient communities and environments, to stable and secure nations. A Fortune 500 firm, AECOM and its companies have annual revenue of approximately U.S. $17.4 billion.  Learn more at aecom.com and @AECOM.
