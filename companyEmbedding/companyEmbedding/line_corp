                    Statistics and Market Data about the Internet
                This page provides statistics, facts and market data related to internet. This includes information on segments and industries such as social media, online search, user-generated content, online advertising and marketing as well as statistics on demographics and use.

Current internet user figures suggest that there are more than 2.5 billion users worldwide with a global penetration rate of 35 percent with North America accounting for 14 percent of global internet users.

Since the late 1990s, the internet has not only provided users with online experiences such as email, online search and general browsing but has also played a major role in enabling human interaction and reshaping traditional communications media such as film, television, music and telephone. The mainstreaming of internet features, such as digital music and video, user-generated content and digital media sales, have caused traditional media consumption to undergo significant changes. With the large-scale offerings of user-generated as well as licensed content in the forms of audio, video, games and writings, companies such as YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, Pandora and Tumblr have broadened the selection of available entertainment and enabled internet users to interact more closely with the media and each other.

The emergences of new digital technologies and websites have accelerated forms of human interaction through online forums, instant messaging, and social networking (since the mid-2000’s). Email has been a staple of the online experience. However, the rise of social networks, most notably market leader Facebook, and mobile social apps such as Twitter, LINE or WhatsApp have changed the notion of online communications and the divide of the personal and public online space. Facebook has more than 1.2 billion monthly active users, presenting a global reach of almost 50 percent of internet users worldwide.

According to internet market data, online sales via B2B and B2C e-commerce have not only expanded the reach and volume of traditional wholesale and retail trade but have also changed entire business infrastructures across various industries. The reach of online commerce has also enabled small and independent business owners to pursue their business ventures across local borders. Market data suggests a steady growth of global digital buyer penetration. Online shopping is not the only way of making money via the internet – statistics suggest a growth of digital content sales via e-commerce platforms such as iTunes, Google Play or Steam as well as the vast market of online advertising and marketing. Global companies such as Google, Amazon and Baidu generate the majority of their revenues via online services.

Whereas the majority of internet access used to be via a fixed-line connection to a desktop PC, the growth of mobile technologies such as WiFi and laptops as well as mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers have completely changed the online landscape. In countries with weak technological infrastructures, mobile internet has enabled people to access the web and to participate in the global information exchange. Notable examples are mobile banking and the ability to provide people with a global platform in order to broadcast their issues during times of unrest and crisis such as the Arab Spring movement. During national and global disasters such as Hurricane Sandy, Fukushima or Typhoon Yolanda, online services such as Google and Twitter have formed crisis response portals in order to co-ordinate and support rescue efforts.

Today, surveys indicate that daily internet usage plays a significant role in the everyday lives of consumers in the connected world.

                    Statistics and Market Data on Mobile Internet & Apps
                This page provides statistics, facts and market data related to mobile internet and apps. This includes information on segments and industries such as mobile internet usage, market reach, device usage, app reach as well as statistics on demographics and use.

Mobile internet refers to the use of internet-connected applications and browsing the web on mobile devices. For many years internet access has only been possible with a fixed line. In the last couple of years however, mobile internet use has moved out of the niche and onto the mass market. As of 2013, almost a third of website traffic originated from mobile devices.

Currently, more than 100 million users in the United States access the internet via tablet or smartphone. Furthermore, the number of mobile-only internet users worldwide is expected to close in on half a billion users. Apple set the bar for future smartphones when it released the first iPhone in 2007. In 2010, Apple introduced the iPad and has since been dominating the tablet market as well. Google followed suit, releasing the Android OS which is currently the most popular smartphone operating system on the planet.

The Apple App Store and Google Play are also the leading mobile app stores worldwide and account for over 90 percent of worldwide app revenues. Between the two competitors, Google Play’s market share is steadily growing and has doubled within the previous year.
Mobile internet usage statistics show that users spent most of their online time writing and reading emails. Other popular activities include social networking, catching up with news and current events, mobile gaming, and mobile media consumption via content streaming apps such as Netflix or Spotify.

The popularity of mobile internet has created a new market for advertisers as well. Mobile advertising revenues are growing quickly and mobile advertising is expected to grow into a billion-dollar business in the next few years.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
