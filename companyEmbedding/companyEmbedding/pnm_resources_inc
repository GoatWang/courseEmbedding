Short Interest In PNM Resources Decreases By 39.4%






MarketNewsVideo.com




Jul 13, 2017 1:46 PM EDT













 


























































 The most recent short interest data has been released for the 06/30/2017 settlement date, which shows a 1,302,434 share decrease in total short interest for PNM Resources Inc ( PNM), to 2,004,069, a decrease of 39.39% since 06/15/2017. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days (at the average volume) it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed. Average daily volume for PNM at the 06/30/2017 settlement increased to 670,611, as compared to 550,789 at the 06/15/2017 report. That brought "days to cover" down to 2.99, a 50.22% decrease from the 6.00 days to cover calculated at the previous short interest data release.   The below chart shows the historical "days to cover" for PNM at previous short interest release dates:    START SLIDESHOW:Top 25 S.A.F.E. Dividend Stocks »    A decreased "days to cover" value could indicate that short sellers are no longer expecting the same decline in stock price they once were, or it could also indicate a long bet elsewhere was closed where PNM had been shorted as a hedge.  The chart below shows the one year performance of PNM shares, versus its 200 day moving average. Looking at this chart, PNM's low point in its 52 week range is $30.95 per share, with $40.10 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $37.48.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, PNM makes up 2.59% of the PowerShares DWA Utilities Momentum Portfolio ETF (PUI) which is lower by about 0.3% on the day Thursday.

Our Businesses
PNM Resources Inc. is an energy holding company based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It serves electricity to more than 761,000 homes and businesses in New Mexico and Texas through its regulated utilities, PNM and TNMP. In 2016 consolidated operating revenues totaled $1.4 billion. The company’s generation capacity of more than 2,791 megawatts reflects a balanced mix of coal, natural gas, nuclear, wind, solar and geothermal generation. PNM Resources’ common stock trades on the NYSE under the ticker PNM.


PNM is a regulated utility in New Mexico with operations primarily engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. It is the state's largest electricity provider. PNM serves more than 500,000 New Mexico residential and business customers in Greater Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, Los Lunas, Belen, Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Alamogordo, Ruidoso, Silver City, Deming, Bayard, Lordsburg and Clayton. We also serve the New Mexico tribal communities of the Tesuque, Cochiti, Santo Domingo, San Felipe, Santa Ana, Sandia, Isleta and Laguna Pueblos.  PNM is regulated by the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
PNM’s capacity in electric generating facilities, which are owned, leased, or under Power Purchase Agreements, in commercial service as of December 31, 2016 is: 

Transmission
As of December 31, 2016, PNM owned, jointly owned, or leased, 3,200 circuit miles of electric transmission lines (including the Eastern Interconnection Project); 6,060 miles of distribution overhead lines; 5,789 cable miles of underground distribution lines (excluding street lighting); and 269 substations.
Transmission Losses:
January 1 - May 31, 2016: 3.33%
June 1 - December 31, 2016: 3.50%
January 1 - May 31, 2017:  3.50%
June 1 - December 31, 2017: 2.94%

SAIDI is an industry acronym for “System Average Interruption Duration Index” and is a measure of outage time experienced by customers when averaged across the entire system. It is measured in “minutes” because it is meant to show how many minutes of outage a typical customer would experience during the year.
SAIDI is used as an indicator of how your system is performing. We look at SAIDI as a measure of system performance and then formulate operating plans to minimize that number to the best of our ability given both financial and personnel constraints.
 

Transmission
TNMP provides transmission and distribution services in Texas under the provisions of Texas Electric Choice Act (TECA) and the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act. TNMP’s transmission and distribution activities are solely within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which is the independent system operator responsible for maintaining reliable operations for the bulk electric power supply system in most of Texas. As of December 31, 2016, TNMP owned 978 circuit miles of overhead electric transmission lines; 7,111 pole miles of overhead distribution lines; 1,209 circuit miles of underground distribution lines; and 115 substations.
TNMP, along with all other entities within ERCOT who do not have their own control areas, does not calculate transmission losses. ERCOT, as the Independent System Operator and the entity who balances and manages settlement, calculates transmission losses for all transmission systems within its control area, including TNMP’s transmission systems.





TNMP provides transmission and distribution services to Retail Electric Providers (REPs) that provide electric service to customers in TNMP’s service territories.  The number of end users below represents the customers of these REPs.  Under TECA, end users in Texas have the ability to choose any REP to provide energy.

PNM Resources Stock Sees Short Interest Drop 11.2%
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 06/30/2016 settlement date, which shows a 360,924 share decrease in total short interest for PNM Resources Inc , to 2,846,171.0, a decrease of 11.25% since 06/15/2016. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

The department handles all IT projects, which are largely focused on cost saving initiatives for its utility operations business. Directors are key leaders in their respective areas, such as supply chain management, and IT infrastructure. 

In the past the company has noted a possible implementation of a company-wide BYOD program. When a decision is made, the IT architecture division, not IT security, will have final say.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Primary holdings[edit]

Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM)[edit]
Public Service Company of New Mexico is a corporation that is wholly owned by PNM Resources. In marketing material it is usually called PNM.
Headquartered in Albuquerque, it provides electricity to 413,000 customers in the urbanized or semi-urbanized areas in the northern half of the state. Elsewhere, rural electric cooperatives provide much of the power. PNM maintains approximately 2,000 miles (3,200 km), 2,282 miles (3,673 km) of electric transmission lines, and 7,594 electric distribution lines. PNM is a significant owner of the San Juan generation facility, a coal-fired plant located near Farmington, New Mexico, and a 10% owner in the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Facility near Phoenix, AZ. PNM also owns and operates several natural gas-fired plants throughout the state of New Mexico including Reeves Generating Station in Albuquerque, most of which are used to meet additional demand for electricity in the summer months. PNM employs approximately 2,000 people and has been noted as one of the top companies in the United States for minorities to work for.
Texas—New Mexico Power Company[edit]
Texas—New Mexico Power is a corporation that is wholly owned by PNM Resources. It is a regulated electric utility operating in Texas.
Corporate organization and history[edit]
PNM was founded in 1917 as the Albuquerque Gas and Electric Company. PNM sold the gas part of the business to Southern Union Gas Company of Dallas in 1949. These sold portions became the Gas Company of New Mexico. In 1985, however, PNM reacquired the Gas Company of New Mexico after Southern Union Gas Company reached a settlement stemming from federal anti-trust litigation. In 1994, both electric and gas operations began serving customers as PNM.
In May 2003, PNM Resources' utility subsidiary PNM was recognized by the American Wind Energy Association's Utility Leadership Award for PNM's role in creation of the New Mexico Wind Energy Center. The award was presented at the National Wind Energy Conference in Austin, Texas.[1]
In 2008, PNM sold New Mexico Gas to Continental Energy, a company backed by the private equity firm Lindsay Goldberg. It was later acquired by TECO Energy.[2] It will soon become a division of Halifax, Canada-based Emera when its acquisition of TECO Energy closes by mid-2016.[3]

Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM)[edit]
Public Service Company of New Mexico is a corporation that is wholly owned by PNM Resources. In marketing material it is usually called PNM.
Headquartered in Albuquerque, it provides electricity to 413,000 customers in the urbanized or semi-urbanized areas in the northern half of the state. Elsewhere, rural electric cooperatives provide much of the power. PNM maintains approximately 2,000 miles (3,200 km), 2,282 miles (3,673 km) of electric transmission lines, and 7,594 electric distribution lines. PNM is a significant owner of the San Juan generation facility, a coal-fired plant located near Farmington, New Mexico, and a 10% owner in the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Facility near Phoenix, AZ. PNM also owns and operates several natural gas-fired plants throughout the state of New Mexico including Reeves Generating Station in Albuquerque, most of which are used to meet additional demand for electricity in the summer months. PNM employs approximately 2,000 people and has been noted as one of the top companies in the United States for minorities to work for.
Texas—New Mexico Power Company[edit]
Texas—New Mexico Power is a corporation that is wholly owned by PNM Resources. It is a regulated electric utility operating in Texas.
Corporate organization and history[edit]
PNM was founded in 1917 as the Albuquerque Gas and Electric Company. PNM sold the gas part of the business to Southern Union Gas Company of Dallas in 1949. These sold portions became the Gas Company of New Mexico. In 1985, however, PNM reacquired the Gas Company of New Mexico after Southern Union Gas Company reached a settlement stemming from federal anti-trust litigation. In 1994, both electric and gas operations began serving customers as PNM.
In May 2003, PNM Resources' utility subsidiary PNM was recognized by the American Wind Energy Association's Utility Leadership Award for PNM's role in creation of the New Mexico Wind Energy Center. The award was presented at the National Wind Energy Conference in Austin, Texas.[1]
In 2008, PNM sold New Mexico Gas to Continental Energy, a company backed by the private equity firm Lindsay Goldberg. It was later acquired by TECO Energy.[2] It will soon become a division of Halifax, Canada-based Emera when its acquisition of TECO Energy closes by mid-2016.[3]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
