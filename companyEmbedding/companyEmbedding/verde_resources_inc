Bio Huma Netics, Inc., and Mesa Verde Resources Expand Product Selection | Growing Produce














































































    Trending Now: #Politics  Alliance Stepping Up Efforts to Protect Specialty CropsWho Will Be Florida’s next Woman of the Year in Agriculture?April 23, 2017 Bio Huma Netics, Inc., and Mesa Verde Resources Expand Product Selection Posted By: Christina Herrick | Email | TweetEmailPrintFacebookGoogleLinkedInTwitter  Bio Huma Netics, Inc. (BHN) — an Arizona company that produces products under the Huma Gro, Huma Gro Turf, and Probiotic Solutions brands—has recently formed an alliance with Reid Enterprises LLC, which does business as Mesa Verde Resources (MVR) in New Mexico. Mesa Verde Resources is a humic substance mining company that produces, manufactures, and sells humic-acid and fulvic-acid products.
Other than access to a greater range of products, customers from the two companies should see no change in day-to-day operations. There will be no immediate change in personnel at either company, and the two companies will continue to operate separately under separate names for the immediate future.
This alliance is expected to facilitate a synergistic relationship between the BHN lines of agriculture, turf, and wastewater/soil remediation products and the Mesa Verde Resources line of humic and fulvic products for both domestic and international markets. While BHN has previously focused on a fraction of humic substances to extract the Micro Carbon Technology used as a base for all its liquid products, the combined company will now offer its customers an even greater selection of dry and liquid products that includes MVR’s various formulations of humic and fulvic acids.

The following table details the Company’s intended use of proceeds from this 
Offering, for the first twelve (12) months after successful completion of the 
Offering.  None of the expenditures itemized are listed in any particular 
order of priority or importance.  Since the Company does not intend to pay 
any Offering expenses from the proceeds from this Offering, and assuming 
that 100% of the Offering is sold ($80,000), the gross aggregate proceeds 
will be allocated as follows: 

Expenditure Item** 
 
Property Work      $  7,500 
 
Supervision           2,500 
 
Property Payment      5,000 
 
BLM Claim Fees          840 
 
Professional Fees    20,000 
 
Office and Miscellaneous 
Expenses             10,000 
 
Working Capital      34,160 
 
Total               $80,000 
 
**The above expenditures are defined as follows: 

Property Work:  Work proposed is a Biogeochemistry sampling which will sample 
along the main strike of the property and will also sample at the fault 
area on the southern end of the claims.  The work will be done by a skilled 
technician.  This includes trucks, accommodations and surveying in grid lines 
to guide the work. 

Supervision:  This item refers to the fee of hiring someone to supervise the 
work. 

Property Payment:  This item refers to the fee owing by May 17, 2011, per our 
mineral claim purchase agreement with Gold Explorations, LLC.  This payment 
has been made. 

BLM Claim Fees:  This item refers to the cost of maintaining our 6 lode mining 
claims on an annual basis.  Currently the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) 
charges $140 per claim per year, to be paid by September 1 st . 

Professional Fees:  This item refers to all legal services and accounting 
fees that will be incurred by the Company in the first year of operations 
following completion of this Offering. 

Office and Miscellaneous Expenses:  These are the costs of operating our 
offices, including telephone services, mail, stationary, acquisition of office 
equipment and supplies, bank service fees and charges, and other 
miscellaneous expenses associated with running our office. 

Working Capital :  The Company intends to use funds allocated to Working 
Capital to cover any unforeseen costs, or expenses that are more than the 
amount allocated under the Use of Proceeds. 

There is no assurance that we will be able to raise the entire $80,000 with 
this Offering.  The following chart details how we will use the proceeds if 
we raise only 75%, 50%, or 25% of this Offering:

                             25%           50%             75%

Expenses                      -            4,160          10,000 
 
Working Capital               -               -           14,160 
 
Totals                  $  20,000       $  40,000      $  60,000 

There is no minimum amount we are required to raise in this Offering and any 
funds received will be immediately available to us. 

If only 75% of this Offering is sold, we estimate having sufficient capital 
for our first year of operations.   

If only 50% of this Offering is sold , we would have to prioritize our 
expenses in order of importance.  We estimate that this would provide 
sufficient capital to cover expected professional fees (legal and accounting), 
mineral property payments, and then mineral exploration for the year, but 
would limit how much funds would be allocated to office and miscellaneous 
expenses.  At 50% we would not have any extra working capital for 
emergencies, as we could need additional cash for office and miscellaneous 
expenses. 

If we raise less than 50%, we will have difficulty in implementing our plan 
of operations.  Our expenses would be further prioritized in order of 
importance and would affect how we allocate funds for our planned exploration 
expenses in the first year.  We would allocate the first $20,000 to 
professional fees as this is required to maintain reporting status with the 
SEC during the next 12 months.  From there we would need to pay the property 
payment and BLM fees or we would lose our rights to the 6 mineral claims and 
any funds left over, if any, would be allocated to office and miscellaneous 
expenses.   

If only 25% of this Offering is sold , we would only have sufficient capital 
to cover professional fees.  We would not be able to cover annual property 
maintenance and/commitment fees.  We would be required to raise additional 
funds to be able to keep our mineral claim rights and to be able to do any 
exploration work. 

Even if we raise the full amount under this Offering, it will not be
sufficient to pay all of the payments required under the five year payment 
program as set forth in the purchase agreement, and the five year work 
program. In order to complete both the payments under the purchase agreement 
and complete the work program, we will be required to raise additional 
capital. We anticipate raising additional capital by either a sale of equity, 
issuance of debt to one or more third parties or from loans by an officer or 
director. We have no agreements from any third party, or any officer or 
director, either written or verbal, at this time. A portion of the proceeds 
from this offering will be used to pay for consulting services to Gold 
Explorations, LLC, a company co-owned by our director, Steve Karolyi. The 
potential payments include a property payment of $5,000, and supervisory work 
of $2,500. Other than the amounts to be paid to Gold Explorations, no proceeds 
from this Offering will be paid to the officer or directors in the form of 
commissions, salary or other compensation.


The gold mining industry is fragmented, that is there are a large number of 
gold prospectors and producers, small and large.  We do not compete with 
anyone.  That is because there is no competition for the exploration or 
removal of minerals from the claims we will be exploring.  We will either 
find gold on the property or not.  If we do not, we will cease or suspend 
operations.  We are one of the smallest exploration companies in existence.  
We are an infinitely small participant in the gold mining market.  Readily 
available gold markets exist in the United States and around the world for 
the sale of gold.  Therefore, we will be able to sell any gold that we are 
able to recover.


Company Description
Verde Resources, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 22, 
2010.  We are an exploration stage corporation.  An exploration stage 
corporation is one engaged in the search for mineral deposits or reserves 
which are not in either the development or production stage.  We intend to


 
conduct exploration activities on one property.  Record title to the property 
upon which we intend to conduct exploration activities is not held in our 
name.  The property is owned by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  The 
right to mine the claims has been obtained by Gold Explorations, LLC of 
Minden, Nevada.  Verde entered into a purchase agreement to purchase the 
claims through a five year payment program totaling $100,000 USD and a five 
year work program totaling $50,000 USD.  We intend to conduct exploration 
activities on the Payday Claims located in Esmeralda County, Nevada.  The one 
property consists of six (6) lode mining claims.  We intend to explore for 
gold on the property. 

We have been issued a "substantial doubt" going concern opinion from our 
auditors and our only asset is our cash in the bank, which, at March 31, 
2011, consisted of approximately $10,841 in cash generated from related party 
loans and the issuance of shares of Company common stock to our founders and 
initial investors.

Verde’s principal place of business and corporate offices are located at 905 
Ventura Way, Mill Valley, CA, 94941.  Our telephone number is (415) 251-8715 
and our registered agent is Corporate Direct, 2258 Meridian Boulevard, Minden, 
Nevada, 89423.
