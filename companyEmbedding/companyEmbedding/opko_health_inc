Overview
            
OPKO Renal is developing proprietary products to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and vitamin D insufficiency. These products are designed to treat patients with Stage 3, 4 or 5 CKD, but they also have potential application to other indications including metabolic bone disease, such as renal osteodystrophy and osteoporosis. In addition, the Renal Division is developing novel therapies to treat elevated blood phosphorus levels (hyperphosphatemia) in order to improve the control of SHPT in CKD patients.

SHPT = Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
            CKD = Chronic kidney disease

About the OPKO Renal Division 
The Renal Division of OPKO Health, Inc. is developing proprietary products to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and vitamin D insufficiency. These products are designed to treat patients with Stage 3, 4 or 5 CKD, but they also have potential application to other indications including metabolic bone disease, such as renal osteodystrophy and osteoporosis. In addition, the Renal Division is developing novel therapies to treat elevated blood phosphorus levels (hyperphosphatemia) in order to improve the control of SHPT in CKD patients.
CKD is a worldwide public health problem with steadily increasing incidence, prevalence and cost. Key factors driving growth of the CKD market in developed countries include aging populations and the current epidemic of obesity and its associated complications of hypertension and adult-onset diabetes. Nearly 80% of CKD cases have etiologies linked to hypertension and diabetes. The worldwide incidence of adult-onset diabetes alone is expected to double by 2030 to approximately 366 million.
CKD is categorized into 5 successive stages, each stage representing more advanced disease. The earliest stages of CKD afflict nearly 25 million individuals in the United States (U.S.) and contribute to the widespread development of osteoporosis. By the time a patient reaches Stage 5 CKD, the kidney is virtually non-functional. The majority of Stage 5 patients require regular dialysis for survival, with a small proportion eventually receiving viable kidney transplants. In the U.S., the annual cost of treating patients with Stage 5 CKD is approximately $35 billion. Despite this expenditure, CKD continues to be associated with poor outcomes, reflecting the inadequacies of the current standard of care. Vitamin D insufficiency, hyperphosphatemia and SHPT, when inadequately treated, are major contributors to poor CKD outcomes.
OPKO’s expertise in vitamin D chemistry, biochemistry, metabolism and physiology, combined with its experience in successfully bringing vitamin D therapeutics to market uniquely positions the Renal Division to improve the lives of CKD patients.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
