James Huff


1924 - 2014
Obituary
Condolences



























Huff, James James Bentley (Jim) Huff, a resident of Dallas, Texas, passed peacefully on July 4, 2014. Jim was born on July 6, 1924 in Ada, Oklahoma as the only child of James Wiley Huff and Beatrice Blanche Huff. Beatrice passed away in 1930, when Jim was six years old. His father remarried Bertha Campbell Perry, who raised Jim as if he were her own son. Jim attended the University of Oklahoma and earned Bachelor's Degree in Accounting. He practiced public accounting in the Dallas/Fort Worth area from the 1950s until his retirement approximately 50 years later. He was considered an expert in federal income tax matters and was a close counselor to his clients particularly in regard to financing matters. He was fascinated by the automobile business and left accounting for a few years to operate car dealerships and created the first discount car rental agency in the 1960s. He had two long marriages. He married Mary Lou Tribbey on Christmas Eve in 1949. They were married for 21 years and had two sons. After their divorce, Jim married Theresa Dean Smith in 1972 whom he first met in high school in Ada, Oklahoma. They were married for 20 years. In addition to his professional and family life, Jim was a Freemason, and he was an active participant in the Shriners International. He was a past president of the Fort Worth Drum and Bugle Corp; he was a member of the Court of Jesters; and he raised money for the Shriners Hospitals for Children. He is survived by his two sons with Mary Lou: James Warren Huff of Dallas, Texas and Gary Bentley Huff of Fort Worth, Texas. He has five grandchildren: Connor Warren Huff, Dillon Bailey Huff, Noel Justin Huff, Heather Michelle Bartlett, and Kyle Bentley Huff. He has one great grandson, Nathan Scott Bartlett. A private memorial service and interment will be held at the Rosedale Cemetery in Ada, Oklahoma. Memorial contributions in lieu of flowers can be made to the Shriners Hospitals for Children.
