Recent News 



21st Century Fox marks 10 years of industry-leading sustainability effortsMay 9, 2017 –Ten years ago today, our company made a bold commitment to minimize our environmental impacts, grow sustainably, and inspire others to take action, with the launch of the Global Energy Initiative.
Thanks to the dedication, creativity and passion of colleagues from around the world, we have delivered on that commitment, and improved our business and our communities in the process. Our efforts have reduced our operating costs by hundreds of millions of dollars, built important relationships with partners and audiences, earned recognition for our leadership, and established best practices for the entire entertainment industry.
Over the past decade, we have invested in renewable energy and energy efficiency, including the recently completed expansion of solar power systems at our studio lot in LA, and built new offices on three continents—in Mumbai, Los Angeles, and Rio de Janeiro—that have achieved LEED certification, recognizing their green design. In 2010, 21CF became the first global media company to reach a carbon neutral target; since then we’ve developed new targets to drive continued improvement and have made significant progress toward those goals.…
We have helped lead our industry in environmentally responsible film and television production, most recently with efforts on FX’s Legion, FOX’s The X-Files, and Super Bowl LI, and set new environmental standards for the way we create and deliver our content. On screen, compelling storytelling continues to be our most powerful tool in engaging audiences on environmental issues, with programming such as Avatar, The Simpsons, and Before the Flood entertaining our global viewers while encouraging them to think critically about their own impacts on their communities and the world.
Our expanded partnership with National Geographic also speaks to this commitment, with captivating stories that take us to the far reaches of our planet and inspire us to better protect it. National Geographic’s cutting-edge research and exploration help find solutions to our world’s most pressing challenges and give our readers and viewers a front-row seat to the action.
As we mark this milestone and enter the second decade of our sustainability efforts, which continue as part of 21CF Social Impact, we thank our colleagues from every part of the organization who have helped bring us this far.

Watch National Geographic’s coal industry documentary for free until July 3June 26, 2017 –From June 26 until July 3, audiences can watch From the Ashes, National Geographic’s new feature documentary about the coal industry, for free on YouTube, Amazon, Facebook, and several more streaming services. The documentary, from Emmy-nominated director Michael Bonfiglio, examines how the coal industry affects life on the planet, as well as how communities across America continue to address its legacy. National Geographic initially broadcast From the Ashes on June 25 and will continue to roll the film out globally across 171 countries and 45 languages.…
“From the Ashes is more relevant than ever. The film explores the complexities of the coal industry and its impact on the environment, economy and public health,” said Tim Pastore, president of original programming and production for National Geographic channels. “At National Geographic, we are committed to furthering the national dialogue on clean energy and are thrilled to make From the Ashes available for free across such a wide array of streaming platforms.”
Viewers can watch From the Ashes on Natgeotv.com and all Nat Geo TV Apps across iOS and Android devices, Apple TV, Roku, and Samsung Connected TVs. A commercial-free version is available to stream on YouTube, Facebook, Hulu, Amazon, Google Play, and VOD.
The documentary convenes coal miners, renewable energy leaders, politicians, public health experts, activists, and more to explore every side of the coal industry debate, from the impact of burning coal on climate change to the economic challenges facing communities that rely on the coal industry for jobs. In an interview with National Geographic, Bonfiglio spoke about his efforts to de-politicize these issues and present them fairly and informatively.  
“Our approach was really to try and remove some of the inherent partisan and polarizing nature of the subject matter,” he said. “We just drew information in, looking at multiple sides of a story, trying to provide people with information and facts they probably haven't thought about… And I do hope that [the film] will offer a starting point to talk about some of these issues.”
From the Ashes initially premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival and has since launched a CrowdRise campaign to support organizations working to diversify economies in regions affected by the coal industry’s decline. Bloomberg Philanthropies, a partner on the film, will match all donations up to $3 million and has also organized a worldwide screening tour, including screenings in Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, San Francisco, Vancouver, Washington, Brussels, London, Mexico City, and Paris. The film has also screened at more than 200 colleges and universities throughout the U.S.
Lean more about From the Ashes, and watch the full-length documentary for free on the platforms above by July 3.

LA’s FoxGives team spends a week in Huarmey providing hands-on support for Peruvian flood relief efforts June 19, 2017 –On May 28, a group of LA-based Fox colleagues touched down in Huarmey, Peru to support the country’s flood relief efforts. Organized by FoxGives, the group partnered with All Hands Volunteers, a non-profit organization dedicated to assisting with disaster relief across the globe. Peru has suffered from intense excessive rainfall over the last six months, resulting in numerous landslides, flash flooding, and mudflows. The Peruvian government has reported 700,000 people homeless, 18,000 houses inhabitable, and 928 schools destroyed, with numbers steadily rising. Huarmey, the location for the program, was highlighted as an area that had received limited help after it had recently been hit with a massive mudslide.…
Working alongside the Peru Flood Response Program, the FoxGives team spent a week in Huarmey cleaning out mud and debris from local homes. The team also helped repair homes that had retained their infrastructure and demolishing ones that needed to be rebuilt. One Spanish-speaking member of the FoxGives team assisted with translations and site assessments while another colleague from National Geographic helped with media and mapping of the town. “The whole group not only integrated well into our project but actually went above and beyond to help with translations and media and community engagement projects,” said Josceline Cuff, Project Director of All Hands Volunteers. The team also raised funds on the Fox lot to contribute to other relief efforts in Peru.
“As people whose job it is to tell impactful, unique, and ultimately human stories, a trip like the one I experienced in Peru, seems required. Not only did I leave feeling like I had genuinely made a difference in Huarmey, but my scope of the world has broadened as well,” reflected Fox volunteer Emily Wolfe at the end of the trip.
Head to FoxGives to learn more and check out photos from Peru.

DePaul students create new sustainability strategies for FOX Sports and MLB as part of FOX Sports UniversityJune 19, 2017 –Public Relations students at DePaul University in Chicago met with senior executives from 21st Century Fox, FOX Sports, and Major League Baseball on June 5 to pitch new project ideas and marketing campaigns for the companies’ joint environmental sustainability efforts. The presentation was the result of a semester-long partnership between DePaul and the FOX Sports University program, which allows college students the chance to work directly with sports industry professionals on a real-world problem facing their business. DePaul students were charged with creating new public messaging strategies that raise awareness of FOX Sports and MLB’s sustainability initiatives throughout the baseball season.…
“We would love to thank FOX Sports, 21st Century Fox, and MLB for giving us such a rich assignment,” said Don Ingle, whose PR class at DePaul took part in FOX Sports University this spring. “Our students take so much pride in [this program], and it would not be possible without FOX Sports University specifically going to Major League Baseball and getting them to agree that this was the right time and that we were the right school to be doing this kind of campaign... I’ve never seen any class have this much professional involvement from beginning to end.”
Ingle’s class of 24 students worked for ten weeks to create the marketing campaigns, drawing on the MLB’s nearly decade-long history of environmental sustainability, which includes projects on LED lighting, recycling, water conservation, and more. The students worked in four teams of six to immerse themselves in MLB sustainability and pitched projects and campaigns such as expanded bike sharing opportunities at the All-Star Game and a baseball giveaway with the slogan “Strike Out Your Footprint” stamped on each ball. The teams also created public service announcements about sustainability designed to air during key points in the season, such as the playoffs and the World Series, which is broadcast on FOX Sports.
“The sustainability effort is important because [sports] is a platform that reaches so many people,” said junior Melissa Bellew. “Almost everyone is interested in at least one professional sport, and if they see the players or their favorite team practicing sustainability, fans will be more likely to [do so, as well].”
FOX Sports and MLB executives worked directly with the students throughout the semester to offer professional guidance. They briefed the students on the project at the beginning of the term, checked in via conference call mid-way through, and returned to Chicago on June 5 to hear the students’ pitches in person. This model is typical of FOX Sports University partnerships, which seek to give students as much hands-on experience in the sports industry as possible.
"I've learned more about myself and my strengths in relation to a team than in any other class," said Caroline Fronczak, a senior public relations and advertising student. "I know this experience will be something I take with me as I pursue a career in the sports industry."
FOX Sports University is now in its ninth year and works with nearly 40 universities across the U.S., devising individual projects and convening unique business partners for each participating school. The program allows students to apply the skills they learn in the classroom to real-world business challenges and provides FOX Sports with fresh insights from the industry’s next generation of leaders. To date, more than 5,000 students have participated in FOX Sports University, nearly 100 of whom have gone on to work for FOX Sports, either through internships or full-time employment. Even more students have been referred to FOX Sports partners for employment opportunities as they approach graduation.

FOX Sports University: A Year in ReviewJune 15, 2017 –As final exams conclude, and college seniors across the country prepare to take their first steps into the real world, FOX Sports University wraps up its ninth year, covering more campuses and impacting more students than ever before. FOX Sports University is the largest, most comprehensive program of its kind, with the intent on bridging the gap between academia and the sports industry. Together with nearly 40 acclaimed University partners, the FOX Sports University program provides unique and enriching educational opportunities to students from coast-to-coast while uncovering fresh insights for our business. To date, over 5,000 students have participated in FOX Sports University.
As we graduate another class of eager young talent, FOX Sports University reflects on the past school year, and would like to thank FOX employees for their commitment to bringing their unique insights and experience into classrooms across the country. Here is a look back on some of the highlights of the last year:
FOX SPORTS UNIVERSITY SUPERSTARS TAKE SUPER BOWL LI
For the first time ever, FOX Sports University students were challenged with a digital project surrounding the crown jewel of the sports broadcast industry: the Super Bowl.…
Journalism students at the University of Missouri, and Advertising students at the University of North Carolina were challenged by FOX Sports to develop creative ways for the network to engage fans through social and digital platforms surrounding Super Bowl LI on FOX. The winning student teams from each school were invited for an exclusive, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to join the FOX Sports team in Houston during Super Bowl LI Media Week. Students networked with FOX executives, toured NRG Stadium and Radio Row, watched live tapings of FS1 studio shows, and even saw some of their ideas come to life. Our winning teams left Houston impressed, inspired, and with an experience they will never forget.


 

FOX SPORTS UNIVERSITY JOINS FORCES WITH MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL TO “GO GREEN”
Committed to sustainability, FOX Sports and MLB teamed up to inspire change in a new generation of young adults at DePaul University.
Public Relations students at DePaul University were challenged by 21CF Social Impact, FOX Sports, and MLB to develop creative marketing and PR messaging that FOX and MLB can utilize to raise awareness for joint sustainability efforts throughout the baseball season. While many MLB team partners have worked with the FOX Sports University program, this is the first time the league office has been involved in the classroom. The students truly stepped up to the plate with strong final presentations that utilized FOX and MLB assets during jewel events – Opening Day, All-Star Week, and the Post-Season!

FOX SPORTS UNIVERSITY ALUM- A RECORD NUMBER ARE AMONG US
This Summer, 12 FOX Sports University alumni will join nine different FOX Sports departments as Summer Interns.
With its unique access to top-level student talent across the country, FOX Sports University continues to serve as a recruitment pipeline for many FOX business units. FOX Sports University’s network has led to the hiring of nearly 100 FOX Sports University students since the program’s inception in 2007. This summer, FOX Sports University students from University of North Carolina, Marquette, New York University, Syracuse, Michigan, Southern Methodist University, Villanova and Seton Hall accepted internship positions across the company. From PROcast to FOX Sports Ad Sales, Home Team Sports, FS1, PR and Marketing, the FOX Sports University Program continues to be an asset for our company.

Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (stylized as 21st Century Fox, simply known as Fox, and also called 21CF) is an American multinational mass media corporation based in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was one of two companies formed from the 2013 spin-off of the publishing assets of News Corporation, as founded by Rupert Murdoch in 1979. 21st Century Fox is the legal successor to News Corporation dealing primarily in the film and television industries and is currently the world's fourth largest media conglomerate (after Comcast, The Walt Disney Company and Time Warner). The other company, the "new" News Corporation, holds Murdoch's print interests (both owned by him and his family via a family trust with 39 percent controlling interest in each).
The company's assets include the Fox Entertainment Group—owners of the 20th Century Fox film studio and Fox television network, and among other assets, pan-Asian pay channel operator Star TV; and on December 9, 2016, 21CF announced a bid for full control of United Kingdom-based Sky Plc, whose independent directors supported the deal.[4][5]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
21st Century Fox was formed by the splitting of entertainment and media properties from News Corporation. In February 2012, Natalie Ravitz accepted a position to become Rupert Murdoch’s Chief of Staff at News Corporation.[6] News Corporation's board approved the split on May 24, 2013, while shareholders approved the split on June 11, 2013;[7] the company completed the split on June 28 and formally started trading on the NASDAQ on July 1.[8][9][10] Plans for the split were originally announced on June 28, 2012, while additional details, and the working name of the new company were unveiled on December 3, 2012.[11][12][13]
Murdoch stated that performing this split would "unlock the true value of both companies and their distinct assets, enabling investors to benefit from the separate strategic opportunities resulting from more focused management of each division." The move also came in the wake of a series of scandals that had damaged the reputation of the company's publishing operations in the United Kingdom.[9][11] The split was structured so that the old News Corporation would change its name to 21st Century Fox and spin off its publishing assets into a "new" News Corporation.[10][14][15]
While the company was originally announced as the Fox Group, on April 16, 2013, Murdoch announced the new name as a way to suggest the retaining of 20th Century Fox's heritage as the group advances into the future. Its logo was officially unveiled on May 9, 2013, featuring a modernized version of the iconic Fox searchlights.[16][17] However, the 21st Century Fox brand does not extend to the existing 20th Century Fox division (which remains under its original name).[18]
The formation of 21st Century Fox was officially finalized on June 28, 2013. It formally began trading on the NASDAQ and Australian Securities Exchange on July 1, 2013.[19][20]
Subsequent history[edit]
On January 8, 2014, Rupert Murdoch announced plans to delist 21st Century Fox's shares from the Australian Securities Exchange, in favor of solely trading on the NASDAQ. Its listing in Australia was a holdover from its period as News Corporation, and 21st Century Fox has relatively little presence in Australia unlike News Corp. Murdoch stated that the changes, which were expected to be complete by June 2014, would "simplify the capital and operating structure" of 21st Century Fox and provide "improved liquidity" to shareholders.[20][21]
In June 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid to acquire Time Warner, which had similarly spun off its publishing assets, for $80 billion in a cash and stock deal. The deal, which was rejected by Time Warner's board of directors in July 2014, would have also involved the sale of CNN to ease antitrust issues.[22] On August 5, 2014, 21st Century Fox announced it had withdrawn its bid for Time Warner.[23] The company's stock had fallen sharply since the bid was announced, prompting directors to announce 21st Century Fox would buy back $6 billion of its shares over the following 12 months.[24]
On July 25, 2014, 21st Century Fox announced the sale of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland to BSkyB for $9 billion, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.[25] Fox would use the money from the sale, along with $25 billion it received from Goldman Sachs, to attempt another bid for Time Warner.
On September 9, 2015, 21st Century Fox announced a for-profit joint venture with the National Geographic Society. The new company will be called National Geographic Partners, and will take ownership of all of National Geographic media and consumer-based operations including National Geographic magazine, and the National Geographic television networks that were already run as a joint venture with the company. 21st Century Fox holds a 73% stake in the company.[26][27]
On December 15, 2016, 21st Century Fox reached an agreement to takeover the 61% of Sky that it did not already own.[28] The company was valued at £18.5bn. The deal was approved by the European Commission on April 7, 2017,[29] followed by Ireland's Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on June 27,[30] while still waiting for approval in the UK.
On April 30, 2017, it was reported that 21st Century Fox was in talks to purchase Tribune Media.[31][32]
On May 7, 2017, it was reported that Sinclair Broadcast Group was nearing a deal to purchase Tribune Media,[33][34] and that 21st Century Fox had dropped its bid for the company.[35][36]
On May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group officially announced its intent to acquire Tribune Media. The transaction will be a cash-and-stock deal valuing the company at $3.9 billion.[37]
Operations[edit]
21st Century Fox's operations can be broadly categorized into four major reporting segments:

Cable Network Programming
Television
Filmed Entertainment
Direct-Broadcast Satellite Television.[38]

Among the divisions of the company is Twentieth Century Fox Consumer Products which "licenses and markets properties worldwide" on behalf of a number of 21st Century Fox assets and third-parties.[39]
As of 2015[update], the senior vice president for government relations was Joe Welch.[40]
Corporate governance[edit]
On its formation in 2013, Murdoch was chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company, while Chase Carey took the posts of president and chief operating officer.[41] Co-chairman and Co-CEO positions were created in 2014 and filled by Lachlan Murdoch and James Murdoch, respectively, both sons of Rupert Murdoch.[42]
On July 1, 2015, Lachlan Murdoch was elevated to Co-Executive Chairman alongside his father and James Murdoch replaced his father as CEO. Former COO Chase Carey became Executive Vice Chairman.[43]
Assets[edit]
Main article: List of assets owned by 21st Century Fox
21st Century Fox primarily consists of the media and broadcasting properties that were owned by its predecessor, such as the Fox Entertainment Group, STAR TV, and their 39.14% stake in Sky plc. News Corporation's broadcasting properties in Australia, such as Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, remain a part of the newly renamed News Corp Australia—which was spun off with the new News Corp and is not a part of 21st Century Fox.[14]

Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (stylized as 21st Century Fox, simply known as Fox, and also called 21CF) is an American multinational mass media corporation based in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was one of two companies formed from the 2013 spin-off of the publishing assets of News Corporation, as founded by Rupert Murdoch in 1979. 21st Century Fox is the legal successor to News Corporation dealing primarily in the film and television industries and is currently the world's fourth largest media conglomerate (after Comcast, The Walt Disney Company and Time Warner). The other company, the "new" News Corporation, holds Murdoch's print interests (both owned by him and his family via a family trust with 39 percent controlling interest in each).
The company's assets include the Fox Entertainment Group—owners of the 20th Century Fox film studio and Fox television network, and among other assets, pan-Asian pay channel operator Star TV; and on December 9, 2016, 21CF announced a bid for full control of United Kingdom-based Sky Plc, whose independent directors supported the deal.[4][5]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
21st Century Fox was formed by the splitting of entertainment and media properties from News Corporation. In February 2012, Natalie Ravitz accepted a position to become Rupert Murdoch’s Chief of Staff at News Corporation.[6] News Corporation's board approved the split on May 24, 2013, while shareholders approved the split on June 11, 2013;[7] the company completed the split on June 28 and formally started trading on the NASDAQ on July 1.[8][9][10] Plans for the split were originally announced on June 28, 2012, while additional details, and the working name of the new company were unveiled on December 3, 2012.[11][12][13]
Murdoch stated that performing this split would "unlock the true value of both companies and their distinct assets, enabling investors to benefit from the separate strategic opportunities resulting from more focused management of each division." The move also came in the wake of a series of scandals that had damaged the reputation of the company's publishing operations in the United Kingdom.[9][11] The split was structured so that the old News Corporation would change its name to 21st Century Fox and spin off its publishing assets into a "new" News Corporation.[10][14][15]
While the company was originally announced as the Fox Group, on April 16, 2013, Murdoch announced the new name as a way to suggest the retaining of 20th Century Fox's heritage as the group advances into the future. Its logo was officially unveiled on May 9, 2013, featuring a modernized version of the iconic Fox searchlights.[16][17] However, the 21st Century Fox brand does not extend to the existing 20th Century Fox division (which remains under its original name).[18]
The formation of 21st Century Fox was officially finalized on June 28, 2013. It formally began trading on the NASDAQ and Australian Securities Exchange on July 1, 2013.[19][20]
Subsequent history[edit]
On January 8, 2014, Rupert Murdoch announced plans to delist 21st Century Fox's shares from the Australian Securities Exchange, in favor of solely trading on the NASDAQ. Its listing in Australia was a holdover from its period as News Corporation, and 21st Century Fox has relatively little presence in Australia unlike News Corp. Murdoch stated that the changes, which were expected to be complete by June 2014, would "simplify the capital and operating structure" of 21st Century Fox and provide "improved liquidity" to shareholders.[20][21]
In June 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid to acquire Time Warner, which had similarly spun off its publishing assets, for $80 billion in a cash and stock deal. The deal, which was rejected by Time Warner's board of directors in July 2014, would have also involved the sale of CNN to ease antitrust issues.[22] On August 5, 2014, 21st Century Fox announced it had withdrawn its bid for Time Warner.[23] The company's stock had fallen sharply since the bid was announced, prompting directors to announce 21st Century Fox would buy back $6 billion of its shares over the following 12 months.[24]
On July 25, 2014, 21st Century Fox announced the sale of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland to BSkyB for $9 billion, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.[25] Fox would use the money from the sale, along with $25 billion it received from Goldman Sachs, to attempt another bid for Time Warner.
On September 9, 2015, 21st Century Fox announced a for-profit joint venture with the National Geographic Society. The new company will be called National Geographic Partners, and will take ownership of all of National Geographic media and consumer-based operations including National Geographic magazine, and the National Geographic television networks that were already run as a joint venture with the company. 21st Century Fox holds a 73% stake in the company.[26][27]
On December 15, 2016, 21st Century Fox reached an agreement to takeover the 61% of Sky that it did not already own.[28] The company was valued at £18.5bn. The deal was approved by the European Commission on April 7, 2017,[29] followed by Ireland's Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on June 27,[30] while still waiting for approval in the UK.
On April 30, 2017, it was reported that 21st Century Fox was in talks to purchase Tribune Media.[31][32]
On May 7, 2017, it was reported that Sinclair Broadcast Group was nearing a deal to purchase Tribune Media,[33][34] and that 21st Century Fox had dropped its bid for the company.[35][36]
On May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group officially announced its intent to acquire Tribune Media. The transaction will be a cash-and-stock deal valuing the company at $3.9 billion.[37]
Operations[edit]
21st Century Fox's operations can be broadly categorized into four major reporting segments:

Cable Network Programming
Television
Filmed Entertainment
Direct-Broadcast Satellite Television.[38]

Among the divisions of the company is Twentieth Century Fox Consumer Products which "licenses and markets properties worldwide" on behalf of a number of 21st Century Fox assets and third-parties.[39]
As of 2015[update], the senior vice president for government relations was Joe Welch.[40]
Corporate governance[edit]
On its formation in 2013, Murdoch was chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company, while Chase Carey took the posts of president and chief operating officer.[41] Co-chairman and Co-CEO positions were created in 2014 and filled by Lachlan Murdoch and James Murdoch, respectively, both sons of Rupert Murdoch.[42]
On July 1, 2015, Lachlan Murdoch was elevated to Co-Executive Chairman alongside his father and James Murdoch replaced his father as CEO. Former COO Chase Carey became Executive Vice Chairman.[43]
Assets[edit]
Main article: List of assets owned by 21st Century Fox
21st Century Fox primarily consists of the media and broadcasting properties that were owned by its predecessor, such as the Fox Entertainment Group, STAR TV, and their 39.14% stake in Sky plc. News Corporation's broadcasting properties in Australia, such as Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, remain a part of the newly renamed News Corp Australia—which was spun off with the new News Corp and is not a part of 21st Century Fox.[14]

Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (stylized as 21st Century Fox, simply known as Fox, and also called 21CF) is an American multinational mass media corporation based in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was one of two companies formed from the 2013 spin-off of the publishing assets of News Corporation, as founded by Rupert Murdoch in 1979. 21st Century Fox is the legal successor to News Corporation dealing primarily in the film and television industries and is currently the world's fourth largest media conglomerate (after Comcast, The Walt Disney Company and Time Warner). The other company, the "new" News Corporation, holds Murdoch's print interests (both owned by him and his family via a family trust with 39 percent controlling interest in each).
The company's assets include the Fox Entertainment Group—owners of the 20th Century Fox film studio and Fox television network, and among other assets, pan-Asian pay channel operator Star TV; and on December 9, 2016, 21CF announced a bid for full control of United Kingdom-based Sky Plc, whose independent directors supported the deal.[4][5]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
21st Century Fox was formed by the splitting of entertainment and media properties from News Corporation. In February 2012, Natalie Ravitz accepted a position to become Rupert Murdoch’s Chief of Staff at News Corporation.[6] News Corporation's board approved the split on May 24, 2013, while shareholders approved the split on June 11, 2013;[7] the company completed the split on June 28 and formally started trading on the NASDAQ on July 1.[8][9][10] Plans for the split were originally announced on June 28, 2012, while additional details, and the working name of the new company were unveiled on December 3, 2012.[11][12][13]
Murdoch stated that performing this split would "unlock the true value of both companies and their distinct assets, enabling investors to benefit from the separate strategic opportunities resulting from more focused management of each division." The move also came in the wake of a series of scandals that had damaged the reputation of the company's publishing operations in the United Kingdom.[9][11] The split was structured so that the old News Corporation would change its name to 21st Century Fox and spin off its publishing assets into a "new" News Corporation.[10][14][15]
While the company was originally announced as the Fox Group, on April 16, 2013, Murdoch announced the new name as a way to suggest the retaining of 20th Century Fox's heritage as the group advances into the future. Its logo was officially unveiled on May 9, 2013, featuring a modernized version of the iconic Fox searchlights.[16][17] However, the 21st Century Fox brand does not extend to the existing 20th Century Fox division (which remains under its original name).[18]
The formation of 21st Century Fox was officially finalized on June 28, 2013. It formally began trading on the NASDAQ and Australian Securities Exchange on July 1, 2013.[19][20]
Subsequent history[edit]
On January 8, 2014, Rupert Murdoch announced plans to delist 21st Century Fox's shares from the Australian Securities Exchange, in favor of solely trading on the NASDAQ. Its listing in Australia was a holdover from its period as News Corporation, and 21st Century Fox has relatively little presence in Australia unlike News Corp. Murdoch stated that the changes, which were expected to be complete by June 2014, would "simplify the capital and operating structure" of 21st Century Fox and provide "improved liquidity" to shareholders.[20][21]
In June 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid to acquire Time Warner, which had similarly spun off its publishing assets, for $80 billion in a cash and stock deal. The deal, which was rejected by Time Warner's board of directors in July 2014, would have also involved the sale of CNN to ease antitrust issues.[22] On August 5, 2014, 21st Century Fox announced it had withdrawn its bid for Time Warner.[23] The company's stock had fallen sharply since the bid was announced, prompting directors to announce 21st Century Fox would buy back $6 billion of its shares over the following 12 months.[24]
On July 25, 2014, 21st Century Fox announced the sale of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland to BSkyB for $9 billion, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.[25] Fox would use the money from the sale, along with $25 billion it received from Goldman Sachs, to attempt another bid for Time Warner.
On September 9, 2015, 21st Century Fox announced a for-profit joint venture with the National Geographic Society. The new company will be called National Geographic Partners, and will take ownership of all of National Geographic media and consumer-based operations including National Geographic magazine, and the National Geographic television networks that were already run as a joint venture with the company. 21st Century Fox holds a 73% stake in the company.[26][27]
On December 15, 2016, 21st Century Fox reached an agreement to takeover the 61% of Sky that it did not already own.[28] The company was valued at £18.5bn. The deal was approved by the European Commission on April 7, 2017,[29] followed by Ireland's Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on June 27,[30] while still waiting for approval in the UK.
On April 30, 2017, it was reported that 21st Century Fox was in talks to purchase Tribune Media.[31][32]
On May 7, 2017, it was reported that Sinclair Broadcast Group was nearing a deal to purchase Tribune Media,[33][34] and that 21st Century Fox had dropped its bid for the company.[35][36]
On May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group officially announced its intent to acquire Tribune Media. The transaction will be a cash-and-stock deal valuing the company at $3.9 billion.[37]
Operations[edit]
21st Century Fox's operations can be broadly categorized into four major reporting segments:

Cable Network Programming
Television
Filmed Entertainment
Direct-Broadcast Satellite Television.[38]

Among the divisions of the company is Twentieth Century Fox Consumer Products which "licenses and markets properties worldwide" on behalf of a number of 21st Century Fox assets and third-parties.[39]
As of 2015[update], the senior vice president for government relations was Joe Welch.[40]
Corporate governance[edit]
On its formation in 2013, Murdoch was chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company, while Chase Carey took the posts of president and chief operating officer.[41] Co-chairman and Co-CEO positions were created in 2014 and filled by Lachlan Murdoch and James Murdoch, respectively, both sons of Rupert Murdoch.[42]
On July 1, 2015, Lachlan Murdoch was elevated to Co-Executive Chairman alongside his father and James Murdoch replaced his father as CEO. Former COO Chase Carey became Executive Vice Chairman.[43]
Assets[edit]
Main article: List of assets owned by 21st Century Fox
21st Century Fox primarily consists of the media and broadcasting properties that were owned by its predecessor, such as the Fox Entertainment Group, STAR TV, and their 39.14% stake in Sky plc. News Corporation's broadcasting properties in Australia, such as Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, remain a part of the newly renamed News Corp Australia—which was spun off with the new News Corp and is not a part of 21st Century Fox.[14]

Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (stylized as 21st Century Fox, simply known as Fox, and also called 21CF) is an American multinational mass media corporation based in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was one of two companies formed from the 2013 spin-off of the publishing assets of News Corporation, as founded by Rupert Murdoch in 1979. 21st Century Fox is the legal successor to News Corporation dealing primarily in the film and television industries and is currently the world's fourth largest media conglomerate (after Comcast, The Walt Disney Company and Time Warner). The other company, the "new" News Corporation, holds Murdoch's print interests (both owned by him and his family via a family trust with 39 percent controlling interest in each).
The company's assets include the Fox Entertainment Group—owners of the 20th Century Fox film studio and Fox television network, and among other assets, pan-Asian pay channel operator Star TV; and on December 9, 2016, 21CF announced a bid for full control of United Kingdom-based Sky Plc, whose independent directors supported the deal.[4][5]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
21st Century Fox was formed by the splitting of entertainment and media properties from News Corporation. In February 2012, Natalie Ravitz accepted a position to become Rupert Murdoch’s Chief of Staff at News Corporation.[6] News Corporation's board approved the split on May 24, 2013, while shareholders approved the split on June 11, 2013;[7] the company completed the split on June 28 and formally started trading on the NASDAQ on July 1.[8][9][10] Plans for the split were originally announced on June 28, 2012, while additional details, and the working name of the new company were unveiled on December 3, 2012.[11][12][13]
Murdoch stated that performing this split would "unlock the true value of both companies and their distinct assets, enabling investors to benefit from the separate strategic opportunities resulting from more focused management of each division." The move also came in the wake of a series of scandals that had damaged the reputation of the company's publishing operations in the United Kingdom.[9][11] The split was structured so that the old News Corporation would change its name to 21st Century Fox and spin off its publishing assets into a "new" News Corporation.[10][14][15]
While the company was originally announced as the Fox Group, on April 16, 2013, Murdoch announced the new name as a way to suggest the retaining of 20th Century Fox's heritage as the group advances into the future. Its logo was officially unveiled on May 9, 2013, featuring a modernized version of the iconic Fox searchlights.[16][17] However, the 21st Century Fox brand does not extend to the existing 20th Century Fox division (which remains under its original name).[18]
The formation of 21st Century Fox was officially finalized on June 28, 2013. It formally began trading on the NASDAQ and Australian Securities Exchange on July 1, 2013.[19][20]
Subsequent history[edit]
On January 8, 2014, Rupert Murdoch announced plans to delist 21st Century Fox's shares from the Australian Securities Exchange, in favor of solely trading on the NASDAQ. Its listing in Australia was a holdover from its period as News Corporation, and 21st Century Fox has relatively little presence in Australia unlike News Corp. Murdoch stated that the changes, which were expected to be complete by June 2014, would "simplify the capital and operating structure" of 21st Century Fox and provide "improved liquidity" to shareholders.[20][21]
In June 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid to acquire Time Warner, which had similarly spun off its publishing assets, for $80 billion in a cash and stock deal. The deal, which was rejected by Time Warner's board of directors in July 2014, would have also involved the sale of CNN to ease antitrust issues.[22] On August 5, 2014, 21st Century Fox announced it had withdrawn its bid for Time Warner.[23] The company's stock had fallen sharply since the bid was announced, prompting directors to announce 21st Century Fox would buy back $6 billion of its shares over the following 12 months.[24]
On July 25, 2014, 21st Century Fox announced the sale of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland to BSkyB for $9 billion, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.[25] Fox would use the money from the sale, along with $25 billion it received from Goldman Sachs, to attempt another bid for Time Warner.
On September 9, 2015, 21st Century Fox announced a for-profit joint venture with the National Geographic Society. The new company will be called National Geographic Partners, and will take ownership of all of National Geographic media and consumer-based operations including National Geographic magazine, and the National Geographic television networks that were already run as a joint venture with the company. 21st Century Fox holds a 73% stake in the company.[26][27]
On December 15, 2016, 21st Century Fox reached an agreement to takeover the 61% of Sky that it did not already own.[28] The company was valued at £18.5bn. The deal was approved by the European Commission on April 7, 2017,[29] followed by Ireland's Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on June 27,[30] while still waiting for approval in the UK.
On April 30, 2017, it was reported that 21st Century Fox was in talks to purchase Tribune Media.[31][32]
On May 7, 2017, it was reported that Sinclair Broadcast Group was nearing a deal to purchase Tribune Media,[33][34] and that 21st Century Fox had dropped its bid for the company.[35][36]
On May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group officially announced its intent to acquire Tribune Media. The transaction will be a cash-and-stock deal valuing the company at $3.9 billion.[37]
Operations[edit]
21st Century Fox's operations can be broadly categorized into four major reporting segments:

Cable Network Programming
Television
Filmed Entertainment
Direct-Broadcast Satellite Television.[38]

Among the divisions of the company is Twentieth Century Fox Consumer Products which "licenses and markets properties worldwide" on behalf of a number of 21st Century Fox assets and third-parties.[39]
As of 2015[update], the senior vice president for government relations was Joe Welch.[40]
Corporate governance[edit]
On its formation in 2013, Murdoch was chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company, while Chase Carey took the posts of president and chief operating officer.[41] Co-chairman and Co-CEO positions were created in 2014 and filled by Lachlan Murdoch and James Murdoch, respectively, both sons of Rupert Murdoch.[42]
On July 1, 2015, Lachlan Murdoch was elevated to Co-Executive Chairman alongside his father and James Murdoch replaced his father as CEO. Former COO Chase Carey became Executive Vice Chairman.[43]
Assets[edit]
Main article: List of assets owned by 21st Century Fox
21st Century Fox primarily consists of the media and broadcasting properties that were owned by its predecessor, such as the Fox Entertainment Group, STAR TV, and their 39.14% stake in Sky plc.

Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (stylized as 21st Century Fox, simply known as Fox, and also called 21CF) is an American multinational mass media corporation based in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was one of two companies formed from the 2013 spin-off of the publishing assets of News Corporation, as founded by Rupert Murdoch in 1979. 21st Century Fox is the legal successor to News Corporation dealing primarily in the film and television industries and is currently the world's fourth largest media conglomerate (after Comcast, The Walt Disney Company and Time Warner). The other company, the "new" News Corporation, holds Murdoch's print interests (both owned by him and his family via a family trust with 39 percent controlling interest in each).
The company's assets include the Fox Entertainment Group—owners of the 20th Century Fox film studio and Fox television network, and among other assets, pan-Asian pay channel operator Star TV; and on December 9, 2016, 21CF announced a bid for full control of United Kingdom-based Sky Plc, whose independent directors supported the deal.[4][5]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
21st Century Fox was formed by the splitting of entertainment and media properties from News Corporation. In February 2012, Natalie Ravitz accepted a position to become Rupert Murdoch’s Chief of Staff at News Corporation.[6] News Corporation's board approved the split on May 24, 2013, while shareholders approved the split on June 11, 2013;[7] the company completed the split on June 28 and formally started trading on the NASDAQ on July 1.[8][9][10] Plans for the split were originally announced on June 28, 2012, while additional details, and the working name of the new company were unveiled on December 3, 2012.[11][12][13]
Murdoch stated that performing this split would "unlock the true value of both companies and their distinct assets, enabling investors to benefit from the separate strategic opportunities resulting from more focused management of each division." The move also came in the wake of a series of scandals that had damaged the reputation of the company's publishing operations in the United Kingdom.[9][11] The split was structured so that the old News Corporation would change its name to 21st Century Fox and spin off its publishing assets into a "new" News Corporation.[10][14][15]
While the company was originally announced as the Fox Group, on April 16, 2013, Murdoch announced the new name as a way to suggest the retaining of 20th Century Fox's heritage as the group advances into the future. Its logo was officially unveiled on May 9, 2013, featuring a modernized version of the iconic Fox searchlights.[16][17] However, the 21st Century Fox brand does not extend to the existing 20th Century Fox division (which remains under its original name).[18]
The formation of 21st Century Fox was officially finalized on June 28, 2013. It formally began trading on the NASDAQ and Australian Securities Exchange on July 1, 2013.[19][20]
Subsequent history[edit]
On January 8, 2014, Rupert Murdoch announced plans to delist 21st Century Fox's shares from the Australian Securities Exchange, in favor of solely trading on the NASDAQ. Its listing in Australia was a holdover from its period as News Corporation, and 21st Century Fox has relatively little presence in Australia unlike News Corp. Murdoch stated that the changes, which were expected to be complete by June 2014, would "simplify the capital and operating structure" of 21st Century Fox and provide "improved liquidity" to shareholders.[20][21]
In June 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid to acquire Time Warner, which had similarly spun off its publishing assets, for $80 billion in a cash and stock deal. The deal, which was rejected by Time Warner's board of directors in July 2014, would have also involved the sale of CNN to ease antitrust issues.[22] On August 5, 2014, 21st Century Fox announced it had withdrawn its bid for Time Warner.[23] The company's stock had fallen sharply since the bid was announced, prompting directors to announce 21st Century Fox would buy back $6 billion of its shares over the following 12 months.[24]
On July 25, 2014, 21st Century Fox announced the sale of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland to BSkyB for $9 billion, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.[25] Fox would use the money from the sale, along with $25 billion it received from Goldman Sachs, to attempt another bid for Time Warner.
On September 9, 2015, 21st Century Fox announced a for-profit joint venture with the National Geographic Society. The new company will be called National Geographic Partners, and will take ownership of all of National Geographic media and consumer-based operations including National Geographic magazine, and the National Geographic television networks that were already run as a joint venture with the company. 21st Century Fox holds a 73% stake in the company.[26][27]
On December 15, 2016, 21st Century Fox reached an agreement to takeover the 61% of Sky that it did not already own.[28] The company was valued at £18.5bn. The deal was approved by the European Commission on April 7, 2017,[29] followed by Ireland's Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on June 27,[30] while still waiting for approval in the UK.
On April 30, 2017, it was reported that 21st Century Fox was in talks to purchase Tribune Media.[31][32]
On May 7, 2017, it was reported that Sinclair Broadcast Group was nearing a deal to purchase Tribune Media,[33][34] and that 21st Century Fox had dropped its bid for the company.[35][36]
On May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group officially announced its intent to acquire Tribune Media. The transaction will be a cash-and-stock deal valuing the company at $3.9 billion.[37]
Operations[edit]
21st Century Fox's operations can be broadly categorized into four major reporting segments:

Cable Network Programming
Television
Filmed Entertainment
Direct-Broadcast Satellite Television.[38]

Among the divisions of the company is Twentieth Century Fox Consumer Products which "licenses and markets properties worldwide" on behalf of a number of 21st Century Fox assets and third-parties.[39]
As of 2015[update], the senior vice president for government relations was Joe Welch.[40]
Corporate governance[edit]
On its formation in 2013, Murdoch was chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company, while Chase Carey took the posts of president and chief operating officer.[41] Co-chairman and Co-CEO positions were created in 2014 and filled by Lachlan Murdoch and James Murdoch, respectively, both sons of Rupert Murdoch.[42]
On July 1, 2015, Lachlan Murdoch was elevated to Co-Executive Chairman alongside his father and James Murdoch replaced his father as CEO. Former COO Chase Carey became Executive Vice Chairman.[43]
Assets[edit]
Main article: List of assets owned by 21st Century Fox
21st Century Fox primarily consists of the media and broadcasting properties that were owned by its predecessor, such as the Fox Entertainment Group, STAR TV, and their 39.14% stake in Sky plc. News Corporation's broadcasting properties in Australia, such as Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, remain a part of the newly renamed News Corp Australia—which was spun off with the new News Corp and is not a part of 21st Century Fox.[14]

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
