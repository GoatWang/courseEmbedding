Australian equities


Our value-based investment philosophy and disciplined investment process has generated attractive returns for our Australian equity clients for over 30 years.
At the heart of our investment philosophy is our bottom-up stock selection approach, which is driven by in-depth analysis and estimates, prepared by our experienced team of investment professionals.
We use this internal research to help us identify Australian companies that are currently trading at an attractive discount to their true underlying value. These companies may have fallen out of favour with investors in the short-term due to a company-specific announcement, a profit downgrade, a negative growth outlook or a new market trend.
We know from our decades of experience that the market, more often than not, overreacts to many of these short-term events. That’s why we always take a long-term view, as it allows us to look through this short-term ‘noise’ and invest in good companies at attractive prices. It’s an investment approach that some describe as contrarian, given we tend to avoid those companies that are seen as ‘market favourites’. We offer both large and small company investment strategies.
Our process has been consistently applied for over 30 years and is one that continues to provide what our clients want from us.

Global listed infrastructure







We use our disciplined investment process to invest in global listed infrastructure securities that we believe will provide our clients with attractive risk adjusted returns. We invest only in those assets with the strongest combination of inflation linkage and low cash flow volatility, and with a high level of corporate governance and management alignment.
At the heart of our investment philosophy is our bottom-up stock selection approach, which is driven by rigorous fundamental research and extensive cash flow modelling undertaken by our experienced team of infrastructure specialists.
While not a ‘top-down’ investment manager, we also consider the macroeconomic environment as part of our investment process, given the impact these factors can have on infrastructure asset valuations. 
We use our internal research to generate a tightly controlled focus list, which includes infrastructure securities from  approximately 110 companies around the world that we believe provide the strongest combination of inflation protection and low volatility.
This is a relatively high conviction strategy, which ensures our portfolios have meaningful exposure to our best investment ideas. Our investment team invest a significant portion of their financial wealth in the strategy, ensuring a strong alignment of interests with our clients.
It’s our commitment to infrastructure investment and our proven investment approach that allows our clients to access the real benefits of infrastructure investment.

Our tighter definition of infrastructure
Our focus on inflation protection and low volatility

Asia Pacific equities


Our value-based investment philosophy and disciplined investment process has been in place for over 30 years, and applied to the Asia Pacific region for over 14 years.
Our Asia Pacific capability covers three equity strategies – Asia ex-Japan, Asia Pacific ex-Japan and Pacific Developed ex-Japan.
At the heart of our investment philosophy is our bottom-up stock selection approach, which is driven by in-depth analysis and estimates, prepared by our experienced team of investment professionals.
We use this internal research to help us identify companies in the Asian region that are currently trading at an attractive discount to their true underlying value. These companies may have fallen out of favour with investors in the short-term due to an adverse market event such as a company-specific announcement, profit downgrade or negative growth outlook.
We know from our decades of experience that the market, more often than not, overreacts to many of these short-term events.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

Helping you achieve your goals


We help individual investors achieve their financial goals through our range of managed funds that invest in Australian equities, Asia Pacific equities and global listed infrastructure.
We’ve used the same disciplined investment approach and in-depth research process for our Australian equities strategy for over 30 years, where we only invest in companies that we believe are trading below their true intrinsic value. This same investment approach has been applied to our Asia Pacific equities strategy since 2002.
Our global listed infrastructure investment strategy targets infrastructure stocks with low volatility, inflation protection and strong corporate governance. We apply deep fundamental analysis whilst controlling macroeconomic risks.
Our investment teams across all of our strategies are highly experienced. We also ensure our interests are aligned with those of our clients, and that everything we do is consistent with our strong risk management and compliance framework.
It’s an approach that has allowed us to provide attractive returns over the long term.
We also keep our investors informed about their investments with an ongoing range of reports around fund performance, portfolio positioning and market insights.

Keep your child happy and secure with health and safety suppliesBabies are delicate, vulnerable little people who need constant assistance from the grownups in their lives. Luckily, keeping your little bundle of joy healthy, happy and safe has never been easier. Walmart carries a range of healthcare, monitoring and security products that give parents peace of mind and make the task of keeping an eye on your little one simple and effective. With options ranging from personal care products such as lotions to emergency medical supplies such as thermometers and a range of different tech tools for monitoring, our Every Day Low Prices make it possible for you to stock up on the supplies you need to make your life with baby peaceful and smooth.Health and safety essentialsIf you're a new parent, you may be a little overwhelmed by the range of options in the Walmart Baby Health and Safety department. Don't worry; we're here to help. By breaking the department as a whole up into smaller product-focused sections, you can make it easier to find exactly what you need and identify the products that work best for your budget and lifestyle.Baby grooming and healthcareBabies have delicate skin and sensitive eyes, and they require gentler personal care products than kids and adults use. From baby shampoo that's gentle on the eyes to specially formulated lotions that keep your baby's skin from getting too dry, this product category helps you cover all your personal-care bases to keep your baby clean, soft and dry. This is also the section where you'll find healthcare essentials. Just as babies need specially formulated soaps and lotions, they also require special dosages of medications. Don't give your baby adult formulations of over-the-counter medications like Tylenol. Stick with baby formulas and follow recommended dosages on the bottles for everything from gas-relieving medications to pain and fever relief. This section also has specially designed tools like thermometers and nasal aspirators to help you keep track of your baby's illness and relieve issues like nasal congestion. Babies can't blow their own noses, so nasal aspirators are an important tool to keep on hand just in case your little one gets a stuffy nose. Other grooming- and health-related supplies designed specially for babies, like first aid kits, teething toys, bumpers for sharp corners and bath thermometers, are available in this section.Baby gates and babyproofingNewborn infants aren't too difficult to keep track of they aren't going to move without your help. But with each passing week, babies get more crafty about moving around on their own and finding new ways to cause mischief without even realizing it. You can keep your baby safe and save the contents of your cabinets from getting an infant-spurred reorganization with the equipment in our Baby Gates and Babyproofing sections. If you have pets or older children, baby gates can be helpful right from day one of bringing your baby home from the hospital. These simple gates let you set up temporary barriers in your home to block off space and make hazards like staircases inaccessible to little ones. You can pen your baby into an area larger than a playpen or crib to allow some freedom while also placing limits on access. Similarly, babyproofing supplies let you prevent access to rooms, windows, cabinets and other potential hazards. Shopping for your babyproofing supplies before you bring your little one home can make it easier to get this protective gear in place when you actually need it. You can prevent your baby from fiddling with electrical outlets, toilet seat lids and other household fixtures with the supplies in this section.Baby MonitorsBaby monitors are a high-tech way of making sure your baby stays comfortable and quiet at night or during naptime in the middle of the day. Our Baby Monitors section includes all the latest technology, giving you the ability to hear and see your baby. With so many trusted brands on offer, you can pick and choose from the available options to find the most reliable, highest-quality baby monitor money can buy. While you can still find the classic two-way radio baby monitor style that provides audio feedback from your baby's room, you can also invest in a webcam-style baby monitor to allow family members and other loved ones to peek into your baby's nursery from across the globe. This can also allow parents at work to check in on the baby and give nervous new moms and dads the ability to leave their infant with a babysitter and still stay plugged in to what's going on at home. Visual baby monitors can even be useful while you're inside the house; in addition to hearing whether your baby is fussing, you'll be able to see whether there are any potential hazards in the crib or determine whether your baby is asleep or peacefully awake by just glancing at your monitor.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863239, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
