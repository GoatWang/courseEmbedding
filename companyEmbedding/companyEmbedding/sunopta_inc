SunOpta Inc. Announces Exit from Flexible Re-Sealable Pouch 
      Products and Sale of Its Allentown Pouch Equipment






                    	July 27, 2017 07:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time 
                    	



TORONTO--(EON: Enhanced Online News)--SunOpta Inc. (Nasdaq:STKL) (TSX:SOY), a leading global company focused 
      on organic, non-genetically modified and specialty foods, announced 
      today that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell equipment used 
      in the production of flexible, re-sealable pouches from its Allentown, 
      PA facility to Skjodt-Barrett for $2.0 million. The asset sale is in 
      conjunction with the Company’s decision to discontinue flexible, 
      re-sealable pouch products as part of its ongoing portfolio optimization 
      strategy and Value Creation Plan.
    
“Each employee has contributed to our goal of bringing well-being 
      to life in their own way and has had a meaningful impact at SunOpta.”

      “This asset sale, and discontinuation of the flexible re-sealable pouch 
      business aligns with our stated portfolio optimization strategy of 
      exiting product lines where the Company is not effectively positioned,” 
      said Dave Colo, CEO of SunOpta. “We anticipate the discontinuation of 
      contract manufacturing pouched baby food products to be profit neutral 
      and allow for the redeployment of capital and resources for investment 
      in more profitable segments of our business where we have enhanced 
      strategic positioning.”
    

      Flexible re-sealable pouch products accounted for $46 million of 
      revenues in fiscal 2016, and $10 million of revenues in the first 
      quarter of 2017, and were part of the healthy snacks platform within the 
      consumer products segment. SunOpta will continue to produce aseptic 
      beverages from its Allentown, PA facility, which were not part of the 
      sale. The sale of equipment is expected to close during the fourth 
      quarter of 2017.
    

      “I want to thank all of our employees involved in the flexible 
      re-sealable pouch operations for their hard work and dedication," Colo 
      said. “Each employee has contributed to our goal of bringing well-being 
      to life in their own way and has had a meaningful impact at SunOpta.”

Forward-Looking Statements


      Certain statements included in this press release may be considered 
      "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the United States 
      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian 
      securities legislation, which are based on information available to us 
      on the date of this release. These forward-looking statements include, 
      but are not limited to, the anticipated impact of our exit from flexible 
      re-sealable pouch products on profits, the expected time to close the 
      sale of equipment, and anticipated benefits from the sale of the pouch 
      equipment. Terms and phrases such as "expect", "anticipate", "will", 
      "continue", and other similar terms and phrases are intended to identify 
      these forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements are based 
      on information available to us on the date of this release and are based 
      on estimates and assumptions made by the Company in light of its 
      experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions 
      and expected future developments as well as other factors the Company 
      believes are appropriate in the circumstances including the relatively 
      modest contribution from flexible re-sealable pouch products to our 
      consolidated revenues and profits historically. The Company makes no 
      representation that reasonable business people in possession of the same 
      information would reach the same conclusions. Whether actual timing and 
      results will agree with expectations and predications of the Company is 
      subject to many risks and uncertainties including that all conditions of 
      closing the sale of the pouch equipment are satisfied, the inability or 
      failure of the purchaser to satisfy the purchase price for the pouch 
      equipment, changes in the level of capital investment and various other 
      risks and uncertainties as described from time to time under "Risk 
      Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and its Quarterly 
      Reports on Form 10-Q (available at www.sec.gov). 
      Consequently, all forward-looking statements made herein are qualified 
      by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the 
      actual results or developments anticipated by the Company will be 
      realized.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

SunOpta expects to cut about 60 employees in Upper Macungie - Lehigh Valley Business Cycle

Jon HarrisContact ReporterOf The Morning Call




Global organic food company SunOpta Inc. expects to reduce employment at its Upper Macungie Township plant by about 60 workers as it exits the flexible, resealable pouch business and attempts a turnaround of its business.SunOpta on Thursday announced it has signed an agreement to sell equipment used in the production of flexible, resealable pouches at its Upper Macungie facility to Ontario-based food company Skjodt-Barrett for $2 million. The equipment sale is expected to close during the fourth quarter.That means the Upper Macungie plant, which employs 114, won’t be a dual-purpose consumer products facility for much longer. While one part of the facility handles flexible, resealable pouches primarily for baby food, SunOpta completed a $25 million expansion in November 2015 that added aseptic processing capabilities for beverages such as soy or almond milk.SunOpta said it will continue to produce aseptic beverages from the Upper Macungie facility. In fact, a spokesman said, SunOpta could expand its aseptic beverage capabilities at the plant. With that in mind, SunOpta said it has no intention of reducing its footprint in the 101,000-square-foot facility at 7108 Daniels Drive.

SunOpta leases the facility from J.G. Petrucci Co. Inc., and the lease doesn’t expire until April 2027, according to the company’s annual report.SunOpta expects to run the pouch business at the plant through October. The roughly 60 employees who will be affected by SunOpta’s decision will be considered for openings on the aseptic side of the plant or at other SunOpta facilities, the company said.“I want to thank all of our employees involved in the flexible resealable pouch operations for their hard work and dedication,” SunOpta CEO Dave Colo said in a news release. “Each employee has contributed to our goal of bringing well-being to life in their own way and has had a meaningful impact at SunOpta.”SunOpta, with its partner Oaktree Capital Management, has been trying to turn the company around through a value-creation plan that focuses on four pillars: portfolio optimization, operational excellence, go-to-market effectiveness and process sustainability.

In the first quarter, SunOpta reported a loss of $11.4 million, or 16 cents a share, compared with a loss in the year-earlier period of $9.7 million, or 11 cents a share. The company also reported revenues of $330 million in the quarter, a 6.3 percent decrease from $352.3 million a year earlier.Colo said the equipment sale  fits into the company’s new strategy and will allow for the redeployment of capital for investment in more profitable parts of SunOpta’s business.The flexible, resealable pouch business and aseptic beverage unit have appeared to be headed in different directions for quite some time. Consider the company’s fourth-quarter results in 2015.While the new aseptic beverage operation in Upper Macungie was just ramping up and starting to win the company new business, SunOpta had to eat $2.2 million in costs because of downtime and spoilage resulting from an equipment failure during the quarter in the pouch side of the local plant.

SunOpta selling off equipment of one of two Lehigh Valley production lines

SunOpta Inc., a Toronto-based organic food company, which has operations in Upper Macungie Township, has sold the equipment for one of the two product lines packaged there.
It sold its resealable pouch production equipment for $2 million to Skjodt-Barrett, an Ontario-based food packager.
In a press release, SunOpta said the sale was made in conjunction with its decision to discontinue flexible, resealable pouch products as part of its ongoing strategy, which had it “exiting product lines where the company is not effectively positioned.”
Flexible resealable pouch products accounted for $46 million in revenue in fiscal 2016 and $10 million in the first quarter of 2017 and were part of SunOpta’s healthy snacks platform in its consumer products segment.
SunOpta opened food-pouch manufacturing operations in Upper Macungie in 2012 and added a $25 million expansion in late 2015 to add aseptic processing for soy, almond and similar milk products.
Aseptic processing production will continue at the plant.
The company did not respond to a question on how the equipment sale would affect employment at the facility, although Dave Colo, CEO of SunOpta, issued a statement.
“I want to thank all of our employees involved in the flexible resealable pouch operations for their hard work and dedication,” Colo said. “Each employee has contributed to our goal of bringing well-being to life in their own way and has had a meaningful impact at SunOpta.”
As of February 2016, the company reported adding 48 jobs for aseptic processing on top of the 52 employees it had previously on the resealable pouch production line.
The equipment sale is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter this year.

SunOpta expects to cut about 60 employees in Upper Macungie - Lehigh Valley Business Cycle

Global organic food company SunOpta Inc. expects to reduce employment at its Upper Macungie Township plant by about 60 workers as it exits the flexible, resealable pouch business and attempts a turnaround of its business.SunOpta on Thursday announced it has signed an agreement to sell equipment used in the production of flexible, resealable pouches at its Upper Macungie facility to Ontario-based food company Skjodt-Barrett for $2 million. The equipment sale is expected to close during the fourth quarter.That means the Upper Macungie plant, which employs 114, won’t be a dual-purpose consumer products facility for much longer. While one part of the facility handles flexible, resealable pouches primarily for baby food, SunOpta completed a $25 million expansion in November 2015 that added aseptic processing capabilities for beverages such as soy or almond milk.SunOpta said it will continue to produce aseptic beverages from the Upper Macungie facility. In fact, a spokesman said, SunOpta could expand its aseptic beverage capabilities at the plant. With that in mind, SunOpta said it has no intention of reducing its footprint in the 101,000-square-foot facility at 7108 Daniels Drive.

SunOpta leases the facility from J.G. Petrucci Co. Inc., and the lease doesn’t expire until April 2027, according to the company’s annual report.SunOpta expects to run the pouch business at the plant through October. The roughly 60 employees who will be affected by SunOpta’s decision will be considered for openings on the aseptic side of the plant or at other SunOpta facilities, the company said.“I want to thank all of our employees involved in the flexible resealable pouch operations for their hard work and dedication,” SunOpta CEO Dave Colo said in a news release. “Each employee has contributed to our goal of bringing well-being to life in their own way and has had a meaningful impact at SunOpta.”SunOpta, with its partner Oaktree Capital Management, has been trying to turn the company around through a value-creation plan that focuses on four pillars: portfolio optimization, operational excellence, go-to-market effectiveness and process sustainability.

In the first quarter, SunOpta reported a loss of $11.4 million, or 16 cents a share, compared with a loss in the year-earlier period of $9.7 million, or 11 cents a share. The company also reported revenues of $330 million in the quarter, a 6.3 percent decrease from $352.3 million a year earlier.Colo said the equipment sale  fits into the company’s new strategy and will allow for the redeployment of capital for investment in more profitable parts of SunOpta’s business.The flexible, resealable pouch business and aseptic beverage unit have appeared to be headed in different directions for quite some time. Consider the company’s fourth-quarter results in 2015.While the new aseptic beverage operation in Upper Macungie was just ramping up and starting to win the company new business, SunOpta had to eat $2.2 million in costs because of downtime and spoilage resulting from an equipment failure during the quarter in the pouch side of the local plant.

SunOpta selling off equipment of one of two Lehigh Valley production lines

SunOpta Inc., a Toronto-based organic food company, which has operations in Upper Macungie Township, has sold the equipment for one of the two product lines packaged there.
It sold its resealable pouch production equipment for $2 million to Skjodt-Barrett, an Ontario-based food packager.
In a press release, SunOpta said the sale was made in conjunction with its decision to discontinue flexible, resealable pouch products as part of its ongoing strategy, which had it “exiting product lines where the company is not effectively positioned.”
Flexible resealable pouch products accounted for $46 million in revenue in fiscal 2016 and $10 million in the first quarter of 2017 and were part of SunOpta’s healthy snacks platform in its consumer products segment.
SunOpta opened food-pouch manufacturing operations in Upper Macungie in 2012 and added a $25 million expansion in late 2015 to add aseptic processing for soy, almond and similar milk products.
Aseptic processing production will continue at the plant.
The company did not respond to a question on how the equipment sale would affect employment at the facility, although Dave Colo, CEO of SunOpta, issued a statement.
“I want to thank all of our employees involved in the flexible resealable pouch operations for their hard work and dedication,” Colo said. “Each employee has contributed to our goal of bringing well-being to life in their own way and has had a meaningful impact at SunOpta.”
As of February 2016, the company reported adding 48 jobs for aseptic processing on top of the 52 employees it had previously on the resealable pouch production line.
The equipment sale is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter this year.
