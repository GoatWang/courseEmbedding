JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREInsult To Injury: Rethinking Our Responses To Intimate Abuseby Mills, Linda G.Locking up men who beat their partners sounds like a tremendous improvement over the days when men could hit women with impunity and women fearing for their lives could expect no help from authorities. But does our system of requiring the arrest, prosecution, and incarceration of abusers lessen domestic violence or help battered women? In this already controversial but vitally important book, we learn that the criminal justice system may actually be making the problem of domestic violence worse. Looking honestly at uncomfortable facts, Linda Mills makes the case for a complete overhaul and presents a promising alternative.The evidence turns up some surprising facts about the complexities of intimate abuse, facts that run against mainstream assumptions: The current system robs battered women of what power they do hold. Perhaps as many as half of women in abusive relationships stay in them for strong cultural, economic, religious, or emotional reasons. Jailing their partners often makes their situations worse. Women are at least as physically violent and emotionally aggressive as are men toward women, and women's aggression is often central to the dynamic of intimate abuse. Informed by compelling evidence, personal experience, and what abused women themselves say about their needs, Mills proposes no less than a fundamentally new system. Addressing the real dynamics of intimate abuse and incorporating proven methods of restorative justice, Mills's approach focuses on healing and transformation rather than shame or punishment. Already the subject of heated controversy, Insult to Injury offers a desperately needed and powerful means for using what we know to reduce violence in our homes.General, Women's StudiesCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

But does our system of requiring the arrest, prosecution, and incarceration of abusers lessen domestic violence or help battered women? In this already controversial but vitally important book, we learn that the criminal justice system may actually be making the problem of domestic violence worse. Looking honestly at uncomfortable facts, Linda Mills makes the case for a complete overhaul and presents a promising alternative.The evidence turns up some surprising facts about the complexities of intimate abuse, facts that run against mainstream assumptions: The current system robs battered women of what power they do hold. Perhaps as many as half of women in abusive relationships stay in them for strong cultural, economic, religious, or emotional reasons. Jailing their partners often makes their situations worse. Women are at least as physically violent and emotionally aggressive as are men toward women, and women's aggression is often central to the dynamic of intimate abuse. Informed by compelling evidence, personal experience, and what abused women themselves say about their needs, Mills proposes no less than a fundamentally new system. Addressing the real dynamics of intimate abuse and incorporating proven methods of restorative justice, Mills's approach focuses on healing and transformation rather than shame or punishment. Already the subject of heated controversy, Insult to Injury offers a desperately needed and powerful means for using what we know to reduce violence in our homes.GeneralCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

She created this amazing new world with new lick-a-licious new alpha males, the Blood kings. And she brought us some Greek mythology as well.There is one think I need to say. It is not common to have a cover model, Tommy Barresi really represent the main character of a book! The photographer Eric Battershell and Linda Boulanger the Cover Designer did an amazing job.The Prologue is one of the best I have read in a while. It lays a foundation for us to understand the future of the Kings, but it also shows the pain and betrayal Viktoras had to endure. We learn of the caliber of men Viktoras surrounded him with and that says much of the man he is. Viktoras was a man who walked righteous and was devoted to the gods he served, to the end he had hope and it was repaid!Katarina has needs to let her fathers dreams become reality. She also saved his company from being ruined to being a success. Kat also created a new technology that can change everything, only thing is she needs the backing of a Company like the one Viktor Katsaros has. Kay knows exactly what she needs and have been trying to contact Viktor to setup a meeting with him. She even tried stalking him at the man of the year award, fortunately she gets to meet Roman Marinos that brokers the deal. 3 months and she has to present her product to Katsaros Indusrustries.Viktor is close to his 3,000th year. Without bonding with his true ate he will disappear into nothingness but be welcomed in the fields of heroes in death, never knowing the light his mate would bring. His heart won't beat with joy. He knew when Katarina was born, he knew her pain, he knew he couldn't go to her in her grieve, even when he had to be restrained!The love in the supernatural is not as normal as for humans, it is instant. It is predestined. With all the good happening, there is always evil abound. It is present even here. And  you will have to read about it to fully understand the evil and the threat!I love that Julia made this world different to our dragon world. Her message still stays the same. Love conquers evil. I can not wait for the next book! I also like that she lets you know who is next... I can not wait Julia! Love your new series!Read more22 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA King and his Chosen QueenByDiana Pageon April 23, 2016Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseJulia Mills has taken the genre of the " Vampire" and shaken it out,  turned it upside down and side-ways. In this series the Kings of the Blood are born of the Gods, with rules of how they will live their lives, literally written in blood. Fast forward to now and each King only has until his 3rd millenium to find his mate, get her to fall in love and commit to him. Each King knows when she is born, but cannot interfere in her life until she comes to find him. Viktor is the Supreme Commander of the Kings, and his woman is the 1st to be born. Katerina has been trying to save her family's company since the death of both her parents, her meeting with Viktor seems like the best way to do this, she has absolutely no idea exactly how much her life is about to change. Viktor, having lived so l9ng and used to making all the rules everyone else follows, is in for a rude awakening with Kat, she has fought tooth and nail to make a go of her family legacy and she'll be damned if anyone (even someone who makes her breath hitch and her panties soaked) takes it from her. And the course of true love never is easy, add in an enemy of old and you have ano extremely hot, sexy, humorous start to what I believe will be one of Julia Mills best series. Don't get me wrong, I love, love, love, her Dragons books, and would start a protest if she ever stopped writing about our Dragons !! But these "Blood Kings" have a space in my heart too, so kudos to Julia Mills and 5''s all the way around . I recieved a gifted copy in exchange for an honest review.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsIt was okay, it could have been greatByDebra Johnsonon December 5, 2016Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseViktor: Heart of Her King (Kings of the Blood #1) by Julia Mills is an Adult Paranormal Romance.2 star rating on Goodreads = it's okay and that is my true rating.  Amazon's 2 stars = I don't like it.  That is not my true feelings.  It is okay. There are things about it I really liked.It has a unique premise in that Zeus creates the Blood Kings. Unfortunately, this story becomes tedious to read. Very redundant. I love the idea of the story, but Viktor and Katarina's thoughts are continuously repeated throughout. Among those thoughts is how the Blood Kings came to be. We already know how the kings are created from the prolog. In fact the prolog is the best part of this story. If Ms. Mills had not continued to repeat their creation over and over again and taken out all the repetitive thoughts I would have loved the story.There are some great moments in here. There is just a pinch of suspense. Also a few editing errors.I bought the first three books of this series at the same time. That and my curiosity will have me reading them, but I am not in a big rush.I have read other books of Ms. Julia Mills and actually follow her. Her 'Not Quite' series is my favorite so far.Viktor: Heart of Her King (Kings of the Blood Book 1)Read more0Comment|

				Rapid prototyping takes your designs out of the computer and into the real world, but choosing the right process is critical to success. Join product designer Gabriel Corbett for a tour of the most popular rapid-prototyping methods, straight from the workshop floor. This course includes first-hand looks at the machinery and techniques behind 3D printing, machining, resin casting, injection molding, 2D prototyping, and laser scanning. After you watch this course, you'll have a solid understanding of the available prototyping processes, and knowledge of the machinery and tools to bring your product through the prototyping stage and into the real world.
					
						Topics include:
						
3D printing parts, using fused deposition modeling, stereolithography, and selective laser sintering (FDM, SLA, and SLS)
Working with CNC mills and lathes
Building a silicon mold and resin casting a part

- Hi, I'm Gabe Corbett,
and welcome to Rapid Prototyping for Product Design.
After you designed your part in the computer,
it's standard practice to generate a physical prototype
of that part to evaluate it before sending
it to manufacturing.
In this course, we'll look at several common methods
for prototyping,
so you can start to decide which method will work
best for your parts.
We'll start with a quick overview of the different
prototyping methods.
We'll take a look at how prototyping fits
into the production workflow.
We'l look at different options for 3D printing,
a quick method for creating physical parts
which has become very popular lately.


We'll then dive deeper into what's involved
in setting up and running a printer.
We'll spend some time with CNC mills and lays
to give you an idea of what's involved in
machining and turning a part.
We'll look at both resin casting and injection molding,
two similar processes for creating casts and molded parts.
And finally, we'll work a 3D laser scanner
and a touch probe system to reverse engineer a part
and build a model in the computer.
If you've designed a part in Solworks or some other
CAD application, and you're ready to see that part
in the real world,
this course will give you a good idea of your options.


So, let's get started with Rapid Prototyping
for Product Design.

Pros
Amazing library of more than 3,000 online learning courses. Deep training for advanced software, particularly Adobe products. Well-structured site. Excellent video and audio quality. Well-vetted instructors.


Cons
No per-video or per-course access. Equally helpful training videos sometimes available for free online.


Bottom Line
Lynda.com is an outstanding resource for video-based, online learning, particularly if multimedia software or coding skills are what you need. The price is attractive, considering you get unfettered access to all the courses in Lynda.com's catalog.










Lynda.com is one of the best sources for online learning. For years, Lynda.com has put informative and clear video-based training in front of people who need it. As part of LinkedIn, it has added learning paths to help professionals gain new skills. The videos let you work at your own pace, and the website is designed to help you keep track of what you want to learn and what you have already learned. The site is exceptional at teaching technical skills and technique, such as photography and coding. Beyond multimedia training, Lynda.com also helps people pick up business principles, money-management advice, and much more. When you need skills training fast, Lynda.com is the go-to source for high-quality results and a PCMag Editors' Choice.

Price and Plans
Lynda.com is a subscription-based service. Some videos are made available free to help you preview courses, but you really need a subscription to get to the valuable meat of this online learning site. You can try the service free for 10 days, but you'll have to enter a credit card for access. Alternatively, you can try it out via LinkedIn Learning for one month, which also requires a credit card (or PayPal account) on file. You can sign up on Lynda.com with a unique login or sign in using your LinkedIn account.
A Basic plan costs $25 per month or if you are billed annually, $19.99 per month. It includes unlimited access to all the videos Lynda.com has to offer. In other words, rather than paying for a course, you pay for unlimited access to everything in the catalog. That flexibility is one of the key features of Lynda.com, separating it from other online learning services such as The Great Courses, which charge you per course.

The Basic plan comes with a few limitations. You can't download project files or watch any of the videos offline on a mobile device. If you pony up the $37.50 per month Premium subscription fee, you get project files. Opting for the $375 per year Premium account gets you offline viewing access. Note that offline viewing isn't included for Premium members who pay by the month. Group pricing is also available on request for four or more people. Lynda.com has apss for Android, AppleTV, iOS, and Windows.
Though Lynda.com's prices are completely reasonable for the high-quality training you receive, there are ways to get similar content free. Khan Academy is perhaps the best-known website, with a vast and ever-growing series of videos that help you learn all kinds of stuff. While excellent, Khan Academy started out teaching academic material, such as economics and algebra, so you might not find the exact skills training that you need there. Lynda.com excels at teaching software programs, particularly multimedia software, and professional techniques for using them. If you need a crash course in the latest features of Photoshop or InDesign, Lynda.com is sure to have them online quickly, whereas, with Khan, it's a crapshoot.
Excellent Features for Getting Started
As mentioned, you do need to enter credit card details or a PayPal account just to try out the site. If you forget to cancel within your ten-day window, you will be charged. Once you've set that up, Lynda.com asks you what you'd like to accomplish (improve at my job, change my career or job, learn skills, or build an app or a website).
If you choose one of the first three options, you'll be asked to choose your job or interests in order to get recommendations. If you opt to build an app or a website, you'll be directed to suggested learning paths, such as Become an iOS App Developer and courses such as Foundations of Programming: Fundamentals. Hover over a learning path tile to see the number of courses included. Click through, and you can see potential salary ranges and the number of hours the courses will take. Course recommendations also include the time commitment, level, and the number of views. You can preview courses before diving in.
Programming courses are broken down into a series of short videos, most of which are just a few minutes long. You can skip videos if you want or read the transcript instead. Another convenient feature is the ability to add them to a playlist. You can also find courses by searching keywords or browsing the alphabetized library.

Lynda.com's Videos and Help
I'm continually impressed with the quality of Lynda.com's videos. The player is large, with a few tabs below it for the video Overview, Transcript, View Offline, and Exercise Files. The Transcript tab has the full text of the video, and it highlights a few words at a time to sync up with the presenter's voice. That's impressive and amazingly helpful if the speaker talks too quickly, or you just didn't catch what she or he said. Exercise Files are available with Premium accounts and let you follow along with the instructor as he or she demonstrates lessons. (Pro-tip: If you sign up for Lynda on LinkedIn—branded as LinkedIn Learning—you can access Exercise Files during your free trial.)
Lynda.com really sets a high bar for sound and image quality, as well. The presenters are informative and rehearsed, but also relaxed. Like with Khan Academy, I really trust that these people are experts.
Lynda.com also highlights a variety of courses for those trying to pick up some new coding skills. Hundreds of courses and tens of thousands of video tutorials cover Web development and design topics for beginners and experts alike. The catalog features classes from the foundations of programming to specialized lessons on user interface, responsive design, and mobile app development. Some courses even feature expert opinions from legitimate titans of their respective industries, such as game designer Brenda Romero. And teachers will be pleased to know that many tutorials, including some free ones, are specifically targeted at children.
While Lynda.com's coding lessons lack the helpful interactivity of a service like Khan Academy and Treehouse (an Editors' Choice for paid learn-to-code services), they make up for it with a much greater breadth and depth of content. Treehouse adds an extra touch with pop-ups of important keyboard shortcuts and visual representations of coding symbols. The quality of the videos is also a lot more consistent, compared with Udemy's large, open marketplace.
When you complete a course, Lynda.com offers a certificate, which doesn't necessary bear any weight in the real world, but is useful for when an employer wants proof of your training before reimbursing you for a course. If you connect your account with LinkedIn, you can add these certificates to your profile as well.
The site doesn't skimp when it comes to support outside of the training material. A toll-free phone number, international telephone number, and email submission form all offer channels for technical support or to answer your questions. You'll find plenty of additional help files online, too.

Quality to Spare
Lynda.com delivers high-quality, painstakingly detailed content, especially for high-end software. Members can watch the same videos as many times as they need, at any time of day, wherever they have an Internet connection and appropriate video-streaming capabilities. With a Premium subscription paid annually, you can even download videos to a mobile device to watch them offline.
While you certainly can spend your time hunting down free online videos to learn the skills you'll pay to learn on Lynda.com, Lynda.com removes the hunting and scrubbing through ill-lighted amateur YouTube videos to give you what you need, plainly and simply. If you're the type of person who needs a live instructor to answer your precise questions, Lynda.com might not offer enough for you, but be warned that one live course could cost you three times as much as a month's worth of access. Lynda.com is our Editors' Choice for online learning.
