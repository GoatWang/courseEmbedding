Larry D. McVay
Larry D. McVay
Distinguished Engineer
1995
Degree
Mechanical Engineering – 1970 
Citation
At Time of Nomination in 1995
Larry D. McVay was born and raised in Levelland, Texas, where he was very active in school activities, athletics, and 
				church. He attended South Plains College in Levelland, and was recognized as an outstanding alumnus of that school in 
				1989. In 1970, he completed his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering at Texas Tech University, where he was 
				a member of Pi Tau Sigma, the national mechanical engineering fraternity.
While attending Texas Tech, Mr. McVay worked for Amoco for three summers. When he graduated in 1970, he went to work 
				for Amoco Production Company, and over the next ten years, he held numerous engineering, engineering supervision, and 
				engineering management positions in Texas, Illinois, and Colorado.
Mr. McVay became district manager at the Slaughter District in Brownfield, Texas, in 1980. At this location, the 
				largest of Amoco’s districts, he oversaw the industry’s first field scale carbon dioxide operations. This 
				$100 million project came in 30 percent under budget, ahead of schedule, and with minimal operating problems.
In his role as vice president and general manager of Amoco Pipeline, Mr. McVay developed a company–wide Safety 
				and Integrity Program and a systemic Crisis Management Program. Mr. McVay also managed refineries for Amoco in Wyoming 
				and Virginia. Effective March 28, 1993, Mr. McVay became vice president – progress of Amoco Corporation. This new 
				position was established to provide executive–level leadership of Amoco’s worldwide improvement efforts.
His many professional activities include serving as chapter chairman for the Regional American Petroleum Institute 
				and the Society of Petroleum Engineers. For his dedication, Mr. McVay has received the Meritorious Service Award from 
				the American Petroleum Institute. He also serves on the Industry Advisory Board for the Texas Tech Department of 
				Mechanical Engineering and the Engineering Department at Colorado State University. Texas Tech elected him to the 
				Mechanical Engineering Academy in 1993.
Much to society’s benefit, Mr. McVay is very civic–minded. He has served as president of two chambers of 
				commerce, and he has been chairman of several United Way campaigns. He is active in Rotary Club. In addition to being a 
				school board member for five years, he has served on the council boards of both Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America. 
				Mr. McVay also has been appointed to the Governor of Virginia’s Task for Implementation of the Clean Air Act and 
				to the Governor of Colorado’s Economic Development Council.
Some of his other interests include youth and church activities. He has tutored students and coached football, 
				soccer, baseball, and basketball for both boys and girls. Also, Mr. McVay is active on the administrative board of the 
				United Methodist Church.
He and his wife, Nancy, have two children, Heath and Heather. Mr. and Mrs. McVay live in Woodridge, Illinois.
We are more than pleased to announce that Larry D. McVay is a DISTINGUISHED ENGINEER of Texas Tech University.
