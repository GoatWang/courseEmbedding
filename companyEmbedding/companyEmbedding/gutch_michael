Biography
 This is Mike Gutch's first children's book other than his unpublished "book" he wrote in third grade about New York State, which coincidentally is where he resides, in the town of Pelham, just outside of New York City. Mike lives with his wife and four children. When he's not making peanut butter and honey sandwiches for them or working for the Man, he's enjoying the great outdoors. If you'd like to send him a note on the book or advice on how to get anything unstuck, you can email him at [email protected]
