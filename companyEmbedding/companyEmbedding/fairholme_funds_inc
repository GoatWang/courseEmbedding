A concurrent $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 Index grew only to $23,236.The potential advantages of The Fairholme Fund's long-term focused investment approach are most evident when evaluating our performance over any 5-year period since FAIRX inception.Through June 30, 2017, The Fairholme Fund has achieved 145 positive 5-year return periods and only 6 negative 5-year return periods, compared with 124 positive 5-year return periods and 27 negative 5-year return periods for the S&P 500. The Fairholme Fund's average rolling 5-year return was 65.70% versus 43.75% for the S&P 500. The Fairholme Fund has outperformed the S&P 500 in 98 of 151 5-year periods, calculated after each month’s end. The Fairholme Fund’s worst 5-year-period return was (6.89)% versus (29.05)% for the S&P 500. In its best 5-year period, The Fairholme Fund’s return was 185.26% versus the S&P 500’s best return of 181.57%.Standardized returns are available by clicking FAIRX FACTS in the menu to the left.  * Mutual fund investing involves risks, including loss of principal.

The investment return and principal value of an investment in The Fairholme Fund will fluctuate; an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

This exposes The Fairholme Fund to the risk of unanticipated industry conditions and risks particular to a single company or the securities of a single company. The Fairholme Fund’s performance may differ markedly from the performance of the S&P 500 Index in either up or down market trends. The performance of the S&P 500 Index is shown with all dividends reinvested and does not reflect any reduction in performance for the effects of transaction costs or management fees.

An investment in American International Group demonstrates Fairholme's commitment to identifying established public companies trading at prices well below our estimates of their intrinsic value. A leader in global property and casualty insurance, with over 70 million* customers and client relationships worldwide,  AIG is an example of a recovering icon that fell out of favor with investors.*AIG.com, "Our Businesses"







Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We believe that these two companies may be the most important financial institutions in the United States – perhaps the world – and directly support housing affordability and accessibility, including the uniquely American 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. They are a major reason why our country did not descend into a second Great Depression. Millions of American families depend on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to lower the costs and improve access to homeownership. In times of stress, these two have helped to ensure the continued functioning of the U.S. housing market. They have no substitutes. Fairholme’s investment in Fannie and Freddie demonstrates a commitment to ignore the crowd and invest in valuable, systemically important institutions – even those that are politically unpopular.







Bank of America spent tens of billions to clean up Countrywide Financial, which was no easy task. As the heavy lifting winds down, we believe the bank's profitability will shine through and the stock will begin to flex some muscle. 







Sears, a real estate behemoth in retailer's clothing, remains our proverbial beach ball held under water. Based on our latest estimates of underlying asset values, our research suggests that this may be a good long-term holding. Click here for important disclaimers, current performance, and portfolio composition information.

Fairholme Funds, Inc. Launches Fairholme Allocation Fund
January 3, 2011 (PLANSPONSOR.com) – Today the Fairholme Allocation Fund will be open to investors.  
By PLANSPONSOR staff editors@plansponsor.com | January 03, 2011 






















  














According to the announcement, the Fairholme Allocation Fund (ticker: FAAFX) seeks long-term total return from capital appreciation and income, and it attempts to achieve this investment objective by “investing in a focused portfolio of investments in the equity, fixed-income and cash and cash-equivalent asset classes”. The proportion of the fund’s portfolio invested in each asset class will vary from time to time “based on Fairholme’s assessment of relative fundamental values of securities and other investments in the class, the attractiveness of the investment opportunities within each asset class, general market and economic conditions, and expected future returns of investments,” according to the Miami-based firm. The fund seeks to capitalize on anticipated fluctuations in the financial markets by changing the mix of the Fund’s holdings in the targeted asset classes, and will use Fairholme’s focused, multi-sector, multi-strategy, value-based approach, according to a press release. The minimum investment to open a new account is $25,000. The minimum subsequent investment for regular accounts is $2,500 and $1,000 for retirement accounts. The annual fund operating expense is 0.75%.More information is available at http://www.fairholmefunds.com.

Fairholme Funds, Inc. - Fairholme Fund Will Re-Open To New Investors






Business Wire




Aug 15, 2013 4:00 PM EDT













 


























































  The Board of Directors of Fairholme Funds, Inc. has approved the re-opening of The Fairholme Fund (NASDAQ:FAIRX) to new investors. Effective August 19, 2013, The Fairholme Fund will offer its shares to new investors and begin accepting orders for the purchase of Fund shares from new investors. The decision to re-open the Fund to new investors was based on the expectation that, given the Fund’s current holdings, investment opportunities, and liquidity, inflows from new investors can be invested in a manner that is consistent with the Fund’s investment objective and strategies.  The Fund retains the right to suspend the sale of its shares to investors in the future.  A supplement to the Fund’s Prospectus and Summary Prospectus, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, provides additional information about the terms of the Fund’s offering.   Mutual fund investing involves risks, including loss of principal. The investment return and principal value of an investment in The Fairholme Fund will fluctuate; an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. The Fairholme Fund makes and has made focused investments in a limited number of issuers and does not seek to diversify its investments. This exposes The Fairholme Fund to the risk of unanticipated industry conditions and risks particular to a single company or the securities of a single company. The Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses should be considered carefully before investing. The   Fund’s   Prospectus and Summary Prospectus, which should be read carefully before investing, contain this and other important information about the Fund, and may be obtained by calling Shareholder Services at 1-866-202-2263 or visiting our website   www.fairholmefunds.com  .   Fairholme Distributors, LLC (8/13)
