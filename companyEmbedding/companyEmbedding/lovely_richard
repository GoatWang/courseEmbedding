About Acrylic Prints



Mounting Option #1

Mounting Option #2

Bring your artwork to life with the stylish lines and added depth of an acrylic print.   Your image gets printed directly onto the back of a 1/4" thick sheet of clear acrylic.
The image is the art - it doesn't get any cleaner than that!
All acrylic prints ship within 3 - 4 business days and arrive "ready to hang" with four aluminum mounting posts (Option #1) or hanging wire (Option #2).
The high gloss of the acrylic sheet complements the rich colors of any image to produce stunning results.
There are two different ways to mount your acrylic print.
Option #1 (Mounting Posts) - Attach your print to your wall with four aluminum mounting posts.   The cylindrical cap of each mounting post can be removed, allowing you to thread a small screw along the center axis of the of post and into the wall.   When you're finished, simply reattached each cap, and you're done.   The mounting posts act as stand-offs and keep your print separated from the wall by 1".   All of the required mounting hardware (i.e. posts, screws, and wall anchors) is included with your print.   Click here for mounting details.
Option #2 (Hanging Wire) - With this option, your acrylic print is attached to a 1/4" thick black board which has a wooden frame and hanging wire attached to the back.   There are no metal mounting posts at the corners.   Simply put a nail in your wall, hang your print from the hanging wire, and you're done.   Due to the thickness of the black board and mounting frame, your print is separated from the wall by 1.50"   Click here for mounting details.
