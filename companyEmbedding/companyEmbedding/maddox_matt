Attorney Profile
Matt comes from a family with a long and well known presence in the Springfield legal community. “My dad started his career when Truman was in office and finally quit when Obama was in office,” relates Matt.  “Times, technology and the law changed, but Dad’s ability to sort through the nonsense and counsel his clients with solid, common sense advice endured.  I would be happy to be half the lawyer he was.”  Matt considers himself fortunate to have practiced along with him for the first five years of his career.
Since 1988, Matt has concentrated his practice in the defense of civil litigation matters.  In 2001, Matt joined Quinn Johnston in the Springfield office as a partner with primary focus on medical malpractice defense. The Leading Lawyer Network recognizes him as one of the best medical malpractice defense lawyers in downstate Illinois, and he holds an “AV Preeminent” rating from Martindale.
“I consider it a privilege to represent a doctor in court,” says Matt, one of the most seasoned trial attorneys in the firm. His cases have involved a wide range of physician specialists: general surgeons, colorectal surgeons, neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, podiatrists, family practice physicians, obstetricians, internists, psychiatrists, emergency physicians and optometrists, to name a few.
When asked to list some highlights of his career, he cites the following:

Defense Verdicts in multiple medical negligence trials including claims related to emergency medicine, general surgery, breast surgery, psychiatric care, eye surgery, carpal tunnel surgery, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, primary care and obstetrics.  Other successfully defended trials include multiple railroad liability trials (FELA), farm liability, legal malpractice,  nursing home care, products liability and insurance contract claims.
Going to verdict in over 75 jury trials.
Service for five years on the Board of Directors of the Illinois Association of Defense Counsel.

Effective 483 Responses: Focus on CAPA Violations


    Everyone breathes a sigh of relief when the FDA investigators depart. But if they leave a Form 483 pointing out deficiencies and noncompliances, that’s when the work really starts.
