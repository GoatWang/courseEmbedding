Terms and conditions, risk statement and margin statement available on Scottrade.com.

		        	Explore Bonds 




















International Investing





Scottrade offers investment exposure to over 20 foreign markets through American Depository Receipts (ADRs).

What is a Managed Account?

            Managed accounts offered by online brokers are a backdoor way for online brokers to capture management fees from erstwhile independent investors who were 
            initially attracted to the freedom and low commissions offered by online trading. However, they make sense for investors with large portfolios or those who 
            don't have the time, ability, or interest to make 100% of their investment decisions. For an annual fee, generally about 1-2% of assets, the broker will 
            set up, monitor, and manage a portfolio of stocks, bonds, ETFs, cash, and whatever else the investors decide will best meet their investing goals.
            

            These accounts can feature groups of mutual funds or ETFs, a diversified portfolio of stocks, or any other combination of securities. Typically, investors 
            pay the advisor for finding the best portfolio fit and managing the account in either a passive or active manner. Managing may be as simple as "set it and 
            forget it," involve a periodic rebalancing, or involve more active trading. The management fee usually increases with the manager's degree of activity.
            
            Below are summaries of the managed account options and fees from five of the leading online brokerages. All information is obtained from each broker's websites.
            















Scottrade Managed Account Fees 
            Managed accounts are available only through Scottrade Investment Management, an affiliate of Scottrade. Minimum investments in their product, the Client 
            Program Account (CPA) are at least $25,000, depending on the account type. The standard fee schedule assesses the first $75,000 of an account at an annual 
            rate of 0.90% and decreases incrementally for account balances over that minimum.
            

            Scottrade Investment Management requires investors to call first to learn about the various programs, so no information about types of accounts or asset 
            allocation models was readily available. Scottrade prefers to have investors consult with an advisor before deciding on any managed account options.

Fidelity Managed Account Fees 
            Managed accounts with Fidelity also require a discussion with a Fidelity advisor who gathers information about an investor's goals and risk tolerance. 
            A proposal is then developed and submitted to the investor for review and approval. After approval, the assets are placed into the account selected by 
            the investor. Fidelity offers a wide selection of managed accounts, so they are presented in list form for ease of reading.
            
            Diversified Portfolios include:

            Fixed Income Managed Accounts typically require a $250,000 minimum investment. Options include PIMCO Municipal Bond Ladder strategies as well as short-term, intermediate, and long-term taxable bond strategies. Annual fees range from 0.25% to 0.65%, depending on the account size.
            
            Diversified Managed Accounts offer a variety of asset allocation models based on Schwab research. Annual fees are between 0.85% and 1.10%, depending on account size.

Etrade Managed Account Fees 
            E*Trade offers two managed account programs: Managed Investment Portfolios (MIP) and Unified Managed Accounts (UMA). MIPs are portfolios of diversified mutual funds and/or ETFs that are actively managed and rebalanced by the E*Trade investment team based on your goals and tolerance for risk. UMAs are more comprehensive and provide active professional portfolio management as well as broad diversification across several asset classes, tax management features, and access to experienced money managers.
            
            MIPs require a minimum investment of $25,000. Annual fees range from 0.90% on the first $100,000 of assets, down to 0.65% of assets above $1,000,000. Three income-producing models are offered (Conservative, Aggressive, and Inflation Protection). Four strategic growth models are offered (Conservative Growth, Moderate Growth, Growth, and Aggressive Growth).
            
            UMAs are designed for larger, more complex portfolios, with a $150,000 minimum investment required. Portfolios may include individual stocks as well as mutual funds and ETFs and will seek broader diversification combined with an asset allocation that aligns with investors' goals and risk tolerance. A premium is placed on tax efficiency. The manager will do rebalancing when necessary in order to maintain the target asset allocation.
            
            Annual fees start at 1.25% for the first $1,000,000 of assets and decrease incrementally to 0.95% for assets above $5,000,000.

Summary
            Managed accounts from reputable online brokerages are a viable alternative to full-service brokers who offer managed accounts. Lower costs are the main 
            reason to consider a managed account, but simplification and easier record keeping also play a role in attracting formerly independent investors. Although 
            it seems counterintuitive to pay a small percent to a company to manage of collection of mutual funds or ETFs that already charge annual expense fees, 
            managed accounts can provide better returns than individuals may achieve on their own because of inferior buying and selling decisions or inappropriate 
            asset allocations.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
