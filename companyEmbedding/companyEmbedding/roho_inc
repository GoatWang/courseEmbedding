Frequently Asked Questions




Which cushion is best for sitting long periods, pain relief, preventing pressure sores?

Regarding the ROHO family of products, the high profile (4" cells) line of products are going to offer the most immersion (sinking in) into the cushion. This greater immersion will increase the force (weight) redistribution of the client thus decreasing peek pressures and improving comfort, decreasing pain and preventing pressure ulcers. Through this immersion, you are better able to redistribute (equalize) the weight (force) of the client onto their thighs, greater trochanters (hips), and the ischial tuberosities (buttocks). Through immersion into the 4" cells, a ROHO cushion aims to reduce the extrinsic risk factors of peak pressures, shear and friction, and microclimate in pressure ulcer development; however, it is important to assess the client individually for other risk factors including, but not limited to, nutrition, circulation, and previous history of pressure ulcers which NO cushion is able to affectively address.

Can I place an incontinence pad, towel, drawl sheet or hoyer lift sling over top a ROHO cushion and/or a ROHO mattress?

Unfortunately, anything that you place over a ROHO cushion or mattress, actually any cushion or mattress, can interfere with the effectiveness. A ROHO cushion/mattress works by increasing the contact area of the individual when they immerse (sink) into the product thus redistributing the force so there is limited peek pressures at one specific landmark. When anything is placed between an individual and the cushion/mattress, surface tension is increased and thus they have a more difficult time immersing (sinking) into the cushion/mattress effectively.
However, since each and every individual needs to be treated individually and a plan of care needs to be considered based upon that individual’s specific circumstances, we also realize that other needs like incontinence, safety during transfers etc. need to be considered. A licensed healthcare professional should weigh the risks of placing a pad, towel or Hoyer lift sling, thus reducing the effectiveness of the cushion/mattress, versus the risk of not placing these items.
If an incontinence pad or drawl sheet is required while the individual is sitting on the cushion or lying on the mattress, it is our recommendation that the least amount of layers are used and these pads/sheets are put overtop the cushion/mattress in a fashion where they are very loose and NOT tight.
If the removal of a Hoyer lift sling from underneath a patient, who was transferred onto the cushion, is going to cause increased shear and friction, which may be detrimental to an individual’s skin, a licensed healthcare professional should weigh the risks of keeping the client on the cushion WITH the sling in place, versus removing the sling.

Can I use my ROHO cushion without the cover?

It is true that anything that you place over a ROHO cushion, actually any cushion can interfere with the effectiveness. A ROHO cushion works by increasing the contact area of the individual when they immerse (sink) into the product thus redistributing the force so there is limited peek pressures at one specific landmark. When anything is placed between an individual and the cushion, even a ROHO cover, surface tension is increased and thus they have a more difficult time immersing (sinking) into the cushion effectively. However, ROHO has gone to great lengths to provide a cover, which still allows immersion with the least amount of surface tension created. Mr. Graebe, the inventor of the ROHO cushion, from a scientific standpoint, would recommend a ROHO cushion actually be used without the cover.
As previously stated, our covers are made to be used so that there is little if any interference with pressure distribution when they are being used. When other things are used instead of our stretchable, breathable cover, like a pillowcase, a sheet, a quilted chuck, or another wheelchair cushion cover, there is less effectiveness of the cushion due to increase tension. Bottom line, the person has less immersion and envelopment of the body, thus reducing the pressure redistribution characteristics.
So bottom line . . . can a ROHO cushion be used without the cover? Absolutely. Particularly if there is no risk that the cells may become caught in something. Should the cushion be used with something other than the cover it comes with? NO, it will significantly reduce the benefits of the cushion. 

How can I choose the right cushion?

Seek the assistance of a clinical professional who can assess your clinical requirements. In many countries, occupational and physiotherapists have the expertise; however, your personal physician can advise and offer referrals. 

How often should the ROHO DRY FLOATATION Cushion be checked for proper inflation?

The hand check should be performed daily with the patient's ADLs (Activities of Daily Living). The entire adjustment procedure needs only to be done when necessary. It only takes a few seconds.

If I currently have pressure ulcers, can I sit on my ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion?

Yes. It is appropriate for individuals with a stage 1, 2 or 3 ulcer to sit directly on a ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion provided they, or their caregiver, monitor the wound frequently. In conjunction with proper care and nutrition, it is proven that an ulcer can heal on a ROHO cushion. Due to our unique ability to redistribute pressure, enhance blood flow, and decrease edema, we are thereby able to enhance healing. A stage 4 ulcer usually requires surgery and presents numerous complications for the client. 

Does neoprene rubber promote heat buildup?

No. The ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushions are air filled. Air has a very low specific heat making it a poor conductor of heat (less transfer of heat than with water or gel). Less transfer of heat from patient to cushion results in increased energy levels of the end-users.

I need a very stable cushion. Which one should I choose?

We have a variety of models which offer positioning and stability. Examples include the SELECT Family line, which includes the QUADTRO® SELECT® and the CONTOUR SELECT™ cushion, the nexus® SPIRIT® cushion and the new HARMONY™ cushion. A clinician trained in seating can assist you in choosing the appropriate model for your needs.

How can I get literature on the ROHO product line?

To receive literature on the ROHO product line in the US or Canada, please call 800-851-3449, or fax at 888-551-3449, or to receive literature outside the US and Canada call 1- 618-277-9150 or fax 1-618-277-6518. We would be glad to send you information on the various company programs, products or distributors nearest you. Click here to send an email to the Help Desk.

How long does a ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion last?

On average, three to five years. The amount of wear and tear an individual user subjects their cushion to will effect the life of the cushion. Using the cover supplied with the cushion will extend the life of your cushion. ROHO, Inc. offers a two-year limited warranty on the ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion product line and a three-year limited warranty on the SELECT cushion product line. In addition, each cushion is supplied with a patch-kit.

What makes the ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushions better than other cushions?

Durability. Optimal reduction of shear and friction on the client's skin. Adjustability. Light weight. Proven performance over time. Click here for additional details on ROHO DRY FLOATATION technology.

Do the ROHO cushions only prevent pressure ulcers, or can the patient actually have an existing pressure ulcer? 

The range of ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushions were designed to either prevent or heal. Both cushions and mattresses can and should be used in conjunction with proper care and nutrition to enhance the healing process over a period of time. (A clinician should assess the intrinsic and extrinsic factors of skin breakdown particular to you, to determine what effect a ROHO cushion might have.)

What do you mean by "Handle your ROHO DRY FLOATATION Cushion with care?" In other words, what are the DO's and DO NOT's for a ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion owner?

DO NOT:

Pull or attempt to carry the cushion by the cells, valve, or ISOFLO® Memory Control™ valve.
Expose the cushion to petroleum based solutions (e.g., lanolin).
Sit on cushion with sharp items in your pockets.

DO:

Follow the operating and cleaning instructions.


If using a ROHO cushion, can I sit longer than two hours, or do I still need to have some movement anyway (pressure reliefs)? 

Yes. Many users increase their sitting times dramatically (e.g., 16 hours). ROHO suggests you follow the routine of pressure relief procedures recommended to you by your clinician. By consistently monitoring your skin, you may be able to determine what period of time must pass before you begin to experience redness.

What is the weight limit of the ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion?

Only the cushion size will cause a limit. Therefore, it is imperative that each individual receive the proper size for his or her stature and chair. Custom cushions are also available.

Do you offer custom cushions, and how do I order one?

Yes. We do offer custom cushions. The advice of a rehab specialist would be most helpful in designing a specific custom cushion. Our Customer Service department also has a staff available to assist you in custom orders. Simply call, fax or e-mail ROHO with your questions. 

Do I need a rigid base underneath the cushion, or is a sling seat okay to use with the ROHO cushion?

ROHO suggests all of our seating products be used with a solid seat insert, unless the wheelchair sling is designed not to hammock or sag over time. ROHO offers two types of solid inserts which can be inserted between the cushion and cover for convenient transportation.

Can I tie down cells to create a no pressure area?

In the past, there have been many proponents of tying down cells to create no pressure areas under the seated surface. However, unless medically necessary, we recommend not tying down cells, as the cushion performs best when distributing pressure over the entire contact area.
When a no contact area is incorporated into a cushion, a high pressure perimeter surrounding the no contact area is created. This variance in pressure between the perimeter and no contact area tends to cause shear, deformity and trauma to the tissue, thus increasing risk of ischemia. In addition, there is the possibility for pooling of interstitial fluids (edema) at the no contact area reducing efficient cellular nutrient transfer. Enhancing blood flow and nutrient transfer is essential and the DRY FLOATATION® cushion allows for this healing process to occur. If you tie down cells, you run the risk of delaying healing or actually increasing the size of a wound. 

What about cushion toxicity?

When people ask or talk about LATEX TOXICITY what they are really asking or talking about is a severe allergic reaction to proteins found in Natural Rubber. Natural Rubber comes from the sap, a white milky fluid (latex), of the Hevea brasilienis or rubber tree. The proteins are Mother Nature’s way of keeping the sap from coagulating as it moves through the tree carrying moisture and nutrients from roots to leaves and back. All products made from Natural Rubber contain some amount of these proteins. The amount depends on how the latex was processed and how well the products made from it were leached and washed. Not only are rubber like products, gloves, condoms, catheters and tubing made from Natural Rubber, but, also adhesives and sponge foams.
Almost everybody will have some kind of a reaction to these proteins. Depending on the number of times exposed and the duration of the exposure the reaction can be anything from a mild dermatological rash to anaphylactic shock. Certain groups of people appear to be more susceptible to developing anaphylaxis. Healthcare workers for example, may develop severe dermatological reactions because of the daily repeated exposure and Myelodysplasia (spina bifida) patients seem to be particularly at risk, especially under anesthesia.
ROHO Incorporated products are manufactured from man-made materials. The cushions themselves are made of Neoprene, a synthetic rubber material that contains no protein, the covers are made of Nylon, Lycra, Polyurethane, and Polyvinyl chloride, and pumps are made of polypropylene.
When discussing specific allergy problems with healthcare workers we should be careful not to forget that a very small percentage of the population will have a reaction to contact with our cushions. People develop hypersensitivity to all sorts of things. Some people develop hives and severe itching when they come into contact with wool clothing. Others develop reactions to detergents and soaps or citrus fruits. Because the cushion is made from a chemical polymer and contains other chemicals used to produce a cure and render it resistive to UV light and the effects of ozone etc. means that a few rare individuals will have a dermatological allergy reaction to our product. This can be a serious problem but it should not be confused with the protein toxicity associated with Natural Rubber.

Can I return my ROHO Cushion?

Yes.  You can return the cushion within 30 days if it is in NEW condition.  Due to hygenic reasons, a Roho Cushion cannot be returned if it is used.  To ensure that you ordered the correct size, we recommend that you first try the cushion without taking the cover out of the sealed package (if the cover package is broken this will incur a $40.00 charge).  If it is the wrong the size, please let our customer service team know immediately and we will do an exchange.  Note: Exchanges incur actual freight charges, which is the shipping charge to ship the cushion back to us and then the shipping cost to resend the correct size.  Depending on where you live the actual shipping charges are usually around a total of $30.00. Also for "non" standard sizes/ non standard cushions there will be a restocking fee of at least 15%, the PostureLITE upon order is not returnable or refundable, also any custom cushion is non ruturnable and non refundable.

My cushion has developed a leak and it is still under warranty.  How do I get it serviced?


If you have a ROHO cushion that is in need of service, call the Warranty Service Department at 1-800-851-3449 ext. 7391 or email warranty@therohogroup.com.
Information needed when calling in:
        
Cushion's serial Number (Where Am I?)
Date of Purchase
Description of the Defect


Once you call in, a Warranty Service Representative will walk you through the process of getting your product serviced.


Whats the difference between between High, Low, and Mid Profile Cushions?

ROHO manufactures 3 heights of cushions; a High Profile, which has 4” tall air cells, a Mid Profile cushion with 3” tall air cells, and a Low Profile that has 2.5” tall air cells.
The purpose of a ROHO cushion is to decrease the amount of pressure on the sitting area through a patented technology of interconnected neoprene air cells that increase and decrease in air volume to match an individual’s contours. This dry flotation technology facilitates blood flow to the sitting area and assists in the healing of ischemic ulcers (pressure sores).
I generally recommend High Profile Cushions for first time users or for individuals with current pressure sores (or a history of pressure sores) due to its ability to maintain proper pressure relief even if slightly underinflated. This gives the client or caregiver more room for error without compromising the client’s skin integrity by “bottoming out” in the cushion. The drawback to the High Profile Cushion is that its 4” tall air cells could make you feel like you are sitting up too high, therefore giving you a sense of instability. 
The Low Profile Cushion with its 2.5” tall air cells offers a lower center of gravity than the High Profile Cushion, which provides an increased sense of stability. The Low Profile Cushion is appropriate for active users that would be frequently transferring on and off of the cushion.  The lower cell heights also allow easier transferring and propulsion if being used on a manual wheelchair. The drawback is decreased room for error in regards to maintaining proper inflation. Simply put, you must have the ability monitor how much air is in their cushion to prevent “bottoming out.”
The Mid Profile cushion is halfway between a High and Low Profile.  The Mid offers you an option for both moderate protection and stability.

Whats the difference between a Quadtro Select Cushion and a Single Compartment?

The basic difference between a Quadtro Select and a standard ROHO is an extra valve located on the front of the Quadtro cushion that splits the cushion into four equal compartments.  The valve can either be opened to allow airflow throughout the entire cushion or it can be closed to control airflow to the four specific quadrants.  This allows the client to customize the amount of air in each chamber.  When the valve is open, air flows freely between quadrants and performs like a standard ROHO.  The drawback is having an extra metal and plastic valve on the front of the cushion that some customers find to be cumbersome.  It is an excellent cushion if you require the ability to adjust air volume in each quadrant for positioning needs and contouring to your body.
Different needs require different heights and styles, but assessing your specific uses and abilities will help guide you to the proper selection.

Frequently Asked Questions




Which cushion is best for sitting long periods, pain relief, preventing pressure sores?

Regarding the ROHO family of products, the high profile (4" cells) line of products are going to offer the most immersion (sinking in) into the cushion. This greater immersion will increase the force (weight) redistribution of the client thus decreasing peek pressures and improving comfort, decreasing pain and preventing pressure ulcers. Through this immersion, you are better able to redistribute (equalize) the weight (force) of the client onto their thighs, greater trochanters (hips), and the ischial tuberosities (buttocks). Through immersion into the 4" cells, a ROHO cushion aims to reduce the extrinsic risk factors of peak pressures, shear and friction, and microclimate in pressure ulcer development; however, it is important to assess the client individually for other risk factors including, but not limited to, nutrition, circulation, and previous history of pressure ulcers which NO cushion is able to affectively address.

Can I place an incontinence pad, towel, drawl sheet or hoyer lift sling over top a ROHO cushion and/or a ROHO mattress?

Unfortunately, anything that you place over a ROHO cushion or mattress, actually any cushion or mattress, can interfere with the effectiveness. A ROHO cushion/mattress works by increasing the contact area of the individual when they immerse (sink) into the product thus redistributing the force so there is limited peek pressures at one specific landmark. When anything is placed between an individual and the cushion/mattress, surface tension is increased and thus they have a more difficult time immersing (sinking) into the cushion/mattress effectively.
However, since each and every individual needs to be treated individually and a plan of care needs to be considered based upon that individual’s specific circumstances, we also realize that other needs like incontinence, safety during transfers etc. need to be considered. A licensed healthcare professional should weigh the risks of placing a pad, towel or Hoyer lift sling, thus reducing the effectiveness of the cushion/mattress, versus the risk of not placing these items.
If an incontinence pad or drawl sheet is required while the individual is sitting on the cushion or lying on the mattress, it is our recommendation that the least amount of layers are used and these pads/sheets are put overtop the cushion/mattress in a fashion where they are very loose and NOT tight.
If the removal of a Hoyer lift sling from underneath a patient, who was transferred onto the cushion, is going to cause increased shear and friction, which may be detrimental to an individual’s skin, a licensed healthcare professional should weigh the risks of keeping the client on the cushion WITH the sling in place, versus removing the sling.

Can I use my ROHO cushion without the cover?

It is true that anything that you place over a ROHO cushion, actually any cushion can interfere with the effectiveness. A ROHO cushion works by increasing the contact area of the individual when they immerse (sink) into the product thus redistributing the force so there is limited peek pressures at one specific landmark. When anything is placed between an individual and the cushion, even a ROHO cover, surface tension is increased and thus they have a more difficult time immersing (sinking) into the cushion effectively. However, ROHO has gone to great lengths to provide a cover, which still allows immersion with the least amount of surface tension created. Mr. Graebe, the inventor of the ROHO cushion, from a scientific standpoint, would recommend a ROHO cushion actually be used without the cover.
As previously stated, our covers are made to be used so that there is little if any interference with pressure distribution when they are being used. When other things are used instead of our stretchable, breathable cover, like a pillowcase, a sheet, a quilted chuck, or another wheelchair cushion cover, there is less effectiveness of the cushion due to increase tension. Bottom line, the person has less immersion and envelopment of the body, thus reducing the pressure redistribution characteristics.
So bottom line . . . can a ROHO cushion be used without the cover? Absolutely. Particularly if there is no risk that the cells may become caught in something. Should the cushion be used with something other than the cover it comes with? NO, it will significantly reduce the benefits of the cushion. 

How can I choose the right cushion?

Seek the assistance of a clinical professional who can assess your clinical requirements. In many countries, occupational and physiotherapists have the expertise; however, your personal physician can advise and offer referrals. 

How often should the ROHO DRY FLOATATION Cushion be checked for proper inflation?

The hand check should be performed daily with the patient's ADLs (Activities of Daily Living). The entire adjustment procedure needs only to be done when necessary. It only takes a few seconds.

If I currently have pressure ulcers, can I sit on my ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion?

Yes. It is appropriate for individuals with a stage 1, 2 or 3 ulcer to sit directly on a ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion provided they, or their caregiver, monitor the wound frequently. In conjunction with proper care and nutrition, it is proven that an ulcer can heal on a ROHO cushion. Due to our unique ability to redistribute pressure, enhance blood flow, and decrease edema, we are thereby able to enhance healing. A stage 4 ulcer usually requires surgery and presents numerous complications for the client. 

Does neoprene rubber promote heat buildup?

No. The ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushions are air filled. Air has a very low specific heat making it a poor conductor of heat (less transfer of heat than with water or gel). Less transfer of heat from patient to cushion results in increased energy levels of the end-users.

I need a very stable cushion. Which one should I choose?

We have a variety of models which offer positioning and stability. Examples include the SELECT Family line, which includes the QUADTRO® SELECT® and the CONTOUR SELECT™ cushion, the nexus® SPIRIT® cushion and the new HARMONY™ cushion. A clinician trained in seating can assist you in choosing the appropriate model for your needs.

How can I get literature on the ROHO product line?

To receive literature on the ROHO product line in the US or Canada, please call 800-851-3449, or fax at 888-551-3449, or to receive literature outside the US and Canada call 1- 618-277-9150 or fax 1-618-277-6518. We would be glad to send you information on the various company programs, products or distributors nearest you. Click here to send an email to the Help Desk.

How long does a ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion last?

On average, three to five years. The amount of wear and tear an individual user subjects their cushion to will effect the life of the cushion. Using the cover supplied with the cushion will extend the life of your cushion. ROHO, Inc. offers a two-year limited warranty on the ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion product line and a three-year limited warranty on the SELECT cushion product line. In addition, each cushion is supplied with a patch-kit.

What makes the ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushions better than other cushions?

Durability. Optimal reduction of shear and friction on the client's skin. Adjustability. Light weight. Proven performance over time. Click here for additional details on ROHO DRY FLOATATION technology.

Do the ROHO cushions only prevent pressure ulcers, or can the patient actually have an existing pressure ulcer? 

The range of ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushions were designed to either prevent or heal. Both cushions and mattresses can and should be used in conjunction with proper care and nutrition to enhance the healing process over a period of time. (A clinician should assess the intrinsic and extrinsic factors of skin breakdown particular to you, to determine what effect a ROHO cushion might have.)

What do you mean by "Handle your ROHO DRY FLOATATION Cushion with care?" In other words, what are the DO's and DO NOT's for a ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion owner?

DO NOT:

Pull or attempt to carry the cushion by the cells, valve, or ISOFLO® Memory Control™ valve.
Expose the cushion to petroleum based solutions (e.g., lanolin).
Sit on cushion with sharp items in your pockets.

DO:

Follow the operating and cleaning instructions.


If using a ROHO cushion, can I sit longer than two hours, or do I still need to have some movement anyway (pressure reliefs)? 

Yes. Many users increase their sitting times dramatically (e.g., 16 hours). ROHO suggests you follow the routine of pressure relief procedures recommended to you by your clinician. By consistently monitoring your skin, you may be able to determine what period of time must pass before you begin to experience redness.

What is the weight limit of the ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion?

Only the cushion size will cause a limit. Therefore, it is imperative that each individual receive the proper size for his or her stature and chair. Custom cushions are also available.

Do you offer custom cushions, and how do I order one?

Yes. We do offer custom cushions. The advice of a rehab specialist would be most helpful in designing a specific custom cushion. Our Customer Service department also has a staff available to assist you in custom orders. Simply call, fax or e-mail ROHO with your questions. 

Do I need a rigid base underneath the cushion, or is a sling seat okay to use with the ROHO cushion?

ROHO suggests all of our seating products be used with a solid seat insert, unless the wheelchair sling is designed not to hammock or sag over time. ROHO offers two types of solid inserts which can be inserted between the cushion and cover for convenient transportation.

Can I tie down cells to create a no pressure area?

In the past, there have been many proponents of tying down cells to create no pressure areas under the seated surface. However, unless medically necessary, we recommend not tying down cells, as the cushion performs best when distributing pressure over the entire contact area.
When a no contact area is incorporated into a cushion, a high pressure perimeter surrounding the no contact area is created. This variance in pressure between the perimeter and no contact area tends to cause shear, deformity and trauma to the tissue, thus increasing risk of ischemia. In addition, there is the possibility for pooling of interstitial fluids (edema) at the no contact area reducing efficient cellular nutrient transfer. Enhancing blood flow and nutrient transfer is essential and the DRY FLOATATION® cushion allows for this healing process to occur. If you tie down cells, you run the risk of delaying healing or actually increasing the size of a wound. 

What about cushion toxicity?

When people ask or talk about LATEX TOXICITY what they are really asking or talking about is a severe allergic reaction to proteins found in Natural Rubber. Natural Rubber comes from the sap, a white milky fluid (latex), of the Hevea brasilienis or rubber tree. The proteins are Mother Nature’s way of keeping the sap from coagulating as it moves through the tree carrying moisture and nutrients from roots to leaves and back. All products made from Natural Rubber contain some amount of these proteins. The amount depends on how the latex was processed and how well the products made from it were leached and washed. Not only are rubber like products, gloves, condoms, catheters and tubing made from Natural Rubber, but, also adhesives and sponge foams.
Almost everybody will have some kind of a reaction to these proteins. Depending on the number of times exposed and the duration of the exposure the reaction can be anything from a mild dermatological rash to anaphylactic shock. Certain groups of people appear to be more susceptible to developing anaphylaxis. Healthcare workers for example, may develop severe dermatological reactions because of the daily repeated exposure and Myelodysplasia (spina bifida) patients seem to be particularly at risk, especially under anesthesia.
ROHO Incorporated products are manufactured from man-made materials. The cushions themselves are made of Neoprene, a synthetic rubber material that contains no protein, the covers are made of Nylon, Lycra, Polyurethane, and Polyvinyl chloride, and pumps are made of polypropylene.
When discussing specific allergy problems with healthcare workers we should be careful not to forget that a very small percentage of the population will have a reaction to contact with our cushions. People develop hypersensitivity to all sorts of things. Some people develop hives and severe itching when they come into contact with wool clothing. Others develop reactions to detergents and soaps or citrus fruits. Because the cushion is made from a chemical polymer and contains other chemicals used to produce a cure and render it resistive to UV light and the effects of ozone etc. means that a few rare individuals will have a dermatological allergy reaction to our product. This can be a serious problem but it should not be confused with the protein toxicity associated with Natural Rubber.

Can I return my ROHO Cushion?

Yes.  You can return the cushion within 30 days if it is in NEW condition.  Due to hygenic reasons, a Roho Cushion cannot be returned if it is used.  To ensure that you ordered the correct size, we recommend that you first try the cushion without taking the cover out of the sealed package (if the cover package is broken this will incur a $40.00 charge).  If it is the wrong the size, please let our customer service team know immediately and we will do an exchange.  Note: Exchanges incur actual freight charges, which is the shipping charge to ship the cushion back to us and then the shipping cost to resend the correct size.  Depending on where you live the actual shipping charges are usually around a total of $30.00. Also for "non" standard sizes/ non standard cushions there will be a restocking fee of at least 15%, the PostureLITE upon order is not returnable or refundable, also any custom cushion is non ruturnable and non refundable.

My cushion has developed a leak and it is still under warranty.  How do I get it serviced?


If you have a ROHO cushion that is in need of service, call the Warranty Service Department at 1-800-851-3449 ext. 7391 or email warranty@therohogroup.com.
Information needed when calling in:
        
Cushion's serial Number (Where Am I?)
Date of Purchase
Description of the Defect


Once you call in, a Warranty Service Representative will walk you through the process of getting your product serviced.


Whats the difference between between High, Low, and Mid Profile Cushions?

ROHO manufactures 3 heights of cushions; a High Profile, which has 4” tall air cells, a Mid Profile cushion with 3” tall air cells, and a Low Profile that has 2.5” tall air cells.
The purpose of a ROHO cushion is to decrease the amount of pressure on the sitting area through a patented technology of interconnected neoprene air cells that increase and decrease in air volume to match an individual’s contours. This dry flotation technology facilitates blood flow to the sitting area and assists in the healing of ischemic ulcers (pressure sores).
I generally recommend High Profile Cushions for first time users or for individuals with current pressure sores (or a history of pressure sores) due to its ability to maintain proper pressure relief even if slightly underinflated. This gives the client or caregiver more room for error without compromising the client’s skin integrity by “bottoming out” in the cushion. The drawback to the High Profile Cushion is that its 4” tall air cells could make you feel like you are sitting up too high, therefore giving you a sense of instability. 
The Low Profile Cushion with its 2.5” tall air cells offers a lower center of gravity than the High Profile Cushion, which provides an increased sense of stability. The Low Profile Cushion is appropriate for active users that would be frequently transferring on and off of the cushion.  The lower cell heights also allow easier transferring and propulsion if being used on a manual wheelchair. The drawback is decreased room for error in regards to maintaining proper inflation. Simply put, you must have the ability monitor how much air is in their cushion to prevent “bottoming out.”
The Mid Profile cushion is halfway between a High and Low Profile.  The Mid offers you an option for both moderate protection and stability.

Whats the difference between a Quadtro Select Cushion and a Single Compartment?

The basic difference between a Quadtro Select and a standard ROHO is an extra valve located on the front of the Quadtro cushion that splits the cushion into four equal compartments.  The valve can either be opened to allow airflow throughout the entire cushion or it can be closed to control airflow to the four specific quadrants.  This allows the client to customize the amount of air in each chamber.  When the valve is open, air flows freely between quadrants and performs like a standard ROHO.  The drawback is having an extra metal and plastic valve on the front of the cushion that some customers find to be cumbersome.  It is an excellent cushion if you require the ability to adjust air volume in each quadrant for positioning needs and contouring to your body.
Different needs require different heights and styles, but assessing your specific uses and abilities will help guide you to the proper selection.

Roho Cushions



If I currently have pressure ulcers, can I sit on my ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion?

Yes. It is appropriate for individuals with a stage 1, 2 or 3 ulcer to sit directly on a ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion provided they, or their caregiver, monitor the wound frequently. In conjunction with proper care and nutrition, it is proven that an ulcer can heal on a ROHO cushion. Due to our unique ability to redistribute pressure, enhance blood flow, and decrease edema, we are thereby able to enhance healing. A stage 4 ulcer usually requires surgery and presents numerous complications for the client.

Whats the difference between between High, Low, and Mid Profile Cushions?

ROHO manufactures 3 heights of cushions; a High Profile, which has 4” tall air cells, a Mid Profile cushion with 3” tall air cells, and a Low Profile that has 2.5” tall air cells.
The purpose of a ROHO cushion is to decrease the amount of pressure on the sitting area through a patented technology of interconnected neoprene air cells that increase and decrease in air volume to match an individual’s contours. This dry flotation technology facilitates blood flow to the sitting area and assists in the healing of ischemic ulcers (pressure sores).
I generally recommend High Profile Cushions for first time users or for individuals with current pressure sores (or a history of pressure sores) due to its ability to maintain proper pressure relief even if slightly underinflated. This gives the client or caregiver more room for error without compromising the client’s skin integrity by “bottoming out” in the cushion. The drawback to the High Profile Cushion is that its 4” tall air cells could make you feel like you are sitting up too high, therefore giving you a sense of instability.
The Low Profile Cushion with its 2.5” tall air cells offers a lower center of gravity than the High Profile Cushion, which provides an increased sense of stability. The Low Profile Cushion is appropriate for active users that would be frequently transferring on and off of the cushion. The lower cell heights also allow easier transferring and propulsion if being used on a manual wheelchair. The drawback is decreased room for error in regards to maintaining proper inflation. Simply put, you must have the ability monitor how much air is in their cushion to prevent “bottoming out.”
The Mid Profile cushion is halfway between a High and Low Profile. The Mid offers you an option for both moderate protection and stability.

Whats the difference between a Quadtro Select Cushion and a Single Compartment?

The basic difference between a Quadtro Select and a standard ROHO is an extra valve located on the front of the Quadtro cushion that splits the cushion into four equal compartments. The valve can either be opened to allow airflow throughout the entire cushion or it can be closed to control airflow to the four specific quadrants. This allows the client to customize the amount of air in each chamber. When the valve is open, air flows freely between quadrants and performs like a standard ROHO. The drawback is having an extra metal and plastic valve on the front of the cushion that some customers find to be cumbersome. It is an excellent cushion if you require the ability to adjust air volume in each quadrant for positioning needs and contouring to your body.
Different needs require different heights and styles, but assessing your specific uses and abilities will help guide you to the proper selection.

If using a ROHO cushion, can I sit longer than two hours?

Yes. Many users increase their sitting times dramatically (e.g., 16 hours). ROHO suggests you follow the routine of pressure relief procedures recommended to you by your clinician. By consistently monitoring your skin, you may be able to determine what period of time must pass before you begin to experience redness.

Roho Cushions



If I currently have pressure ulcers, can I sit on my ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion?

Yes. It is appropriate for individuals with a stage 1, 2 or 3 ulcer to sit directly on a ROHO DRY FLOATATION cushion provided they, or their caregiver, monitor the wound frequently. In conjunction with proper care and nutrition, it is proven that an ulcer can heal on a ROHO cushion. Due to our unique ability to redistribute pressure, enhance blood flow, and decrease edema, we are thereby able to enhance healing. A stage 4 ulcer usually requires surgery and presents numerous complications for the client.

Whats the difference between between High, Low, and Mid Profile Cushions?

ROHO manufactures 3 heights of cushions; a High Profile, which has 4” tall air cells, a Mid Profile cushion with 3” tall air cells, and a Low Profile that has 2.5” tall air cells.
The purpose of a ROHO cushion is to decrease the amount of pressure on the sitting area through a patented technology of interconnected neoprene air cells that increase and decrease in air volume to match an individual’s contours. This dry flotation technology facilitates blood flow to the sitting area and assists in the healing of ischemic ulcers (pressure sores).
I generally recommend High Profile Cushions for first time users or for individuals with current pressure sores (or a history of pressure sores) due to its ability to maintain proper pressure relief even if slightly underinflated. This gives the client or caregiver more room for error without compromising the client’s skin integrity by “bottoming out” in the cushion. The drawback to the High Profile Cushion is that its 4” tall air cells could make you feel like you are sitting up too high, therefore giving you a sense of instability.
The Low Profile Cushion with its 2.5” tall air cells offers a lower center of gravity than the High Profile Cushion, which provides an increased sense of stability. The Low Profile Cushion is appropriate for active users that would be frequently transferring on and off of the cushion. The lower cell heights also allow easier transferring and propulsion if being used on a manual wheelchair. The drawback is decreased room for error in regards to maintaining proper inflation. Simply put, you must have the ability monitor how much air is in their cushion to prevent “bottoming out.”
The Mid Profile cushion is halfway between a High and Low Profile. The Mid offers you an option for both moderate protection and stability.

Whats the difference between a Quadtro Select Cushion and a Single Compartment?

The basic difference between a Quadtro Select and a standard ROHO is an extra valve located on the front of the Quadtro cushion that splits the cushion into four equal compartments. The valve can either be opened to allow airflow throughout the entire cushion or it can be closed to control airflow to the four specific quadrants. This allows the client to customize the amount of air in each chamber. When the valve is open, air flows freely between quadrants and performs like a standard ROHO. The drawback is having an extra metal and plastic valve on the front of the cushion that some customers find to be cumbersome. It is an excellent cushion if you require the ability to adjust air volume in each quadrant for positioning needs and contouring to your body.
Different needs require different heights and styles, but assessing your specific uses and abilities will help guide you to the proper selection.

If using a ROHO cushion, can I sit longer than two hours?

Yes. Many users increase their sitting times dramatically (e.g., 16 hours). ROHO suggests you follow the routine of pressure relief procedures recommended to you by your clinician. By consistently monitoring your skin, you may be able to determine what period of time must pass before you begin to experience redness.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
