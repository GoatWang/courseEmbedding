Seventh Sense Biosystems Receives Notice of Allowance for Additional 
      U.S. Patents for TAP Blood Collection System




Momentum Continues Towards Pain Free Platform






May 11, 2015 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Seventh Sense Biosystems, Inc., (7SBio), a leading developer of blood 
      collection and diagnostic platforms, announced today the receipt of 
      notice of allowances from the United States Patent and Trademark Office 
      for two patent applications (U.S. Patent Applications 13/016,575 and 
      13/166,451) in addition to the four patents the company has already 
      received.
    


      The allowed patent claims cover specific design features associated with 
      1) delivering less pain than a ‘finger stick’ and 2) reporting and 
      interfacing with external information systems using the TAP device in 
      conjunction with patient compliance and prescription therapeutic 
      monitoring. Coupled with previously issued patents which cover 
      collection of any volume of blood and the use of microneedles, 
      microfluidics and a vacuum to cause blood flow, these patent allowances 
      will confer additional protection for 7SBio’s proprietary Touch 
      Activated Phlebotomy (TAP) technology platform.
    

      “The ongoing validation of our novel and innovative platform through the 
      U.S. patent system continues to be a source of momentum for Seventh 
      Sense and we anticipate more issuances in the near future as we progress 
      towards the commercialization of the TAP platform of blood collection 
      and diagnostic tools,” said Howard Weisman, CEO at 7SBio. 
      “Non-compliance of patients who are fearful of pain or large needles 
      associated with blood tests is an important, unaddressed problem which 
      our products solve in a meaningful way. With the crossing of each new 
      positive milestone, an essentially pain-free, easy-to-use and mobile 
      solution is closer to reality.”
    

      With the anticipated issuance of these two patents, the company will 
      have a total of six US patents, with numerous other patents pending 
      worldwide.
    

      “Unlike companies that are developing proprietary systems that 
      miniaturize the process of blood collection and analysis for clinicians 
      only, 7SBio is developing an open, ubiquitous platform that can 
      interface with many systems and be used by patients and health care 
      providers alike,” said Weisman. “We share a responsibility for 
      delivering the highest quality of healthcare wherever it’s needed and 
      we’re working with the US Patent and Trademark Office and the FDA to 
      ensure the efficacy, safety and intellectual property rights of the TAP 
      platform in all its forms and uses.”
    

About the TAP Touch Activated Phlebotomy ® 
      and TAP Blood Collection Device®TAP is a 
      proprietary platform that draws capillary blood in a painless, one-step 
      process without having to access a vein, and it can be utilized across 
      and integrated with a broad spectrum of diagnostic applications. The TAP 
      system penetrates the uppermost layers of skin through the use of 
      micro-needles, collects capillary blood using a novel microfluidic 
      extraction process, and stabilizes the blood with anticoagulant if 
      required. The device has a visual indicator to confirm that collection 
      is complete. The TAP platform is designed for fully automated, high 
      throughput manufacturing.
    

About Seventh Sense Biosystems, Inc.Founded in 2008, 
      Seventh Sense Biosystems is developing an array of products based on the 
      company's proprietary TAP™ (Touch Activated Phlebotomy) painless blood 
      collection platform. The company’s initial focus is on improving 
      important diagnostic testing at the point of care by reducing the 
      discomfort, anxiety and hassle of blood sample collection. 7SBio 
      receives funding from investors Flagship Venture Partners, Lighthouse 
      Capital Partners, and Polaris Partners. For more information, please

Seventh Sense Biosystems Inc. Announces Expansion Of Manufacturing Operations And Facilities In Medford, Massachusetts  











Tweet








9/21/2015 11:09:19 AM



MEDFORD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Seventh Sense Biosystems, Inc., (7SBio), a leading developer of 
      blood collection and diagnostic platforms, announced today it is 
      expanding its manufacturing operations and relocating its home office.
    
“This new facility provides Seventh Sense with a unique opportunity to 
      house all of its functions under one roof to support a successful 
      product launch in 2016”

      “This new facility provides Seventh Sense with a unique opportunity to 
      house all of its functions under one roof to support a successful 
      product launch in 2016,” said Howard Weisman, president and CEO of 
      Seventh Sense. “Demand for our proprietary painless blood collection 
      device continues to grow and this move to our new manufacturing and 
      office space will support our continued growth and expansion."
    

      Seventh Sense Biosystems’s new address is 200 Boston Avenue, Suite 3700, 
      Medford, Massachusetts. The company's main phone number will remain the 
      same – 617-547-7246 – as will all email addresses.
    

About the TAP Touch Activated Phlebotomy ® and TAP Blood Collection 
      Device®


      TAP is a proprietary platform that draws capillary blood in a painless, 
      one-step process without having to access a vein, and it can be utilized 
      across and integrated with a broad spectrum of diagnostic applications. 
      The TAP system penetrates the uppermost layers of skin through the use 
      of micro-needles, collects capillary blood using a novel microfluidic 
      extraction process, and stabilizes the blood with anticoagulant if 
      required. The device has a visual indicator to confirm that collection 
      is complete. The TAP platform is designed for fully automated, high 
      throughput manufacturing.
    

About Seventh Sense Biosystems, Inc.


      Founded in 2008, within Flagship VentureLabs™, 7SBio is developing and 
      commercializing an array of products based on the company’s proprietary 
      Touch Activated Phlebotomy (TAP™) painless blood collection platform, 
      with an initial focus on enabling important diagnostic testing at the 
      point of care by reducing the discomfort, anxiety and hassle of blood 
      sample collection that can inhibit and sometimes prevent patients from 
      undergoing blood tests and receiving appropriate care. Please also refer 
      to our website at www.7sbio.com

New Blood Collection ExperienceAt some point, we have all experienced having blood drawn directly from a vein, usually in the crook of the elbow. There is nothing worse than watching someone insert a needle into your vein, often more than once, and then seeing your blood fill several tubes. TAP, the world’s first push-button blood collection device, eliminates all of this and makes blood collection simple, convenient, and virtually painless.Gone are the days of tourniquets, large needles, lancets, tubes, and bandages. No more sitting in a waiting room waiting anxiously to have your blood drawn. Instead, the small device is positioned on a patient’s upper arm and with just a ‘tap’, blood is collected. Future versions of TAP will enable patients to collect their own blood anywhere. No more sitting in a doctor’s office anxiously waiting to have your blood drawn.Seventh Sense aims to create a new standard for blood collection that increases patient compliance with testing orders, leading to faster diagnoses and better outcomes. Future versions of TAP will enable the patient to collect their own blood anywhere.HOW DOES IT WORK?
