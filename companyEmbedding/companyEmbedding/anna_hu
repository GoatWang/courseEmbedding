Profile



Unless you make an appointment to visit her boutique in Taiwan, Anna Hu’s jewelry is available only in the grand concourse of the Plaza Hotel Retail Collection. The open, silver-hued space won the grand prize in the 2009 Area for Retail Environments Architecture Awards. The mall-like setting is an unusual atmosphere for the designer, an accomplished cellist and art historian with a refined, classical sensibility. Her pieces are individually handcrafted, set with diamonds, pearls, sapphires, emeralds, and rubies as large as coins. The pieces range from simple diamond-and-emerald stud earrings to a startlingly realistic gold-tarantula brooch with a pearl egg sac. — Frankie Thomas

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
