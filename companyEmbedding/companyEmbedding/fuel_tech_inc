FTI Stored Diesel Fuel Maintenance Systems —  Products
Since no one can predict when an emergency will call upon your power fuel backup system, Fuel Tech's (FTI) stored diesel fuel maintenance system and emergency power fuel maintenance products are the only safe methods of emergency preparation.













Stored diesel fuel must be purified, but also should be treated for stability and microbial growth using biocides and fuel stabilizers. Protect your emergency power fuel system from commonly occurring moisture and contaminates, and save money, time, and lives, with FTI's stored diesel fuel maintenance system and diesel purification products.
Fuel Tech   provides a three-tiered strategy for emergency power fuel filtration to ensure that your hospital, bank, prison, or other critical facility's backup generators are ready for action when you need them.

Fuel Maintenance: Fuel Tech offers automatic emergency power fuel filtration for single and multi tank stored diesel applications through four different FM approved automated diesel fuel filtering systems, suitable for up to 60,000 gallon stored diesel fuel tanks. 
Biocides: Fuel Tech uses a biocide, Microbicide 1.5, to control microbial growth within the diesel fuel storage tank. Microbicide 1.5 is an EPA Registered Biocide in all 50 States.
Fuel Stabilizers: LTSA-35A  a chemical treatment  promotes diesel fuel stability, is self-dispersing, and does not require costly injection systems for introduction to the stored diesel fuel.

Fuel Tech's stored diesel fuel maintenance system runs on an optimum schedule to remove 99.5% of entrained water, free water, and particulate matter for maximum diesel purification. Call or Email FTI Today to order the emergency power fuel filtration system for your critical facility: (805) 462-8849.
Fuel Tech is a veteran-owned company; all products are manufactured in North America (USA), Are FM approved, and shipped internationally. Please note that FTI is not a provider of fuel transfer pumps, aviation fuel, or gasoline maintenance  Fuel Tech deals exclusively with diesel and biodiesel fuels.

Diesel Generator Fuel Maintenance Systems from  FTI
An emergency power system is only as reliable as its weakest link; don't  let that weak link be a poor diesel generator fuel maintenance system. In an  emergency where a loss of power occurs, mission critical facilities (including  hospitals, data processing centers, prisons, and banks) are dependent on the  operability and reliability of their emergency power systems for safety,  security, and uninterrupted operation. 

Few realize that  stored diesel fuel can begin to deteriorate within just 28 days of  refining, increasing the chances of engine failure or damage. What will  happen when the power goes out in your high-rise building? Will your defense,  emergency, or security system remain armed when a loss of power occurs? Protect  your veterans administration, government office, or other classified mission  critical facility from catastrophe by investing in a reliable emergency diesel  generator fuel maintenance system with Fuel Technologies International.
Fuel Technologies  International (FTI) manufactures automated stored diesel fuel maintenance  systems and provides comprehensive preventative maintenance programs to fight  stored diesel fuel degradation on all fronts—oxidation, microorganism growth,  and corrosion—so that your emergency power systems are safe, functional, and  stable when you need them most. 
 Fuel Technologies  International is the only manufacturer of automated stored diesel fuel  maintenance equipment that is FM Approved and NFPA Compliant. FTI also has an elevated understanding of biodiesel fuel, though only 5% of  the market currently uses it. FTI is ahead of the industry curve in regards to  knowledge of how to properly maintain and utilize both diesel and biodiesel  fuels effectively.
There are four  essential components to an effective fuel maintenance program:

Thoroughly remove  particulate from your fuel using an FM Approved System.  These systems operate on an optimum schedule to maintain the continuous  reliability of your stored fuel system.
Achieve optimum diesel  purification through use of an Approved Biocide.
Further protect your  emergency power fuel through use of an Approved Fuel Stabilizer.
FTI suggests two  annual ASTM Approved Test Methods to ensure that your emergency power system fuel is both safe and clean.

FTI has been known as the expert in diesel generator fuel maintenance since 1993. FTI will not only provide you with the systems and programs for maintaining your diesel fuel, but will teach you why they are important and how to use them. 
Consumers can invest their  confidence in Fuel Technologies International not only because all FTI products  are FM approved, but FTI is also an approved GSA Schedule Contractor, earned an  impressive 96 overall rating on Dun & Bradstreet's Open Ratings Report, and  is registered with the Central Contractors Registry. FTI is a veteran owned company—all  products are manufactured in the United States and shipped worldwide. Contact FTI Today to  learn about our easy-to-install, safe, integrated, and automated diesel  generator fuel maintenance systems.

The following table sets forth management’s estimate of the allocation of net 
proceeds expected to be received from this offering. Actual expenditures may 
vary from these estimates. Pending such uses, we will invest the net proceeds 
in investment-grade, short-term, interest bearing securities. In the event
that the entire offering is not sold, the proceeds received would be used for 
purchase of raw materials and component parts. Purchase of automated machine 
tools, marketing and increasing receivables and working capital would be 
deferred until funds are available.

(1)     We plan to have our officers and directors offer and sell the shares.
 They will receive no discounts or commissions. To the extent that our
 officers and directors sell the shares, the proceeds, which allocated for
 commissions will be additional working capital. We do not have any
 agreements, arrangements or understandings with any broker/dealers to offer
 or sell our shares, although we may, at our discretion, retain such to assist
 in the offer and sale of shares. This represents the maximum underwriting
 discounts and commissions we will pay if broker/dealers are used to sell the
 shares. 
  
(2) Working capital will be applied to support cash flow, payroll and as
 a reserve for unexpected expenses.


We work in a highly competitive environment.  In addition to capital, we must 
obtain agreements with manufacturers and sellers of automotive products.  
There are other companies similar to our company competing for this business. 
Virtually all of these competitors have financial and other resources 
substantially greater than ours.  We cannot assure you that we will be able 
to acquire the necessary customers to make our company successful. 

-----

The fuel additive business is a very competitive market place.  There are 
many products available through conventional distribution channels such as 
auto parts stores and gasoline stations.  The price of some of the competitive
products is both more expensive and less expensive than MPG3.   A number of 
the competitors have greater financial resources and experience in the 
industry than Fuel Technology Products, Inc.  The Company feels its direct
marketing distribution system will allow it to be successful in the market 
place.


Company Description
Fuel Technology Products, Inc. is the exclusive distributor of MPG3 fuel 
enhancer.  MPG3 fuel enhancer is a solid form fuel additive that dissolves 
completely in motor fuel to improve mileage and vehicle performance.  It is a 
combustion catalyst which basically means it helps deliver a more


 complete burn
of the fuel in the engine.  It is made from 100% active ingredients and 
eliminates the packaging and handling costs associated with traditional bottle 
products.  Fuel Technology Products, Inc. distributes its products in a 
multi-level marketing program using the name Fuel Saver Group.

The Company has Corporate Offices at 204 W. Spear Street, Suite 3020, Carson 
City, Nevada 89703, and Administrative Office, marketing workshop and storage 
space at 3184-D Airway Avenue, Costa Mesa, California 92626.  Our telephone

Air Pollution Control






 
 


I-NOx - Integrated NOx Reduction System






 
Fuel Tech’s I-NOx Integrated NOx Reduction System combines proven technologies for cost-effective NOx control from the point of combustion to the stack. These combined technologies may be applied as a retrofit solution for existing units or may be new generating units, capable of NOx reduction exceeding 80%.
 
 
 
 





 
 


Model LNB - Low NOx Burners






 
Low NOx burners and Low NOx burner Upgrades are available for both industrial and utility boilers burning a wide variety of fuels and have proven to be a cost effective way to reduce NOx emissions by 40% - 60%. Each system application is specifically designed to maximize NOx reduction without sacrificing combustion performance or unit operation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) combustion modeling is used to validate the design prior to fabrication...
 
 
 
 





 
 


Over Fire Air Systems






 
Combustion air is diverted from the burners to create a fuel rich zone in the lower furnace. Fuel bound nitrogen conversion to NO is inhibited on coal and oil fired boilers. Peak flame temperatures are reduced on gas fired boilers to limit thermal NOx formation. A high momentum air stream intersects burner flames in the upper furnace to complete combustion prior to the boiler convective section.
 
 
 
 





 
 


NOxOUT and HERT - Urea SNCR Systems






 
The NOxOUT SNCR Process is a urea-based Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) process for reduction of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from stationary combustion sources. The process requires precisely engineered injection of stabilized urea liquor into combustion flue gas temperatures as high as 2500° F. Fuel Tech customizes the design and injection strategy for each application since most NOx reduction...
 
 
 
 





 
 


Model ASCR - Advanced SCR System ASCR






 
Fuel Tech’s ASCR Advanced SCR process maximizes performance and minimizes cost and space requirements when needed. Where high level NOx reduction are required, ASCR can be applied to full scale reactor designs to maximize performance. SCR process design is the most critical step to successful SCR performance. Maximizing SCR performance and minimizing its impact on plant operations requires a thorough understanding of each application. For each...

These projects include boilers, incinerators, reformers and many other types of heat recovery equipment firing coal, gas, oil, and a variety of process gases and waste fuels. Maximizing SCR performance and minimizing its impact on plant operations requires a...
 
 
 
 





 
 


Static Mixers






 
Static mixers are used in a wide variety of applications, including air pollution control, material processing and wastewater handling systems where deviations in process or product conditions need to be minimized. Fuel Tech is rapidly becoming a leader in the design and supply of mixing technology for the power generation industry, particularly for Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process applications in which the consistency of flue gas velocity,...
 
 
 
 





 
 


Graduated Straightening Grid Technology (GSG)






 
Our patented GSG Graduated Straightening Grid technology has been applied to areas in the power plant from the economizer to the air heater
 
 
 
 

Fuel Chem






 
 


Model TIFI MG - Targeted In-Furnace Injection Technology






 
The most common application of our TIFI technology utilizes magnesium hydroxide slurry diluted with water and prior to injection. This mixture is sprayed into the combustion unit at locations defined by TIFI technology computer modeling, to maximize coverage of the problem areas. Such an approach causes the TIFI MG® solution to react with slag as it is forming and penetrate existing deposits to affect the physical crystal...
 
 
 
 





 
 


Model TIFI XP - Targeted In-Furnace Injection Technology






 
TIFI XP programs build upon our TIFI technology and is specifically designed to provide users both slag control and fuel flexibility in order to burn less-expensive, yet higher-slagging coals such as Illinois Basin (ILB). The TIFI XP programs utilizes multiple reagents which are optimized to achieve maximum results. TIFI XP programs can also help mitigate corrosion from ILB fuels with high chlorine levels.

                        About Us
                    


COMPANY INFORMATION
Incorporated in 1987, Fuel Tech has over 200 employees, of which more than 25% of its full-time staff holds advanced degrees. The Company maintains Corporate Headquarters in Warrenville, Illinois, with additional domestic offices in: Durham, North Carolina, Stamford, Connecticut, and Westlake, Ohio. International offices are located in Milan, Italy and Beijing, China. Fuel Tech’s Common Stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. under the symbol 'FTEK.'
As a key participant in the air pollution control and fuel treatment chemicals industries, Fuel Tech is a member of the following organizations:
Technologies
The Company’s nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction technologies include low NOx burners, burner upgrades and over-fire air systems. In addition post-combustion NOx control systems include: NOxOUT® and HERT™ SNCR systems, Rich Reagent Injection (RRI) systems, and ASCR™ Advanced SCR systems. These technologies can be combined as part of an I-NOx™ Integrated NOx Control system. Our ULTRA™ ammonia generation process and XCAM™ systems to measure ammonia are technologies centered around SNCR and SCR applications. For particulate control, Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) technologies are applied through rebuild and retrofits to maximize performance to achieve regulatory compliance. In addition, Flue Gas Conditioning (FGC) technology through the use of sulfur trioxide and ammonia injection systems modify fly ash properties for collection by ESPs. These technologies have established Fuel Tech as a leader in NOx reduction, with installations on over 1,000 units worldwide, where coal, fuel oil, natural gas, municipal waste, biomass, and other fuels are utilized.
The Company’s FUEL CHEM® technology revolves around custom-designed applications of chemicals to improve the efficiency, reliability, fuel flexibility and environmental status of combustion units. These programs control slagging, fouling, corrosion, opacity and the formation of sulfur trioxide, ammonium bisulfate, particulate matter (PM2.5), as well as, carbon dioxide (CO2). This technology is applied to units where coal, heavy oil, biomass, and municipal waste are utilized. Our HClear™ programs target the reduction of HCl emissions.
We also provide a range of services, which include boiler testing, combustion optimization, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) management services, which includes ammonia injection grid design and tuning. In addition to flow corrective devices such as static mixers and our GSG™ Graduated Straightening Grid to help optimize flue gas distribution and mixing in both power plant and industrial applications.
Many of our application designs rely on our proprietary Company's exceptional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling capabilities, enhanced by our internally developed, high-end visualization software; this is in addition to our Physical (Experimental) Modeling of system designs. These capabilities, coupled with our innovative technologies and multi-disciplined team approach, enable us to provide practical solutions to our customers’ most challenging problems.

COMPANY INFORMATION
Incorporated in 1987, Fuel Tech has over 200 employees, of which more than 25% of its full-time staff holds advanced degrees. The Company maintains Corporate Headquarters in Warrenville, Illinois, with additional domestic offices in: Durham, North Carolina, Stamford, Connecticut, and Westlake, Ohio. International offices are located in Milan, Italy and Beijing, China. Fuel Tech’s Common Stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. under the symbol 'FTEK.'
As a key participant in the air pollution control and fuel treatment chemicals industries, Fuel Tech is a member of the following organizations:
Technologies
The Company’s nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction technologies include low NOx burners, burner upgrades and over-fire air systems. In addition post-combustion NOx control systems include: NOxOUT® and HERT™ SNCR systems, Rich Reagent Injection (RRI) systems, and ASCR™ Advanced SCR systems. These technologies can be combined as part of an I-NOx™ Integrated NOx Control system. Our ULTRA™ ammonia generation process and XCAM™ systems to measure ammonia are technologies centered around SNCR and SCR applications. For particulate control, Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) technologies are applied through rebuild and retrofits to maximize performance to achieve regulatory compliance. In addition, Flue Gas Conditioning (FGC) technology through the use of sulfur trioxide and ammonia injection systems modify fly ash properties for collection by ESPs. These technologies have established Fuel Tech as a leader in NOx reduction, with installations on over 1,000 units worldwide, where coal, fuel oil, natural gas, municipal waste, biomass, and other fuels are utilized.
The Company’s FUEL CHEM® technology revolves around custom-designed applications of chemicals to improve the efficiency, reliability, fuel flexibility and environmental status of combustion units. These programs control slagging, fouling, corrosion, opacity and the formation of sulfur trioxide, ammonium bisulfate, particulate matter (PM2.5), as well as, carbon dioxide (CO2). This technology is applied to units where coal, heavy oil, biomass, and municipal waste are utilized. Our HClear™ programs target the reduction of HCl emissions.
We also provide a range of services, which include boiler testing, combustion optimization, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) management services, which includes ammonia injection grid design and tuning. In addition to flow corrective devices such as static mixers and our GSG™ Graduated Straightening Grid to help optimize flue gas distribution and mixing in both power plant and industrial applications.
Many of our application designs rely on our proprietary Company's exceptional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling capabilities, enhanced by our internally developed, high-end visualization software; this is in addition to our Physical (Experimental) Modeling of system designs. These capabilities, coupled with our innovative technologies and multi-disciplined team approach, enable us to provide practical solutions to our customers’ most challenging problems.
