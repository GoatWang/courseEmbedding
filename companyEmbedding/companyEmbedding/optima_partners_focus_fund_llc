INTRODUCTION
Optima Fund Management was founded by D. Dixon Boardman, Managing Member and Chief Executive Officer, to focus on investments which would generate attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing significant downside protection. Today, the Firm offers both commingled and custom tailored separate account hedge fund of funds programs across a variety of strategies. Optima also has a single manager hedge fund program. The hedge funds in this program were selected by Optima based on Optima's assessment of their strong track record and outstanding manager pedigree.

Founded in 1988, making Optima one of the oldest independent alternative asset management firms. 
Client base is 70% institutional / 30% high net worth with 900 clients across 20 countries. 
Optima Fund Management LLC has been an SEC Registered Investment Advisor since 1993 and Optima Fund Management Limited Partnership has been an SEC Registered Investment Advisor since 2004. 
Since 2000, Optima has had a strategic alliance with BNY Mellon Wealth Management and Mellon Financial Corp., which holds a 17% interest in the Firm. 

PHILOSOPHY 
Since inception, Optima has been committed to the quality and integrity of its investment programs, operations and client service. This is not just our business strategy; it is the standard against which we measure everything we do. This includes Optima's belief that of the thousands of hedge funds that exist today, at most 10% are worthy of review and perhaps only half of that number are worthy of serious consideration. 

Optima differentiates itself from other fund of hedge funds based on strong qualitative and quantitative research aspects of the due diligence process as well as a special focus on operational and portfolio risk management. 
Optima strives to invest with those that it views as the "best and the brightest" talent in the hedge fund industry. 
Optima is responsive to specific mandates and can customize portfolios to meet investor goals and guidelines. 



D. Dixon Boardman








                “We spend considerable time getting to know each of our clients. A deep understanding of their unique goals and requirements forms the foundation of our customized programs.” 
                Christopher J. Heath, Managing Director

Funds of hedge funds resurgent, says Optima founder Dixon Boardman

Funds of Hedge Funds











The fund of hedge fund business is strong and is regaining momentum and America is leading the way, says Dixon Boardman, founder of Optima Fund Management.
 
Boardman (pictured) cites figures from Hedge Fund Intelligence noting that in 2012 North American firms saw assets grow by an average of some 3.47 per cent while non-US firms had continued to register significant outflows. 
 
Optima, founded in 1988, is celebrating its 25th anniversary with assets under management breaking through USD4bn. He emphasises, however, that the profile of today’s investors in FoHFs has altered significantly over the years.
 
“The most obvious change is that the business has come to be dominated by institutional investors whereas at the outset, the focus was mainly on the high net-worth sector,” he says.
 
Optima’s assets under management currently split 60 per cent institutional and 40 per cent HNW.
 
“Furthermore, we’ve also witnessed an important change in the profile of institutional investors, themselves,” Boardman says. “Early adopters and more sophisticated institutions are increasingly taking the manager selection and monitoring process in house – they have climbed the learning curve. Next along the ‘escalator’ are institutions that may have started out relying on funds of funds and are now turning to customised solutions that better fit their overall investment programmes. And then there are the newer or smaller institutions for whom investing in funds of funds is perfectly sensible.”
 
Launched in 2007, the Optima Partners Focus Fund enables investors to invest with a highly select group of established hedge fund managers, each running a concentrated portfolio of their best ideas.
 
The Focus Fund, which recorded a net return of 17.43 per cent in 2012, continues to perform well in 2013 with first quarter net returns of 12.9 per cent.
 
“Manager selection is key,” says Boardman. “Top-quartile hedge fund managers have materially outperformed the averages, often with less risk. But superior manager selection is a costly and time consuming process that few are qualified to perform.”
