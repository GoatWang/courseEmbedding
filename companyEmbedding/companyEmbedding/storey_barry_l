Mount Berry Square Mall (Doug Walker, RN-T)



















































James M. Hull and Barry L. Storey have announced the formation of two new entities, Hull Property Group and BLS Holdings Group, LLC with the goal of allowing each individual the opportunity to pursue specialized interests.Hull and Storey cofounded Hull/Storey Development, LLC, currently operating as Hull Storey Gibson Companies, in 1992 and have been actively involved in the acquisition, development and operation of retail properties across the Southeast.





Moving forward, Hull Property Group will focus on middle market mall ownership and operations and BLS Holdings Group, LLC will focus on non-mall retail assets and alternative investments.“We have enjoyed a longstanding partnership of 22 years and I have a great deal of respect and admiration for Jim,” said Storey. “While our primary focus going forward will be our individually owned companies we will continue to be involved as partners on specific projects.”





“Barry and I have enjoyed many successes over a long period and I look forward to continuing to work together as there is no better partner than the Storey family. Barry and I would like to thank Doug Cates for his role in the facilitation of this transition and wish him well as he returns to full time status at Cherry Bekaert, LLP,” said Hull.
