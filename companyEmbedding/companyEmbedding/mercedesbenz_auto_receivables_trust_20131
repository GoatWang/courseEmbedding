Fitch Affirms 4 Classes of Mercedes Benz Auto Receivables Trust 2013-1 & 2014-1 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms 4 Classes of Mercedes Benz Auto Receivables Trust 2013-1 & 
      2014-1
    





April 13, 2016 06:10 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has affirmed four of 
      the outstanding classes of Mercedes Benz Auto Receivables Trust (MBART) 
      2013-1 and 2014-1 as follows:
    

      2013-1:--Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 at 
      'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      2014-1:--Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 at 
      'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The ratings are based on available credit enhancement and loss 
      performance. The collateral pools continue to perform within Fitch's 
      expectations. Under the credit enhancement structure, the securities are 
      able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the current ratings 
      and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the 
      documents.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of Mercedes-Benz Financial Services USA, 
      LLC retail auto loan originations, the strength of its servicing 
      capabilities, and the sound financial and legal structure of the 
      transaction.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of default and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxies and impact available loss coverage and multiple levels for 
      the transactions. Lower loss coverage could impact the ratings and 
      Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited strong 
      performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations with 
      rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of the 
      transactions in this review can be found in the respective appendices 
      listed below. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the 
      asset class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, 
      Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global Structured Finance 
      Transactions' dated Mar. 26, 2015.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

(FICO) score of 767 is consistent with recently issued MBART transactions and, combined with the strong internal credit-tier distribution, indicates a strong borrower. Increased Used Vehicle Concentration: Concentrations of used vehicles increased to 72.43% in 2014-1 from 61.38% in 2013-1, representing the highest level in any MBART transaction to date. The increase in used vehicles has resulted in a higher WA loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for the 2014-1 pool, which could result in higher loss severities on defaulted loans.Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Total initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for class A notes is 2.75%. Yield supplement OC will be used to boost the transaction's annual percentage rate (APR), providing expected excess spread of 2.60%. CE is sufficient to cover in excess of a 5.0x multiple of Fitch's base case expected lifetime cumulative net losses (CNLs) of 1%.Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Mercedes Benz Financial Services' (MBFS) portfolio and securitization performance has been improving with low delinquencies and losses over the past three years. Performance has been supported by the improving U.S. economic recovery and stable used vehicle values.Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of Daimler or MBFS would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in potential negative rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Mercedes-Benz Auto Receivables Trust 2014-1 to increased losses over the life of the transaction.Fitch's analysis found that the class A notes display minimal sensitivity to a moderate increase in defaults and losses, showing potential downgrades of up to one notch, if at all, under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. However, class A notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further detailed in the accompanying presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com or by clicking on the below link.Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Mercedes-Benz Auto Receivables Trust 2014-1 (U.S. ABS)http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=751280ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextYou may never have to deal with parking again thanks to autonomous garagesDigital TrendsThe At-Home Tip That Can Stop Foot & Nail FungusGlobal Nail FungusSponsoredAudi, Mercedes now updating European diesels for emissions; more to come?Green Car ReportsKristin Beck, transgender Navy SEAL hero: 'Let's meet face to face and you tell me I'm not worthy'Business Insider'I'm going to issue a warning': Howard Marks' outlines the dangers of today's marketYahoo FinanceEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredFED HOLDS RATES, FOMC HINTS AT SEPTEMBER UNWINDYahoo FinanceRepublicans block Democrats' bid to see Treasury files on TrumpReutersAmazon’s Echo rivaled by Xiaomi and Facebook: rptYahoo Finance VideoDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredImmigration is the 'single best way' to lift economic standardsYahoo FinanceTODAY'S CHARTS: Why Facebook earnings could show a big surprise to the upsideYahoo FinancePhil Mickelson trash-talked Jordan Spieth at the Open Championship — and Phil is going to have to eat his wordsBusiness InsiderStart Earning Miles With The Best Travel CardWise BreadSponsoredA Senate vote to repeal Obamacare could rattle marketsYahoo FinanceMcLaren reportedly has another Ultimate Series car in the works - the P15AutoblogGeorge Takei Offers Blistering Takedown Of Trump's Trans Military BanBryan: So an old gay out of work actor thinks his opinion matters?Join the Conversation1 / 52.1k

Did you know that the parent company of Mercedes was the first to build a true automobile? Just over two decades after the U.S. Civil War had ended (And a mere sixteen years after the founding of modern Germany), Karl Benz was granted a patent for his “Motorwagen.” The vehicle came out in January of 1886, and was powered by a single cylinder, four-stroke engine of his own design.
Cars in general have come a long way in 120 years – especially the Mercedes. The Mercedes Benz has long been famous for its quality engineering and reliability, but it doesn’t stay that way by itself. Even the most legendary driving machine will deteriorate if not properly maintained, and that is why every Mercedes owner needs a source for discount Mercedes parts. The Mercedes parts that most typically wear out – aside from engine filters – are the hoses and belts, which should be inspected about every three to six months for signs of age, brittleness and cracking. Mercedes parts associated with the electrical system are next on the list.  Like radiator hoses, plug wires can become brittle and crack with age. Make sure these plug wires are of high quality and shielded so as to avoid electro-magnetic interference with your car’s electric accessories as well as “cross-talk” – a potentially serious condition in which electric current can literally jump from one wire to another and cause serious damage. By investing in quality Mercedes parts, you’ll avoid costly repairs and enjoy a reliable vehicle for many years.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
