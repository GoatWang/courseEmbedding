mugshots.com definitions:
Arrest or booked: An arrest is the act of depriving a person of his or her liberty usually in relation to the purported investigation or prevention of crime and presenting (the arrestee) to a procedure as part of the criminal justice system. The term is Anglo-Norman in origin and is related to the French word arrêt, meaning "stop".
The question whether the person is under arrest or not depends not on the legality of the arrest, but on whether the person has been deprived of personal liberty of movement. Including but not limited to; a traffic stop, citation issuance or initial investigation of alleged crime scene.
The word "arrest" on Mugshots.com means the apprehension of a person or the deprivation of a person's liberty.
The word "booked", when used by mugshots.com, is identical in meaning to the word "arrest".
Mugshot - A photograph of usually a person's head and especially face; specifically : a police photograph of a suspect's face or profile." - Merriam Webster dictionary
