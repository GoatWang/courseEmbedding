Dennis J Hickey's Experience
Title: Vice President
               Company: Krasdale Foods Inc
Job Details
               The Krasdale Group today is a very different company from Krasdale Foods, started in 1908 as "A.Krasne Inc". Prior to 1972, Krasdale Foods was an old line grocery wholesaling company with a strong private label. Due to the exceptional merchandising talents of Abraham Krasne, the founder, and several extremely competent merchandisers and buyers, the company was able to succeed while competitors failed. Soon after the 1972 relocation to Hunts Point, we expanded our market serving supermarkets, as we had the newest and most efficient distribution center in the area. By the mid 1970's individually owned supermarkets joined our C-Town voluntary association which became a major expansion of our business. We determined that there is a need for more than simple groceries certain of our customers. Our corporate focus shifted away from purely physical distribution toward retail and merchandising and "value added" services in support of our client base. We came to realize that we are in two distinct businesses and that we occasionally confronted conflicting interests within our own ranks. We had to divide our management skills so as to best serve both constituencies. We wanted to be the best in both areas and this led to the spin-off of Alpha I Marketing as separate corporate entity devoted to providing all manner of services to assist our entrepreneurial customers building successful businesses. Krasdale Foods remained in the grocery distribution sector, while C-town became a feature marquee of Alpha I Marketing and its focus was clearly providing marketing, advertising and all other required assistance to retailers. Our aim is to provide the service equivalent of the corporate chain headquarters for the independent super market owners. By the early 1990's we determined that we attained such intense market penetration, that our customers required an additional store format. We determined that we needed a format to open new opportunities for our customers, and this realization gave birth to Beta II Marketing and the Bravo retail store program. Today, Krasdale Foods continues to see growth in product sales, while Alpha I and Beta II provide marketing services with specific aim of making our clients successful.

Maryann, New Jersey
