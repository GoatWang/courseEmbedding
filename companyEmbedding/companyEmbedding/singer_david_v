HanesBrands Appoints David V. Singer to Board of Directors | Business Wire
























































HanesBrands Appoints David V. Singer to Board of Directors






October 20, 2014 02:40 PM Eastern Daylight Time



WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HanesBrands (NYSE: HBI), a leading global maker and marketer of everyday 
      basic apparel under world-class brands, today announced that David V. 
      Singer, former chief executive officer of snack food leader 
      Snyder’s-Lance, Inc., has been appointed to the company’s board of 
      directors.
    


      Singer, 59, whose term runs until the 2015 annual meeting of 
      stockholders, will serve on the board’s audit committee. With Singer’s 
      appointment, the Hanes board has 10 members.
    

      Singer, who had a successful multidecade career in the food/beverage and 
      finance industries, retired as CEO from Snyder’s-Lance, Inc., in May 
      2013 after creating a leading national snack food company through 
      acquisitions and turning around the Charlotte-based company by leading 
      the overhaul of its supply chain, sales, marketing and distribution 
      functions.
    

      “Dave’s leadership skills, finance acumen and vast consumer-product 
      experience across multiple disciplines make him a valued addition to our 
      talented board of directors,” Hanes Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
      Richard A. Noll said.
    

      Singer served as CEO of Lance, Inc., from 2005 until 2010 when he 
      oversaw the merger with Snyder’s of Hanover, resulting in a snack food 
      company with some of the leading pretzel, sandwich cracker and snack 
      brands in the country. He served as CEO of Snyder’s-Lance, Inc., from 
      2010 until his retirement. Prior to that, he held the treasurer, chief 
      financial officer and executive vice president roles in a 19-year career 
      at Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated in Charlotte, one of the nation's 
      largest independent Coca-Cola bottlers, as well as finance positions at 
      BNY Mellon in Pittsburgh.
    

      He serves as a director of Brunswick Corporation, Flowers Foods, Inc., 
      and SPX Corporation. He earned his bachelor of science degree in 
      marketing and MBA from Pennsylvania State University in State College, 
      Penn.
    

HanesBrands


      HanesBrands is a socially responsible leading marketer of everyday basic 
      apparel under some of the world’s strongest apparel brands in the 
      Americas, Asia and Europe, including Hanes, Champion, Playtex, 
      DIM, Bali, Maidenform, Flexees, JMS/Just 
      My Size, Wonderbra, Nür Die, Lovable and Gear for Sports. 
      The company sells T-shirts, bras, panties, shapewear, men’s underwear, 
      children’s underwear, socks, hosiery, and activewear produced in the
