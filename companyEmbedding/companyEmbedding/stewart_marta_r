Celebrate summer with a backyard BBQ, potluck picnic, pool party -- there are so many opportunities for fun with these must-have supplies from Martha!
 
Heat up the Grill
Stock up on charcoal, because it’s officially grilling season!

The Tools of Summer 






Once your Martha & Marley Spoon meal kit is ordered, make sure you have the right grilling tools for the job. Shop for tongs, a grilling thermometer, skewers, grill baskets, and more from the Martha Stewart Collection™, only at Macy’s.

Chill the Wine 






Did you know that adding salt to an ice bath will lower the water’s freezing point, in turn chilling the contents faster? This method comes in handy for chilling white wine on a warm summer day; simply add the right bottles for the occasion! Shop Martha Stewart Wine Co., Martha’s new online shop dedicated to helping you discover wines from around the world. Choose from individual bottles of reds and whites, warm-weather rosés, curated wine packs, and a wine club membership.

Keep Drinks Cold 






Instead of using a cumbersome (and unsightly) cooler, set out a beverage bucket with an assortment of cold drinks to keep party guests refreshed. Liven up the plain exterior with a fun design or pattern created with Martha Stewart Multi-Surface Acrylic Craft Paint.

Use Carefree Drinkware 






For outdoor parties with a relaxed atmosphere, eliminate the worry of broken glass by using drinkware made from durable materials like acrylic. This cup and pitcher set from the Martha Stewart Collection only at Macy’s is shatter-resistant and adds a pop of color to the table.

Arrange a Self-Serve Drink Station 






Keep the party casual with a self-serve drink station so you’re free to mingle with friends and family instead of playing bartender. This acrylic drink dispenser from the Martha Stewart Collection™, only at Macy’s, holds 2.5 gallons of your favorite juice, tea, or cocktail.

Sweeten the Menu 






With a seemingly-endless supply of hot dogs, potato chips, sugary beverages, and other traditional party fare, it’s not surprising dessert may sound overindulgent. Trade store-bought desserts for healthier homemade treats from Martha’s newest cookbook, A New Way to Bake. Learn to transform classic recipes with modern ingredients, like whole-grain flours and natural sweeteners, for sweet treats everyone will enjoy.

History[edit]
The company was founded, in 1997 by Martha Stewart,[3] as an umbrella for the various media and merchandising ventures linked to the Martha Stewart brand. It went public on the NYSE on October 19, 1999. The stock opened at $18 a share, but shot up to $38 a share, making Stewart an instant billionaire.
She served as president, chairwoman and CEO of the company until being forced to resign as a result of the ImClone insider trading case. As part of an agreement with the SEC, she was banned from serving in any role that would allow her to prepare, audit or disclose financial results of a public company until August 2011.[4] In effect, this banned her from serving as an officer of her own company. However, she still owns a 96 percent controlling interest.
Stewart rejoined the board of directors of her namesake company in September 2011[5] and became its chairwoman once again in May 2012.[6]
On December 4, 2015, it was announced that Sequential Brands Group acquired Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.[7] As a result of its acquisition, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia requested that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) suspend trading & de-list the company's common stock.[7][8]

Four newspaper columns — ask Martha, Living, Weddings and Everyday Food — are distributed to newspapers throughout the United States via the New York Times Syndicate. Current books are published through Random House's Clarkson Potter division; earlier titles were offered through subsidiaries of Time Warner prior to Stewart's spin-off of her business ventures from its corporate umbrella. Publishing activities are a major source of income for the company, and accounted for roughly 60% of total revenue in 2005.
Television and radio[edit]
Television[edit]
On 15 November 2005 Martha Stewart named NBC's Sheraton Kalouria as President of Television[10] for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSLO), he was responsible for development and production of global programming for cable, broadcast, syndication and DVD as well as managing MSLO's development in the area of digital content for video on demand,[11] web and mobile platforms.

Although MSLO retained no technical ownership stake in NBC's program The Apprentice: Martha Stewart, the company, its magazines, and various business ventures were prominently featured in each episode. Mark Burnett, who produced the series, is also co-producer of the company's daily talk show, Martha.
DVD[edit]
MSLO began marketing instructional DVDs in late 2005 through a partnership with Warner Bros., with the first five offerings oriented toward cooking and holiday and special event planning.
Radio[edit]
MSLO operates a satellite radio channel, Martha Stewart Living Radio, on Channel 110 of SiriusXM Satellite Radio. Among programs on the channel there was a weekday-evening talk show co-hosted by Martha Stewart's daughter Alexis Stewart, Whatever with Alexis and Jennifer. Alexis left the radio show in June 2011 leaving Jennifer Koppelman-Hutt as the sole host. The show was cancelled in December 2011 and Koppelman-Hutt was terminated.
Internet and direct Commerce[edit]
The company's Internet and Direct Commerce segment currently includes its website marthastewart.com and a direct to consumer flower business, marthastewartflowers.com. Through an agreement with Touchpoint, it designed a line of customizable greeting cards under the Marthascards banner, which were sourced and fulfilled by Touchpoint. This agreement was replaced by a new program with Kodak EasyShare Gallery in 2006.
In November 2006, MSLO announced their launch of Martha's Circle which is a lifestyle oriented blog ad-network[12] whose charter members include Apartment Therapy, Smitten Kitchen, and Charles & Hudson.
Historically, the company also produced a print and online catalog, Martha by Mail, which was launched in 1997 and later rebranded as Martha Stewart: The Catalog for Living. Following Stewart's public fallout and the dot-com bubble burst in 2002, the company decided to discontinue both the online and print editions in 2003. The final print catalog was mailed in January 2004, and the online store closed in June of that year.
Merchandising[edit]
MSLO additionally offers various home goods through its mass-market Martha Stewart Everyday brand in Kmart stores throughout the United States, and at Sears Canada in Canada. Furniture and paint are part of the company's specialty-retail oriented Martha Stewart Signature brand through a partnership with Bernhardt Furniture Company and previously with Sherwin-Williams. In October 2006, the company announced a new agreement with Lowe's to develop an exclusive interior paints line, which replaced its previous contract with Sherwin-Williams. The new line of paints, Martha Stewart Colors, launched in April 2007.
In April 2006, the company also announced its plans to develop a new, upmarket merchandise line with Macy's, Inc. (at the time named Federated Department Stores) launched in Macy's stores in 2007. The company has also announced its intention to design a new paper-based crafts product line, Martha Stewart Crafts, with EK Success, initially planned for release in time for the Holiday 2006 season, which later debuted in early 2007 at Michael's stores.
In Fall of 2009, Stewart announced the development of a line of outdoor furniture, indoor organization, kitchen cabinets, and decor products at Home Depot.
On December 7, 2011, JCPenney announced the acquisition of 16.6 percent of the company's stock. JCPenney plans to put "mini-Martha Stewart shops" in many of its stores in 2013, as well as starting a web site together.[13]
Wine[edit]
On September 14, 2007, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced that it inked a partnership with E & J Gallo Winery to produce a wine brand with the label "Martha Stewart Vintage" for sale in 6 cities, January. The 15,000 cases to be sold include: 2006 Sonoma County Chardonnay, 2005 Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon and 2006 Sonoma County Merlot (for Atlanta, Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver, Phoenix, and Portland, Oregon).
Martha Stewart also signed a contract with Costco Wholesale Corp. to offer a series of food products developed from MSLO’s library of recipes.
Acquisition of Emeril Lagasse Franchise[edit]
On February 19, 2008, MSL Omnimedia announced that the company had reached an agreement with celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse to purchase certain business assets for $50 million: $45 million in cash and $5 million in stock.[14] With the exclusion of Emeril Lagasse’s restaurant chain and his foundation, the deal consists of the rights to television programs such as Essence of Emeril and Emeril Live, Emeril Lagasse’s Cookbook library, the emerils.com website, and kitchen and food products.
Controversies[edit]
Investor's lawsuit[edit]
On August 6, 2002, a class action was filed against Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. for misleading investors by issuing materially false and misleading statements, and its officers using insider information to avoid losses. A settlement of $30 million was approved in 2007.[15] In 2004, the company previously recognized as expense its estimate of annualsubscription-acquisition costs ratably throughout the year. After reviewing this matter with its independent certified public accounting firm and its auditcommittee, the company determined on October 26, 2004 to change the method of accounting for interim period expense recognition of its subscription acquisition costs. The company recognized subscription-acquisition costs in the period in which the acquisition efforts took place and restated the financial statements.[16]
Macy's lawsuit[edit]
In December 2013, Macy's sued Martha Stewart and Penney after the two companies decided, in 2011, to partner up and open up what would be called Martha Stewart home shops. Macy's sued Martha Stewart for "breach of contract" and sued Penney for "interfering with its agreement with Martha Stewart". Both of these lawsuits were combined in December 2013.[17] Macy's goal was to stop Penney from selling Martha Stewart merchandise that was supposed to be sold exclusively at Macy's.[18]
Macy's settled a portion of its lawsuit with Martha Stewart Omnimedia over a home products deal, however, Macy's continues to sue J.C. Penney Company Inc.[19] Stewart did not disclose the terms of the settlement.[17] This lawsuit cost between "$7 million and $8 million in legal costs", according to CEO Dienst.[9]

History[edit]
The company was founded, in 1997 by Martha Stewart,[3] as an umbrella for the various media and merchandising ventures linked to the Martha Stewart brand. It went public on the NYSE on October 19, 1999. The stock opened at $18 a share, but shot up to $38 a share, making Stewart an instant billionaire.
She served as president, chairwoman and CEO of the company until being forced to resign as a result of the ImClone insider trading case. As part of an agreement with the SEC, she was banned from serving in any role that would allow her to prepare, audit or disclose financial results of a public company until August 2011.[4] In effect, this banned her from serving as an officer of her own company. However, she still owns a 96 percent controlling interest.
Stewart rejoined the board of directors of her namesake company in September 2011[5] and became its chairwoman once again in May 2012.[6]
On December 4, 2015, it was announced that Sequential Brands Group acquired Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.[7] As a result of its acquisition, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia requested that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) suspend trading & de-list the company's common stock.[7][8]

Four newspaper columns — ask Martha, Living, Weddings and Everyday Food — are distributed to newspapers throughout the United States via the New York Times Syndicate. Current books are published through Random House's Clarkson Potter division; earlier titles were offered through subsidiaries of Time Warner prior to Stewart's spin-off of her business ventures from its corporate umbrella. Publishing activities are a major source of income for the company, and accounted for roughly 60% of total revenue in 2005.

Although MSLO retained no technical ownership stake in NBC's program The Apprentice: Martha Stewart, the company, its magazines, and various business ventures were prominently featured in each episode. Mark Burnett, who produced the series, is also co-producer of the company's daily talk show, Martha.
DVD[edit]
MSLO began marketing instructional DVDs in late 2005 through a partnership with Warner Bros., with the first five offerings oriented toward cooking and holiday and special event planning.
Radio[edit]
MSLO operates a satellite radio channel, Martha Stewart Living Radio, on Channel 110 of SiriusXM Satellite Radio. Among programs on the channel there was a weekday-evening talk show co-hosted by Martha Stewart's daughter Alexis Stewart, Whatever with Alexis and Jennifer. Alexis left the radio show in June 2011 leaving Jennifer Koppelman-Hutt as the sole host. The show was cancelled in December 2011 and Koppelman-Hutt was terminated.
Internet and direct Commerce[edit]
The company's Internet and Direct Commerce segment currently includes its website marthastewart.com and a direct to consumer flower business, marthastewartflowers.com. Through an agreement with Touchpoint, it designed a line of customizable greeting cards under the Marthascards banner, which were sourced and fulfilled by Touchpoint. This agreement was replaced by a new program with Kodak EasyShare Gallery in 2006.
In November 2006, MSLO announced their launch of Martha's Circle which is a lifestyle oriented blog ad-network[12] whose charter members include Apartment Therapy, Smitten Kitchen, and Charles & Hudson.
Historically, the company also produced a print and online catalog, Martha by Mail, which was launched in 1997 and later rebranded as Martha Stewart: The Catalog for Living. Following Stewart's public fallout and the dot-com bubble burst in 2002, the company decided to discontinue both the online and print editions in 2003. The final print catalog was mailed in January 2004, and the online store closed in June of that year.
Merchandising[edit]
MSLO additionally offers various home goods through its mass-market Martha Stewart Everyday brand in Kmart stores throughout the United States, and at Sears Canada in Canada. Furniture and paint are part of the company's specialty-retail oriented Martha Stewart Signature brand through a partnership with Bernhardt Furniture Company and previously with Sherwin-Williams. In October 2006, the company announced a new agreement with Lowe's to develop an exclusive interior paints line, which replaced its previous contract with Sherwin-Williams. The new line of paints, Martha Stewart Colors, launched in April 2007.
In April 2006, the company also announced its plans to develop a new, upmarket merchandise line with Macy's, Inc. (at the time named Federated Department Stores) launched in Macy's stores in 2007. The company has also announced its intention to design a new paper-based crafts product line, Martha Stewart Crafts, with EK Success, initially planned for release in time for the Holiday 2006 season, which later debuted in early 2007 at Michael's stores.
In Fall of 2009, Stewart announced the development of a line of outdoor furniture, indoor organization, kitchen cabinets, and decor products at Home Depot.
On December 7, 2011, JCPenney announced the acquisition of 16.6 percent of the company's stock. JCPenney plans to put "mini-Martha Stewart shops" in many of its stores in 2013, as well as starting a web site together.[13]
Wine[edit]
On September 14, 2007, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced that it inked a partnership with E & J Gallo Winery to produce a wine brand with the label "Martha Stewart Vintage" for sale in 6 cities, January. The 15,000 cases to be sold include: 2006 Sonoma County Chardonnay, 2005 Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon and 2006 Sonoma County Merlot (for Atlanta, Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver, Phoenix, and Portland, Oregon).
Martha Stewart also signed a contract with Costco Wholesale Corp. to offer a series of food products developed from MSLO’s library of recipes.
Acquisition of Emeril Lagasse Franchise[edit]
On February 19, 2008, MSL Omnimedia announced that the company had reached an agreement with celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse to purchase certain business assets for $50 million: $45 million in cash and $5 million in stock.[14] With the exclusion of Emeril Lagasse’s restaurant chain and his foundation, the deal consists of the rights to television programs such as Essence of Emeril and Emeril Live, Emeril Lagasse’s Cookbook library, the emerils.com website, and kitchen and food products.
Controversies[edit]
Investor's lawsuit[edit]
On August 6, 2002, a class action was filed against Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. for misleading investors by issuing materially false and misleading statements, and its officers using insider information to avoid losses. A settlement of $30 million was approved in 2007.[15] In 2004, the company previously recognized as expense its estimate of annualsubscription-acquisition costs ratably throughout the year. After reviewing this matter with its independent certified public accounting firm and its auditcommittee, the company determined on October 26, 2004 to change the method of accounting for interim period expense recognition of its subscription acquisition costs. The company recognized subscription-acquisition costs in the period in which the acquisition efforts took place and restated the financial statements.[16]
Macy's lawsuit[edit]
In December 2013, Macy's sued Martha Stewart and Penney after the two companies decided, in 2011, to partner up and open up what would be called Martha Stewart home shops. Macy's sued Martha Stewart for "breach of contract" and sued Penney for "interfering with its agreement with Martha Stewart". Both of these lawsuits were combined in December 2013.[17] Macy's goal was to stop Penney from selling Martha Stewart merchandise that was supposed to be sold exclusively at Macy's.[18]
Macy's settled a portion of its lawsuit with Martha Stewart Omnimedia over a home products deal, however, Macy's continues to sue J.C. Penney Company Inc.[19] Stewart did not disclose the terms of the settlement.[17] This lawsuit cost between "$7 million and $8 million in legal costs", according to CEO Dienst.[9]

History[edit]
The company was founded, in 1997 by Martha Stewart,[3] as an umbrella for the various media and merchandising ventures linked to the Martha Stewart brand. It went public on the NYSE on October 19, 1999. The stock opened at $18 a share, but shot up to $38 a share, making Stewart an instant billionaire.
She served as president, chairwoman and CEO of the company until being forced to resign as a result of the ImClone insider trading case. As part of an agreement with the SEC, she was banned from serving in any role that would allow her to prepare, audit or disclose financial results of a public company until August 2011.[4] In effect, this banned her from serving as an officer of her own company. However, she still owns a 96 percent controlling interest.
Stewart rejoined the board of directors of her namesake company in September 2011[5] and became its chairwoman once again in May 2012.[6]
On December 4, 2015, it was announced that Sequential Brands Group acquired Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.[7] As a result of its acquisition, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia requested that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) suspend trading & de-list the company's common stock.[7][8]

Four newspaper columns — ask Martha, Living, Weddings and Everyday Food — are distributed to newspapers throughout the United States via the New York Times Syndicate. Current books are published through Random House's Clarkson Potter division; earlier titles were offered through subsidiaries of Time Warner prior to Stewart's spin-off of her business ventures from its corporate umbrella. Publishing activities are a major source of income for the company, and accounted for roughly 60% of total revenue in 2005.
Television and radio[edit]

Although MSLO retained no technical ownership stake in NBC's program The Apprentice: Martha Stewart, the company, its magazines, and various business ventures were prominently featured in each episode. Mark Burnett, who produced the series, is also co-producer of the company's daily talk show, Martha.
DVD[edit]
MSLO began marketing instructional DVDs in late 2005 through a partnership with Warner Bros., with the first five offerings oriented toward cooking and holiday and special event planning.
Radio[edit]
MSLO operates a satellite radio channel, Martha Stewart Living Radio, on Channel 110 of SiriusXM Satellite Radio. Among programs on the channel there was a weekday-evening talk show co-hosted by Martha Stewart's daughter Alexis Stewart, Whatever with Alexis and Jennifer. Alexis left the radio show in June 2011 leaving Jennifer Koppelman-Hutt as the sole host. The show was cancelled in December 2011 and Koppelman-Hutt was terminated.
Internet and direct Commerce[edit]
The company's Internet and Direct Commerce segment currently includes its website marthastewart.com and a direct to consumer flower business, marthastewartflowers.com. Through an agreement with Touchpoint, it designed a line of customizable greeting cards under the Marthascards banner, which were sourced and fulfilled by Touchpoint. This agreement was replaced by a new program with Kodak EasyShare Gallery in 2006.
In November 2006, MSLO announced their launch of Martha's Circle which is a lifestyle oriented blog ad-network[12] whose charter members include Apartment Therapy, Smitten Kitchen, and Charles & Hudson.
Historically, the company also produced a print and online catalog, Martha by Mail, which was launched in 1997 and later rebranded as Martha Stewart: The Catalog for Living. Following Stewart's public fallout and the dot-com bubble burst in 2002, the company decided to discontinue both the online and print editions in 2003. The final print catalog was mailed in January 2004, and the online store closed in June of that year.
Merchandising[edit]
MSLO additionally offers various home goods through its mass-market Martha Stewart Everyday brand in Kmart stores throughout the United States, and at Sears Canada in Canada. Furniture and paint are part of the company's specialty-retail oriented Martha Stewart Signature brand through a partnership with Bernhardt Furniture Company and previously with Sherwin-Williams. In October 2006, the company announced a new agreement with Lowe's to develop an exclusive interior paints line, which replaced its previous contract with Sherwin-Williams. The new line of paints, Martha Stewart Colors, launched in April 2007.
In April 2006, the company also announced its plans to develop a new, upmarket merchandise line with Macy's, Inc. (at the time named Federated Department Stores) launched in Macy's stores in 2007. The company has also announced its intention to design a new paper-based crafts product line, Martha Stewart Crafts, with EK Success, initially planned for release in time for the Holiday 2006 season, which later debuted in early 2007 at Michael's stores.
In Fall of 2009, Stewart announced the development of a line of outdoor furniture, indoor organization, kitchen cabinets, and decor products at Home Depot.
On December 7, 2011, JCPenney announced the acquisition of 16.6 percent of the company's stock. JCPenney plans to put "mini-Martha Stewart shops" in many of its stores in 2013, as well as starting a web site together.[13]
Wine[edit]
On September 14, 2007, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced that it inked a partnership with E & J Gallo Winery to produce a wine brand with the label "Martha Stewart Vintage" for sale in 6 cities, January. The 15,000 cases to be sold include: 2006 Sonoma County Chardonnay, 2005 Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon and 2006 Sonoma County Merlot (for Atlanta, Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver, Phoenix, and Portland, Oregon).
Martha Stewart also signed a contract with Costco Wholesale Corp. to offer a series of food products developed from MSLO’s library of recipes.
Acquisition of Emeril Lagasse Franchise[edit]
On February 19, 2008, MSL Omnimedia announced that the company had reached an agreement with celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse to purchase certain business assets for $50 million: $45 million in cash and $5 million in stock.[14] With the exclusion of Emeril Lagasse’s restaurant chain and his foundation, the deal consists of the rights to television programs such as Essence of Emeril and Emeril Live, Emeril Lagasse’s Cookbook library, the emerils.com website, and kitchen and food products.
Controversies[edit]
Investor's lawsuit[edit]
On August 6, 2002, a class action was filed against Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. for misleading investors by issuing materially false and misleading statements, and its officers using insider information to avoid losses. A settlement of $30 million was approved in 2007.[15] In 2004, the company previously recognized as expense its estimate of annualsubscription-acquisition costs ratably throughout the year. After reviewing this matter with its independent certified public accounting firm and its auditcommittee, the company determined on October 26, 2004 to change the method of accounting for interim period expense recognition of its subscription acquisition costs. The company recognized subscription-acquisition costs in the period in which the acquisition efforts took place and restated the financial statements.[16]
Macy's lawsuit[edit]
In December 2013, Macy's sued Martha Stewart and Penney after the two companies decided, in 2011, to partner up and open up what would be called Martha Stewart home shops. Macy's sued Martha Stewart for "breach of contract" and sued Penney for "interfering with its agreement with Martha Stewart". Both of these lawsuits were combined in December 2013.[17] Macy's goal was to stop Penney from selling Martha Stewart merchandise that was supposed to be sold exclusively at Macy's.[18]
Macy's settled a portion of its lawsuit with Martha Stewart Omnimedia over a home products deal, however, Macy's continues to sue J.C. Penney Company Inc.[19] Stewart did not disclose the terms of the settlement.[17] This lawsuit cost between "$7 million and $8 million in legal costs", according to CEO Dienst.[9]

Sequential Brands expands exclusive Martha Stewart line of office products at Staples

 
Lifestyle expert provides new essentials for school, home, office and travel
NEW YORK, 2017-Jul-12 — /EPR Retail News/ — Sequential Brands Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:SQBG) and Staples (Nasdaq:SPLS) announce the expansion of the Martha Stewart line of office products available exclusively at Staples.
The collection includes a new line of organizing products and accessories such as Discbound™ notebooks, message boards, folders, and Stack + Fit®storage solutions. The new product, which has been available since June, features beautiful new patterns, gold-finished hardware, and two new colors, persimmon and gray. The line also features a customizable Wall Manager® System.
“When we design, our goal is to identify innovative organizing ideas and transform them in to stylish, high-quality products that consumers love and trust. It’s important that people have the ability to stay organized whether the space they’re working with is a roomy office, a small desk, a closet or just a tote bag. We design products which make those spaces as functional as possible. Consumers really appreciate our attention to detail and use this line for its quality, style, and value,” said Martha Stewart.
Earlier this year, the Martha Stewart line of office products launched a new office storage system and new travel products and accessories. The office storage system offers basketweave bins with raised lids that make stacking and storing easy in even the smallest spaces; bins come in 6 sizes, most of which can hold letter-size paper and standard folders. The travel line is designed to help travelers stay organized and ease the travel experience; products include a brand-new Martha Stewart backpack—featuring a rear pocket that unzips to slip over a rolling luggage handle—a tote bag, and assorted zipper pouches, perfect for accessories such as toiletries, makeup, and more. These latest products and the entire Martha Stewart collection are currently available online at Staples.com/MarthaStewart and in stores.
“We’re thrilled to expand the exclusive Martha Stewart collection at Staples that includes beautiful organizational products and bright pattern finishes,” said Amy Steel Vanden-Eykel, vice president, merchandising, Staples. “The Martha Stewart brand is perfect for the moms and teens who are looking for a stylish, functional alternative to classic office supplies.”

NEW YORK, July  11, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sequential Brands Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:SQBG) and Staples (Nasdaq:SPLS) announce the expansion of the Martha Stewart line of office products available exclusively at Staples. Photos accompanying this announcement are available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/570cf35e-32a1-4a32-aad0-c255b55acc2f http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/498aad33-6535-4a99-ba3b-e5f8d5f04242 The collection includes a new line of organizing products and accessories such as Discbound™ notebooks, message boards, folders, and Stack + Fit® storage solutions. The new product, which has been available since June, features beautiful new patterns, gold-finished hardware, and two new colors, persimmon and gray. The line also features a customizable Wall Manager® System.    “When we design, our goal is to identify innovative organizing ideas and transform them in to stylish, high-quality products that consumers love and trust. It’s important that people have the ability to stay organized whether the space they’re working with is a roomy office, a small desk, a closet or just a tote bag. We design products which make those spaces as functional as possible. Consumers really appreciate our attention to detail and use this line for its quality, style, and value,” said Martha Stewart.  Earlier this year, the Martha Stewart line of office products launched a new office storage system and new travel products and accessories. The office storage system offers basketweave bins with raised lids that make stacking and storing easy in even the smallest spaces; bins come in 6 sizes, most of which can hold letter-size paper and standard folders. The travel line is designed to help travelers stay organized and ease the travel experience; products include a brand-new Martha Stewart backpack—featuring a rear pocket that unzips to slip over a rolling luggage handle—a tote bag, and assorted zipper pouches, perfect for accessories such as toiletries, makeup, and more. These latest products and the entire Martha Stewart collection are currently available online at Staples.com/MarthaStewart and in stores. “We’re thrilled to expand the exclusive Martha Stewart collection at Staples that includes beautiful organizational products and bright pattern finishes,” said Amy Steel Vanden-Eykel, vice president, merchandising, Staples. “The Martha Stewart brand is perfect for the moms and teens who are looking for a stylish, functional alternative to classic office supplies.” About Martha Stewart Martha Stewart is an Emmy Award-winning television show host, entrepreneur, bestselling author, and a trusted lifestyle expert and teacher.

Norfolk Southern names Marta Stewart Executive Vice President and CFO; John Rathbone to retire










Share











Norfolk, VA - Sep 20, 2013



Marta R. Stewart



John P. Rathbone




NORFOLK, VA. - Marta R. Stewart has been named executive vice president and chief financial officer for Norfolk Southern Corp. with headquarters in Norfolk, effective Nov. 1. She will report to NS President James A. Squires.
Stewart succeeds John P. Rathbone, who will retire Nov.1, after a 32-year career in the finance and administrative divisions at Norfolk Southern.
“We thank John Rathbone for his leadership, counsel, and numerous contributions that have been instrumental in building today’s Norfolk Southern,” said NS CEO Wick Moorman. ”I am confident that our company’s history of financial excellence will be in good hands with Marta Stewart.”
Stewart joined Norfolk Southern in 1983 and served in several finance positions before being named vice president and controller in 2003 and then vice president and treasurer in 2009. She holds a bachelor’s degree in accounting from The College of William & Mary and is a Certified Public Accountant.
Rathbone joined Norfolk Southern predecessor, Norfolk & Western Railway Co., in 1981. He served in several auditing positions before being named vice president and controller in 1992, senior vice president and controller in 2000, executive vice president administration in 2004, and executive vice president finance and chief financial officer in 2012. A native of Alexandria, Va., he earned a bachelor’s degree in history and English from Virginia Tech and is a Certified Public Accountant.
Norfolk Southern Corporation is one of the nation’s premier transportation companies. Its Norfolk Southern Railway Company subsidiary operates approximately 20,000 route miles in 22 states and the District of Columbia, serves every major container port in the eastern United States, and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers. Norfolk Southern operates the most extensive intermodal network in the East and is a major transporter of coal, automotive, and industrial products.

Martha Helen Stewart (née Kostyra; born August 3, 1941) is an American businesswoman, writer, and television personality. As founder of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, she has gained success through a variety of business ventures, encompassing publishing, broadcasting, merchandising, and e-commerce. She has written numerous bestselling books, is the publisher of the Martha Stewart Living magazine, and hosted two long-running syndicated television shows, Martha, which ran from 2005 to 2012, and Martha Stewart Living, which ran from 1993 to 2005.
In 2004, Stewart was convicted of charges related to the ImClone stock trading case. There was speculation that the incident would effectively end her media empire,[2][3][4] although Stewart began a comeback campaign in 2005[5] and her company returned to profitability in 2006.[6] Stewart rejoined the board of directors of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia in 2011[7] and became chairman of her namesake company again in 2012.[8] The company was acquired by Sequential Brands in 2015.[9]

Early life[edit]
Martha Stewart was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, on August 3, 1941.[10] She is the second of six children[11] born to middle-class parents, Edward "Eddie" Kostyra (1912–1979) and Martha Ruszkowski Kostyra (1914–2007), and is of entirely Polish heritage.[12][13][14] When Stewart was three years old, the family moved to Nutley.[15][16] She adopted the name "Grace" for her confirmation name.[17]
When Stewart was 10, she worked as the occasional babysitter for the children of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Gil McDougald, all players for the New York Yankees.[18] Mickey and Merlyn Mantle had four sons, for whom Stewart watched and organized birthday parties.[19] She also began modeling. At 15, Stewart was featured in a television commercial for Unilever.[20] She went on to appear in television commercials and in magazines, including one of Tareyton's "Smokers would rather fight than switch!" cigarette advertisements.[21] During her college years, she supplemented her scholarship money through "modeling jobs at $50/hour — which was a lot of money at that time".[22] Her clients included Chanel.[23]
Stewart's mother taught her how to cook and sew.[24] Later, she learned the processes of canning and preserving when she visited her grandparents' home in Buffalo, New York.[25] Her father had a passion for gardening and passed on much of his knowledge and expertise to his daughter.[26] Stewart was also active in many extracurricular activities, such as the school newspaper and the Art Club.[27]
Stewart graduated from Nutley High School.[28] She attended Barnard College, originally planning to major in chemistry, but switching to art, European History, and later architectural history. To help pay her college tuition, she did fashion modeling for Chanel.[29] During this time, she met Andrew Stewart, who finished his law degree at Yale Law School.[30] They married in 1961.[31] She returned to Barnard a year after their marriage to graduate with a double major in History and Architectural History.[29][32]
Career[edit]
In 1967, Martha Stewart began a second career as a stockbroker, her father-in-law's profession. Meanwhile, Andrew Stewart founded a publishing house and served as chief executive of several others. Andrew and Martha Stewart moved to Westport, Connecticut, where they purchased and restored the 1805 farmhouse on Turkey Hill Road that would later become the model for the TV studio of Martha Stewart Living.[33] During the project, Stewart's panache for restoring and decorating became apparent. In 1976, Stewart started a catering business in her basement with a friend from her modeling days, Norma Collier. The venture quickly became successful but soured when Collier alleged that Stewart was difficult to work with, and was also taking catering jobs on the side. Stewart soon bought her portion of the business. Stewart was also hired as the manager of a gourmet food store, the Market Basket, but after a disagreement with the owners at the mini-mall she was forced out and opened her own store.[34]




Stewart at the 2010 Time 100 Gala


Andrew had become the president of prominent New York City publisher, Harry N. Abrams, Inc. In 1977, he was responsible for releasing the English-language edition of The Secret Book of Gnomes series, by Dutch authors Wil Huygen and Rien Poortvliet, which quickly became a blockbuster success and was on The New York Times Best Seller list. He contracted Stewart's company to cater the book release party, where Stewart was introduced to Alan Mirken, head of Crown Publishing Group.[35][36]
Mirken was impressed by Stewart's talent as a chef and hostess and later contacted her to develop a cookbook, featuring recipes and photos from the parties that Stewart hosted. The result was her first book, Entertaining (December 13, 1982),[37] ghostwritten by Elizabeth Hawes.[38]
Following Entertaining's success, Stewart released many more books under the Clarkson Potter publishing imprint, including Martha Stewart's Quick Cook (1983), Martha Stewart's Hors D'oeuvres (1984), Martha Stewart's Pies & Tarts (1985), Weddings (1987), The Wedding Planner (1988), Martha Stewart's Quick Cook Menus (1988), and Martha Stewart's Christmas (1989), among others. During this time, she also authored dozens of newspaper columns, magazine articles and other pieces on homemaking, and made numerous television appearances on programs such as The Oprah Winfrey Show and Larry King Live. Andrew and Martha Stewart separated in 1987 and divorced in 1990.[11][31]
Later career[edit]
In 1990, Stewart signed with Time Publishing Ventures to develop a new magazine, Martha Stewart Living, for which Stewart would serve as editor-in-chief. The first issue was released in late 1990 with an initial rate base of 250,000. Circulation would peak in 2002 at more than 2 million copies per issue.[39] In 1993, she began a weekly half-hour service program based on her magazine, which expanded to weekdays in 1997 and later to a full hour show in 1999, with half-hour episodes on weekends. Stewart also became a frequent contributor to NBC's Today Show and later to CBS's The Early Show, and starred in several prime time holiday specials on the CBS network.[40]
On the cover of the May 1995 issue, New York Magazine declared her "the definitive American woman of our time".[41]
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia[edit]
In September 1997, with the assistance of business partner Sharon Patrick, Stewart was able to secure funding to purchase the various television, print, and merchandising ventures related to the Martha Stewart brand, and consolidate them into a new company, named Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Stewart served as chairman, president, and CEO of the new company and Patrick became Chief Operations Officer. By organizing all of the brand's assets under one roof, Stewart felt she could promote synergy and have greater control of the brand's direction through the business's activities. That same month, Stewart announced in Martha Stewart Living the launch of a companion website and a catalogue business, called Martha by Mail. The company also has a direct-to-consumer floral business[permanent dead link].
On October 19, 1999, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MSO. The initial public offering was set at $18 per share, and rallied to $38 by the end of trading, making Stewart a billionaire on paper and the first female, self-made billionaire in the US.[42] The stock price slowly went down to $16 per share by February 2002. Stewart was then and continues to be the majority shareholder, commanding 96% control of voting power in the company.
Stock trading case and conviction[edit]
Main article: ImClone stock trading case
According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Stewart avoided a loss of $45,673 by selling all 3,928 shares of her ImClone Systems stock on December 27, 2001, after receiving material, nonpublic information from Peter Bacanovic, who was Stewart's broker at Merrill Lynch. The day following her sale, the stock value fell 16%.[43]
In the months that followed, Stewart drew heavy media scrutiny, including a Newsweek cover headlined "Martha's Mess".[44] Notably, on June 25, 2002, CBS anchor Jane Clayson grilled Stewart on the air about ImClone during her regular segment on The Early Show. Stewart continued chopping cabbage and responded: "I want to focus on my salad."[45] On October 3, 2002, Stewart resigned her position, held for four months, on the board of directors of the New York Stock Exchange, following a deal prosecutors had made with Douglas Faneuil, an assistant to Bacanovic.[46]
On June 4, 2003, Stewart was indicted by the government on nine counts, including charges of securities fraud and obstruction of justice. Stewart voluntarily stepped down as CEO and Chairwoman of MSLO, but stayed on as chief creative officer. She went on trial in January 2004. Prosecutors showed that Bacanovic had ordered his assistant to tell Stewart that the CEO of ImClone, Samuel D. Waksal, was selling all his shares in advance of an adverse Food and Drug Administration ruling. The FDA action was expected to cause ImClone shares to decline.[47]
Sentence[edit]
After a highly publicized six-week jury trial, Stewart was found guilty in March 2004 of felony charges of conspiracy, obstruction of an agency proceeding, and making false statements to federal investigators, and was sentenced in July 2004 to serve a five-month term in a federal correctional facility and a two-year period of supervised release (to include five months of electronic monitoring).[47]
Bacanovic and Waksal were also convicted of federal charges and sentenced to prison terms.[48][49] Stewart also paid a fine of $30,000.[50]
In August 2006, the SEC announced that it had agreed to settle the related civil case against Stewart. Under the settlement, Stewart agreed to disgorge $58,062 (including interest from the losses she avoided), as well as a civil penalty of three times the loss avoided, or $137,019. She also agreed to a five-year ban from serving as a director, CEO, CFO, or any other officer role responsible for preparing, auditing, or disclosing financial results of any public company.[51] In June 2008, the UK Border Agency refused to grant her a visa to enter the United Kingdom because of her criminal conviction for obstructing justice. She had been planning to speak at the Royal Academy on fashion and leisure industry matters.[52]
Incarceration[edit]




Federal Prison Camp, Alderson, where Stewart was confined


Stewart wanted to go to prison in Connecticut or Florida. She did not want to serve at Federal Prison Camp, Alderson in West Virginia, due to its remote location; in 2004, her lawyer said that the remoteness would make it difficult for Stewart's then-90-year-old mother to visit.[53] Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum recommended to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) that Stewart be given her first choice, Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury, or her second choice, Federal Correctional Complex, Coleman.[54] However, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice said that the BOP would not send her to FCI Danbury because the news media could too easily access the facility. The bureau could not send Stewart to FCC Coleman because of complications from Hurricane Ivan; the Coleman complex filled because inmates from Federal Correctional Institution, Marianna were moved to Coleman. Therefore, the Federal Bureau of Prisons assigned Stewart to Alderson. The spokesperson said that he was concerned that the assignment to Alderson could be perceived as being vindictive.[53] Stewart's daughter, Alexis, said that she believed that the BOP "may have made a point of sending her far away".[55]
Cedarbaum ordered Stewart to report to her prison sentence before 2:00 p.m. on October 8, 2004.[54] By September 27, 2004, Stewart received the BOP ID 55170-054.[54] At about 6:15 a.m. on October 8, 2004,[56] she reported to FPC Alderson.[57] Stewart said that her prison nickname was "M. Diddy".[58] While in confinement, she took a job and became an informal liaison between the administration and her fellow inmates. The People special, Scandals! That Rocked America, stated "Some expected America's goddess of domestic perfection to fall into terminal despair. Instead, with the drive that would make her a billionaire, Stewart took her lemon of a sentence and made lemonade. Heck, she made a lemon soufflé."[59] Stewart was released from FPC Alderson at 12:30 a.m. on March 4, 2005.[60] She was then placed in a two-year term of supervised release; during five of those months, she was placed in home confinement with electronic monitoring.[56][60] Stewart served her home confinement at her residence in Bedford, New York.[58] She was allowed to leave her house for 48 hours per week for work-related visits.[58] After her home confinement ended, but while her supervised release continued, she was required to remain employed and not to associate with people with criminal records. In addition, during the supervised release, she was required to receive permission from federal officials if she was going to leave the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.[61]
Current projects[edit]




Stewart at the Metropolitan Opera opening (2008)


Following her release from prison in March 2005, Stewart launched a highly publicized comeback and was once again involved in Martha Stewart Living. Offerings of her company's Martha Stewart Everyday line at Kmart were expanded to include a new line of ready-made home furnishings, and its mass market interior paint line became available at the larger Sears stores. However, the most heavily promoted aspect of her comeback was in television. Stewart returned to daytime television with The Martha Stewart Show and appeared in an adapted version of The Apprentice (called The Apprentice: Martha Stewart). Both shows premiered in September 2005, and both were produced by Mark Burnett. Her prime time Apprentice spin-off received poor ratings, which some[who?] attribute to popular dislike for the opportunistic tone of the network's massive promotional campaign and to NBC's slotting the show up against the hit drama Lost. The Apprentice: Martha Stewart was not renewed for a second season.[62]
In October 2005, Stewart released a new book, titled The Martha Rules, on starting and managing a new business,[63] and a month later, her company released Martha Stewart Baking Handbook.[64] In October 2006, Martha Stewart's Homekeeping Handbook, a reference book about looking after a house, was published by Clarkson Potter. She also is a regular contributor of cooking, crafts, and gardening segments on NBC's Today show. Stewart's daily talk show was nominated in six categories for the 33rd Daytime Emmy Awards in 2006, including Best Host and Best Show.




Stewart in 2008


MSLO launched a line of houses that carry her name to be built by KB Home, initially in Cary, North Carolina and ultimately in various other locations nationwide. The first homes, which were inspired by Stewart's homes in New York and Mount Desert Island in Maine, were completed in early 2006. Ultimately, 650 homes are planned, with prices from the low $200,000s to mid-$400,000s. A line of paper-based crafts for EK Success is also in development. In September 2007, she launched an upscale line of homewares for Macy's, which was the largest brand launch in Macy's history. Appearing in commercials for the line, Stewart stated she has designed more than 2,000 items exclusively for Macy's. The line includes bedding, bath, cookware, and dinnerware. In addition to television and merchandising, MSLO launched a 24-hour satellite radio channel with Sirius in November 2005, on which Stewart currently hosts a weekly call-in show.
Stewart also made a special appearance on the comedy-drama series Ugly Betty, in the November 16, 2006, episode "Four Thanksgivings and a Funeral", in which she gave her friend Wilhelmina Slater (played by Vanessa Williams) tips on how to prepare a turkey.[65] Justin Suarez (played by Mark Indelicato) is a fan of Stewart.
In July 2006, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced a multi-year agreement with FLOR, Inc., the eco-friendly manufacturer of high-style modular floor coverings, to manufacture and market a new line of Martha Stewart-branded carpet tiles. The Martha Stewart Floor Designs by FLOR[66] line debuted in 2007 with the distinctive design and color palette associated with the Martha Stewart brand. The agreement with FLOR was part of the Martha Stewart organization's growing home furnishings program, which includes a wide range of products such as furniture with Bernhardt, wall color with Lowe's, and floor coverings with FLOR.
On September 14, 2007, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced that it had signed a partnership with E & J Gallo Winery to produce a wine brand with label Martha Stewart Vintage (for sale in six cities, in January 2008, at $15). The 15,000 cases to be sold included: 2006 Sonoma County Chardonnay, 2005 Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon, and 2006 Sonoma County Merlot (for Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, North Carolina, Denver, Phoenix, and Portland, Oregon). Martha Stewart also signed a contract with Costco to offer frozen and fresh food, under the Kirkland Signature label.[67]
In July 2008, craft items under the names "Martha Stewart Celebrate" and "Martha Stewart Create", two divisions of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, premiered in Wal-Mart stores. The deal came about, in part, due to the closing of more than 600 K-Mart stores in the U.S.
In a move from broadcast television to cable, on January 26, 2010, Hallmark Channel and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced a multi-year strategic partnership. Her hour-long daytime television series, Martha, formerly The Martha Stewart Show, moved to the Hallmark Channel on September 13, 2010. It aired on Hallmark for two seasons, before cancellation in early 2012, with the final episode airing on May 11, 2012.[68][69]
New York Magazine reported in 2011 that Martha Stewart Living had only made a profit in one of the previous eight years.[17] That same year, Stewart debuted a new 30-minute show, Martha Bakes, on the Hallmark Channel.[70]
Stewart made another foray into acting with a debut on the long-running NBC legal drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. She played a private school headmistress in the episode entitled "Learning Curve" (airdate April 2012).[71]
A new television series, Martha Stewart's Cooking School, debuted on PBS in October 2012. Each weekly, 30-minute episode covers cooking techniques and basics.[72][73] It is based on her eponymous book.[74]
In the fall of 2016, VH1 premiered a new show featuring Martha and her friend Snoop Dogg called Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party, featuring games, recipes, and musical guests.[75] Snoop Dogg and Stewart also later starred together in a Super Bowl commercial for T-Mobile during Super Bowl LI in February 2017.[76]
Marley Spoon is a new project of packaged and home-delivered ingredients and recipes for preparation at home.[77][78]
Personal life[edit]




Alexis Stewart (left) and Martha Stewart (right), in September 2008


In 1961, she married Andrew Stewart, then a student at Yale Law School. Their only child, a daughter named Alexis, was born in 1965. The couple separated in 1987 and divorced in 1990.[11][31] Subsequently, Stewart dated Sir Anthony Hopkins but ended the relationship after she saw The Silence of the Lambs. She stated she was unable to avoid associating Hopkins with the character of Hannibal Lecter.[79][80]
Stewart reportedly dated billionaire Charles Simonyi, who was an early employee of Microsoft and head of their software group, on and off for 15 years. She featured footage of him as a space tourist aboard Soyuz on her television show in 2007. They broke up around February 2008.[81]
Stewart is an avid animal lover. Her pets include champion show Chow Chow dogs, French Bulldogs, Himalayan cats, and Friesian horses, including her dark horse Rutger.[82] Stewart also created a video[83] on behalf of fur-bearing animals after being approached by PETA while in jail. Stewart stated, "I used to wear real fur, but, like many others, I had a change of heart when I learned what actually happens to the animals".[84] Stewart filmed a public service announcement on behalf of the farm animal welfare organization Farm Sanctuary.[85]
Martha Kostyra, Stewart's mother, died at the age of 93 on November 16, 2007.[86] Kostyra, also called "Big Martha" by her family, had appeared on Martha Stewart Living numerous times.[86]
Stewart currently resides in Katonah, a hamlet of the town of Bedford, New York. She also maintains a 35,000-square-foot (3,300 m2) residence on Mount Desert Island in Seal Harbor, Maine, known as 'Skylands', the former summer estate of automobile designer and tycoon Edsel Ford, with gardens designed by renowned landscape architect Jens Jensen (1922).[87][88]
She claims to have been struck by lightning three times.[89]
Recognition[edit]
In 2011, Stewart was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.[90]

Martha Helen Stewart (née Kostyra; born August 3, 1941) is an American businesswoman, writer, and television personality. As founder of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, she has gained success through a variety of business ventures, encompassing publishing, broadcasting, merchandising, and e-commerce. She has written numerous bestselling books, is the publisher of the Martha Stewart Living magazine, and hosted two long-running syndicated television shows, Martha, which ran from 2005 to 2012, and Martha Stewart Living, which ran from 1993 to 2005.
In 2004, Stewart was convicted of charges related to the ImClone stock trading case. There was speculation that the incident would effectively end her media empire,[2][3][4] although Stewart began a comeback campaign in 2005[5] and her company returned to profitability in 2006.[6] Stewart rejoined the board of directors of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia in 2011[7] and became chairman of her namesake company again in 2012.[8] The company was acquired by Sequential Brands in 2015.[9]

Early life[edit]
Martha Stewart was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, on August 3, 1941.[10] She is the second of six children[11] born to middle-class parents, Edward "Eddie" Kostyra (1912–1979) and Martha Ruszkowski Kostyra (1914–2007), and is of entirely Polish heritage.[12][13][14] When Stewart was three years old, the family moved to Nutley.[15][16] She adopted the name "Grace" for her confirmation name.[17]
When Stewart was 10, she worked as the occasional babysitter for the children of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Gil McDougald, all players for the New York Yankees.[18] Mickey and Merlyn Mantle had four sons, for whom Stewart watched and organized birthday parties.[19] She also began modeling. At 15, Stewart was featured in a television commercial for Unilever.[20] She went on to appear in television commercials and in magazines, including one of Tareyton's "Smokers would rather fight than switch!" cigarette advertisements.[21] During her college years, she supplemented her scholarship money through "modeling jobs at $50/hour — which was a lot of money at that time".[22] Her clients included Chanel.[23]
Stewart's mother taught her how to cook and sew.[24] Later, she learned the processes of canning and preserving when she visited her grandparents' home in Buffalo, New York.[25] Her father had a passion for gardening and passed on much of his knowledge and expertise to his daughter.[26] Stewart was also active in many extracurricular activities, such as the school newspaper and the Art Club.[27]
Stewart graduated from Nutley High School.[28] She attended Barnard College, originally planning to major in chemistry, but switching to art, European History, and later architectural history. To help pay her college tuition, she did fashion modeling for Chanel.[29] During this time, she met Andrew Stewart, who finished his law degree at Yale Law School.[30] They married in 1961.[31] She returned to Barnard a year after their marriage to graduate with a double major in History and Architectural History.[29][32]
Career[edit]
In 1967, Martha Stewart began a second career as a stockbroker, her father-in-law's profession. Meanwhile, Andrew Stewart founded a publishing house and served as chief executive of several others. Andrew and Martha Stewart moved to Westport, Connecticut, where they purchased and restored the 1805 farmhouse on Turkey Hill Road that would later become the model for the TV studio of Martha Stewart Living.[33] During the project, Stewart's panache for restoring and decorating became apparent. In 1976, Stewart started a catering business in her basement with a friend from her modeling days, Norma Collier. The venture quickly became successful but soured when Collier alleged that Stewart was difficult to work with, and was also taking catering jobs on the side. Stewart soon bought her portion of the business. Stewart was also hired as the manager of a gourmet food store, the Market Basket, but after a disagreement with the owners at the mini-mall she was forced out and opened her own store.[34]




Stewart at the 2010 Time 100 Gala


Andrew had become the president of prominent New York City publisher, Harry N. Abrams, Inc. In 1977, he was responsible for releasing the English-language edition of The Secret Book of Gnomes series, by Dutch authors Wil Huygen and Rien Poortvliet, which quickly became a blockbuster success and was on The New York Times Best Seller list. He contracted Stewart's company to cater the book release party, where Stewart was introduced to Alan Mirken, head of Crown Publishing Group.[35][36]
Mirken was impressed by Stewart's talent as a chef and hostess and later contacted her to develop a cookbook, featuring recipes and photos from the parties that Stewart hosted. The result was her first book, Entertaining (December 13, 1982),[37] ghostwritten by Elizabeth Hawes.[38]
Following Entertaining's success, Stewart released many more books under the Clarkson Potter publishing imprint, including Martha Stewart's Quick Cook (1983), Martha Stewart's Hors D'oeuvres (1984), Martha Stewart's Pies & Tarts (1985), Weddings (1987), The Wedding Planner (1988), Martha Stewart's Quick Cook Menus (1988), and Martha Stewart's Christmas (1989), among others. During this time, she also authored dozens of newspaper columns, magazine articles and other pieces on homemaking, and made numerous television appearances on programs such as The Oprah Winfrey Show and Larry King Live. Andrew and Martha Stewart separated in 1987 and divorced in 1990.[11][31]
Later career[edit]
In 1990, Stewart signed with Time Publishing Ventures to develop a new magazine, Martha Stewart Living, for which Stewart would serve as editor-in-chief. The first issue was released in late 1990 with an initial rate base of 250,000. Circulation would peak in 2002 at more than 2 million copies per issue.[39] In 1993, she began a weekly half-hour service program based on her magazine, which expanded to weekdays in 1997 and later to a full hour show in 1999, with half-hour episodes on weekends. Stewart also became a frequent contributor to NBC's Today Show and later to CBS's The Early Show, and starred in several prime time holiday specials on the CBS network.[40]
On the cover of the May 1995 issue, New York Magazine declared her "the definitive American woman of our time".[41]
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia[edit]
In September 1997, with the assistance of business partner Sharon Patrick, Stewart was able to secure funding to purchase the various television, print, and merchandising ventures related to the Martha Stewart brand, and consolidate them into a new company, named Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Stewart served as chairman, president, and CEO of the new company and Patrick became Chief Operations Officer. By organizing all of the brand's assets under one roof, Stewart felt she could promote synergy and have greater control of the brand's direction through the business's activities. That same month, Stewart announced in Martha Stewart Living the launch of a companion website and a catalogue business, called Martha by Mail. The company also has a direct-to-consumer floral business[permanent dead link].
On October 19, 1999, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MSO. The initial public offering was set at $18 per share, and rallied to $38 by the end of trading, making Stewart a billionaire on paper and the first female, self-made billionaire in the US.[42] The stock price slowly went down to $16 per share by February 2002. Stewart was then and continues to be the majority shareholder, commanding 96% control of voting power in the company.
Stock trading case and conviction[edit]
Main article: ImClone stock trading case
According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Stewart avoided a loss of $45,673 by selling all 3,928 shares of her ImClone Systems stock on December 27, 2001, after receiving material, nonpublic information from Peter Bacanovic, who was Stewart's broker at Merrill Lynch. The day following her sale, the stock value fell 16%.[43]
In the months that followed, Stewart drew heavy media scrutiny, including a Newsweek cover headlined "Martha's Mess".[44] Notably, on June 25, 2002, CBS anchor Jane Clayson grilled Stewart on the air about ImClone during her regular segment on The Early Show. Stewart continued chopping cabbage and responded: "I want to focus on my salad."[45] On October 3, 2002, Stewart resigned her position, held for four months, on the board of directors of the New York Stock Exchange, following a deal prosecutors had made with Douglas Faneuil, an assistant to Bacanovic.[46]
On June 4, 2003, Stewart was indicted by the government on nine counts, including charges of securities fraud and obstruction of justice. Stewart voluntarily stepped down as CEO and Chairwoman of MSLO, but stayed on as chief creative officer. She went on trial in January 2004. Prosecutors showed that Bacanovic had ordered his assistant to tell Stewart that the CEO of ImClone, Samuel D. Waksal, was selling all his shares in advance of an adverse Food and Drug Administration ruling. The FDA action was expected to cause ImClone shares to decline.[47]
Sentence[edit]
After a highly publicized six-week jury trial, Stewart was found guilty in March 2004 of felony charges of conspiracy, obstruction of an agency proceeding, and making false statements to federal investigators, and was sentenced in July 2004 to serve a five-month term in a federal correctional facility and a two-year period of supervised release (to include five months of electronic monitoring).[47]
Bacanovic and Waksal were also convicted of federal charges and sentenced to prison terms.[48][49] Stewart also paid a fine of $30,000.[50]
In August 2006, the SEC announced that it had agreed to settle the related civil case against Stewart. Under the settlement, Stewart agreed to disgorge $58,062 (including interest from the losses she avoided), as well as a civil penalty of three times the loss avoided, or $137,019. She also agreed to a five-year ban from serving as a director, CEO, CFO, or any other officer role responsible for preparing, auditing, or disclosing financial results of any public company.[51] In June 2008, the UK Border Agency refused to grant her a visa to enter the United Kingdom because of her criminal conviction for obstructing justice. She had been planning to speak at the Royal Academy on fashion and leisure industry matters.[52]
Incarceration[edit]




Federal Prison Camp, Alderson, where Stewart was confined


Stewart wanted to go to prison in Connecticut or Florida. She did not want to serve at Federal Prison Camp, Alderson in West Virginia, due to its remote location; in 2004, her lawyer said that the remoteness would make it difficult for Stewart's then-90-year-old mother to visit.[53] Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum recommended to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) that Stewart be given her first choice, Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury, or her second choice, Federal Correctional Complex, Coleman.[54] However, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice said that the BOP would not send her to FCI Danbury because the news media could too easily access the facility. The bureau could not send Stewart to FCC Coleman because of complications from Hurricane Ivan; the Coleman complex filled because inmates from Federal Correctional Institution, Marianna were moved to Coleman. Therefore, the Federal Bureau of Prisons assigned Stewart to Alderson. The spokesperson said that he was concerned that the assignment to Alderson could be perceived as being vindictive.[53] Stewart's daughter, Alexis, said that she believed that the BOP "may have made a point of sending her far away".[55]
Cedarbaum ordered Stewart to report to her prison sentence before 2:00 p.m. on October 8, 2004.[54] By September 27, 2004, Stewart received the BOP ID 55170-054.[54] At about 6:15 a.m. on October 8, 2004,[56] she reported to FPC Alderson.[57] Stewart said that her prison nickname was "M. Diddy".[58] While in confinement, she took a job and became an informal liaison between the administration and her fellow inmates. The People special, Scandals! That Rocked America, stated "Some expected America's goddess of domestic perfection to fall into terminal despair. Instead, with the drive that would make her a billionaire, Stewart took her lemon of a sentence and made lemonade. Heck, she made a lemon soufflé."[59] Stewart was released from FPC Alderson at 12:30 a.m. on March 4, 2005.[60] She was then placed in a two-year term of supervised release; during five of those months, she was placed in home confinement with electronic monitoring.[56][60] Stewart served her home confinement at her residence in Bedford, New York.[58] She was allowed to leave her house for 48 hours per week for work-related visits.[58] After her home confinement ended, but while her supervised release continued, she was required to remain employed and not to associate with people with criminal records. In addition, during the supervised release, she was required to receive permission from federal officials if she was going to leave the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.[61]
Current projects[edit]




Stewart at the Metropolitan Opera opening (2008)


Following her release from prison in March 2005, Stewart launched a highly publicized comeback and was once again involved in Martha Stewart Living. Offerings of her company's Martha Stewart Everyday line at Kmart were expanded to include a new line of ready-made home furnishings, and its mass market interior paint line became available at the larger Sears stores. However, the most heavily promoted aspect of her comeback was in television. Stewart returned to daytime television with The Martha Stewart Show and appeared in an adapted version of The Apprentice (called The Apprentice: Martha Stewart). Both shows premiered in September 2005, and both were produced by Mark Burnett. Her prime time Apprentice spin-off received poor ratings, which some[who?] attribute to popular dislike for the opportunistic tone of the network's massive promotional campaign and to NBC's slotting the show up against the hit drama Lost. The Apprentice: Martha Stewart was not renewed for a second season.[62]
In October 2005, Stewart released a new book, titled The Martha Rules, on starting and managing a new business,[63] and a month later, her company released Martha Stewart Baking Handbook.[64] In October 2006, Martha Stewart's Homekeeping Handbook, a reference book about looking after a house, was published by Clarkson Potter. She also is a regular contributor of cooking, crafts, and gardening segments on NBC's Today show. Stewart's daily talk show was nominated in six categories for the 33rd Daytime Emmy Awards in 2006, including Best Host and Best Show.




Stewart in 2008


MSLO launched a line of houses that carry her name to be built by KB Home, initially in Cary, North Carolina and ultimately in various other locations nationwide. The first homes, which were inspired by Stewart's homes in New York and Mount Desert Island in Maine, were completed in early 2006. Ultimately, 650 homes are planned, with prices from the low $200,000s to mid-$400,000s. A line of paper-based crafts for EK Success is also in development. In September 2007, she launched an upscale line of homewares for Macy's, which was the largest brand launch in Macy's history. Appearing in commercials for the line, Stewart stated she has designed more than 2,000 items exclusively for Macy's. The line includes bedding, bath, cookware, and dinnerware. In addition to television and merchandising, MSLO launched a 24-hour satellite radio channel with Sirius in November 2005, on which Stewart currently hosts a weekly call-in show.
Stewart also made a special appearance on the comedy-drama series Ugly Betty, in the November 16, 2006, episode "Four Thanksgivings and a Funeral", in which she gave her friend Wilhelmina Slater (played by Vanessa Williams) tips on how to prepare a turkey.[65] Justin Suarez (played by Mark Indelicato) is a fan of Stewart.
In July 2006, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced a multi-year agreement with FLOR, Inc., the eco-friendly manufacturer of high-style modular floor coverings, to manufacture and market a new line of Martha Stewart-branded carpet tiles. The Martha Stewart Floor Designs by FLOR[66] line debuted in 2007 with the distinctive design and color palette associated with the Martha Stewart brand. The agreement with FLOR was part of the Martha Stewart organization's growing home furnishings program, which includes a wide range of products such as furniture with Bernhardt, wall color with Lowe's, and floor coverings with FLOR.
On September 14, 2007, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced that it had signed a partnership with E & J Gallo Winery to produce a wine brand with label Martha Stewart Vintage (for sale in six cities, in January 2008, at $15). The 15,000 cases to be sold included: 2006 Sonoma County Chardonnay, 2005 Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon, and 2006 Sonoma County Merlot (for Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, North Carolina, Denver, Phoenix, and Portland, Oregon). Martha Stewart also signed a contract with Costco to offer frozen and fresh food, under the Kirkland Signature label.[67]
In July 2008, craft items under the names "Martha Stewart Celebrate" and "Martha Stewart Create", two divisions of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, premiered in Wal-Mart stores. The deal came about, in part, due to the closing of more than 600 K-Mart stores in the U.S.
In a move from broadcast television to cable, on January 26, 2010, Hallmark Channel and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced a multi-year strategic partnership. Her hour-long daytime television series, Martha, formerly The Martha Stewart Show, moved to the Hallmark Channel on September 13, 2010. It aired on Hallmark for two seasons, before cancellation in early 2012, with the final episode airing on May 11, 2012.[68][69]
New York Magazine reported in 2011 that Martha Stewart Living had only made a profit in one of the previous eight years.[17] That same year, Stewart debuted a new 30-minute show, Martha Bakes, on the Hallmark Channel.[70]
Stewart made another foray into acting with a debut on the long-running NBC legal drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. She played a private school headmistress in the episode entitled "Learning Curve" (airdate April 2012).[71]
A new television series, Martha Stewart's Cooking School, debuted on PBS in October 2012. Each weekly, 30-minute episode covers cooking techniques and basics.[72][73] It is based on her eponymous book.[74]
In the fall of 2016, VH1 premiered a new show featuring Martha and her friend Snoop Dogg called Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party, featuring games, recipes, and musical guests.[75] Snoop Dogg and Stewart also later starred together in a Super Bowl commercial for T-Mobile during Super Bowl LI in February 2017.[76]
Marley Spoon is a new project of packaged and home-delivered ingredients and recipes for preparation at home.[77][78]
Personal life[edit]




Alexis Stewart (left) and Martha Stewart (right), in September 2008


In 1961, she married Andrew Stewart, then a student at Yale Law School. Their only child, a daughter named Alexis, was born in 1965. The couple separated in 1987 and divorced in 1990.[11][31] Subsequently, Stewart dated Sir Anthony Hopkins but ended the relationship after she saw The Silence of the Lambs. She stated she was unable to avoid associating Hopkins with the character of Hannibal Lecter.[79][80]
Stewart reportedly dated billionaire Charles Simonyi, who was an early employee of Microsoft and head of their software group, on and off for 15 years. She featured footage of him as a space tourist aboard Soyuz on her television show in 2007. They broke up around February 2008.[81]
Stewart is an avid animal lover. Her pets include champion show Chow Chow dogs, French Bulldogs, Himalayan cats, and Friesian horses, including her dark horse Rutger.[82] Stewart also created a video[83] on behalf of fur-bearing animals after being approached by PETA while in jail. Stewart stated, "I used to wear real fur, but, like many others, I had a change of heart when I learned what actually happens to the animals".[84] Stewart filmed a public service announcement on behalf of the farm animal welfare organization Farm Sanctuary.[85]
Martha Kostyra, Stewart's mother, died at the age of 93 on November 16, 2007.[86] Kostyra, also called "Big Martha" by her family, had appeared on Martha Stewart Living numerous times.[86]
Stewart currently resides in Katonah, a hamlet of the town of Bedford, New York. She also maintains a 35,000-square-foot (3,300 m2) residence on Mount Desert Island in Seal Harbor, Maine, known as 'Skylands', the former summer estate of automobile designer and tycoon Edsel Ford, with gardens designed by renowned landscape architect Jens Jensen (1922).[87][88]
She claims to have been struck by lightning three times.[89]
Recognition[edit]
In 2011, Stewart was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.[90]

Martha Helen Stewart (née Kostyra; born August 3, 1941) is an American businesswoman, writer, and television personality. As founder of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, she has gained success through a variety of business ventures, encompassing publishing, broadcasting, merchandising, and e-commerce. She has written numerous bestselling books, is the publisher of the Martha Stewart Living magazine, and hosted two long-running syndicated television shows, Martha, which ran from 2005 to 2012, and Martha Stewart Living, which ran from 1993 to 2005.
In 2004, Stewart was convicted of charges related to the ImClone stock trading case. There was speculation that the incident would effectively end her media empire,[2][3][4] although Stewart began a comeback campaign in 2005[5] and her company returned to profitability in 2006.[6] Stewart rejoined the board of directors of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia in 2011[7] and became chairman of her namesake company again in 2012.[8] The company was acquired by Sequential Brands in 2015.[9]

Early life[edit]
Martha Stewart was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, on August 3, 1941.[10] She is the second of six children[11] born to middle-class parents, Edward "Eddie" Kostyra (1912–1979) and Martha Ruszkowski Kostyra (1914–2007), and is of entirely Polish heritage.[12][13][14] When Stewart was three years old, the family moved to Nutley.[15][16] She adopted the name "Grace" for her confirmation name.[17]
When Stewart was 10, she worked as the occasional babysitter for the children of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Gil McDougald, all players for the New York Yankees.[18] Mickey and Merlyn Mantle had four sons, for whom Stewart watched and organized birthday parties.[19] She also began modeling. At 15, Stewart was featured in a television commercial for Unilever.[20] She went on to appear in television commercials and in magazines, including one of Tareyton's "Smokers would rather fight than switch!" cigarette advertisements.[21] During her college years, she supplemented her scholarship money through "modeling jobs at $50/hour — which was a lot of money at that time".[22] Her clients included Chanel.[23]
Stewart's mother taught her how to cook and sew.[24] Later, she learned the processes of canning and preserving when she visited her grandparents' home in Buffalo, New York.[25] Her father had a passion for gardening and passed on much of his knowledge and expertise to his daughter.[26] Stewart was also active in many extracurricular activities, such as the school newspaper and the Art Club.[27]
Stewart graduated from Nutley High School.[28] She attended Barnard College, originally planning to major in chemistry, but switching to art, European History, and later architectural history. To help pay her college tuition, she did fashion modeling for Chanel.[29] During this time, she met Andrew Stewart, who finished his law degree at Yale Law School.[30] They married in 1961.[31] She returned to Barnard a year after their marriage to graduate with a double major in History and Architectural History.[29][32]
Career[edit]
In 1967, Martha Stewart began a second career as a stockbroker, her father-in-law's profession. Meanwhile, Andrew Stewart founded a publishing house and served as chief executive of several others. Andrew and Martha Stewart moved to Westport, Connecticut, where they purchased and restored the 1805 farmhouse on Turkey Hill Road that would later become the model for the TV studio of Martha Stewart Living.[33] During the project, Stewart's panache for restoring and decorating became apparent. In 1976, Stewart started a catering business in her basement with a friend from her modeling days, Norma Collier. The venture quickly became successful but soured when Collier alleged that Stewart was difficult to work with, and was also taking catering jobs on the side. Stewart soon bought her portion of the business. Stewart was also hired as the manager of a gourmet food store, the Market Basket, but after a disagreement with the owners at the mini-mall she was forced out and opened her own store.[34]




Stewart at the 2010 Time 100 Gala


Andrew had become the president of prominent New York City publisher, Harry N. Abrams, Inc. In 1977, he was responsible for releasing the English-language edition of The Secret Book of Gnomes series, by Dutch authors Wil Huygen and Rien Poortvliet, which quickly became a blockbuster success and was on The New York Times Best Seller list. He contracted Stewart's company to cater the book release party, where Stewart was introduced to Alan Mirken, head of Crown Publishing Group.[35][36]
Mirken was impressed by Stewart's talent as a chef and hostess and later contacted her to develop a cookbook, featuring recipes and photos from the parties that Stewart hosted. The result was her first book, Entertaining (December 13, 1982),[37] ghostwritten by Elizabeth Hawes.[38]
Following Entertaining's success, Stewart released many more books under the Clarkson Potter publishing imprint, including Martha Stewart's Quick Cook (1983), Martha Stewart's Hors D'oeuvres (1984), Martha Stewart's Pies & Tarts (1985), Weddings (1987), The Wedding Planner (1988), Martha Stewart's Quick Cook Menus (1988), and Martha Stewart's Christmas (1989), among others. During this time, she also authored dozens of newspaper columns, magazine articles and other pieces on homemaking, and made numerous television appearances on programs such as The Oprah Winfrey Show and Larry King Live. Andrew and Martha Stewart separated in 1987 and divorced in 1990.[11][31]
Later career[edit]
In 1990, Stewart signed with Time Publishing Ventures to develop a new magazine, Martha Stewart Living, for which Stewart would serve as editor-in-chief. The first issue was released in late 1990 with an initial rate base of 250,000. Circulation would peak in 2002 at more than 2 million copies per issue.[39] In 1993, she began a weekly half-hour service program based on her magazine, which expanded to weekdays in 1997 and later to a full hour show in 1999, with half-hour episodes on weekends. Stewart also became a frequent contributor to NBC's Today Show and later to CBS's The Early Show, and starred in several prime time holiday specials on the CBS network.[40]
On the cover of the May 1995 issue, New York Magazine declared her "the definitive American woman of our time".[41]
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia[edit]
In September 1997, with the assistance of business partner Sharon Patrick, Stewart was able to secure funding to purchase the various television, print, and merchandising ventures related to the Martha Stewart brand, and consolidate them into a new company, named Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Stewart served as chairman, president, and CEO of the new company and Patrick became Chief Operations Officer. By organizing all of the brand's assets under one roof, Stewart felt she could promote synergy and have greater control of the brand's direction through the business's activities. That same month, Stewart announced in Martha Stewart Living the launch of a companion website and a catalogue business, called Martha by Mail. The company also has a direct-to-consumer floral business[permanent dead link].
On October 19, 1999, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MSO. The initial public offering was set at $18 per share, and rallied to $38 by the end of trading, making Stewart a billionaire on paper and the first female, self-made billionaire in the US.[42] The stock price slowly went down to $16 per share by February 2002. Stewart was then and continues to be the majority shareholder, commanding 96% control of voting power in the company.
Stock trading case and conviction[edit]
Main article: ImClone stock trading case
According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Stewart avoided a loss of $45,673 by selling all 3,928 shares of her ImClone Systems stock on December 27, 2001, after receiving material, nonpublic information from Peter Bacanovic, who was Stewart's broker at Merrill Lynch. The day following her sale, the stock value fell 16%.[43]
In the months that followed, Stewart drew heavy media scrutiny, including a Newsweek cover headlined "Martha's Mess".[44] Notably, on June 25, 2002, CBS anchor Jane Clayson grilled Stewart on the air about ImClone during her regular segment on The Early Show. Stewart continued chopping cabbage and responded: "I want to focus on my salad."[45] On October 3, 2002, Stewart resigned her position, held for four months, on the board of directors of the New York Stock Exchange, following a deal prosecutors had made with Douglas Faneuil, an assistant to Bacanovic.[46]
On June 4, 2003, Stewart was indicted by the government on nine counts, including charges of securities fraud and obstruction of justice. Stewart voluntarily stepped down as CEO and Chairwoman of MSLO, but stayed on as chief creative officer. She went on trial in January 2004. Prosecutors showed that Bacanovic had ordered his assistant to tell Stewart that the CEO of ImClone, Samuel D. Waksal, was selling all his shares in advance of an adverse Food and Drug Administration ruling. The FDA action was expected to cause ImClone shares to decline.[47]
Sentence[edit]
After a highly publicized six-week jury trial, Stewart was found guilty in March 2004 of felony charges of conspiracy, obstruction of an agency proceeding, and making false statements to federal investigators, and was sentenced in July 2004 to serve a five-month term in a federal correctional facility and a two-year period of supervised release (to include five months of electronic monitoring).[47]
Bacanovic and Waksal were also convicted of federal charges and sentenced to prison terms.[48][49] Stewart also paid a fine of $30,000.[50]
In August 2006, the SEC announced that it had agreed to settle the related civil case against Stewart. Under the settlement, Stewart agreed to disgorge $58,062 (including interest from the losses she avoided), as well as a civil penalty of three times the loss avoided, or $137,019. She also agreed to a five-year ban from serving as a director, CEO, CFO, or any other officer role responsible for preparing, auditing, or disclosing financial results of any public company.[51] In June 2008, the UK Border Agency refused to grant her a visa to enter the United Kingdom because of her criminal conviction for obstructing justice. She had been planning to speak at the Royal Academy on fashion and leisure industry matters.[52]
Incarceration[edit]




Federal Prison Camp, Alderson, where Stewart was confined


Stewart wanted to go to prison in Connecticut or Florida. She did not want to serve at Federal Prison Camp, Alderson in West Virginia, due to its remote location; in 2004, her lawyer said that the remoteness would make it difficult for Stewart's then-90-year-old mother to visit.[53] Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum recommended to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) that Stewart be given her first choice, Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury, or her second choice, Federal Correctional Complex, Coleman.[54] However, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice said that the BOP would not send her to FCI Danbury because the news media could too easily access the facility. The bureau could not send Stewart to FCC Coleman because of complications from Hurricane Ivan; the Coleman complex filled because inmates from Federal Correctional Institution, Marianna were moved to Coleman. Therefore, the Federal Bureau of Prisons assigned Stewart to Alderson. The spokesperson said that he was concerned that the assignment to Alderson could be perceived as being vindictive.[53] Stewart's daughter, Alexis, said that she believed that the BOP "may have made a point of sending her far away".[55]
Cedarbaum ordered Stewart to report to her prison sentence before 2:00 p.m. on October 8, 2004.[54] By September 27, 2004, Stewart received the BOP ID 55170-054.[54] At about 6:15 a.m. on October 8, 2004,[56] she reported to FPC Alderson.[57] Stewart said that her prison nickname was "M. Diddy".[58] While in confinement, she took a job and became an informal liaison between the administration and her fellow inmates. The People special, Scandals! That Rocked America, stated "Some expected America's goddess of domestic perfection to fall into terminal despair. Instead, with the drive that would make her a billionaire, Stewart took her lemon of a sentence and made lemonade. Heck, she made a lemon soufflé."[59] Stewart was released from FPC Alderson at 12:30 a.m. on March 4, 2005.[60] She was then placed in a two-year term of supervised release; during five of those months, she was placed in home confinement with electronic monitoring.[56][60] Stewart served her home confinement at her residence in Bedford, New York.[58] She was allowed to leave her house for 48 hours per week for work-related visits.[58] After her home confinement ended, but while her supervised release continued, she was required to remain employed and not to associate with people with criminal records. In addition, during the supervised release, she was required to receive permission from federal officials if she was going to leave the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.[61]
Current projects[edit]




Stewart at the Metropolitan Opera opening (2008)


Following her release from prison in March 2005, Stewart launched a highly publicized comeback and was once again involved in Martha Stewart Living. Offerings of her company's Martha Stewart Everyday line at Kmart were expanded to include a new line of ready-made home furnishings, and its mass market interior paint line became available at the larger Sears stores. However, the most heavily promoted aspect of her comeback was in television. Stewart returned to daytime television with The Martha Stewart Show and appeared in an adapted version of The Apprentice (called The Apprentice: Martha Stewart). Both shows premiered in September 2005, and both were produced by Mark Burnett. Her prime time Apprentice spin-off received poor ratings, which some[who?] attribute to popular dislike for the opportunistic tone of the network's massive promotional campaign and to NBC's slotting the show up against the hit drama Lost. The Apprentice: Martha Stewart was not renewed for a second season.[62]
In October 2005, Stewart released a new book, titled The Martha Rules, on starting and managing a new business,[63] and a month later, her company released Martha Stewart Baking Handbook.[64] In October 2006, Martha Stewart's Homekeeping Handbook, a reference book about looking after a house, was published by Clarkson Potter. She also is a regular contributor of cooking, crafts, and gardening segments on NBC's Today show. Stewart's daily talk show was nominated in six categories for the 33rd Daytime Emmy Awards in 2006, including Best Host and Best Show.




Stewart in 2008


MSLO launched a line of houses that carry her name to be built by KB Home, initially in Cary, North Carolina and ultimately in various other locations nationwide. The first homes, which were inspired by Stewart's homes in New York and Mount Desert Island in Maine, were completed in early 2006. Ultimately, 650 homes are planned, with prices from the low $200,000s to mid-$400,000s. A line of paper-based crafts for EK Success is also in development. In September 2007, she launched an upscale line of homewares for Macy's, which was the largest brand launch in Macy's history. Appearing in commercials for the line, Stewart stated she has designed more than 2,000 items exclusively for Macy's. The line includes bedding, bath, cookware, and dinnerware. In addition to television and merchandising, MSLO launched a 24-hour satellite radio channel with Sirius in November 2005, on which Stewart currently hosts a weekly call-in show.
Stewart also made a special appearance on the comedy-drama series Ugly Betty, in the November 16, 2006, episode "Four Thanksgivings and a Funeral", in which she gave her friend Wilhelmina Slater (played by Vanessa Williams) tips on how to prepare a turkey.[65] Justin Suarez (played by Mark Indelicato) is a fan of Stewart.
In July 2006, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced a multi-year agreement with FLOR, Inc., the eco-friendly manufacturer of high-style modular floor coverings, to manufacture and market a new line of Martha Stewart-branded carpet tiles. The Martha Stewart Floor Designs by FLOR[66] line debuted in 2007 with the distinctive design and color palette associated with the Martha Stewart brand. The agreement with FLOR was part of the Martha Stewart organization's growing home furnishings program, which includes a wide range of products such as furniture with Bernhardt, wall color with Lowe's, and floor coverings with FLOR.
On September 14, 2007, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced that it had signed a partnership with E & J Gallo Winery to produce a wine brand with label Martha Stewart Vintage (for sale in six cities, in January 2008, at $15). The 15,000 cases to be sold included: 2006 Sonoma County Chardonnay, 2005 Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon, and 2006 Sonoma County Merlot (for Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, North Carolina, Denver, Phoenix, and Portland, Oregon). Martha Stewart also signed a contract with Costco to offer frozen and fresh food, under the Kirkland Signature label.[67]
In July 2008, craft items under the names "Martha Stewart Celebrate" and "Martha Stewart Create", two divisions of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, premiered in Wal-Mart stores. The deal came about, in part, due to the closing of more than 600 K-Mart stores in the U.S.
In a move from broadcast television to cable, on January 26, 2010, Hallmark Channel and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced a multi-year strategic partnership. Her hour-long daytime television series, Martha, formerly The Martha Stewart Show, moved to the Hallmark Channel on September 13, 2010. It aired on Hallmark for two seasons, before cancellation in early 2012, with the final episode airing on May 11, 2012.[68][69]
New York Magazine reported in 2011 that Martha Stewart Living had only made a profit in one of the previous eight years.[17] That same year, Stewart debuted a new 30-minute show, Martha Bakes, on the Hallmark Channel.[70]
Stewart made another foray into acting with a debut on the long-running NBC legal drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. She played a private school headmistress in the episode entitled "Learning Curve" (airdate April 2012).[71]
A new television series, Martha Stewart's Cooking School, debuted on PBS in October 2012. Each weekly, 30-minute episode covers cooking techniques and basics.[72][73] It is based on her eponymous book.[74]
In the fall of 2016, VH1 premiered a new show featuring Martha and her friend Snoop Dogg called Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party, featuring games, recipes, and musical guests.[75] Snoop Dogg and Stewart also later starred together in a Super Bowl commercial for T-Mobile during Super Bowl LI in February 2017.[76]
Marley Spoon is a new project of packaged and home-delivered ingredients and recipes for preparation at home.[77][78]
Personal life[edit]




Alexis Stewart (left) and Martha Stewart (right), in September 2008


In 1961, she married Andrew Stewart, then a student at Yale Law School. Their only child, a daughter named Alexis, was born in 1965. The couple separated in 1987 and divorced in 1990.[11][31] Subsequently, Stewart dated Sir Anthony Hopkins but ended the relationship after she saw The Silence of the Lambs. She stated she was unable to avoid associating Hopkins with the character of Hannibal Lecter.[79][80]
Stewart reportedly dated billionaire Charles Simonyi, who was an early employee of Microsoft and head of their software group, on and off for 15 years. She featured footage of him as a space tourist aboard Soyuz on her television show in 2007. They broke up around February 2008.[81]
Stewart is an avid animal lover. Her pets include champion show Chow Chow dogs, French Bulldogs, Himalayan cats, and Friesian horses, including her dark horse Rutger.[82] Stewart also created a video[83] on behalf of fur-bearing animals after being approached by PETA while in jail. Stewart stated, "I used to wear real fur, but, like many others, I had a change of heart when I learned what actually happens to the animals".[84] Stewart filmed a public service announcement on behalf of the farm animal welfare organization Farm Sanctuary.[85]
Martha Kostyra, Stewart's mother, died at the age of 93 on November 16, 2007.[86] Kostyra, also called "Big Martha" by her family, had appeared on Martha Stewart Living numerous times.[86]
Stewart currently resides in Katonah, a hamlet of the town of Bedford, New York. She also maintains a 35,000-square-foot (3,300 m2) residence on Mount Desert Island in Seal Harbor, Maine, known as 'Skylands', the former summer estate of automobile designer and tycoon Edsel Ford, with gardens designed by renowned landscape architect Jens Jensen (1922).[87][88]
She claims to have been struck by lightning three times.[89]
Recognition[edit]
In 2011, Stewart was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.[90]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
