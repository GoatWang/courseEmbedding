50 Hz Products


Power Factor Correction Solutions
The PF Guard capacitor bank will reduce the demand on your electrical equipment, resulting in improved electrical system capacity and a more effective power supply.
 


Global Harmonic Solutions
TCI offers a wide selection of 50 Hz solutions that reduce or eliminate harmonic distortion, including passive harmonic filters and line reactors.



HGP
 



HarmonicGuard Passive 5% Passive Harmonic Filter

Performance of 5% or lower THD with loads as low as 50%
Performance of 5% or lower THD with background voltage distortion as high as 5%
True 100kA SCCR
Meets most stringent requirements of IEEE 519
Generator compatible
Internal fusing to prevent capacitor damage




 
 


HG7
 



HG7 7% Passive Harmonic Filter
			The HG7 not only limits current distortion to less than 7% THD, it also improves true power factor. Multiple package options result in the right filter configuration for the application.


 
 


KDR
 



KDR Line Reactor
			The addition of a KDR Line Reactor will limit the inrush current to the rectifier, rounding the waveform, reducing the peak currents and lowering the harmonic current distortion.



 
 

 
Global Motor Protection Solutions
The MotorShield eliminates harmful dv/dt to result in a sinewave output. The V1k dv/dt filter provides motor protection by limiting voltage spikes below 1,000 volts for long lead applications.



MotorShield
 



MotorShield Sinewave Filter
			The MotorShield filter eliminates harmful dv/dt to result in a sinewave output.


 
 


V1k
 



V1k dv/dt Motor Protection Filter
			Greatly reduces motor failures on VFD applications by limiting the magnitude of voltage spikes to levels below 1000 Volts and slowing down the rate of change of PWM switching by a factor of three or more.


 
 


KDR
 



KDR Output Line Reactor
			The addition of a KDR unit to the output of a drive will dampen overshoot peak voltage, reduce motor heating and audible noise, helping to extend the life of the motor.



 
 

 
Global High Frequency Noise Solutions
Unwanted high frequency electrical noise can cause equipment to malfunction. EMI (Electro Magnetic Interference) and RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) are two types of electrical noise.



KRF
 



Learn more about the KRF
			The KRF filters use a combination of high requency inductors and capacitors to reduce noise in the critical 150kHz to 30MHz frequency range.

The clients of this project are professionals seeking a refuge from the pressures of their careers.  They have been collecting Latin American artists for years and continue to add to their collection on frequent trips home to Mexico City.  They enjoy the hunt and when they return we work together to finalize their selections based on the collection as a whole and placement.   As a result, their home is ever evolving and changing as we re-arrange, add and retire pieces.
