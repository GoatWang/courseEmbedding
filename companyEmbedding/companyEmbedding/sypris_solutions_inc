FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

                A Unique Opportunity
We believe that Sypris has a unique opportunity to build upon its leadership position in each of its business segments.
In our Aerospace and Defense segment, Sypris has been a leading provider of information security solutions for electronic key management, identity authentication, encryption and cyber security for the Department of Defense and intelligence communities for almost 50 years. We have partnered with Purdue University and Carnegie Mellon to focus on the development of Trusted Architecture for secure systems, and with the California Institute of Technology to develop biometric solutions for identity authentication and management. Our security solutions protect the most classified data and networks in the world.
Sypris is also known for its long-standing partnerships as a "Trusted Source" for custom electronic design and manufacturing services, including systems for satellite power supplies, box-builds for land-based systems and electronic components for such key programs as Joint Strike Fighter. Sypris customers, including Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon, have relied upon Sypris to provide electronic assemblies for use in the Apache helicopter, the AMRAAM missile, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the Cobra Judy ship-based radar missile detection suite and the Viper multi-band infrared missile defense laser.
In our Industrial segment, Sypris is one of the leading suppliers of drivetrain components for the commercial vehicle and trailer markets in North America. We have invested extensively in technology to increase the flexibility, responsiveness and reliability of our manufacturing processes, while driving quality and on-time delivery to world class levels. Our products are made to the exacting designs of American Axle, Axle Alliance, Dana, Eaton, John Deere, Meritor and Sisamex, among others, for use in the powertrain assemblies of Daimler, Freightliner, International, Kenworth, Peterbilt and Volvo trucks.
Our Industrial segment is also a leading supplier of specialty closures and other piping components for use in the construction and maintenance of strategic oil, gas and petrochemical projects around the world. Our highly-engineered products can be found in some of the world's most challenging projects, including the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the US, the Keiyo Gas Pipeline and Kawasaki Power Plant in Japan, the Tengiz Oil Field in Kazakhstan, the Rabigh Desalination Plant in Saudi Arabia, the FPG Glycerin Refinery in Malaysia and the Ca Mau Gas Pipeline in Vietnam.

                A Unique Opportunity
We believe that Sypris has a unique opportunity to build upon its leadership position in each of its business segments.
In our Aerospace and Defense segment, Sypris has been a leading provider of information security solutions for electronic key management, identity authentication, encryption and cyber security for the Department of Defense and intelligence communities for almost 50 years. We have partnered with Purdue University and Carnegie Mellon to focus on the development of Trusted Architecture for secure systems, and with the California Institute of Technology to develop biometric solutions for identity authentication and management. Our security solutions protect the most classified data and networks in the world.
Sypris is also known for its long-standing partnerships as a "Trusted Source" for custom electronic design and manufacturing services, including systems for satellite power supplies, box-builds for land-based systems and electronic components for such key programs as Joint Strike Fighter. Sypris customers, including Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon, have relied upon Sypris to provide electronic assemblies for use in the Apache helicopter, the AMRAAM missile, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the Cobra Judy ship-based radar missile detection suite and the Viper multi-band infrared missile defense laser.
In our Industrial segment, Sypris is one of the leading suppliers of drivetrain components for the commercial vehicle and trailer markets in North America. We have invested extensively in technology to increase the flexibility, responsiveness and reliability of our manufacturing processes, while driving quality and on-time delivery to world class levels. Our products are made to the exacting designs of American Axle, Axle Alliance, Dana, Eaton, John Deere, Meritor and Sisamex, among others, for use in the powertrain assemblies of Daimler, Freightliner, International, Kenworth, Peterbilt and Volvo trucks.
Our Industrial segment is also a leading supplier of specialty closures and other piping components for use in the construction and maintenance of strategic oil, gas and petrochemical projects around the world. Our highly-engineered products can be found in some of the world's most challenging projects, including the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the US, the Keiyo Gas Pipeline and Kawasaki Power Plant in Japan, the Tengiz Oil Field in Kazakhstan, the Rabigh Desalination Plant in Saudi Arabia, the FPG Glycerin Refinery in Malaysia and the Ca Mau Gas Pipeline in Vietnam.
