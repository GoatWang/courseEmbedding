He is one of a select few attorneys who has attained Board Certification in Family Law by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization, and he has helped countless clients protect family businesses and professional practices during divorce.Child SupportWhen parents are unmarried, establishing legal paternity of a child is necessary in order to ensure parental rights and responsibilities. At The Law Offices of William D. Powers, we work with both mothers and fathers seeking to prove or disprove the paternity of a child. If paternity is established, we can assist in child support matters and in working out parenting plans that operate in the child's best interest.Child Custody and VisitationChild custody is one of the most contentious areas of family law because emotions run so high when children are involved. In many cases, parents are willing to fight tooth and nail for maximum parenting time and the greatest amount of influence on their child's life. There are some situations that can make child custody matters even more complex. At The Law Offices of William D. Powers, we are experienced in handling all types of child custody cases with compassion, understanding, and strong advocacy. Attorney Bill Powers works closely with clients to resolve child custody matters as efficiently and justly as possible.AdoptionAdoption is a wonderful way to create or expand a family, but adoption can involve some complicated legal issues.

Unfortunately, the future often brings unexpected circumstances. There are many situations in which creating a prenuptial agreement prior to the marriage or a post-marital agreement after the marriage is advisable. These situations include...Spousal SupportTexas was the last state in the U.S. to provide for post-divorce spousal support (alimony). Texas law now provides for alimony in certain circumstances. Recent changes have affected both the amounts that can be awarded, and the duration of the payment.Legal SeparationTexas law does not recognize legal separation, so temporary spousal support can be a critical issue from the outset of any divorce.AnnulmentIn some cases, separating couples are not required to go through the time-consuming process of a divorce, but instead can obtain an annulment. However, courts do not grant no-fault annulments, which means that in order to obtain an annulment, a couple must demonstrate that a marriage was void or voidable. Although annulling a marriage can save time and money in the long run, it is not the best course of action for every couple, so if you are considering ending your marriage, it is crucial to contact an experienced complex divorce attorney who can explain your options.Health LawPersonal InjuryEmily Jespersen is a 2010 graduate of Central Connecticut State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Management.

LEGAL TERMS

(more...)Latin for 'friend of the court.' This term describes a person or organization that is not a party to a lawsuit as plaintiff or defendant but that has a strong interest in the case and wants to get its two cents in. For example, the ACLU often submits materials to support a person who claims a violation of civil rights even though that person is represented by a lawyer.

(more...)In most states, any person under 18 years of age. All minors must be under the care of a competent adult (parent or guardian) unless they are 'emancipated'--in the military, married or living independently with court permission. Property left to a minor must be handled by an adult until the minor becomes an adult under the laws of the state where he or she lives.

SEPARATIONA situation in which the partners in a married couple live apart. Spouses are said to be living apart if they no longer reside in the same dwelling, even though... (more...)A situation in which the partners in a married couple live apart. Spouses are said to be living apart if they no longer reside in the same dwelling, even though they may continue their relationship. A legal separation results when the parties separate and a court rules on the division of property, such as alimony or child support -- but does not grant a divorce.

MARITAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTSee divorce agreement.

(more...)An adoption in which there is some degree of contact between the birthparents and the adoptive parents and sometimes with the child as well. As opposed to most adoptions in which birth and adoption records are sealed by court order, open adoptions allow the parties to decide how much contact the adoptive family and the birthparents will have.

MEDIAN FAMILY INCOMEAn annual income figure for which there are as many families with incomes below that level as there are above that level. The Census Bureau publishes median fam... (more...)An annual income figure for which there are as many families with incomes below that level as there are above that level. The Census Bureau publishes median family income figures for each state and for different family sizes. A debtor whose current monthly income is higher than the median family income in his or her state must pass the means test in order to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and must commit all disposable income to a five-year repayment plan if filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

DILUTIONA situation in which a famous trademark or service mark is used in a context in which the mark's reputation for quality is tarnished or its distinction is blurr... (more...)A situation in which a famous trademark or service mark is used in a context in which the mark's reputation for quality is tarnished or its distinction is blurred. In this case, trademark infringement exists even though there is no likelihood of customer confusion, which is usually required in cases of trademark infringement. For example, the use of the word Candyland for a pornographic site on the Internet was ruled to dilute the reputation of the Candyland mark for the well-known children's game, even though the traditional basis for trademark infringement (probable customer confusion) wasn't an issue.

(more...)A term used instead of defendant or appellee in some states -- especially for divorce and other family law cases -- to identify the party who is sued and must respond to the petitioner's complaint.

(more...)A tradition that required one spouse to prove that the other spouse was legally at fault, to obtain a divorce. The 'innocent' spouse was then granted the divorce from the 'guilty' spouse. Today, 35 states still allow a spouse to allege fault in obtaining a divorce. The traditional fault grounds for divorce are adultery, cruelty, desertion, confinement in prison, physical incapacity and incurable insanity. These grounds are also generally referred to as marital misconduct.

Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsAn elegantly written memoir of a young man's life-changing sojourn in a world of immeasurable poverty and instability: Charles Taylor's Liberia.William Powers went to Liberia as a fresh-faced aid worker in 1999 and was given the mandate to "fight poverty and save the rainforest." It's not long before Powers is confronting the myriad obstacles to these goals. He discovers how Liberia has become a Fourth World country, or a "black hole in the international system"-poor, environmentally looted, scarred by violence, and barely governed. He comes face-to-face with unspeakable horrors and the insidious corruption behind every daily transaction. Yet, against the odds (and the attitude of most aid workers), he finds a place in the jungle that feels like home and a woman he might risk everything for, until violence descends once more, threatening his friends and his future. With the pacing and prose of the best novels, Blue Clay People is an absorbing blend of humor, compassion, and rigorous moral questioning that will convince readers why the fate of endangered places such as Liberia must matter to all of us.Review"When Powers, fresh out of a Ph.D. program in international relations, arrived in Liberia in 1999, sent by an international aid agency 'to fight poverty and save the rainforest,' he faced a daunting task. The second-poorest country in the world, Liberia had just begun to emerge from seven years of civil war and was 'environmentally looted, violence scarred, and barely governed.' Even major cities lacked electricity, running water and postal service; garbage lay uncollected in the streets, schoolteachers were barely literate and the economy worked largely on bribes. The government of Charles Taylor enriched itself through illicit trade in conflict diamonds, protected timber and weapons, while terrorist militias acted at whim. 'It's all just so brutal,' Powers confided to his girlfriend, almost ready to quit after his first year. Yet he stayed on, and this eloquent memoir shows why he found this troubled country so difficult to leave. He writes of stunning beaches and rivers, of majestic forests  home to the largest concentration of mammals in the world  threatened by rapacious logging companies, and of resilient people who teach him that it is possible to live happily with 'enough.' He sketches scenes of transcendent beauty and grotesque violence, and writes with disarming honesty about his struggle to maintain his ideals when the right course of action is far from clear: is it ethical to take an African lover, when the relationship will inevitably be based on financial support? Should he buy endangered zebra duiker meat from a poor family that desperately needs the money? Does his work do good, or inadvertent harm? In the end, he decides, it may not be possible to change the world, but we must continue to act as if we can. Agent, William Clark. (Jan.) Forecast: While more limited in scope than David Rieff's A Bed for the Night, Blue Clay People makes similar points about struggles of humanitarian work and should engage readers of Rieff's volume."  Publishers Weekly (Copyright 2004 Reed Business Information, Inc.)Review "A hard-bitten, unclouded, and intense portrait of a desperate place."  Kirkus ReviewsReview "Powers has a keen ear for dialogue and dialect, and his prose is lovely and lyrical."  Providence JournalReview "Powers' ability to see at least some things through African eyes that sets his memoir apart."  SF Chronicle ReviewReview "An examination of the failures and successes of international aid as well as a moving coming-of-age story."  Columbus DispatchReview "A Masterful storyteller...Powers has a keen ear for dialogue and dialect, and his prose is lovely and lyrical...[His] honesty about his own flaws places him in the congregation rather than the pulpit."--Providence Journal "So few educated Westerners agree to work in Liberia that any book illuminating the situation there would be welcome. It is a bonus that William Powers, one of those few, is also sensitive, reflective, and a fine stylist."--St. Louis Post-Dispatch"Powers sketches scenes of transcendent beauty and grotesque violence, and writes with disarming honesty about his struggle to maintain his ideals when the right course of action is far from clear."--Publishers Weekly (starred review) SynopsisPowers went to Liberia as an aid worker in 1999 and was given the mandate to "fight poverty and save the rainforest." It's not long before Powers discovers how Liberia has become a Fourth World country--poor, environmentally looted, scarred by violence, and barely governed.Synopsis"A haunting account of one man's determination and the struggles of a people living in a deeply troubled country."--BooklistWhen William Powers went to Liberia as a fresh-faced aid worker in 1999, he was given the mandate to "fight poverty and save the rainforest." It wasn't long before Powers saw how many obstacles lay in the way, discovering first-hand how Liberia has become a "black hole in the international system"--poor, environmentally looted, scarred by violence, and barely governed. Blue Clay People is an absorbing blend of humor, compassion, and rigorous moral questioning, arguing convincingly that the fate of endangered places such as Liberia must matter to all of us.About the AuthorWilliam Powers hails from Long Island and is among a small group of Westerners to have lived long-term in Liberia and to have traveled to the nation's most dangerous corners. For two years, he directed food distribution, agriculture, and education programs for the largest non-governmental relief group in Liberia. He has also worked at the World Bank, and holds International Relations degrees from Brown University and Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. He's currently on assignment in Bolivia.

Knowledgeable Legal Guidance Means So Much When You Are Changing Your Life
Issues such as child custody and visitation rights, child and spousal support, and property division may at first seem overwhelming, even in divorces where the partners try to cooperate. But with the help of a trained Austin divorce lawyer, it is possible to protect your interests while looking out for the future of your family.
Bill Powers brings perspective, strong negotiation skills, and intimate knowledge of the law to every family law client he helps. These qualities help his clients in all areas of family law to reach the best possible resolution to their issues, including:
Uncontested Divorce - To help divorcing couples reach an understanding on serious issues such as child custody and property division, Bill uses his unique skills as a trained mediator and certified collaborative divorce lawyer to forge agreements that work for all parties.
Contested Divorce - When it is not possible to reach an agreement through reason, Bill becomes an aggressive advocate for his clients, fighting to protect their rights to reach fair resolution of disputed issues.
Protective Orders and Family Violence - Protecting clients from violence through legal means demands experience and aggressive measures. No one should fear being hurt by another and Bill takes every legal step necessary to prevent it.
Adoption - Adopting a child can be one of the most rewarding experiences in life—but potentially devastating legal issues can arise. Bill understands the requirements of the legal adoption process and helps couples work within adoption laws to build a happy family.
Prenuptial and Post-Marital Agreements - No one knows what the future may bring. More couples than ever choose to create legal agreements before or during marriage to protect assets, to clarify the inheritance rights of their children by previous marriages, and for a host of other reasons. Bill has helped many clients put their worries to rest with well-crafted agreements that stand up to the test of the courts.
Paternity - With more parents choosing not to marry, establishing paternity and everything that goes with that process, becomes more important every day. Once the paternity of a child has been determined, responsibilities such as custody and support can be shared by both parents. Bill has the skills to develop appropriate parenting plans that put the interests of the child first.

William Charles Powers Jr. (born May 30, 1946) was the 28th president of The University of Texas at Austin, the second-longest serving president in the University's history. He held the position from February 1, 2006 to July 2, 2015, when he was succeeded by Gregory L. Fenves.[1][2]
Powers was selected in November 2005 as the sole finalist for the position of president of the University of Texas at Austin.[3] In December 2005, he was officially named president of the University and succeeded Larry Faulkner when he left office in February 2006. Prior to his appointment, he served as Dean of The University of Texas School of Law since 2000. Powers resigned the presidency in June, 2015, partly as the result of external pressures that came to center on admissions practices at the university.[2]
Currently, Powers serves as University Distinguished Teaching Professor and holds the Hines H. Baker and Thelma Kelley Baker Chair in Law at the School of Law.[4]

Education[edit]
Powers obtained his B.A. in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley and his juris doctor from Harvard Law School. During his undergraduate years at Berkeley, he became a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity, and at Harvard he was managing editor of the Harvard Law Review.[5]
Employment[edit]
Powers has also worked at Southern Methodist University, the University of Michigan, and the University of Washington.[citation needed] Powers is a former member of the Enron Corporation Board of Directors and chaired the Special Investigative Committee to investigate the causes of Enron's bankruptcy. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary from 2004-2010.[6]
Powers has authored several law texts, including:[7]

Cases and Materials in Products Liability
Cases and Materials in Torts
Texas Products Liability Law

In 2008, Powers was appointed to the rank of Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in France’s orders of chivalry.[8] In 2012, he became Vice Chair of the Association of American Universities[9] and became Chair of the organization on October 22, 2013.[10] He is a member of Westminster Presbyterian Church (PCUSA) in Austin.[citation needed]
Accomplishments[edit]
While president, Powers oversaw the reform of the undergraduate curriculum and the founding of both the School of Undergraduate Studies and the Dell Medical School. An eight-year fundraising project he spearheaded called the Campaign for Texas raised $3.12 billion for the university.[11] During his tenure the University also completed or began construction on 13 new buildings.[12]
External Pressures[edit]
Despite his successes, Powers's final four years were marked by growing opposition to the status quo in higher education in Austin. A group of regents appointed by then Governor Rick Perry attempted to instantiate the "Seven Breakthrough Solutions" of Austin entrepreneur Jefferson Davis Sandefer IV.[13] Sandefer's ideas for the restructuring of the University were thought by many to be inimical to its research mission.[14] Perry had endorsed the "seven solutions" at a private meeting attended by two of his appointed regents at the Texas Public Policy Foundation in 2008.[15] In the face of mounting pressure from the Board of Regents to implement Sandefer's program, Powers remained steadfast in his support for the University's traditional role and shape. Such actions made him a target of various "reformers," and the same time an admired figure within the higher education community: Powers was elected to Chair the Association of American Universities in 2013.[16]
Soon after the 2011 appointment of regent Wallace Hall, Jr., a college friend of Sandefer's, Powers became the focus of multiple investigations by Hall.[17] Hall's interests as a regent centered largely on Powers's role as leader of its flagship campus in Austin, even though the University of Texas System includes fourteen institutions. Having probed accounting procedures in its capital campaign and a forgivable loan program administered by a private foundation in support of its law school faculty, Hall turned his attention to external influence on admissions at the University. A series of document requests revealed that powerful individuals often sought to obtain favoritism toward various applicants, and sometimes succeeded. In May 2014, a blog post reported that various regents had asked then UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa to fire Powers.[18] Almost immediately, a grassroots campaign arose in his support. A Facebook group named "I Stand With Bill Powers" attracted nearly 10,000 members.[19]
Resignation[edit]
Main article: University of Texas admissions controversy
On July 4, 2014 an anonymous source reported that UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa had asked Powers to resign, prior to the impending meeting of the Board of Regents, or face termination.[20] The Board meeting agenda indicated regents would discuss Powers in an executive session. Cigarroa attributed the request to a "breakdown of communication, collegiality, trust and a willingness to work together for the good of the university."[21] Powers at first indicated he would not resign, saying it would "cast the university and our state in a highly unfavorable light." However, on July 9, 2014, Cigarroa released a statement that Powers nevertheless agreed to resign effective June 2015.[22]
On February 12, 2015 an investigation ordered by the University of Texas found that Powers had helped certain applicants, including those with lesser academic credentials, gain admission if they had been recommended by legislators and influential people.[23] According to the report, from 2009 to 2014, well-connected students flagged by university officials were admitted 74% of the time compared to an overall admission rate of 40%.[23] President Powers and his Chief of Staff "each failed to speak with candor and forthrightness expected of people in their positions of trust and leadership," the report stated.[23] Powers agreed to step down in June 2014. He told the Wall Street Journal that he had "intervened on behalf of a relatively small number of students" but denied that it was "undue influence."[23] Subsequently, the Austin American-Statesman determined that, as Chancellor, Cigarroa had participated in this selfsame aspect of the admissions process, sometimes making notes on the letters about the status of the individuals requesting special consideration in admissions.[24]

William Charles Powers Jr. (born May 30, 1946) was the 28th president of The University of Texas at Austin, the second-longest serving president in the University's history. He held the position from February 1, 2006 to July 2, 2015, when he was succeeded by Gregory L. Fenves.[1][2]
Powers was selected in November 2005 as the sole finalist for the position of president of the University of Texas at Austin.[3] In December 2005, he was officially named president of the University and succeeded Larry Faulkner when he left office in February 2006. Prior to his appointment, he served as Dean of The University of Texas School of Law since 2000. Powers resigned the presidency in June, 2015, partly as the result of external pressures that came to center on admissions practices at the university.[2]
Currently, Powers serves as University Distinguished Teaching Professor and holds the Hines H. Baker and Thelma Kelley Baker Chair in Law at the School of Law.[4]

Education[edit]
Powers obtained his B.A. in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley and his juris doctor from Harvard Law School. During his undergraduate years at Berkeley, he became a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity, and at Harvard he was managing editor of the Harvard Law Review.[5]
Employment[edit]
Powers has also worked at Southern Methodist University, the University of Michigan, and the University of Washington.[citation needed] Powers is a former member of the Enron Corporation Board of Directors and chaired the Special Investigative Committee to investigate the causes of Enron's bankruptcy. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary from 2004-2010.[6]
Powers has authored several law texts, including:[7]

Cases and Materials in Products Liability
Cases and Materials in Torts
Texas Products Liability Law

In 2008, Powers was appointed to the rank of Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in France’s orders of chivalry.[8] In 2012, he became Vice Chair of the Association of American Universities[9] and became Chair of the organization on October 22, 2013.[10] He is a member of Westminster Presbyterian Church (PCUSA) in Austin.[citation needed]
Accomplishments[edit]
While president, Powers oversaw the reform of the undergraduate curriculum and the founding of both the School of Undergraduate Studies and the Dell Medical School. An eight-year fundraising project he spearheaded called the Campaign for Texas raised $3.12 billion for the university.[11] During his tenure the University also completed or began construction on 13 new buildings.[12]
External Pressures[edit]
Despite his successes, Powers's final four years were marked by growing opposition to the status quo in higher education in Austin. A group of regents appointed by then Governor Rick Perry attempted to instantiate the "Seven Breakthrough Solutions" of Austin entrepreneur Jefferson Davis Sandefer IV.[13] Sandefer's ideas for the restructuring of the University were thought by many to be inimical to its research mission.[14] Perry had endorsed the "seven solutions" at a private meeting attended by two of his appointed regents at the Texas Public Policy Foundation in 2008.[15] In the face of mounting pressure from the Board of Regents to implement Sandefer's program, Powers remained steadfast in his support for the University's traditional role and shape. Such actions made him a target of various "reformers," and the same time an admired figure within the higher education community: Powers was elected to Chair the Association of American Universities in 2013.[16]
Soon after the 2011 appointment of regent Wallace Hall, Jr., a college friend of Sandefer's, Powers became the focus of multiple investigations by Hall.[17] Hall's interests as a regent centered largely on Powers's role as leader of its flagship campus in Austin, even though the University of Texas System includes fourteen institutions. Having probed accounting procedures in its capital campaign and a forgivable loan program administered by a private foundation in support of its law school faculty, Hall turned his attention to external influence on admissions at the University. A series of document requests revealed that powerful individuals often sought to obtain favoritism toward various applicants, and sometimes succeeded. In May 2014, a blog post reported that various regents had asked then UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa to fire Powers.[18] Almost immediately, a grassroots campaign arose in his support. A Facebook group named "I Stand With Bill Powers" attracted nearly 10,000 members.[19]
Resignation[edit]
Main article: University of Texas admissions controversy
On July 4, 2014 an anonymous source reported that UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa had asked Powers to resign, prior to the impending meeting of the Board of Regents, or face termination.[20] The Board meeting agenda indicated regents would discuss Powers in an executive session. Cigarroa attributed the request to a "breakdown of communication, collegiality, trust and a willingness to work together for the good of the university."[21] Powers at first indicated he would not resign, saying it would "cast the university and our state in a highly unfavorable light." However, on July 9, 2014, Cigarroa released a statement that Powers nevertheless agreed to resign effective June 2015.[22]
On February 12, 2015 an investigation ordered by the University of Texas found that Powers had helped certain applicants, including those with lesser academic credentials, gain admission if they had been recommended by legislators and influential people.[23] According to the report, from 2009 to 2014, well-connected students flagged by university officials were admitted 74% of the time compared to an overall admission rate of 40%.[23] President Powers and his Chief of Staff "each failed to speak with candor and forthrightness expected of people in their positions of trust and leadership," the report stated.[23] Powers agreed to step down in June 2014. He told the Wall Street Journal that he had "intervened on behalf of a relatively small number of students" but denied that it was "undue influence."[23] Subsequently, the Austin American-Statesman determined that, as Chancellor, Cigarroa had participated in this selfsame aspect of the admissions process, sometimes making notes on the letters about the status of the individuals requesting special consideration in admissions.[24]

William Charles Powers Jr. (born May 30, 1946) was the 28th president of The University of Texas at Austin, the second-longest serving president in the University's history. He held the position from February 1, 2006 to July 2, 2015, when he was succeeded by Gregory L. Fenves.[1][2]
Powers was selected in November 2005 as the sole finalist for the position of president of the University of Texas at Austin.[3] In December 2005, he was officially named president of the University and succeeded Larry Faulkner when he left office in February 2006. Prior to his appointment, he served as Dean of The University of Texas School of Law since 2000. Powers resigned the presidency in June, 2015, partly as the result of external pressures that came to center on admissions practices at the university.[2]
Currently, Powers serves as University Distinguished Teaching Professor and holds the Hines H. Baker and Thelma Kelley Baker Chair in Law at the School of Law.[4]

Education[edit]
Powers obtained his B.A. in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley and his juris doctor from Harvard Law School. During his undergraduate years at Berkeley, he became a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity, and at Harvard he was managing editor of the Harvard Law Review.[5]
Employment[edit]
Powers has also worked at Southern Methodist University, the University of Michigan, and the University of Washington.[citation needed] Powers is a former member of the Enron Corporation Board of Directors and chaired the Special Investigative Committee to investigate the causes of Enron's bankruptcy. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary from 2004-2010.[6]
Powers has authored several law texts, including:[7]

Cases and Materials in Products Liability
Cases and Materials in Torts
Texas Products Liability Law

In 2008, Powers was appointed to the rank of Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in France’s orders of chivalry.[8] In 2012, he became Vice Chair of the Association of American Universities[9] and became Chair of the organization on October 22, 2013.[10] He is a member of Westminster Presbyterian Church (PCUSA) in Austin.[citation needed]
Accomplishments[edit]
While president, Powers oversaw the reform of the undergraduate curriculum and the founding of both the School of Undergraduate Studies and the Dell Medical School. An eight-year fundraising project he spearheaded called the Campaign for Texas raised $3.12 billion for the university.[11] During his tenure the University also completed or began construction on 13 new buildings.[12]
External Pressures[edit]
Despite his successes, Powers's final four years were marked by growing opposition to the status quo in higher education in Austin. A group of regents appointed by then Governor Rick Perry attempted to instantiate the "Seven Breakthrough Solutions" of Austin entrepreneur Jefferson Davis Sandefer IV.[13] Sandefer's ideas for the restructuring of the University were thought by many to be inimical to its research mission.[14] Perry had endorsed the "seven solutions" at a private meeting attended by two of his appointed regents at the Texas Public Policy Foundation in 2008.[15] In the face of mounting pressure from the Board of Regents to implement Sandefer's program, Powers remained steadfast in his support for the University's traditional role and shape. Such actions made him a target of various "reformers," and the same time an admired figure within the higher education community: Powers was elected to Chair the Association of American Universities in 2013.[16]
Soon after the 2011 appointment of regent Wallace Hall, Jr., a college friend of Sandefer's, Powers became the focus of multiple investigations by Hall.[17] Hall's interests as a regent centered largely on Powers's role as leader of its flagship campus in Austin, even though the University of Texas System includes fourteen institutions. Having probed accounting procedures in its capital campaign and a forgivable loan program administered by a private foundation in support of its law school faculty, Hall turned his attention to external influence on admissions at the University. A series of document requests revealed that powerful individuals often sought to obtain favoritism toward various applicants, and sometimes succeeded. In May 2014, a blog post reported that various regents had asked then UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa to fire Powers.[18] Almost immediately, a grassroots campaign arose in his support. A Facebook group named "I Stand With Bill Powers" attracted nearly 10,000 members.[19]
Resignation[edit]
Main article: University of Texas admissions controversy
On July 4, 2014 an anonymous source reported that UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa had asked Powers to resign, prior to the impending meeting of the Board of Regents, or face termination.[20] The Board meeting agenda indicated regents would discuss Powers in an executive session. Cigarroa attributed the request to a "breakdown of communication, collegiality, trust and a willingness to work together for the good of the university."[21] Powers at first indicated he would not resign, saying it would "cast the university and our state in a highly unfavorable light." However, on July 9, 2014, Cigarroa released a statement that Powers nevertheless agreed to resign effective June 2015.[22]
On February 12, 2015 an investigation ordered by the University of Texas found that Powers had helped certain applicants, including those with lesser academic credentials, gain admission if they had been recommended by legislators and influential people.[23] According to the report, from 2009 to 2014, well-connected students flagged by university officials were admitted 74% of the time compared to an overall admission rate of 40%.[23] President Powers and his Chief of Staff "each failed to speak with candor and forthrightness expected of people in their positions of trust and leadership," the report stated.[23] Powers agreed to step down in June 2014. He told the Wall Street Journal that he had "intervened on behalf of a relatively small number of students" but denied that it was "undue influence."[23] Subsequently, the Austin American-Statesman determined that, as Chancellor, Cigarroa had participated in this selfsame aspect of the admissions process, sometimes making notes on the letters about the status of the individuals requesting special consideration in admissions.[24]

Powers obtained his B.A. in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley and his juris doctor from Harvard Law School. During his undergraduate years at Berkeley, he became a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity, and at Harvard he was managing editor of the Harvard Law Review.[5]
Employment[edit]
Powers has also worked at Southern Methodist University, the University of Michigan, and the University of Washington.[citation needed] Powers is a former member of the Enron Corporation Board of Directors and chaired the Special Investigative Committee to investigate the causes of Enron's bankruptcy. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary from 2004-2010.[6]
Powers has authored several law texts, including:[7]

Cases and Materials in Products Liability
Cases and Materials in Torts
Texas Products Liability Law

In 2008, Powers was appointed to the rank of Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in France’s orders of chivalry.[8] In 2012, he became Vice Chair of the Association of American Universities[9] and became Chair of the organization on October 22, 2013.[10] He is a member of Westminster Presbyterian Church (PCUSA) in Austin.[citation needed]
Accomplishments[edit]
While president, Powers oversaw the reform of the undergraduate curriculum and the founding of both the School of Undergraduate Studies and the Dell Medical School. An eight-year fundraising project he spearheaded called the Campaign for Texas raised $3.12 billion for the university.[11] During his tenure the University also completed or began construction on 13 new buildings.[12]
External Pressures[edit]
Despite his successes, Powers's final four years were marked by growing opposition to the status quo in higher education in Austin. A group of regents appointed by then Governor Rick Perry attempted to instantiate the "Seven Breakthrough Solutions" of Austin entrepreneur Jefferson Davis Sandefer IV.[13] Sandefer's ideas for the restructuring of the University were thought by many to be inimical to its research mission.[14] Perry had endorsed the "seven solutions" at a private meeting attended by two of his appointed regents at the Texas Public Policy Foundation in 2008.[15] In the face of mounting pressure from the Board of Regents to implement Sandefer's program, Powers remained steadfast in his support for the University's traditional role and shape. Such actions made him a target of various "reformers," and the same time an admired figure within the higher education community: Powers was elected to Chair the Association of American Universities in 2013.[16]
Soon after the 2011 appointment of regent Wallace Hall, Jr., a college friend of Sandefer's, Powers became the focus of multiple investigations by Hall.[17] Hall's interests as a regent centered largely on Powers's role as leader of its flagship campus in Austin, even though the University of Texas System includes fourteen institutions. Having probed accounting procedures in its capital campaign and a forgivable loan program administered by a private foundation in support of its law school faculty, Hall turned his attention to external influence on admissions at the University. A series of document requests revealed that powerful individuals often sought to obtain favoritism toward various applicants, and sometimes succeeded. In May 2014, a blog post reported that various regents had asked then UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa to fire Powers.[18] Almost immediately, a grassroots campaign arose in his support. A Facebook group named "I Stand With Bill Powers" attracted nearly 10,000 members.[19]
Resignation[edit]
Main article: University of Texas admissions controversy
On July 4, 2014 an anonymous source reported that UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa had asked Powers to resign, prior to the impending meeting of the Board of Regents, or face termination.[20] The Board meeting agenda indicated regents would discuss Powers in an executive session. Cigarroa attributed the request to a "breakdown of communication, collegiality, trust and a willingness to work together for the good of the university."[21] Powers at first indicated he would not resign, saying it would "cast the university and our state in a highly unfavorable light." However, on July 9, 2014, Cigarroa released a statement that Powers nevertheless agreed to resign effective June 2015.[22]
On February 12, 2015 an investigation ordered by the University of Texas found that Powers had helped certain applicants, including those with lesser academic credentials, gain admission if they had been recommended by legislators and influential people.[23] According to the report, from 2009 to 2014, well-connected students flagged by university officials were admitted 74% of the time compared to an overall admission rate of 40%.[23] President Powers and his Chief of Staff "each failed to speak with candor and forthrightness expected of people in their positions of trust and leadership," the report stated.[23] Powers agreed to step down in June 2014. He told the Wall Street Journal that he had "intervened on behalf of a relatively small number of students" but denied that it was "undue influence."[23] Subsequently, the Austin American-Statesman determined that, as Chancellor, Cigarroa had participated in this selfsame aspect of the admissions process, sometimes making notes on the letters about the status of the individuals requesting special consideration in admissions.[24]
