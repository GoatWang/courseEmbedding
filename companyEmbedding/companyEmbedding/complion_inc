A single platform for managing regulatory & clinical trial documents.
The documentation burden is only growing for clinical research sites that are buried in paper and binders. Why waste your site’s time and resources manually printing, scanning, and routing documents and correspondence?
 Complion offers a sponsor-approved, turn-key solution for collecting and managing all of your clinical trial documentation.
Access documents from any device
Create your patient binder, central binder and regulatory binders the same way you always do – but without the hassle.  Everything is easily accessible from any device in our cloud-hosted solution.
How it Works    21 CFR Part 11 Compliant
Our platform is 100% Part 11 compliant and meets ICH GCP. Unlike a shared drive, CTMS or sponsor portal, it allows you to control and maintain your documentation entirely electronically.
Part 11 Compliance  Save money
Not only will our solution save you time, but it will most likely cost less than the amount you currently spend on materials and archiving. Even better, it is monitor-accepted and reimbursable.
ROI and Reimbursement  Committed to your success
Our software is user-friendly and we provide exceptional support. Our research certified professionals can get you up and running in a matter of weeks, and you will also have access to the combined knowledge of our customer community.

“One of the most expensive assets we have are our people. The more chasing around that they need to do, the less time they have to do more important work. One of the goals I have as the director of a research program is to minimize non-value added work – to streamline it and optimize it – and to allow our people to move on to more important things. Complion helps me achieve that goal.”Christy Gilchrist, PhD, CRA, HSHS St. Vincent HospitalWhat Customers SayAre you maximizing sponsor reimbursement?
Not only will using the Complion platform reduce your costs, but our fees are also reimbursable by site sponsors. With Complion, you can avoid other long term archiving costs and also provide significant financial return to the sponsor by enabling remote monitoring access or more efficient onsite monitoring practices.

Gain transparency, in real time.
Trial Sponsors and Contract Research Organizations (CROs) spend significant resources sending monitors to research sites converting paper site files. Even then, it’s a challenge to gain real-time visibility for inspection readiness.
 Sponsors and CROs that work with sites using Complion gain real-time access to all site files, from one location with a single password. This means better visibility at a significantly lower cost. And monitors are thrilled that they no longer have to sift through cumbersome, paper binders.
Fewer trips and hours
The Complion platform can provide you with visibility in real time, from one location, to all of your clinical research site files. It is better monitoring, faster, without leaving your office.
Ready for an inspection
Improve inspection readiness at your organization and your research sites by providing your sites with an efficient and easy-to-use system, built just for them.
Compliant and productive sites
Complion enables sites to meet the FDA and GCP requirements of owning, controlling and validating their own file system. Your sites can now manage everything electronically within one system without any original paper copies or wet-ink signatures.
Connected to site files
Both the sites and the sponsor can archive documents on the platform and users can create formatted exports. Integration options enable real-time entry of site files into your trial master file.
What Customers Say“In about five minutes, rather than having three, four binders worth of stuff, all the correspondence for the entire study from the time it began to the time it closed was saved in a single 150 megabyte file that I could just put up on an FTP site and send to the monitor. It was amazing.”Neal Surasky, Chesapeake Research Group Let’s explore the opportunities together.Get in touch

It’s an increasingly common occurrence at clinical research sites, that moment of realization that the organization is choking on paper. A blizzard of documents and a mountain of bulging folders crushing efficiency and slowing processes to the point that a fleeting thought about a splash of lighter fluid and a well-placed match might pass through the mind of a harried site executive. 
Cooler heads prevail, of course, and far less incendiary solutions are readily available.
Complion has been such a solution for a great many research sites, including South Texas Cardiovascular Consultants (STCC), a research hospital that serves patients in four locations throughout Texas.

How the right partner can smooth the path to a fully compliant regulatory and document management system
Efforts to transition to a streamlined paperless operation are unquestionably worthwhile. But the characteristic increases in efficiency are of little value if the transformed organization falls short of 21 CFR Part 11 compliance. That is why it is critically important that every step on the path to the paperless transformation is guided by professionals who are deeply, intimately familiar with the requirements for compliance.

Real-world examples of how a clinical research sites are using Complion to manage email correspondence and run more efficiently. 
Despite your best efforts to keep your email inbox clear, it can easily become overstuffed as your day to day correspondence pours in. That’s a problem. But that problem takes on massive significance when that email correspondence is part of the documentation in a clinical trial and subject to FDA regulations with specific requirements for how that correspondence is organized and managed. Printing and filing hard copies of email correspondence only exacerbates the problem.

Growth is good. Growth is healthy. But clinical research sites that rely on paper-based systems or even shared drives will quickly find that growth, particularly as it relates to managing multiple locations, can dramatically increase aspirin consumption in order to counteract headaches of truly historic proportions.
Sites that still rely on paper must manually route documents, either physically or by email, across a spiderweb of locations in an effort to collect physician signatures or to get people to sign off on reviews. That process can leave a cluttered trail of redundant documents and duplicate files, which only increases the possibility that something will go wrong, and turns that dream of increased visibility into document tracking and task assignment into a nightmare of wasted time and money.

This is the final post in a series based on the Complion webinar,  The Future of the Clinical Research Industry, as presented by John Neal, CEO of PCRS Network. In that webinar, John explores a variety of factors that are driving the evolution of clinical research. This post looks at another of John Neal’s predictions.

Because sponsors are increasingly seeking efficiencies, and all stakeholders have an interest in minimizing the time required of, and the potential risk to, volunteers who participate in studies, there will be a decrease in the number of single drug studies in the future. [1]

About Complion
Complion provides clinical research sites and their sponsors with a software platform to enable secure, compliant and efficient management of documents and administrative tasks.
As a company founded by former clinical research professionals, we also support our clients with industry-leading customer service and training, expertise on compliance matters, community forums, and a wealth of educational resources.
Our Story
Complion founder Rick Arlow was immersed in clinical research during a NIH funded MD/PhD medical scientist training program at Case Western Reserve University. Although he loved the work, he was shocked at how cumbersome operations and regulatory compliance were for the research site and how much time and space were wasted on manual tasks and paper binders. 
Drawing on his engineering background, Rick built the first version of the Complion software platform to store regulatory documentation, and in close collaboration with leading medical centers, Complion was born.
Since its founding, Complion has grown significantly and built a strong team of clinical research and software development experts. We continue to improve our platform and processes in response to our clients’ needs, and we are honored to serve clinical research sites and sponsors of all sizes across the country.
Our Mission
Complion’s mission is to transform the way clinical trial documentation is created and maintained. By re-engineering cumbersome compliance processes, we seek to unleash medical innovators to better focus on advancements that improve patient outcomes, and enhance the reputations of institutions and investigators.
Our Values
Passion
We understand and share your commitment to research.
Own it
We take pride in our work and show accountability.
Growth
Committed to growth, both personally and as a company.
Celebrate
We celebrate each other’s successes and individual uniqueness.
 Let’s explore opportunities together.

The Future of Clinical Research: Introduction

Posted on Mar 6, 2017 10:16:37 AM







Tweet




















This post introduces a series based on the Complion webinar,  The Future of the Clinical Research Industry, as presented by John Neal, CEO of PCRS Network. In that webinar, John explores a variety of factors that are driving the evolution of clinical research.
No human endeavor is immune to change, and that is certainly true for clinical research. John Neal, CEO of PCRS Network spent a year talking to sponsors, management, and other people in various roles in clinical research in an effort to identify the factors that are shaping the future of clinical research. And while the views vary, one factor looms above all others. 
“There’s a consensus that the system is broken,” says John. “It’s not sustainable.” It all comes down to money. According to John’s research, the average cost to take a drug from discovery through approval is $1.5 billion. And the cost isn’t dropping. 
“Every indication is that without change, that number’s going to continue to increase,” John says. That is especially true for larger pharmaceutical companies that are testing multiple drugs trying to bring multiple products to market. Some of those drugs don’t make it, which raises the average cost of the drugs that do make it to market. “As an industry we need to change,” John says, “and there are plenty of things that are going to drive that change.”
Among those factors are increased patient involvement, pushback from Medicare and other payers on drug prices, greater collaboration on what John calls “real world protocols,” and, of course, technological innovation. 
This series will examine these future factors and how they will shape the industry.

Written by Lisa Bozza Archer
As a former Clinical Research Associate with one of the largest CROs, Lisa obtained a strong foundation in clinical research and therapeutic areas ranging from Neurology, Rheumatology, Endocrinology to Oncology.

These experiences provide her keen insight, both to the needs and the daily experiences of Complion's clients. 
As an Account Manager of Complion's Customer Success Team, Lisa regularly engages with clients to promote successful adoption and utilization of the Complion System. She actively educates and promotes awareness of Complion’s solution to clients and the research community.

Complion Free Educational Webinar
Wednesday, August 23, 2017 | 1:00pm - 2:00pm EST
Presented by: Lauren Kelley, CCRP, Associate Director of GCP Compliance at Polaris Compliance Consultants, Inc.
The clinical study space is competitive. Many sites are finding it difficult to win the studies they want to conduct. Recruitment is important, but enrollment estimates are meaningless if a Sponsor is unsure you can produce reliable data they can submit for product approval. This webinar will discuss what high quality, GCP-compliant site operations entail, and what Sponsors and CROs look for when awarding studies.
Attendees will learn:

What SOPs you should have
Developing a Quality Control process
Documentation of PI oversight
The importance of a CAPA program
Why you should consider having a mock FDA inspection
