The Board of Trustees have approved certain investment policy changes that would allow the Fund to invest up to 25% of their mandate in non-US REIT securities. This policy enhancement is designed to allow the Fund greater flexibility in pursuing their investment objectives. Under normal market circumstances, the Fund primarily invests in i) a) dividend-paying common stocks and b) dividend-paying common stocks issued by companies that derive at least 50% of their revenues from the ownership, construction, financing, management or sale of commercial, industrial or residential real estate ii) a) debt securities and other instruments that are issued by, or that are related to, government, government-related and supranational issuers located, or conducting their business, in emerging market countries and b) senior secured loans. It will invest at least 40%, but no more than 70% of its Managed Assets in equity security holdings and at least 30%, but no more than 60% of its Managed Assets in debt security holdings. The debt security investments will be at the time of investment, rated B or higher by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization or unrated but judged to be of comparable quality. However, it may invest up to 10% of its Managed Assets in those rateable securities rated below B or that are unrated but judged to be of comparable quality, except no more than 5% may be invested in such rateable securities rated below CCC or that are unrated but judged to be of comparable quality. Initially, the average credit quality of those rateable security holdings will be Ba and BB.

Glossary




Objective
The fund's investment objectives are high current income and total return.


Highlights

Balanced equity & debt strategy focused on providing current income & total return potential while reducing US interest rates sensitivity
Diversification potential – lower historical correlations among asset classes provides opportunity for more consistent returns

Managed by specialists in several non-traditional asset classes, providing retail income-oriented investors access to institutional strategies where active professional management can potentially add value to the fund’s total return




Investment Strategy
The fund invests approximately equal proportions in 1) U.S. and foreign dividend-paying common stocks, 2) dividend-paying common Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) issued by real estate companies, 3) emerging markets sovereign debt, and 4) adjustable rate senior loans. The fund expects to invest between 40% and 70% of its managed assets in equity security holdings and between 30% and 60% of its managed assets in debt security holdings. Under normal circumstances, the fund's target weighting is approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. The fund uses leverage.

RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Common Stock Risk: Common stock returns often have experienced significant volatility.Real Estate Securities Risk: Real estate securities such as REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) may be affected by economic downturns and changes in real estate values, rents, property taxes, interest rates and tax laws, in addition to geographical concentration risks.Senior Loan Risk: Senior loans, both secured and unsecured, may not be rated by a national rating agency, are  generally not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and generally are not listed on a securities exchange. Consequently, the amount of public information available about senior loans generally is less extensive than that available for more widely rated, registered and exchange-listed securities.  In addition, some adjustable rate loans may be unsecured or insufficiently collateralized, which increases the risk of fund losses if the loan’s issuer defaults.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.Foreign Investment Risk: Investments in non-U.S securities involve special risks not typically associated with domestic investments including currency risk, if not hedged - the risk that changes in exchange rates will affect the value of the fund’s investments, as well as adverse political, social and economic developments. These risks often are magnified in emerging markets.Leverage Risk: The fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share NAV, market price, and distributions.  Leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative. Leverage is intended to increase common share net income, but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.  Different forms of leverage, including swaps, may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk. Leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk, as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limits.Tax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.Preferred Securities Risk: Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.Basis Risk: As short-term rates change, interest from floating rate loans may not increase in concert with increases in floating rate leverage, introducing basis or imperfect hedging risk.Illiquid Securities Risk: The fund may not be able to sell securities in its portfolio at the time or price the fund desires.Currency Risk: Changes in exchange rates will affect the value of the fund’s investments.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






†† Managed Distribution Policy

				Historical distribution sources have included net investment income, realized gains and return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time which may be viewed at nuveen.com/CEFdistributions. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholders’ 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year. You should not draw any conclusions about a fund’s past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate.
			

				Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.
