Background







About John


                            I'm a product person with a background in software development.  I've built a couple of startups (one consumer, one business) and learnt a lot through the experience.  I ran products at Mimecast (enterprise SaaS company) which was an excellent experience during which I helped close our Series C round.  I am now working at Ordnance Survey where I'm responsible for digital mapping products.  I'm now working on a side project to create an awesomely useful enterprise mobile product powered by some clever machine learning tech.  I'm passionate about creating great products through customer development, relentlessly focus on metrics, have an attention to detail and a good understanding of marketing and sales enablement.  I love working on new ideas with smart people and only dream big.  I'm more hacker than engineer and am looking to find an equally passionate engineer and designer to work with.
