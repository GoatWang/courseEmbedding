Nicholas D. Varischetti assists businesses from a wide range of industries with their litigation, general business, and advisement needs. He is Of Counsel at the firm.
Whether it’s a newly formed entity or an established mid-market company, Mr. Varischetti takes a hands-on approach to understanding each client’s position within the framework of its business or industry.
Named a 2014 Fast Tracker by the Pittsburgh Business Times, Mr. Varischetti has handled various corporate and entity governance matters ranging from entity formation to Board of Directors advisement to business liquidation, with a focus on the construction and oil and gas industries. More specifically, he is experienced in financing transactions, commercial loans, and refinancing, as well as mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances.
Prior to joining Burns White full time as an attorney, Mr. Varischetti was a Summer Associate at Burns White and spent two years at the Allegheny County District Attorney’s office. He also interned in the office of the United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, clerked in the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s office, and worked at the Pennsylvania Senate.
Mr. Varischetti holds three degrees from the University of Pittsburgh, earning a Juris Doctor in 2011 with a Health Law Certificate, a Master’s in public administration from the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs in 2008, and a Bachelor’s Degree in political science and business management in 2006.
Mr. Varischetti is also a partner in Varischetti Holdings, LP, a family-owned and operated organization consisting of several different businesses, including real estate investments, powder metal manufacturing, a construction equipment dealership, an oil and gas field services company, and waste industry consulting.
Additionally, Mr. Varischetti is a shareholder and director of Guardian Elder Care Holdings, Inc., a health care provider with more than 40 nursing facilities, a rehabilitation services business, a long-term care pharmacy, and a home health company. He is also a member of the Board of Directors of Emclaire Financial Corp. and its subsidiary The Farmers National Bank of Emlenton, as well as a member of Varischetti Sports, LLC, which owns a minority interest in the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Outside of the legal profession, Mr. Varischetti is actively involved in the community as a member of the Board of Directors of Pittsburgh’s Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority (ICA), the Manchester Bidwell Corporation, The Frank Varischetti Foundation, and La Roche College’s Board of Trustees as Finance Chair. Furthermore, Mr. Varischetti participates in the Jack Heinz Society for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. He previously served on the Pittsburgh Urban Magnet Project (PUMP) Board of Directors, Every Child Inc. Board of Directors as Member and Chairperson, and the Greater Pittsburgh ATHENA Awards Committee.

Jessica Jurasko Named 2017 Woman of the Year by Duquesne University’s School of Law Women’s Law Association



Burns White attorney, Jessica M. Jurasko, was named the 2017 Woman of the Year by Duquesne University’s School of Law’s Women’s Law Association (WLA). The annual event, held Thursday, April 20th, recognizes a female alumna who has demonstrated leadership, integrity, service, sacrifice, and a commitment to actively seeking change and expanding opportunities for women within the legal profession. In addition, the recipient has influenced women to pursue legal careers, has opened doors that historically have been closed to women lawyers, and has earned the respect of her colleagues by exemplifying the highest ideals of the legal profession.
“This award is so meaningful to me because I was selected as Woman of the Year by the students,” said Ms. Jurasko. “I am hopeful that any young woman in less than ideal circumstances, who has that will ‘stirring within’ to aspire, can see me and know that she too could one day be standing before a crowded room full of wonderful people, having the privilege to work for one the largest and most successful law firms in Pittsburgh, as she receives the Woman of the Year Award from her beloved law school.”
Ms. Jurasko is a 2004 graduate of Duquesne University School of Law, and has been an active member of the school’s alumni association for more than a decade. She served as an elected member of the Board of Governors, and as the President of the Duquesne Law Alumni Association in 2015-2016. She focuses her practice at Burns White in the areas of Health Care and Long-Term Care, Litigation, and Professional Liability.

Burns White, in conjunction with Oxford Development Company, cut the ribbon on its new corporate headquarters in Pittsburgh’s Strip District neighborhood.
Known as Burns White Center, the firm’s new headquarters at 3 Crossings, a new neighborhood development, is a 110,000 square-foot building along Railroad Street and the Allegheny River. Burns White is the sole tenant of the facility.
“The move to 3 Crossings in the Strip District is an exciting step for Burns White as we continue to grow our business and footprint as an employer in Pittsburgh and beyond,” said David B. White. “We wanted a new and innovative space to accommodate the firm’s growth, creating a place that serves both our business and staff needs, while ultimately benefiting our clients.”
Burns White’s new space is different than more traditional law firm spaces, reflecting the needs of today’s workforce with a state-of-the-art building that focuses on collaborative work spaces, increased employee interaction, and efficiencies clients are looking for today. Additional amenities, such as a professional-grade fitness center and cafe with outdoor seating, provide places for employees to gather.

About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
