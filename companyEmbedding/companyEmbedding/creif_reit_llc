What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Standard package LLC fees include everything from the Economy package with a 15 business day turnaround, plus a company seal and binder, and 20 customized membership certificates. The Express Gold LLC formation package includes everything from the Standard package with a 7-10 business day turnaround, plus a Federal Tax ID (EIN) (discounted and expedited), a tax consultation with 1-800Accountant, and a 30-day trial of attorney advice.

KingSett Capital has teamed up with former competitor H&R Real Estate Investment Trust to acquire Canadian shopping mall owner Primaris Retail Real Estate Investment Trust. The Toronto, Ontario-based KingSett, a private equity firm focused on the real estate sector, leads an investor group that includes Ontario Pension Board. Under the terms of the new purchase offer, valued at nearly C$28 per Primaris unit, or close to C$5 billion in total, the KingSett  consortium and H&R will divide Primaris operational assets and properties.
PRESS RELEASE:
H&R Real Estate Investment Trust and H&R Finance Trust (collectively “H&R”) (TSX:  HR.UN) and Primaris Retail Real Estate Investment Trust (“Primaris”) (TSX:  PMZ.UN) and the KingSett Capital led consortium today announced that H&R and Primaris, together with PRR Investments Inc., have amended their previously announced arrangement agreement (dated January 16, 2013). Under the amended agreement (the “Amended Agreement”) the KingSett Capital led consortium will participate in the transaction by acquiring certain properties from Primaris. The KingSett Capital led consortium, which consists of certain KingSett Capital managed funds, Ontario Pension Board and RioCan REIT, will acquire 18 Primaris properties pursuant to separate purchase agreements between Primaris and the consortium members. 





Tom Hofstedter, CEO of H&R said, “We have created a stronger transaction for both H&R and Primaris unitholders. With this transaction, H&R will become Canada’s largest and leading diversified real estate investment trust, emulating the preferred real estate investment model adopted by large pension plans worldwide. The revised transaction will be accretive to H&R’s funds from operations, reduce its overall leverage ratio and increase market capitalization and liquidity, while allowing H&R to acquire a portfolio of high quality Canadian shopping centres and a valuable management platform.  Overall, this is a transformational transaction for H&R that provides considerable benefits for our unitholders.”
John Morrison, CEO of Primaris said, “From the onset of our process we set out to deliver superior value for our unitholders. The result of the two bidders for Primaris joining in this amended transaction has created an opportunity that provides a higher price than what was previously agreed upon. For the benefit of our unitholders, our process has clearly maximized value. The higher cash consideration in the amended transaction provides increased liquidity, meanwhile for those unitholders electing H&R Units, the transaction allows them the ability to maintain their investment in the REIT sector in a tax efficient manner.  We are pleased with the Amended Agreement and the value delivered through the process for our unitholders and other stakeholders.” 





Jon Love, Managing Partner of KingSett Capital said, “We are pleased to be partnering with H&R and working with Primaris on this amended transaction. We believe this is a very good outcome for all involved.”
KingSett Capital led consortium members Ontario Pension Board and RioCan also commented on the amended transaction:
Mark Fuller, CEO of Ontario Pension Board said, “The amended transaction agreement continues to meet our deal objectives of acquiring high quality real estate assets in support of our long-term investment strategy to increase our exposure to private market investments.”
Ed Sonshine, CEO of RioCan REIT added: “We are pleased to be participating in the amended transaction and the acquisition of interests in two prominent regional malls within the GTA.  The properties we have committed to purchase are fully aligned with our strategy and will further strengthen RioCan’s portfolio of enclosed malls.”
Transaction Details
Pursuant to the Amended Agreement, unitholders of Primaris will be entitled to elect to receive $28.00 in cash, subject to an aggregate cash consideration of approximately $1.28 billion or 1.166 stapled units of H&R (“H&R Units”), with approximately 65.2 million H&R Units to be issued in aggregate.
•In the event that Primaris unitholders elect either more or less cash or H&R Units than are available, the total consideration shall be prorated, with the actual consideration mix to be received by each unitholder adjusted to reflect the total elections
•Assuming full proration (all Primaris unitholders elect cash or all Primaris unitholders elect H&R Units), Primaris unitholders will receive $12.58 in cash and 0.642 H&R Units for each Primaris unit
•Based on H&R’s 20-day VWAP ended January 15, 2013 (the last trading day prior to the announcement of the prior H&R/Primaris transaction) of $23.99, the value of the fully prorated consideration received under the Amended Agreement will be $27.98 per Primaris unit, which represents a premium of approximately 21.4 percent to Primaris’ closing price of $23.04 on December 4, 2012 (the last trading day before KS Acquisition II LP announced its intention to make an offer for Primaris). Upon completion of the amended transaction, Primaris unitholders will own approximately 25 percent of H&R
•The amended transaction is structured so holders of Primaris units who are resident in Canada and who hold their Primaris units as capital property will receive their H&R Units on a substantially tax-deferred rollover (the receipt of H&R Finance Trust units, expected to be less than 4 percent of the total unit consideration, will be taxable)
H&R will acquire a $2.7 billion portfolio of 17 of Primaris’ existing shopping centres along with a further 9 properties valued at approximately $377 million that Primaris intends to acquire in advance of the close of the H&R and KingSett transaction. The remaining properties in Primaris’ existing portfolio will be acquired by members of the KingSett Capital led consortium and are valued at approximately $1.9 billion, including assumed debt. 





The previously announced KingSett Capital led consortium offer has been withdrawn in accordance with its terms and affiliates of KingSett Capital that own approximately 7 percent of Primaris units have agreed to support the Amended Agreement.
The Board of Trustees of Primaris and H&R have unanimously agreed to vote their units in favour of the Amended Agreement and to recommend that their respective unitholders vote in favour of the transaction.
Benefits to Primaris
•The amended transaction is financially superior for Primaris unitholders with the value of the consideration (assuming full proration) to be received per Primaris unit increased to $27.98, compared to $27.33 under the prior agreement (based on H&R’s 20-day ended January 15, 2013)
•Provides Primaris unitholders with an option to retain ownership in the Canadian enclosed shopping centre asset class or to elect to receive an immediate cash payment, subject to proration, described above
•The increase in aggregate cash consideration of approximately $578 million provides additional liquidity for those Primaris unitholders that elect to receive cash consideration
•Improves distributions by 24 percent from the current annualized rate of $1.27 to $1.57 for those Primaris units that are exchanged for H&R Units
•Substantially preserves the value of the professional management platform developed over the last 10 years
Benefits to H&R
•Unique opportunity to acquire a portfolio of 25 high quality Canadian shopping centres along with a strong professional management platform
•Financially attractive transaction that is expected to be approximately $0.02 accretive to Funds From Operations per unit and results in a deleveraging of H&R’s balance sheet from 52.1 percent to approximately 51.1 percent Debt to Fair Value
•Maintains H&R’s liquidity with cash available from undrawn bank facilities of approximately $550 million
•Broader portfolio diversification by geographic region, asset class and tenant base
•Increased market capitalization will result in substantially enhanced liquidity for unitholders
•Combines two businesses having similar philosophies with respect to asset and tenant qualities and a disciplined approach to real estate investing
Additional Details 





•The transaction continues to be structured as a Plan of Arrangement and is subject to the approval of 66 ? percent of Primaris units voted at a special meeting of Primaris unitholders and a majority of H&R Units voted at a special meeting of H&R unitholders
•Primaris to pay cash proceeds to its unitholders by way of a redemption of units using the proceeds from the KingSett asset sale transactions
•Special unitholder meetings of Primaris and H&R expected to be held in late March
•The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals (including under the Competition Act (Canada)), court approvals, required consents and other customary closing conditions. Assuming the requisite approvals are received and other conditions are met or waived, the transaction is expected to be completed in early April
•H&R and KingSett are entitled to an aggregate all-cash break fee of $100 million in certain circumstances, including the acceptance by Primaris of an unsolicited superior proposal from a third party
•H&R is entitled to receive customary deal protection provisions including a right to match any superior proposal that is received by Primaris on an unsolicited basis
•No acquisition, disposition or property management fees shall be payable to H&R’s property manager with respect to this transaction or for any future acquisition of enclosed shopping centres in Canada
•Holders of Primaris convertible debentures, prior to closing, will be entitled to convert their debentures in accordance with their terms and participate in the arrangement on the same basis as other unitholders and following closing, will be entitled to receive H&R Units upon conversion based on the exchange ratio contemplated by the transaction
•The circular to be mailed to Primaris unitholders will describe the material Canadian federal income tax considerations associated with the transaction.  Primaris unitholders are urged to carefully review these tax considerations and to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax effects to them of the transaction, having regard to their own particular circumstances
Primaris Independent Committee 





Canaccord Genuity, a financial advisor to the Primaris Independent Committee, has provided the Board of Trustees of Primaris with an opinion to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the limitations and qualifications therein, the consideration to be received under the Amended Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to Primaris unitholders.
The Independent Committee carefully considered a number of factors, including the terms of the transaction, the assets and business of H&R, the outcome of the global search process conducted, including the Independent Committee’s belief that it is very unlikely that a superior offer will emerge for all the outstanding units of Primaris, and the opinion of Canaccord Genuity in recommending the transaction to the Board of Trustees of Primaris.
Based in part on the recommendation of the Independent Committee and the other factors noted herein, the Board of Trustees of Primaris determined that the consideration to be received by Primaris unitholders under the Amended Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, and it would be in the best interests of Primaris to enter into the Amended Agreement.
Advisors
Canaccord Genuity and Evercore Partners were engaged by the Primaris Independent Committee as its financial advisors. McCarthy Tétrault LLP was engaged as counsel to the Independent Committee and to Primaris, and Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP was retained as counsel to Primaris.

TD Securities Inc. and CIBC World Markets were engaged by KingSett Capital as its financial advisors. Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP and Bennett Jones LLP were retained as its legal advisors.
Stikeman Elliott LLP and Fogler, Rubinoff LLP were retained by RioCan REIT as legal advisors.

FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION
This press release contains forward looking statements that reflect current expectations of each of Primaris, H&R and KingSett Capital about their future results, performance, prospects and opportunities, including with respect to the closing, costs and benefits of the proposed transaction and all other statements that are not historical facts. The timing and completion of the proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, termination rights and other risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, required regulatory, court, and unitholder approvals. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the proposed transaction will occur, or that it will occur on the timetable or on the terms and conditions contemplated in this news release. The proposed transaction could be modified, restructured or terminated. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking information. Each of Primaris, H&R and KingSett Capital has tried to identify these forward looking statements by using words such as “may”, “will”, “should” “expect”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “intend”, “plan”, “estimate”, “potentially” and similar expressions. By its nature, such forward looking information necessarily involves known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance, prospects and opportunities in future periods of Primaris, H&R or KingSett Capital to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. 





Non-GAAP Measures
The foregoing includes a reference to a non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) measure that should not be construed as an alternative to comprehensive income (loss) or cash provided by operations and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers as there is no standardized meaning of “funds from operations” under GAAP. Management of H&R believes that funds from operations is a meaningful measure of operating performance.  Readers are encouraged to refer to H&R’s combined MD&A for further discussion of this non-GAAP measure.”

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
