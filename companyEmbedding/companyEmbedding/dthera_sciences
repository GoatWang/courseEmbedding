SAN DIEGO, April 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Dthera Sciences (OTC: DTHR), a Digital Therapeutics company based in San Diego that is working to improve quality of life and reduce anxiety in patients with Alzheimer's and Dementia, announced the results of a clinical study conducted at University of California San Diego School of Medicine, which demonstrated positive results of its product, ReminX on patients with Alzheimer's and Dementia. The study was conducted by J. Vincent Filoteo, PhD, Professor of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology Section Chief in the Department of Psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine.








"The results of this proof-of-concept study are very promising and have the potential to help herald a new way to deliver a form of relief to patients suffering with dementia and related anxiety or depression. Our results indicate that the use of this software led to an immediate and significant decrease in anxiety and depression in our patients, which was also observed by their caregivers. These significant results, which were larger in magnitude than expected, form the basis to further investigate the neuropsychiatric mechanisms that underlie improved mood through the use of this software technology," stated Dr. Filoteo. "Digital therapeutics – the use of software to create a medical effect in patients – is an exciting new frontier for medicine," said Edward Cox, CEO of Dthera. "This study supports that ReminX be used to scale out otherwise labor-intensive medical practices. We are excited at the opportunity to get our product in the hands of as many patients as possible."
In the study, subjects were shown personalized video slideshow stories, which were created by the platform itself, displaying moments from various points in their life along with narration provided by family members.  
The underlying science behind the product is called "Reminiscence Therapy." Reminiscence Therapy (RT) is a well-known and well understood cognitive behavioral therapy, primarily used in the elderly, to both reduce anxiety and increase the quality of life in patients with dementia or those experiencing isolation. The therapy is usually provided either in a one-on-one setting or in groups. One of the key limitations to RT in the past is that it is very labor intensive, typically involving a family member or caregiver sitting with the patient manually going through the stories, and therefore is not easily scalable. 
The product enables an immediate implementation of the core features of Reminiscence Therapy that can be provided to patients at any time. Dthera allows for the key elements of the therapy to be delivered through a Digital Therapeutic software. Driven by a proprietary artificial intelligence engine, Dthera's software helps families populate stories so that patients in long term care facilities have constant access to personalized Reminiscence Therapy.
Study Abstract
This study examined the impact of a digital therapeutic software system on emotional functioning in a group of patients with Dementia. The digital therapeutic software is based on Reminiscence Therapy and allows the uploading of pictures and narration to create slideshow stories depicting important moments in the patient's life. Patients were evaluated in their home and the initial evaluation consisted of patients responding to questionnaires assessing their level of depression, anxiety, overall level of emotional distress, and health related quality of life. Patients' caregivers were also asked to rate the patient's level of emotional functioning. After the initial assessment, patients and their caregivers were instructed on how to use the digital therapeutic software and created a slideshow. Patients then viewed the slideshow and immediately after were re-assessed using the same set of questionnaires as prior to the viewing. Results indicated that patients reported significantly less anxiety, depression, and overall emotional distress after having viewed their story. Furthermore, patient's caregivers also reported that the patient appeared less emotionally distressed. The effect sizes for the significant results were typically large and ranged from 0.76 to 0.91 (effect sizes are used to quantify the magnitude of a statistical effect, with 0.50 typically being viewed as a moderate effect and 0.80 being considered a large effect of an intervention). These effect sizes, which were larger than anticipated, suggest that digital therapeutic software can have an immediate and positive impact on emotional functioning in patients with Dementia. In addition, the accessibility and ease of use of the software system suggests that this technology holds great promise for bringing important aspects of Reminiscence Therapy to patients with Dementia who are suffering from various mood symptoms.

Dthera Sciences Announces Results of Clinical Study of its Product ReminX






Apr 10, 2017, 8:00am EDT














SAN DIEGO, April 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Dthera Sciences (OTC: DTHR), a Digital Therapeutics company based in San Diego that is working to improve quality of life and reduce anxiety in patients with Alzheimer's and Dementia, announced the results of a clinical study conducted at University of California San Diego School of Medicine, which demonstrated positive results of its product, ReminX on patients with Alzheimer's and Dementia. The study was conducted by J. Vincent Filoteo, PhD, Professor of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology Section Chief in the Department of Psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine.
"The results of this proof-of-concept study are very promising and have the potential to help herald a new way to deliver a form of relief to patients suffering with dementia and related anxiety or depression. Our results indicate that the use of this software led to an immediate and significant decrease in anxiety and depression in our patients, which was also observed by their caregivers. These significant results, which were larger in magnitude than expected, form the basis to further investigate the neuropsychiatric mechanisms that underlie improved mood through the use of this software technology," stated Dr. Filoteo. "Digital therapeutics – the use of software to create a medical effect in patients – is an exciting new frontier for medicine," said Edward Cox, CEO of Dthera. "This study supports that ReminX be used to scale out otherwise labor-intensive medical practices. We are excited at the opportunity to get our product in the hands of as many patients as possible."
In the study, subjects were shown personalized video slideshow stories, which were created by the platform itself, displaying moments from various points in their life along with narration provided by family members.  
The underlying science behind the product is called "Reminiscence Therapy." Reminiscence Therapy (RT) is a well-known and well understood cognitive behavioral therapy, primarily used in the elderly, to both reduce anxiety and increase the quality of life in patients with dementia or those experiencing isolation. The therapy is usually provided either in a one-on-one setting or in groups. One of the key limitations to RT in the past is that it is very labor intensive, typically involving a family member or caregiver sitting with the patient manually going through the stories, and therefore is not easily scalable. 
The product enables an immediate implementation of the core features of Reminiscence Therapy that can be provided to patients at any time. Dthera allows for the key elements of the therapy to be delivered through a Digital Therapeutic software. Driven by a proprietary artificial intelligence engine, Dthera's software helps families populate stories so that patients in long term care facilities have constant access to personalized Reminiscence Therapy.
Study Abstract
This study examined the impact of a digital therapeutic software system on emotional functioning in a group of patients with Dementia. The digital therapeutic software is based on Reminiscence Therapy and allows the uploading of pictures and narration to create slideshow stories depicting important moments in the patient's life. Patients were evaluated in their home and the initial evaluation consisted of patients responding to questionnaires assessing their level of depression, anxiety, overall level of emotional distress, and health related quality of life. Patients' caregivers were also asked to rate the patient's level of emotional functioning. After the initial assessment, patients and their caregivers were instructed on how to use the digital therapeutic software and created a slideshow. Patients then viewed the slideshow and immediately after were re-assessed using the same set of questionnaires as prior to the viewing. Results indicated that patients reported significantly less anxiety, depression, and overall emotional distress after having viewed their story. Furthermore, patient's caregivers also reported that the patient appeared less emotionally distressed. The effect sizes for the significant results were typically large and ranged from 0.76 to 0.91 (effect sizes are used to quantify the magnitude of a statistical effect, with 0.50 typically being viewed as a moderate effect and 0.80 being considered a large effect of an intervention). These effect sizes, which were larger than anticipated, suggest that digital therapeutic software can have an immediate and positive impact on emotional functioning in patients with Dementia. In addition, the accessibility and ease of use of the software system suggests that this technology holds great promise for bringing important aspects of Reminiscence Therapy to patients with Dementia who are suffering from various mood symptoms.
