About
Terrestrial and celestial pocket globe. Geographical details on the terrestrial sphere show Tasmania labelled 'Diemans Land' and drawn as an island. In North America there is a label 'Sea 1772'. A total of five oceans are named. Astronomical details on the inside of the case show stars represented by different symbols, but a magnitude table is absent. The Milky Way is labelled, and two stars and two star groups are named. The 48 Ptolemaic constellations and four of the non-Ptolemaic constellations are drawn. Three of the southern constellations are drawn, as well as those of Plancius and all those of Hevelius, except Triangulum Minus. Not all the southern constellations are labelled.Thomas Patrick
