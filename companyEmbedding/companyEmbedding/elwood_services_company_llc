Review: Countertop Installation Service
2 years ago



Cut granite counter top so new stove top would fit where old one was replaced.
We purchased a new stove top which happened to be a few inches larger in depth than the old one so the granite needed to be cut so the new one would fit in the hole.  The old one had to be unplugged so the granite could be cut and Mr. Scott installed the granite back in 2007 so we knew he could unplug the old stove top and cut the granite.  He and his wife did an excellent job in getting the work done.  Both were very professional and did a great job.  It is great because he perform the original install of the granite 8 years ago and was very willing to return and do this job!!

Review: Plumber Service
2 years ago



Replaced the bathroom and basement bar countertops.  This included measuring, removing laminate countertops, installing the new granite countertops and backsplash and installing the undermounted sinks.
Granite Services were wonderful to work with from idea conception to the finished product.  They helped me pick out beautiful granite pieces, educated me on care, and completed the whole project within 2 weeks.  I will use them again.

Plumber reviews in Elwood

        Real People ~ Real Reviews ~ Real Results      




The service technician was very punctual and did a great job diagnosing my furnace. Although he did not offer to provide space heaters for the weekend, upon calling the office to request heaters, I was provided with two. After doing research into the warranty on my unit it turned out that my furnace and the part that broke was covered under an enhanced parts and labor warranty from the manufacturer. The company was very misinformed as to what the warranty covered and refused to provide me service under the enhanced warranty even though their website claims they are a factory authorized dealer. Due to the company's ignorance and complete disregard for customer service or doing the right thing, I was obligated to write this review and inform other potential customers to beware. 
 

            - Michael P.          




Went great did not have heat in our child's room. Provider name locked. came promptly and did some of the best work that I have ever seen (I work with contractors daily). Attention to detail was most important.Mo, Provider name locked. and Provider name locked. did were some of the hardest workers and fast that I have seen, never sacrificing quality. A plus roofing and Spartan electric came in to assist and also didn't disappoint with the same quality as AA plumbing. You won't be disappointed.
 

            - Andre B.          




Tech did not explain anything to me, instead just kept giving these huge quotes. I was supposed to replace toilet valves that were not even broken since the malfunctioning inlet valve-pvr may have damaged them- 4 toilets at $300.00 a pop-who has that kind of money?
I have had several plumbing stuff done through the years and this is my worst experience simply getting a quote. It was a complete waste of my time and money. Will never use them again
