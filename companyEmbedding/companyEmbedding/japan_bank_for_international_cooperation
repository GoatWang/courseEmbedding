Inauguration of the new JBIC[edit]
Following the passage of the Japan Finance Corporation Law on May 18, 2007, during the 166th Ordinary Session of the Diet, the international financial operations (IFOs) of Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) were merged with National Life Finance Corporation (NLFC), Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Finance Corporation (AFC), and Japan Finance Corporation for Small and Medium Enterprise (JASME) on October 1, 2008, to become a new policy-based financing institution, tentatively called Japan Finance Corporation (JFC).
To maintain the international trust and confidence enjoyed by previous JBIC, the international finance sector of JFC continued to use the name "Japan Bank for International Cooperation".[3]
Overview of the new JBIC from 2008 to 2012[edit]
Of the two types of operations conducted by the former JBIC, new JBIC took over IFOs in its international finance sector.
JBIC was the international wing of Japan Finance Corporation (JFC) from October 1, 2008 to April 1, 2012. "The predecessor of JBIC is the International Financial Operations of former JBIC. JFC once took over those IFOs in its international wing.

Mission[edit]
The new JBIC constituted the international finance sector of Japan Finance Corporation (JFC), a policy-based financing institution.
The new JBIC performs the following three functions to contribute to sound development of the international economy, including Japan:

Promote overseas development of strategically important natural resources
Support Japanese industry efforts to develop international business operations
Respond to financial disorder in the international economy

In addition to the above functions, the new JBIC will take over, on a separate account, financial operations for effective realignment of the US military forces stationed in Japan pursuant to the relevant special legislation.
Key operational principles[edit]
The new JBIC will conduct business operations based on the following principles:

Well-focused policy-based financing: As a policy-based financing institution, the new JBIC shall conduct speedy and well-focused operations based on policy needs in response to economic and financial situations in Japan and abroad.
Complementing private-sector financial institutions: To effectively perform the functions required for policy-based financing, the new JBIC shall take account of situations where private sector financial institutions are placed in their international finance activities and supplement them.
Sufficient revenues to cover expenditures: Pursuant to the Japan Finance Corporation Law, the new JBIC shall make efforts to maintain the financial soundness of its international finance operations.
Maintaining and improving international trust and confidence to conduct adequate international finance operations and effective funding operations, the new JBIC shall maintain and improve the international trust and confidence enjoyed by JBIC.
Conducting business operations by drawing on its expertise and initiatives: The new JBIC shall conduct operations by drawing on its own expertise and initiatives on international finance.


Operation[edit]
Former JBIC had mainly two ways of performing its loans: international financial operations (IFOs) and overseas economic operations (ODA). These operations were independent of each other and were clearly separated in the bank's financial statements.
The IFO operations include loans and equity participation in overseas projects of Japanese corporations, therefore contributing to Japanese activities overseas. These operations are aimed at both developed and developing countries. As of March 31, 2006, the IFO operations accounted for ¥985.5 billion.[4]
The ODA operations were aimed mainly at developing countries, especially those in Asia, which accounted for 15.8% of the bank's operations in 2004 fiscal year.[5] These operations provide long-term and low-interest loans to important projects that develop social structure and infrastructure of developing countries. The JBIC's financial assistance represented 40 percent of Japan's official development assistance. As of March 31, 2006, the ODA operations accounted for ¥770 billion.[4] These ODA operations were merged with Japan International Cooperation Agency in 2008.
As of March 2005, the country which had access to the most loans was Indonesia, followed by China and the Philippines. Brazil was the most benefited from South American countries, holding the sixth place in the bank's investments.[6]

Japan Bank for International Cooperation

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (国際協力銀行, Kokusai Kyōryoku Ginkō), or JBIC, is a Japanese public financial institution and export credit agency that was created on October 1, 1999, through the merger of the Japan Export-Import Bank (JEXIM) and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF).[1]
JBIC became the international wing of the Japan Finance Corporation (JFC) (日本政策金融公庫, Nihon seisaku kin-yu kohko) (administered by the Ministry of Finance) established on October 1, 2008. It became independent again from JFC on April 1, 2012. The bank is wholly owned by the Japanese government, and its budget and operations are regulated by the JBIC law. It is headquartered in Tokyo and operates in 18 countries with 21 offices. The main purpose of the institution is to promote economic cooperation between Japan and overseas countries by providing resources to foreign investments and by fostering international commerce. It has a major role in promoting Japanese exports and imports, and the country's activities overseas. The bank's presence can be seen both in developed and developing countries. It tries to contribute to the stability of the international financial order and to the promotion of sustainable development. It follows a policy of not competing with ordinary financial institutions. The bank was one of the instruments of Japan's official development assistance (ODA), which contributes to the execution of the country's foreign policy. As it aims at sustainable development, JBIC is concerned about social and environmental issues,[2] and requires environmental impact assessment studies to provide funding to any project.

Inauguration of the new JBIC[edit]
Following the passage of the Japan Finance Corporation Law on May 18, 2007, during the 166th Ordinary Session of the Diet, the international financial operations (IFOs) of Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) were merged with National Life Finance Corporation (NLFC), Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Finance Corporation (AFC), and Japan Finance Corporation for Small and Medium Enterprise (JASME) on October 1, 2008, to become a new policy-based financing institution, tentatively called Japan Finance Corporation (JFC).
To maintain the international trust and confidence enjoyed by previous JBIC, the international finance sector of JFC continued to use the name "Japan Bank for International Cooperation".[3]
Overview of the new JBIC from 2008 to 2012[edit]
Of the two types of operations conducted by the former JBIC, new JBIC took over IFOs in its international finance sector.
JBIC was the international wing of Japan Finance Corporation (JFC) from October 1, 2008 to April 1, 2012. "The predecessor of JBIC is the International Financial Operations of former JBIC. JFC once took over those IFOs in its international wing.

Mission[edit]
The new JBIC constituted the international finance sector of Japan Finance Corporation (JFC), a policy-based financing institution.
The new JBIC performs the following three functions to contribute to sound development of the international economy, including Japan:

Promote overseas development of strategically important natural resources
Support Japanese industry efforts to develop international business operations
Respond to financial disorder in the international economy

In addition to the above functions, the new JBIC will take over, on a separate account, financial operations for effective realignment of the US military forces stationed in Japan pursuant to the relevant special legislation.
Key operational principles[edit]
The new JBIC will conduct business operations based on the following principles:

Well-focused policy-based financing: As a policy-based financing institution, the new JBIC shall conduct speedy and well-focused operations based on policy needs in response to economic and financial situations in Japan and abroad.
Complementing private-sector financial institutions: To effectively perform the functions required for policy-based financing, the new JBIC shall take account of situations where private sector financial institutions are placed in their international finance activities and supplement them.
Sufficient revenues to cover expenditures: Pursuant to the Japan Finance Corporation Law, the new JBIC shall make efforts to maintain the financial soundness of its international finance operations.
Maintaining and improving international trust and confidence to conduct adequate international finance operations and effective funding operations, the new JBIC shall maintain and improve the international trust and confidence enjoyed by JBIC.
Conducting business operations by drawing on its expertise and initiatives: The new JBIC shall conduct operations by drawing on its own expertise and initiatives on international finance.


Operation[edit]
Former JBIC had mainly two ways of performing its loans: international financial operations (IFOs) and overseas economic operations (ODA). These operations were independent of each other and were clearly separated in the bank's financial statements.
The IFO operations include loans and equity participation in overseas projects of Japanese corporations, therefore contributing to Japanese activities overseas. These operations are aimed at both developed and developing countries. As of March 31, 2006, the IFO operations accounted for ¥985.5 billion.[4]
The ODA operations were aimed mainly at developing countries, especially those in Asia, which accounted for 15.8% of the bank's operations in 2004 fiscal year.[5] These operations provide long-term and low-interest loans to important projects that develop social structure and infrastructure of developing countries. The JBIC's financial assistance represented 40 percent of Japan's official development assistance. As of March 31, 2006, the ODA operations accounted for ¥770 billion.[4] These ODA operations were merged with Japan International Cooperation Agency in 2008.
As of March 2005, the country which had access to the most loans was Indonesia, followed by China and the Philippines. Brazil was the most benefited from South American countries, holding the sixth place in the bank's investments.[6]

Financial Instruments


JBIC's mission is to contribute to the sound development of Japan and international economy and society by conducting financial operation in the following four fields:


Promoting the overseas development and securement of resources which are important for Japan
Maintaining and improving the international competitiveness of Japanese industries
Promoting the overseas business having the purpose of preserving the global environment, such as preventing global warming
Preventing disruptions to international financial order or taking appropriate measures with respect to damages caused by such disruption


JBIC will provide support for the development of Japan and international economy to meet their increasingly diverse financing needs through its variety of financial products and other services.


Export Loans
Export loans support Japanese plant, ship and technology exports.


Import Loans

Import loans support the import of strategically important goods by Japanese firms, including oil, natural gas (such as LNG) and iron ore. The guarantee facility is available for the import of goods other than natural resources.


Overseas Investment Loans
JBIC provides overseas investment loans to meet long-term financing needs of Japanese firms for their international business development, including projects that will establish/expand production bases and develop natural resources overseas.


Untied Loans
Untied loans are loans not conditional on procurement of equipment and materials from Japan. These loans finance projects and programs primarily in developing countries; the imports they need; and their efforts to achieve balance-of-payments equilibrium or stabilize currencies.


Equity Participations

JBIC supports overseas business operations of its clients by participating in their equity investments. Interested Japanese business firms should contact specific international finance departments for more information.


Guarantees

JBIC issues guarantees for loans extended by private financial institutions, public bonds issued by governments and other public entities in developing countries and corporate bonds issued by overseas Japanese subsidiaries and affiliates.


Studies

JBIC conducts feasibility and other studies in the early stage of the projects undertaken in developing and resource-endowed countries.



Energy and Natural Resource Financing
Japan needs to build up stable economic relations with countries endowed with natural resources and provide vigorous cooperation for their resource development projects.

Guarantees


In addition to loans and equity participations, JBIC provides support through its guarantee facility. Guarantees are provided for loans extended by private financial institutions, bonds issued by governments of developing countries or overseas Japanese companies, as well as for currency swap transactions. JBIC also issues reassurance for guarantees from export credit agencies in other countries.
Types of Guarantees
Guarantees for Imports of Manufactured Products
JBIC has a guarantee facility for the borrowings made by Japanese companies to finance the import of aircraft and other manufactured products that are vital for Japan.

Guarantees for Corporate Bonds Issued by Japanese Affiliates
JBIC supports Japanese affiliates operating overseas by providing guarantees for the bonds they issue in local capital markets.

Guarantees for Co-financing, Overseas Syndicated Loans and Public Sector Bonds
Loans to developing countries involve, among others, currency conversion and transfer risks, as well as country risks. Guarantees that JBIC issues to cover such risks will enable Japanese private financial institutions to provide medium- and long-term financing for developing countries, and contribute to developing countries to bringing in private capital and facilitating private companies to expand international business activities.

Guarantees for Currency Swaps
JBIC provides guarantees for swap transactions to support the local currency financing of overseas infrastructure projects and other projects undertaken by Japanese companies.

Counter Guarantees for Export Credits
In the cases where Japanese companies export machinery and equipment jointly with companies of another country, JBIC provides a counter guarantee for the guarantee provided by that country's export credit agency (ECA). This function enables JBIC to flexibly support export projects by Japanese companies collaborating with foreign companies through multilateral mutual guarantee schemes.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018                                                   Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) - BNamericas                                                         About us   Contact    Store    Advertising   Customized Research    BNamericas Wire   Help   Language:   EN    English  Spanish      Start a Free Trial                   News Projects Companies Reports Data                        Close  Recovery Password    Email for your account           Send password                 ×   This information is available only to subscribers.
