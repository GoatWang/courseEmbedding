  "Access to information is becoming quicker and faster, and new        technologies and capabilities are emerging every day" 



BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) announced today two appointments to 
      further strengthen its information and technology capabilities and 
      accelerate its digital service offerings.
    

      Chris Perretta, who previously served as chief information officer 
      (CIO), has been promoted to a newly created position as global head of 
      enterprise data and technology. Perretta will be responsible for 
      advancing State Street’s technology strategy and combining data and 
      insights to deliver new digital tools and platforms for clients. State 
      Street announced last month that it was accelerating the next phase of 
      its transformation program, and Perretta will play an integral role in 
      developing the strategy towards an end vision of an organization that is 
      digitally integrated across infrastructure, workflows, products and data.
    

      Antoine Shagoury has been appointed to executive vice president and 
      global CIO, reporting to Perretta. Shagoury joins State Street from the 
      London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) where he was group chief information 
      and group chief operating officer for the past five years. At LSEG, he 
      had global responsibility for all technology and operations across 
      capital markets, information and data services, and post trade.
    

      “Access to information is becoming quicker and faster, and new 
      technologies and capabilities are emerging every day,” said Mike Rogers, 
      president of State Street Corporation. “Industry leadership will be 
      defined by those companies that provide a true real-time digital 
      experience to strengthen investment processes and decisions and 
      demonstrate continual innovation. Chris’ efforts have been instrumental 
      to the design and development of our digital business and he is well 
      positioned to drive our success in the future.”
    

      “Antoine has a twenty year history in driving change in high-volume, 
      real-time and mission critical global environments,” said Perretta. “He 
      has led successful technology efforts at two stock exchanges and has 
      been an advocate in pursuing disruptive technologies, most recently in 
      block-chain opportunities. Antoine’s extensive technical and operational 
      experience and significant industry knowledge will be a tremendous asset 
      to State Street as we drive the next phase of our digital 
      transformation.”

Adding the COO role to the CIO job
Maximising the performance of the trading platform
Reducing development time
Industrialising trading technology


London Stock Exchange CIO Antoine Shagoury – who recently added COO to his job title – tells Computer Weekly about the balancing act of managing corporate IT and ensuring the company’s core business of providing trading services has the right technology to make it competitive in a sector that doesn’t stand still for a microsecond.

The London Stock Exchange is using its core technology to become an investment industry service provider that offers companies both industrialised trading technology and direct trading services.








Antoine Shagoury joined the London Stock Exchange in February 2010 as CIO. His first job was to oversee the replacement of legacy trading platform, Tradelect, with the MillenniumIT system the London Stock Exchange acquired when it took over the Sri-Lanka based trading software maker for £18m in September 2009.

Adding the COO role to the CIO job
He was recently appointed COO and but retained his CIO role. His deep understanding of the technology will enable him to manage the integration of the exchange’s different businesses, which rely heavily on technology.
The CIO component of his role is also split in two. On the one hand he manages the technology that keeps the business running. Here he focuses on efficiencies. He spends about 15% of his time on this and has about 70 IT staff globally working on projects such as virtualisation, the introduction of business intelligence tools and using cloud-based CRM and collaboration software.
On the other hand he is in charge of the systems that drive the business, to which he dedicates considerably more of his time. He has about 1,000 staff in this part of the business – which includes the provision of software to other trading venues – of which 200 staff have been added only in the last two years. Most are Sri Lanka-based software developers.
Shagoury says less time is required for corporate IT, because it is more stable. As his operational role increases, he is looking at ways to reduce the time spent on his corporate IT role, helping management in different divisions take on a more strategic technology role. 
“We will empower the leaders of different pillars of the business to take on a more strategic technology role,” says Shagoury.


Maximising the performance of the trading platform
In contrast, heading up technology at the exchange puts him in charge of customer-facing systems, none more important than the core trading platform. Since the London Stock Exchange migrated to the MillenniumIT platform in February 2011, it has run smoothly. In the last 12 months it has had no downtime.

The certainty is in stark contrast to the last couple of years of the .Net based Tradelect system, which experienced numerous high-profile outages. The London Stock Exchange management realised it had reached the end of its life, in a fast-changing sector and acted quickly to replace it.
Now the core trading platform provides what Shagoury describes as the three Cs of certainty, continuity and capacity to customers, he is focused on adding services, using the same platform that give customers industrialised packages that can be adapted to fit their requirements.
“All of this is possible now that the right technology is in place. In the past we were limiting the business that could be done,” says Shagoury. Today the Millennium software provides an extensible platform.
There are constant attempts to maximise performance.


Reducing development time
A few years ago when new exchanges, known as Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTF), appeared – following the liberalisation of the market – there was a race to be the fastest. 
Reducing trading times, or latency as it is known, is an important differentiator to investment firms that use algorithmic software to automate massive volumes of trades. Milliseconds can make a huge difference.
Today, after reducing latency to about 100 microseconds, from Tradelect's 3.7 milliseconds, there is less focus on speed. But the exchange’s software teams are busier than ever developing software to give customers more services and confidence.
“We are improving latency all the time – but it is not about speed, but better risk control, reporting and data,” says Shagoury.
The exchange uses agile software development techniques to introduce services to its customers in days rather than months. 
“Over the last year we have created tighter working groups and teams,” says Shagoury. Working thus, the business gets a real-time view of the development process and prototypes are created quickly.
Much of the focus is to push the technical capability of the core system to the periphery to improve tools such as those to collect and distribute data and this to protect the market from potentially risky volatility. 
Other ongoing developments include the introduction of common market and data access and the embedding of more intelligence into hardware.


Industrialising trading technology
At the same time, the company’s software supplies business, MillenniumIT – which grew about 10% last year – is focused on industrialising trading technology.

Shagoury says the business wants to create systems that do not always have to be bespoke, but are flexible enough to be off-the-shelf. 
“We can ask customers what bits they want and we put them together,” says Shagoury. But he says systems for the trading sector must enable exchanges to customise. 
“We can provide a common solution and exchanges can customise it, so they don’t lose their identity.”
He says the supplies business is picking up new customers all the time and, as more and more exchanges start using the MillenniumIT platform, the better the exchange becomes at migrations. 
This is largely down to the industrialised nature of the software. As well as moving its own trading venues onto MillenniumIT, such as Milan-based exchange Borsa Italiana, it has also recently moved the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and Mongolian Stock Exchange to the platform.
“We are getting faster and faster delivering systems because it is industrialised,” adds Shagoury.
The fast-moving technology nature of the trading sector is rewarding for IT professionals. Shagoury’s advice to IT professionals of the future that have ambitions in the trading sector is to build a strong understanding of the business. 
“It is no good being a pure technology professional because you have to understand how to apply it,” says Shagoury.

When Antoine Shagoury took on the role of CIO at the London Stock Exchange, he embarked on an ambitious program of reform at the venerable, but embattled, institution. Several years on, he reveals how technology is driving the growth of the entire business. By James Rundle
The last 10 years have been a period of intense reflection and change for every traditional stock exchange. Fragmentation of liquidity in Europe following the implementation of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid), and the rise of multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) such as Bats and Chi-X, threaten these institutions’ existence. Antoine Shagoury, CIO at the London Stock Exchange (LSE), found this challenge exciting rather than daunting.
The first thing that attracted him to the role was LSE CEO Xavier Rolet and the senior management team’s vision of the future of the market and exchanges. Shagoury knew he could help make that vision a reality. “I was prepared to change the tires on a truck moving at 60 miles per hour,” he says. “We took a calculated risk to build a system that would position us as the fastest exchange in the world, and we turned our own world upside down to do it. We rebuilt the exchange from the inside out, from physical infrastructure systems, and messaging protocols, all the way through the organization and operating culture—everything was changed.”
That reform was long overdue—and sorely needed. For several years, technical hitches and misfires with its electronic trading system, TradElect, threatened the LSE’s reputation for being a solid business that paired reliability with location, presence and resources. The exchange hadn’t reacted with enough speed to a rapidly transforming market.
“We didn’t have much choice,” Shagoury says. “We had to do something, and we had to do it soon. We were facing a growing technical challenge from our competitors—we weren’t on a par with the speed of accessing our market and providing execution certainty to our clients.  You can’t sustain your business like that, and as a primary market, you have to be able to facilitate the business that clients are demanding.”
The challenge with such a large-scale reformation stemmed from the technical aspects as well as in maintaining the operation of the business. The exchange’s public image was just as important, and it necessitated a complex process by which the visual persona of the LSE continued to project its presence, while it changed its footing to become as nimble as its most agile competitor, and as trusted as the most dependable institution.
Adding Value
Such an ambitious project required someone with a deep and abiding connection to and understanding of business and technology. Shagoury didn’t always fit the bill. In high school, he considered a career in corporate law, and later found himself attracted to architecture. Finance was in his blood, however, as his father worked in the retail side of the industry, and it was while helping him at work that Shagoury found his niche.
“My real introduction to technology was working with my father as a teenager at his bank in New York,” he explains. “At that time, there was a real push to adopt inter-networking in retail banking, and mortgage and loan origination was begin automated, and I was a free resource. I found that I enjoyed going through the technicalities, such as getting systems up and running—even from the most basic level of connectivity and networking, applications and configurations. I really enjoyed it.”
Thus, Shagoury switched to designing systems rather than buildings, and working with digital plumbing rather than lead piping. While at college in Rochester, NY, his course gave him a perfect combination of the technical aspects that he’d enjoyed so much before, as well as education on how it intertwined with business practices.
Following his graduation and two years at Datastream Corp., Shagoury joined agency broker Instinet, which helped to instill in him a philosophy about business practice that he has carried throughout his career. The culture at Instinet was such that Shagoury was constantly asked where he thought he could add value. “They never limited you,” he says.
As a result, he was able to work in almost every area of the business—from the trading floors to technical operations. “That excitement—that adrenaline—only added to the personal attraction,” he says.
Shagoury spent a decade at Instinet, interacting with clients and learning his trade through constant feedback from end users. His progression from the position of manager in advanced client-site engineering through to CTO prepared him for taking on his next role at the American Stock Exchange (Amex) in 2003, first as a consultant and then as both an executive vice president and CIO.
At Amex it was a turnaround—Shagoury would design systems, implement them, and then receive instant feedback from the floor traders about what worked and what didn’t. It was a development ecosystem of sorts that worked in a cyclical loop. Amex was eventually bought by the New York Stock Exchange, where Shagoury continued specializing in the business side of operations management. Then, in 2010, the London Stock Exchange came calling.
Quantum Leap
One aspect of Shagoury’s personality that helps to explain his success at the LSE is his boundless energy. He doesn’t sit still for long, he thinks quickly, he talks fast, and his sense of humor colors every point he makes and every memory he relates.
It’s no surprise that his reforms had a remarkably short gestation and implementation period. The LSE Group bought MillenniumIT in 2009 to strengthen its technology division, and had seen success in terms of speed and reliability, but it had to force through technical migration to the platform speedily in order to stay competitive. Expanding on that, other exchanges—such as Oslo Børs last year—have also adopted it.
In all, the LSE has completed five migrations, the most notable being the Millennium rollout of the Turquoise MTF, followed by the main cash markets in the UK.
“I don’t think anyone in the market has ever done what we’ve done in such a short time period,” he says. “Everything we’ve tried to do has been competitively level-setting and feeds directly back into the business. We had legacy platforms running the UK cash equity markets, the retail bond markets, and we had to introduce change. But that wasn’t small change—it was a quantum change. We were rebuilding everything, from the physical connections and the means of accessing our systems to the protocols and languages that our clients use to connect to us. Then we were changing the actual systems themselves. We changed our market, delivered an extensible platform, reduced operating costs and complexity, and decreased latencies by an order of magnitude, and that was anything but a simple process. When you’re dealing with hundreds of clients—global institutions—you have to introduce that type of change in a way that isn’t destructive to their business, their clients or to our markets.”
All of this was done over the course of one year, and in technical terms, it was four major structural overhauls of the LSE’s system architecture—a phenomenal technological shift by any standard.
Growth Engine
As the technology changed, so too did the focus of the entire business. The LSE’s most recent results showed that its technology services division grew by 15 percent in a 12-month period, led by the success of MillenniumIT.
Fundamentally, the LSE is still a place where clients are brought to market to raise capital, and that will never change, Shagoury says. But the ways in which the business as a whole will grow in the future are being driven by the technological aspects and services that the LSE can provide.
“We’re the facilitator of the business, and technology has become the engine that drives the business forward,” he says. “The acquisition of MillenniumIT has made us more technically flexible and responsive to client needs. There are simple aspects such as performance and capacity, but we have to bring it to the next level, working with customers to develop new products and services. With this growth, the new challenge is to remain technically current, and that’s not taken lightly. Now we’re at that point, and we have to ask how we can harvest that maturity and the technical currency, and keep delivering value to our business, our clients and our marketplace.”
Diversification is one of the key areas in which the LSE has managed this. Along with its MillenniumIT migrations, the exchange’s UnaVista system for post-trade services has grown significantly, along with its other technology-based offerings, such as its MTF, Turquoise.
The ability of the LSE to create new index-linked products and synthetic instruments rapidly, and demonstrate them to clients, says Shagoury, is also a growth point for the immediate future. With regulatory reform at full speed in Europe and the US, he sees this as an area in which the LSE can expand.
“I think there are  tremendous opportunities in risk management and surveillance. I don’t mean the fundamental functions that people immediately think of, but rather technical automation and providing the tools to enhance management of market and member interaction—‘regulating’ the market”  he says. “Can you manage notional risk at a user, desk, firm and market level, and can you calculate it in real time? While you’re trading on our markets, can you detect fat-finger errors or programmatic errors on trading strategies or algorithms?  That’s an area where we can grow, and I think it’s a huge opportunity for the exchange, the LSE Group, and even the industry. Enhancing the ways we can match speed with market management certainty brings confidence back to the market, and ultimately investors back to it—not just institutions, but real individual investors.”
Community Service
Along with revamping from the inside out, the LSE has also had upsets on the business side in recent times. Nasdaq OMX launched a hostile takeover bid in 2007 that the LSE managed to fend off, while its own proposed merger with the TMX Group fell through in mid-2011.
Since then, however, it has established more unique initiatives and has pursued a program of acquisition. Last month, after a lengthy discussion period, the LSE posted a bid for a majority stake in LCH.Clearnet, which remains subject to shareholder approval. The deal would allow the exchange to capitalize on regulatory reform for the trading of derivatives. The LSE has also been linked, along with the Singapore Exchange, with a bid for the London Metal Exchange in media reports, although it declines to comment on this.
The LSE also recently announced a project to post real-time share data on Google, an aspect of information dissemination that—coupled with the LSE Group’s purchase of FTSE, and the ability it now has to create new synthetics—plays into the idea of market improvement.
“The way I look at the Google agreement is that it’s building the market, not just from the professional side but from the investor side,” Shagoury says. “Opening the market so people understand what’s happening is part of our commitment, our obligation. It’s fundamental to the growth of capital markets, driving information down to the individual investors. If you look at some of the established retail markets, the investor is a real driving force, and that’s what you want to promote here too.”
This idea of a more communal approach to market economics through technology and other areas appeals to Shagoury. “Capitalism is about wealth creation, and we’re a part of that process, but we’re also part of the economic community,” he says. “This community is global, of course, but we’re no less obligated to help support stability in that community. There’s balance there. It’s a great job that we have—we have to think and act globally.  We can’t be biased toward one market. This is, again, one of those companies where you have a rare opportunity to contribute, and if you couple that with a top-down desire to drive a bottom-up contribution to change, that’s a great combination in any business.”
Career Defining
For Shagoury, who describes himself as challenge-driven, this has been the project of a lifetime. He cites his background at Instinet and Amex, and coming from a supportive family, where the emphasis was always placed on doing what you love, as reasons why he is where he is today.
So what would Shagoury’s ideal job be? “You know, I actually have no idea,” he says. “I love what I do, and I can’t see it stopping unless I run out of energy.”
Luckily for the LSE, that seems unlikely.

The 2016 Tech 50: Antoine Shagoury

							The State Street global chief information officer falls to No. 25 on this year’s Tech 50 ranking.
						








      < The 2016 Tech 50







        25
      

        Antoine Shagoury
      

        Global Chief Information Officer
      

        State Street Corp.
      

        Last Year: 18
      



    After five years as chief information officer of London Stock
    Exchange Group  the last three also as chief operating
    officer  Antoine Shagoury joined State
    Street Corp. last fall as executive vice president and global
    chief information officer. The 46-year-old succeeded 
    Christopher Perretta (No. 17 last year), who had seen the
    Boston-based company through a five-year, cloud-oriented
    technology transformation and this April joined MUFG Americas
    Holdings Corp. as chief information and operations officer.
    Late last year State Street put a group of business analysts
    and technologists together in an emerging technologies
    center. Its mission is to identify and test technologies
    that could have a significant and potentially disruptive
    long-term impact on the firm, which as of March 31 had $27
    trillion in assets under custody and administration and $2
    trillion under management. We find ourselves in the
    center of a perfect storm, says Shagoury, who before
    his London stint was CIO of the American Stock Exchange and
    chief technology officer of Instinet. Our digital
    transformation has brought a convergence of technological
    change and adoption opportunities to build into our
    future. The xcenter, as its called, is
    exploring such frontiers as artificial intelligence, autonomic
    computing and blockchain. State Street has been experimenting
    with blockchain in internal software development and as a
    participant in the R3CEV consortium (see 
    David Rutter, No. 18) and the Post-Trade Distributed Ledger
    Group. While were continuously developing more
    efficient and secure ways of safeguarding data, as an industry
    we still rely heavily on human intervention for data
    processing, which requires time, cost and energy,
    Shagoury says. Ideally, blockchain would give us the
    ability to offer products to our clients faster and, more
    importantly, even more securely.
