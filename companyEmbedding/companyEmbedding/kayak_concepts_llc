 • They say there are upwards of 11 million
paddlers in America.   We’re not sure who “they” are but that’s a lot of folks with kayaks!
• And a lot of gear – PFD’s, paddles  and such, to lug around every time you feel the want – or have the need to simply put in and chill out.
• Kayak Condos® eliminates all that  pre-paddle hassle, leading  to “paddle procrastination”.   That’s not why you bought a kayak, right?
• We’re also promoting the re-thinking and enhancement of waterfronts everywhere –
employing Kayak Condos® – in what we call “PaddleParks”.
• Our mission is simple:  We’re  endeavoring to get lots more people into kayaks by making it easier to get lots more kayaks into water.
 Oh – and one more thing: 
Kayak Condos® are made in
America, and always will be.

1Target Customers

Commercial Customers: In our first year of operation, our customers are municipalities and marinas, who will purchase our product at the "wholesale" prices listed on our website and either lease or rent Kayak Condos to those willing to pay a bit more for convenience we've been talking about – the ability and benefit of accessing one's kayak more easily and therefore being able to use it more often.  


Retail Customers: As we evolve and gain distributors, the private individual (kayaker) becomes a customer.  At this time, Kayak Condos are only sold wholesale on pallets of 6.  As our manufacturing costs decreases with greater volume, a retailer's markup emerges.  Ideal distributor profile would be lumber and building supply centers who will profit from a (1) retail markup, (2) proper installation labor and (3) substructure lumber and tie-down (cable or strapping) materials.  More regarding proper installation is on our website.

2The Problem or Challenge We Solve

We solve
two major problems:


	1. The inconvenient nature of
transporting kayaks to water. Loading, hauling, and unloading a kayak can be a
pain - and doing it twice in one day is even worse. Our Kayak Condos provides
an easy solution. Visitors to the waterfront can rent or lease a Kayak Condo to
store their kayaks and all their equipment. That way they can not only spend
more time in the water that day, but their incentivized to visit more because
of the convenience of it.


	2. Thousands of kayaks are stolen
every year, which breaks our hearts. We offer a safe and secure way to store
kayaks and gear to prevent theft.


	The following is an excerpt
from a letter was written by a customer operating substantial kayak rental
operations in both Boston and Washington DC and plans to move into the Florida
market: 


"In the areas we operate in
there is also a high demand for private storage of personal kayaks. However, the
racks we use now are made of wood, unsightly and not very secure. Kayak
Condos solve this problem. We envision working with Buddy and his team to
provide over 200 Kayak condos for rent in the DC metro area alone. We currently
have 110 spots on our wood racks and there is a waiting list. It's been
great to see Buddy take his idea from concept to actual execution. I was lucky
enough to meet Buddy over 6 years ago and give him feedback and see this idea
grow."


	Thanks, Michael

3Our Solution Details

	Self-contained, convenient, safe and secure kayak storage modules.  Think "gym lockers" for kayaks. 


	Kayak Condos will also help our initial target customers, the site managers who will lease or rent Kayak Condos, will be able to enhance their waterfront locations and drive frequency of visitation.  No public waterfront in the world doesn't want more visitor activity – simply because, they "buy things" while they are there.  They rent boats, buy drinks and refreshments, perhaps other merchandise.  Now they can also rent a Kayak Condo and keep their kayaks there so as to access and use them more often, and buy those aforementioned items more often.  All this goes to enhancing waterfront revenue. 


	We are also introducing the concept of "PaddleParks" to our commercial customers, offering planning and design services, as a solution to help them boost visitation and revenue.  These "PaddleParks" are areas dedicated to kayakers - similar to a dog park for dogs and their owners - a comfortable place for kayakers to come to relax, enjoy their kayaks, and connect with other kayak enthusiasts. 

4The Market Opportunity

	Our market opportunity is global.  We have had inquiries from as far away as Australia and as romantic as Ireland.  This past summer, I even received an inquiry from Baghdad.

5Our Competition

	None – there is no competition for our product ANYWHERE!  We need to market aggressively and move as quickly as we can to become the "bell cow," "the first word," "the leader"  in convenient, safe and secure kayak storage.

6How We Make Money

	Details are inherent within our Proforma statement.


	We feel we have outlined a very reasonable picture of operating expenses as well as sales predictions.  Our overhead is practically nil. We work out of a home office – a tremendous advantage in the heart of a Maine winter.  Part of how we make money is selling a product that makes the buyer money.  The buyer sets rental or lease fees predicated on his location.  A Kayak Condo on a small lake in Maine is going to lease for less than a Kayak Condo on Biscayne Bay.  We only wish we could sell Kayak Condos commensurate with where they will be rented.  But by positioning Kayak Condos to our core customer as a "money-making tool," we'll do well.  Add to that the idea of increasing foot traffic on waterfronts and we have a unique selling proposition to propose and offer.

7Long-Term Plan

	Our goal is to get more people into more kayaks and in the water more – everywhere!  Eventually, we'd like to build relationships distributors.  Our ideal distributor would be a lumber building materials company who would profit from a fair markup on our product, the proper installation (labor team) to install our product, and the building materials on which Kayak Condos must be placed for proper installation and performance. 


	Initially, we need those commercial public and private venues, and perhaps a few resorts to get the product in front of the public to see and experience. Then we can move to sales to individuals through Dealers (distributors). 

8Return on Investment

	Our financial forecast included in the offering is a very conservative estimate of how many Kayak Condos would be sold in the United States, Canada, and other countries who have expressed an interest in our unique modular storage system.  900 units in our first year, 2000 in year 2, and 5000 in year 3 is certainly not a far-fetched unrealistic goal. Yet we show a significant profit.  Income that IS NOT shown in the projections are income derived from designing PaddleParks.  As we are able to communicate the feasibility and desirability of community PaddleParks, I would like to get involved in many of these efforts.  For example, the City of Welland, Ontario is exhibiting interest in developing such a site.  I will be visiting them in mid-September for that express purpose. 

9Milestones

	A significant milestone was reached this summer when we engaged a manufacturer in North Carolina.  Because they also manufacture their own proprietary brand of kayaks, they "get" what we are about and share our enthusiasm. 


	Another milestone was acquiring a significant customer - the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority in Welland, Ontario, which is essentially a "state park." They recently purchased and installed 24 Kayak Condos on one of their 36 properties.  Next spring, we anticipate seeing hundreds more Kayak Condos in Ontario, with other Canadian provinces keeping a close eye on our progress.  God bless the Canadians!


	Within the next few weeks, we anticipate another big milestone - a significant order from Boating in Boston and Boating in DC.  The parent company of these two entities, like the Canadians, is heavily invested in boat rental operations and resorts nationwide.


	The success of this crowdfunding raise will but us in a significantly better position to seek and secure these types of customers with multiple locations, either government or private entities.

	We've developed Kayak Condos, the world's first modular storage system for kayaks, to make it easier to access kayaks and kayaking gear. The idea (and our quest) is to increase paddling experiences and get folks out on the water more often.  Isn't that why they bought a kayak? 


	Secondly, we developed our product to enhance waterfront locations by (1) increasing the frequency of visitation and (2) driving sales by virtue of renting or leasing Kayak Condos to those desiring and willing to pay for added convenience.  Convenience – in banking, food services, dry cleaning, and anything else – is key.  Today, we stream entertainment on any form of electronic device.  We watch when we want to, i.e.: when it's convenient.  


	We don't think an electronic device will – anytime soon – make it easier to access your kayak floating on a waterway, in the open air, at ease and at peace with the world, but Kayak Condos will!

The future of kayak storage - modular storage systems











































 












 











 





Welcome to the Future of Kayak Storage!


Quite simply, we’re offering a modular storage system for kayaks. We believe this to be
the ultimate in kayak and gear security, protection and convenience for today’s kayakers.  And tomorrow’s newfound kayakers – eliminating the pre-paddle hassle of simply getting into the water. Spending more time paddling and enjoying the outdoors. Isn’t that why you bought a kayak in the first place?
For public or private marinas, resorts, state parks and municipal waterfronts, this is a way to stimulate increased access to waterfronts everywhere – while creating an enhanced source of newfound revenue. Along that line, we are introducing the concept of “PaddleParks” which, like skateboard parks and dog parks, are envisioned as dedicated public spaces on local waterfronts – catering specifically to the continuous upswing of paddling – and what we hope to be a substantial influx of new paddle practitioners.  Most notable, we believe, might be [us] “baby boomers” who’s kayaks [like mine] seem to get heavier and heavier each spring.  So if we didn’t mention greater convenience and more frequent access that would follow – let me say it again.  And again – throughout this website.
We believe our product, and our premise, is the future of paddling.  Pour another cup of coffee – and see if you don’t agree.

Diablo Paddlesports - Diablo Amigo Recreational Kayak, Kayaks 


                        The Amigo Recreational Kayak is an all new boat from Diablo Paddlesports. It has everything you love about the Adios, but because of the polyethylene construction, it's offered at a lower price point.

                             paddleboard and the maneuverability of a sit-on-top kayak. Because of the wider body, it's recommended to use a longer paddle than with a traditional kayak. The Amigo is built with a unique tri-hull design so you can fish in shallower water than most other kayaks can get in to. Larry Chair and Paddle sold separately.

Whether you're standing up or sitting down, the Amigo has all the stability of a stand up                        
                             paddleboard and the maneuverability of a sit-on-top kayak. Because of the wider body, it's recommended to use a longer paddle than with a traditional kayak. The Amigo is built with a unique tri-hull design so you can fish in shallower water than most other kayaks can get in to. Larry Chair and Paddle sold separately.

Gear bag attached to seat holds snacks, water bottle or anything you want to keep close at hand. Bungee cords let you fold seatback down flat for car-top transport. Retractable skeg gives you even more control in rough water. Footpads are shaped to alleviate foot fatigue. Bulkheads provide plenty of dry storage for gear. New hatches have a tighter seal and are easier to get on and off. Deck rigging has reflective perimeter cord for extra visibility. Expedition deck rigging and compass mount are recessed to minimize deck spray. Carry handles attached with shock cord provide shock absorption. USA.

Wilderness Tactical C.S.M. Instructor Belt 1-3/4 Black Steel Buckle Nylon Black 36 


                        The Combat Shooter's Model (CSM) Belt from Wilderness tactical is truly a work of art. This belt features a polyethylene insert to significanly increase vertical rigidity and overall durability. Unlike other manufacturers that offer a similar product, Wilderness Tactical actually sews the insert in                        
                             between two layers of high-strength nylon using a triple stitching pattern, rather than simply having one layer of material sewn to the front or back of the insert. The buckle is made of high-tensile strength steel that is rated to support a static load between 5900-7200 pounds (based on width, 1-1/2 or 1-3/4 respectively). This enables the belt to be used as a makeshift rappelling apparatus should an emergency situation requring such equipment and knowledge arise. The CSM is recommended for military personnel, police officers and armed security guards whose duties require that their uniform belts be capable of supporting the weight of tactical equipment such as drop-leg holsters, magazine pouches and other gear. However, Action Pistol and 3-Gun shooters will also find this belt to be more than suitable for their needs as well. Regardless of your status as a practitioner of the shooting arts: student, instructor, competitor, or operator; the CSM will surely exceed your expectations! Technical Information Notes: Please see Wilderness Belt Size Measuring Instructions in the Application Charts section for directions on belt sizing. Please see Wilderness Tactical Instructor Belt in the Application Charts section for directions on the safe usage and durability. This belt is not intended to replace a standard rappelling harness with leg straps in normal operations. It is intended as an emergency option to clip into when there is a risk of falling, or for emergency rappelling when no other option is available. Searches for products like these typically include: Self Defense & Police,Holster Belts,Nylon & Composite Belts
