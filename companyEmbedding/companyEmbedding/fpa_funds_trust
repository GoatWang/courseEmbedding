FREE FUNDRAISING






YouCaring is dedicated to helping as many people as possible. This is why we will never charge anyone to raise money on our site.

Start your own fundraiser today.
It's free!
Create Fundraiser







Our Crowdfunding Platform Charges $0
Most crowdfunding sites charge 5% to 10% in fees just to use their platform. We never have and never will. This is because we believe that for people facing life’s challenges, every dollar counts. With more than $500 million in donations raised, our free fundraising platform has saved fundraisers more than $13 million in fees.

0% fee















5% – 10% fee









Donation Processor Costs

All online fundraising requires a third-party credit card processor such as PayPal, WePay or Stripe. These processors allow money to be safely collected and transferred online, but they do charge small fees for this service. Each donation processor charges 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction.
This is not a YouCaring fee.

To learn more about our donation processors, read our blog post Which Donation Processor Is Right for Your Fundraiser. Rest assured, you can change donation processors at any time during your campaign. Simply contact us and we’ll be happy to guide you through the process.






Keep More of Your Money

When a donation is processed, the donation processor deducts their cost from the donation total. For example, if someone donates $100, the donation processor will take 2.9% plus $.30, resulting in a $3.20 fee. Other sites charge an additional 5% to 10% just to use their site.
YouCaring saves you money by charging no site fees.

How YouCaring Supports Itself

We rely on the generosity of our users to help us provide a free crowdfunding platform for those struggling with life’s challenges. At times, we do receive financial support from our amazing processors and other partners. People who give to fundraisers on YouCaring have the option of providing a voluntary contribution to support our operations and help keep fundraising free. We are incredibly grateful to those who have contributed and in doing so, chosen to participate in our mission to bring life-changing philanthropy to as many people as possible.

First Trust Asia Pacific ex-Japan AlphaDEX® Fund (FPA)




Fund Summary|Holdings|News & Literature|Historical Pricing|Distribution History|Contact Fund











Investment Objective/Strategy - The First Trust Asia Pacific ex-Japan AlphaDEX® Fund is an exchange-traded fund. The investment objective of the Fund is to seek investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield, before the Fund's fees and expenses, of an equity index called the NASDAQ AlphaDEX® Asia Pacific Ex-Japan Index.


        There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved.
    




                The NASDAQ AlphaDEX® Asia Pacific Ex-Japan Index is an "enhanced" index created and administered by Nasdaq, Inc. 
                ("Nasdaq") which employs the AlphaDEX® stock selection methodology to select stocks from the NASDAQ Asia Pacific 
                Ex-Japan Index that meet certain criteria. 
            

                To construct the Index, Nasdaq ranks the eligible stocks on growth factors including 3-, 6- and 12- month price 
                appreciation, sales to price and one year sales growth, and separately on value factors including book value to price, 
                cash flow to price and return on assets. All stocks are ranked on the sum of ranks for the growth factors and, separately, 
                all stocks are ranked on the sum of ranks for the value factors. A stock must have data for all growth and/or value 
                factors to receive a rank for that style.
            
Each stock receives the best style rank from the previous step as its selection score.

                The top 100 stocks based on the selection score determined in the previous step comprise the "selected stocks". The selected 
                stocks are divided into quintiles based on their rankings and the top ranked quintiles receive a higher weight within the index. 
                The stocks are equally weighted within each quintile.
            

                Each stock is then tested in order of its selection score rank to check if the weight assigned to that stock is outside the 
                country/sector weighting constraints, which are set at 15% above the benchmark weight.
                

                        If the weight assigned to the stock, when added with the weight assigned to all higher ranking stocks in its country/sector, 
                        is greater than the constraint, then the stock's weight is lowered to the highest rank in the next quintile. Stocks previously 
                        lower in rank then move up one rank. Such stocks in the lowest quintile that violate a constraint are removed from the portfolio 
                        and replaced by the highest scoring stock not originally selected, subject to country/sector constraints. This process continues 
                        until all the country/sector weightings meet the constraint.
                    


The index is reconstituted and rebalanced semi-annually.

				*Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee of future
				results and current performance may be higher or lower than performance quoted. Investment returns
				and principal value will fluctuate and shares when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than
				their original cost. 
				

 
				After Tax Held returns represent return after taxes on distributions. Assumes shares have not been sold.
				After Tax Sold returns represent the return after taxes on distributions and the sale of fund shares. Returns
				do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Market Price returns are 
                based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread on the stock exchange on which shares of the fund are listed for 
                trading as of the time that the fund’s NAV is calculated. Returns are average annualized total returns, except
				those for periods of less than one year, which are cumulative.  
			

				After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and
				do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor’s tax

Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's outstanding shares .


2
Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).


3
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.


4
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


5
The 30-day SEC yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the most recent 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period and includes the effects of fee waivers and expense reimbursements, if applicable.


6
12-Month Distribution Rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the fund's trailing 12-month ordinary distributions paid or declared by the NAV price. Distribution rates may vary.


7
Index yield represents the weighted average trailing 12-month dividend of the constituents of the NASDAQ AlphaDEX® Asia Pacific Ex-Japan Index.


8
All market capitalization numbers are in USD$ Millions.

You should consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing. You can download a prospectus or summary prospectus, or contact First Trust Portfolios L.P. at 1-800-621-1675 to request a prospectus or summary prospectus which contains this and other information about the fund. The prospectus or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.





        ETF Characteristics
    

		The fund lists and principally trades its shares on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.	
	
The fund's return may not match the return of the NASDAQ AlphaDEX® Asia Pacific Ex-Japan Index.  Securities held by the fund will generally not be bought or sold in response to market fluctuations.

		Investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. 
		Market prices may differ to some degree from the net asset value of the shares. Investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share's net 
		asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be 
		redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the fund's authorized participants are unable 
        to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, fund shares may trade at 
        a discount to the fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.	
	





Risk Considerations


    The fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in the fund. One of the principal risks of investing in the fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular stock owned by the fund, fund shares or stocks in general may fall in value. There can be no assurance that the fund's investment objective will be achieved.
    

    The fund may invest in securities issued by companies concentrated in a particular industry or country. The fund may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.


    An investment in a fund containing securities of non-U.S. issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. These risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries.


    The fund is more susceptible to the economic, market, regulatory, political, natural disasters and local risks of the Asia Pacific region than a fund that is more geographically diversified. The region has historically been highly dependent on global trade, with nations taking strong roles in both the importing and exporting of goods; such a relationship creates a risk with this dependency on global growth. Varying levels of accounting and disclosure standards, restrictions on foreign ownership, minority ownership rights, and corporate governance standards are also common for the region.


    The fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. The fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash, rather than in-kind securities. As a result, the fund may be less tax-efficient.


    The fund is classified as "non-diversified" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.

What is Crowdfunding?

noun
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or cause by raising money from a large number of people, typically through the Internet. It is a form of peer-to-peer fundraising that harnesses the power of social networks to raise awareness and draw donations from around the world for online campaigns.








How is Compassionate Crowdfunding™ Different?

YouCaring is a free online fundraising platform that pioneered Compassionate Crowdfunding™—empowering people worldwide to rally support for personal and charitable causes without the fundraising fees associated with other sites. To date, the YouCaring community is 5.5 million strong and has raised more than $500 million for humanitarian causes.
Start Crowdfunding








The Rise of Crowdfunding


The flourishing sharing economy is changing the landscape of fundraising, and in recent years, crowdfunding has dominated the scene. According to research firm Massolution, donation-based crowdfunding alone grew more than 50 percent in 2015, raising nearly $3 billion. The overall crowdfunding market, including donation-based, lending-based, reward-based and equity-based funding, was expected to grow to $34.5 billion in 2015, more than double that of 2014.







Recent statistics contributing to crowdfunding’s popularity:

Annual out-of-pocket medical expenses in the U.S. have risen to $400 billion, or $1,254 per person.1
Average medical deductibles in the last eight years have increased 100 percent, from $584 to $1,217 for individuals, not including the price of co-pays, co-insurance, drugs and procedures not covered by health insurance plans.2
Forty seven percent of Americans can’t afford $2,000 in an emergency
Annual charitable giving in the U.S. has grown to $360 billion, with 72 percent coming from individuals.3
The sharing economy in 2015 is estimated to be $15 billion and projected to grow to $335 billion by 2035.4





How can you key into the trend and help yourself or someone you love overcome a hardship or challenge by launching a successful crowdfunding campaign?


How To Crowdfund













1. Create
YouCaring’s easy-to-use fundraiser template allows you to create an effective home page for your crowdfunding campaign. Show potential donors how they can help by telling a compelling story, uploading several pictures and videos, and posting updates.



2. Share
Activate your social network. With just a few clicks, spread the word of your fundraiser to friends, family and other potential donors through Facebook, Twitter, email and other channels. Each share is worth $37 on average.



3. Collect
Donations to your fundraiser can be transferred into your account as they’re received. YouCaring provides free fundraising, which means we don’t charge a thing. The donation processor does, however, take 2.9%, plus $.30 per transaction.








Best Crowdfunding Practices
The most important goal of crowdfunding is to build a community and a network that empathizes with your cause and donates.






Five Key Strategies:


Plan Ahead
Create a social presence by setting up Facebook and Twitter accounts if you haven’t already done so. Immediately start connecting with as many friends, family members, coworkers and acquaintances as possible. See our Using Social Media to Promote Your Fundraiser page. Also consider setting up a blog or website devoted to your cause to further boost your social presence. See our How to Start a Fundraising Website or Blog page.

Make It Compelling
From the title to the story to the visuals, your campaign should inspire potential donors to contribute to your cause. Take time to create a great name for your campaign and write an engaging story. Uploading several high-quality photos and one or more videos can exponentially increase donations to your campaign. For additional tips, see these YouCaring articles: Great Ideas for Naming Your Online Fundraiser, How Images Can Lead to Fundraising Success and Videos Are Powerful Fundraiser Tools.

Share and Update
Sharing your campaign often via social media channels and asking your friends, family and others to do the same is the best way to raise awareness and support for your cause. Every share can raise $37. Multiply those shares and your fundraiser may go viral. Meanwhile, well-written updates keep supporters and potential donors engaged. Fundraisers with five updates can raise 15 times more than those with one. Fundraisers with 20 or more updates on average meet their fundraising goal.

Organize Offline Events
Complementing your online campaign with an offline fundraiser can get your community personally involved and rally support from local businesses. Sports tournaments, dinners, auctions, dances and other events are great options. See our Fundraising Ideas page for other tips.

Reach Out to the Media
Getting your campaign covered by a local newspaper, T.V. station, radio station or even blogger and Facebook pages can propel your fundraiser to new heights. See our tips page, How to Get Local Media to Cover Your Fundraiser.

Read MoreCollapse Strategies 






The Crowdfunding Platform You Choose Matters
It is vital to pick the crowdfunding platform that best suits your needs and your cause. The most important aspects include the fees charged to fundraise, the site’s customer service standards and reputation, the schedule for payment of donations, the caliber of online tools available to illustrate and share your campaign, and the quality of the site—from the visuals to the user experience.

Crowdfunding Campaign Success Stories






Help Save Matthew!





Goal: $800,000

Raised: $835,918



Matthew Schreindorfer and his wife, Katia Luciani, could not have imagined the journey they would face starting in August 2014. At age 24, Matthew was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He had gone through every possible treatment in Canada, all of which failed to bring him into remission. According to his doctors, his only hope was to be admitted for a CART-19 clinical trial in the U.S. The couple started working with Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute in New York and started a YouCaring fundraiser with a goal of $800,000, the estimated cost for the treatment. With the help of family and friends in Canada, and newfound supporters in the U.S. and around the world, the couple was able to drum up plenty of support for the clinical trial in the U.S., which proved to be fruitful, putting Matthew in remission for more than six months.

And Luca Makes 5 – Mullen Family Adoption





Goal: $40,500

Raised: $41,259



In February 2016, the Mullen Family of Bethany, Okla., brought home their third adoptive child, Luca, a 3-year-old Eastern European boy with special needs. The joyous occasion came after nearly one year of fundraising, the majority of which included the YouCaring campaign, And Luca Makes 5: The Mullen Family Adoption. After 15 years of marriage, during which the couple was unable to have children, they embarked on an adoptive journey to grow their family, and brought Levi and Lia home in 2011. Their YouCaring fundraiser to adopt Luca raised more than $41,000. Successful strategies didn’t get any better than the Mullen’s over the course of their campaign, during which time they involved their children in many of the happy moments leading up to the last stretch to welcome little Luca.

Help Fatal Arson Survivor Safyre Terry and Family





Goal: $15,000

Raised: $432,249



The story of 7-year-old Safyre Terry stole the hearts of people around the world when a Facebook post in 2015 describing her wish to receive Christmas cards went viral. Safyre was a courageous young burn victim from Upstate New York who was the only survivor of a house fire that killed the rest of her family in 2013. At the time, Safyre was 5 years old, and through all of her medical treatments and ensuing challenges, has remained a bright, optimistic girl who loves life. Around the time of the Facebook post, a YouCaring fundraiser had also been started by friends for Safyre’s aunt and uncle, Mike and Liz Dolder, who are now raising her. The fundraiser was set up to help with the costs of medical treatments and other expenses. Nearly 10,000 people from around the world contributed to the campaign.

Bonsai: Half the Bulldog, Twice the Love





Goal: $1

Raised: $22,898



It’s hard to resist a cute black and white bulldog puppy. But when you see Bonsai, born with multiple rare medical conditions that left him with only half a spine and no pelvis playing with a big pink squeaky toy, still just as rambunctious and playful as any puppy with four legs, it truly tugs at your heartstrings. A group of individuals from Friends of Emma, a rescue organization, took to crowdfunding to give Bonsai a leg up in his treatment. The fundraiser has successfully raised nearly $23,000 to help pay for Bonsai’s medical treatments and a possible mobility device to give him an even happier and healthier life.

Information is updated every day at approximately 6P CST. The Last Price, Change, and Change Percent is listed at the top, with other quote data listed in the quoteboard below.  Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity. YTD High, Low, Change, %Change: The high and low price year-to-date, with the change and percent change year-to-date.

Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."                                  Add Data Columns to this Table Learn about our Custom Views   Want to use this as  your default charts setting?

FPA Fund Description
The First Trust Asia Pacific Ex-Japan AlphaDex ETF tracks an index that selects and weights 100 stocks from the S&P Asia Pacific Ex-Japan BMI Index based on their growth and value factors.
  
FPA FactSet Analytics Insight
FPA's exposure and performance differ radically from our benchmark while high costs and weak liquidity greatly reduce its appeal. It aims to outperform the Developed Asia-Pacific Ex-Japan market using a quant-based methodology that produces severe sector and size biases. FPA includes a heavy allocation to South Korea, which our benchmark considers an emerging country and therefore excludes. Reasonable people can disagree on South Korea's emerging vs. developed status, but few could defend the fund's poor liquidity and hefty expense ratio, which add up to very high all-in costs.
