KNOT Offshore Partners LP Announces Private Placement of $50 Million of 8.0% Series a Convertible Preferred Units | Business Wire


























































KNOT Offshore Partners LP Announces Private Placement of $50 Million 
      of 8.0% Series a Convertible Preferred Units






December 06, 2016 08:01 AM Eastern Standard Time



ABERDEEN, Scotland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--KNOT Offshore Partners LP (the “Partnership”) (NYSE:KNOP) announced 
      today that it has entered into a Series A Preferred Unit Purchase 
      Agreement for the private placement of $50 million of new Series A 
      Convertible Preferred Units (the “Preferred Units”) at a price of $24.00 
      per unit (the “Issue Price”), resulting in approximately 2,083,333 
      Preferred Units, representing limited partner interests in the 
      Partnership, expected to be outstanding as of the closing date (the 
      “Closing Date”) of the private placement. The Preferred Units will be 
      perpetual and will pay cumulative, quarterly distributions in arrears at 
      an annual rate of 8.0% of the Issue Price, on or prior to the date of 
      payment of distributions on the Partnership’s common units (the “Common 
      Units”). The Partnership has the option to issue and sell on the Closing 
      Date up to an additional $49 million of Preferred Units to other 
      purchasers at the Issue Price. The transaction is subject to customary 
      closing conditions and is expected to close in January 2017. Assuming 
      the Partnership issues $50 million of Preferred Units, the net proceeds, 
      after deducting estimated fees and expenses, are expected to be 
      approximately $48.5 million. The Partnership expects to use the net 
      proceeds for general partnership purposes, which may include 
      acquisitions, capital expenditures or the repayment of indebtedness.
    

      The Preferred Units will be generally convertible, at the option of the 
      Preferred Unit holders, into Common Units after the second anniversary 
      of the Closing Date at the then applicable conversion rate. As of the 
      Closing Date, the conversion rate will be one-for-one and will be 
      subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. In addition, the 
      conversion rate will be redetermined on a quarterly basis, such that the 
      conversion rate will be equal to the Issue Price divided by the product 
      of (x) the book value per Common Unit at the end of the immediately 
      preceding quarter (pro-forma for per unit cash distributions payable 
      with respect to such quarter) multiplied by (y) the quotient of (i) the 
      Issue Price divided by (ii) the book value per Common Unit on the 
      Closing Date. In addition, the Partnership may redeem the Preferred 
      Units at any time between the second anniversary and the tenth 
      anniversary of the Closing Date at the redemption price applicable on 
      any such redemption date.
    

      Upon a change of control of the Partnership, the holders of Preferred 
      Units will have the right to require cash redemption at 100% of the 
      Issue Price. In addition, the holders of Preferred Units will have the 
      right to cause the Partnership to redeem the Preferred Units on the 
      tenth anniversary of the Closing Date in, at the option of the 
      Partnership, (i) cash at a price equal to 70% of the Issue Price or (ii) 
      Common Units such that each Preferred Unit receives Common Units worth 
      80% of the Issue Price. In addition, at any time following the second 
      anniversary of the Closing Date and subject to certain conditions, the 
      Partnership will have the right to convert the Preferred Units into 
      Common Units at the then applicable conversion rate.
    

      The Preferred Units will have voting rights that are identical to the 
      voting rights of the Common Units, except they will not have any right 
      to nominate, appoint or elect any of the directors of the Partnership’s 
      board (the “Board”), except whenever distributions payable on the 
      Preferred Units have not been declared and paid for four consecutive 
      quarters (a “Trigger Event”). Upon a Trigger Event, holders of Preferred 
      Units will have the right to replace one of the members of the Board 
      appointed by the general partner of the Partnership with a person 
      nominated by such holders, such nominee to serve until all accrued and 
      unpaid distributions on the Preferred Units have been paid. The 
      Preferred Units shall be entitled to vote with the Common Units as a 
      single class so that the Preferred Units shall be entitled to one vote 
      for each Common Unit into which the Preferred Units are then convertible.
    

      The Partnership may issue junior securities in an unlimited amount and 
      parity securities, provided that the aggregate amount of the Preferred 
      Units and the parity securities pro-forma for such issuance, does not 
      exceed 33.33% of the book value of the sum of the Partnership’s then 
      outstanding aggregate amount of parity securities and junior securities 
      (including Common Units). The consent of the holders of Preferred Units 
      will be necessary for the Partnership to issue any parity securities or 
      senior securities in excess of such pro-forma book value. In addition, 
      the consent of the holders of Preferred Units will be necessary for the 
      Partnership to incur additional indebtedness that would result in the 
      Partnership exceeding 70% debt to total capitalization.
    

      The Preferred Units will rank senior to all Common Units and any other 
      class or series of equity securities of the Partnership outstanding as 
      of the Closing Date with respect to distribution rights and liquidation 
      preference.
    

      Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Partnership has agreed to enter 
      into a Registration Rights Agreement on the Closing Date with the 
      holders of the Preferred Units. Pursuant to the Registration Rights 
      Agreement, the Partnership will agree to use commercially reasonable 
      efforts to file a traditional shelf registration statement registering 
      resales of the Common Units underlying the Preferred Units and to have 
      such registration statement declared effective by the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission by the second anniversary of the Closing Date. The 
      holders of the Preferred Units will also have certain demand and 
      piggyback rights with respect to the underlying Common Units.
    

      The securities offered in the private placement have not been registered 
      under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or 
      any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United 
      States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration 
      requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws.
    

      This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an 
      offer to purchase the securities described herein.

About KNOP


 KNOT Offshore Partners LP  We are a limited partnership formed in February 2013, to operate and acquire shuttle tankers under long-term charters, which we define as charters of five years or more. Our sponsor, Knutsen NYK Offshore Tankers AS (Knutsen NYK), a market leading independent owner and operator of shuttle tankers, which is jointly owned by TS Shipping Invest AS (TSSI), and Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK). TSSI controlled by our Chairman, is a private Norwegian company with ownership interests in shuttle tankers, liquefied natural gas (LNG), tankers and product/chemical tankers. NYK is a Japanese public company with a fleet of approximately 800 vessels, including bulk carriers, containerships, tankers and specialized vessels. As of March 17, 2017, Knutsen NYK owns a 28.9% limited partner interest in us and owned and controlled our general partner, which owns a 1.85% general partner interest in us and a 0.3% limited partner in us.  We currently own and operate a modern fleet of thirteen state of the art shuttle tankers, each equipped with the latest advanced technology, including dynamic positioning and offshore systems, ensuring safe and efficient offloading from offshore installations, in the most challenging of locations and weather conditions. All our vessels operate under long term charters with major oil and gas companies engaged in offshore productions, such as Shell, ExxonMobil, Statoil, Transpetro and ENI. It is our strategy to operate our vessels under long-term charters with stable cash flows and to grow our position in the shuttle tanker market through acquisitions from Knutsen NYK and third parties.
