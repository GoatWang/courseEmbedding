ARLINGTON, Va. | MeriStar Hospitality Corporation (NYSE: MHX), one of the nation's largest hotel real estate investment trusts (REIT), today announced that Paul J.

(NYSE: SRZ), the nation's largest provider of senior-living services.

"Paul Klaassen's more than two decades of experience in a parallel industry makes him an invaluable addition to our board," said Paul W. Whetsell, chairman. "We also expect to benefit from his substantial expertise as we continue to execute our strategies of internal and external growth by repositioning our portfolio through renovations and selective acquisitions."

Klaassen has served as chairman and CEO of Sunrise Senior Living since he founded that organization with his wife, Terry, in 1981. He is the founding chairman and a director of the Assisted Living Federation of America (ALFA). He serves as a director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and The National Chamber Foundation. He is a member of the board of trustees of The Hudson Institute, The Ethics and Public Policy Center, The Trinity Forum and the Advisory Committee for the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard University Medical School.

Except for historical information, the matters discussed in this press release are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially, including the following: the continuing uncertainty of the national economy; economic conditions generally and the real estate market specifically; the effect of threats of terrorism and increased security precautions on travel patterns and demand for hotels; the threatened or actual outbreak of hostilities and international political instability; governmental actions; legislative/regulatory changes, including changes to laws governing the taxation of REITs; level of proceeds from asset sales; cash available for capital expenditures; availability of capital; ability to refinance debt; rising interest rates; rising insurance premiums; competition; supply and demand for hotel rooms in our current and proposed market areas; other factors that may influence the travel industry, including health, safety and economic factors; and changes in generally accepted accounting principles, policies and guidelines applicable to REITs. Additional risks are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although the company believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that any deviation will not be material. These statements are made as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Paul Klaassen looks back on his 27-year reign as CEO


October 30, 2008
 | 









Print this page
by Brett Lieberman

Before 1981 seniors had few options for living out their twilight years: senior apartments (for those healthy enough to care for themselves), nursing homes 
or moving in with family.  Those limited choices, though, were about to change. That year’s opening of Sunrise Senior Living Inc. of McLean would ultimately 
lead to a revolution in senior living.
Within a few years, the company built its first assisted-living community off Glebe Road in Arlington.  Designed from the ground up for older residents, it 
drew hundreds of long-term-care industry and policy leaders who came to tour the community, high on a hill with a view of the Washington Monument. 
They liked what they saw: draperies, moldings and large areas dedicated to shared space instead of institutional-looking corridors. There were no patients in 
the building, just residents. It was referred to as a community, not a facility. And staff provided seniors with assistance in the activities of daily 
living. 
“That building changed everything,” says Paul J. Klaassen. “It was the first really purpose-built, assisted-living community of its type.” 
During the company’s annual meeting later this month, Klaassen will step down after 27 years as CEO. He and his wife, Terry, built the company from a handful 
of locations in the Washington area into one of the country’s largest senior living providers. Today, Sunrise has more than 450 residential communities in 
four countries with 50,000 residents and 43,000 employees. 
Klaassen plans to remain involved as the company’s non-executive chairman. Day-to-day responsibilities will be turned over to new CEO Mark Ordan, Sunrise’s 
chief investment and administrative officer. Before joining Sunrise in 2008, Ordan was CEO of the Mills Corp., a shopping center developer. Terry Klaassen 
will remain active as the firm’s chief cultural officer in charge of training.
As Paul Klaassen prepares to pass the baton, he leaves a company that has just come through a tough patch. Following an accounting scandal in 2006 and 2007 
that prompted an SEC investigation that found accounting errors, Sunrise went though an earnings restatement. 
In March, it completed a restatement of results from 1996 through 2005 that reduced earnings by $173 million. Then in September came more bad news:  $65 
million in losses for the first half of 2008, including a $27.7 million write-off of abandoned project costs. Sunrise’s stock price has taken a beating as 
well, losing more than 40 percent of its value in the last year. To cut costs, Sunrise is reducing staff and slowing plans for expansion. 
Still, Klaassen leaves with a bullish attitude on Sunrise, senior living in general and what to expect in the next stage of his own life. Virginia Business 
sat down with him on an outside patio at a Sunrise community near the company’s headquarters in McLean. An edited transcript of the interview follows. 
VB: When you started Sunrise, there was nothing like it. Why did you think you could pull off something new?  
Klaassen: One of the blessings of starting a company when you are 23 years old is you don’t think of all those things. We didn’t think we would start a 
national movement that would change long-term care in the United States. We simply saw a local need, which was being filled, we felt, badly. We saw an 
opportunity for a better long-term-care model: a model that was focused more on the resident and the family, a model that was more attractive in the physical 
plant. We saw that nursing homes were caring for people that really didn’t need to be in a nursing home … So with the kind of optimism that entrepreneurs 
have that their idea will be accepted, we sold our house and opened the first Sunrise in the Northern Virginia suburbs. 
VB: Did you envision a series of Sunrise communities across the region?
Klaassen: We had a second one open within a year and a third one within a year after that …  I always envisioned it as a growth company … After three years, 
we set about designing a prototype which could be built on three acres anywhere in the country. It had to be reproducible; it had to have timeless appeal. 
VB: Sunrise has more that 450 assisted-living communities. How did this growth take place, and where will Sunrise head in the future?
Klaassen: We’ve always seen this as a movement. You don’t do that by having 10 or so locations. In the early  ’90s,we sold a quarter of the company to bring 
in private equity that allowed us to expand from two-a-year to 10-a-year. We went public in 1996 and were able to go to 20-a-year. A year ago, we hit 30 new 
communities a year before the credit crunch. Right now we have about 30 under construction and have been on a pace of 15 to 20 openings a year. That’s the 
preferred growth mechanism. We think the next 10 years are a time of new construction. There are still a lot of ZIP codes where high-quality senior living is 
not available … 
VB: Tell us about changes you’ve seen in the industry. 
Klaassen: We in fact have seen in the last 25 years a shift in our consumer … Now it is a boomer — a daughter or a son — helping to arrange care needs for 
their parent or loved one … Boomers demand customization. Boomers are demanding better options for themselves and their parents.
VB: Experts warn that Americans are not saving enough for retirement. Do you expect the long-term-care financing model to change? 
Klaassen: The number of people who can afford private-pay senior living is at an all-time high. People are paying for senior living through a combination of 
income and net worths … We find about 65 percent of seniors can afford a private-pay alternative like Sunrise. [According to a Sunrise official, the cost can 
easily run $30,000 a year.] 
VB: Overall, how do you see the long-term-care industry changing? 
Klaassen: I think we’re going to see over the next 10 years more choices, a weeding out of weaker providers. Less attractive buildings are just not going to 
be competitive in the future. Doing senior living well is going to get more complex and more demanding … In the past, even poorly conceived projects could 
succeed even if they were only marginally well managed because there was so much demand. As the field becomes more mature, you can’t just get two out of 
three things right.

VB: Sunrise has faced a number of challenges from accounting issues.  How is the company’s financial health?
Klaassen: I have yet to discover any company that goes in a straight line for five or 10 years, much less 28 years … We’ve opened 50 communities in the last 
two years, despite the fact that we’ve had an accounting restatement, which wasn’t about our cash flow. It was a complex joint venture accounting, a 
relatively technical issue that affected our timing or recognizing income, but not our cash flow. The credit crunch is affecting us today in that 
construction financing is harder to find. We have lots of sites, some of which we have to put on the back burner. We have the equity to put into these 
projects.
VB: Is the accounting problem the biggest challenge Sunrise has faced?
Klaassen: Certainly not the biggest challenge. Right now the lack of construction financing is probably the biggest challenge we are currently facing. 

VB: At 51, you’re still young, particularly by Sunrise standards. Why step aside now?  
Klaassen: Moving from CEO to chairman, I’m thinking of as a promotion, not as a stepping down … I see myself as chairman still being very involved in the 
design aspect of our product, in the training of our new leaders and very much also in the area of public policy. I’ve been able to grow the company from 
zero to over $2 billion. That’s not something many people get to do.  
VB: Do you worry that the accounting problems will become your legacy?
Klaassen: I thought about stepping down on the 25th anniversary mark because it was a nice neat number. But then the accounting thing came up, so I said, 
“I’m going to see this thing through.” I don’t worry about legacies … I clearly wish that the last two years had been smoother, but I’m really proud of the 
work we have done. The big thing we have done here is far bigger than this accounting bump on the road.

      Public Company Information:          




NYSE:SRZ 







      Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: SRZ) today announced that Paul J. 
      Klaassen, its founder and chief executive officer of 27 years, will 
      become Sunrise's non-executive chairman of the board and transition from 
      his role as CEO, effective at the next annual meeting of Sunrise 
      shareholders expected to take place in November 2008. At that time, Mark 
      S. Ordan, Sunrise's chief investment and administrative officer, will 
      become CEO. Mr. Ordan has also joined Sunrise's board of directors, 
      effective July 15, 2008. When Mr. Klaassen becomes chairman, Lynn 
      Krominga, the current chairman of the board, will become lead 
      independent director.
    

      As chairman, Mr. Klaassen will serve as an active champion of Sunrise's 
      mission, culture and values. He will continue to support the Company, 
      Mr. Ordan and the board by focusing on key areas including public policy 
      advocacy, product design, leadership training and visiting Sunrise 
      communities.
    

      Mr. Klaassen, who, with his wife Terry, founded Sunrise in 1981, has led 
      the Company from a single community in the Washington suburbs to become 
      the largest global senior living provider with nearly 500 communities 
      open and under construction with a resident capacity for 59,000 and a 
      staff of more than 40,000. The company is known for pioneering new 
      models of senior living such as assisted living and innovative memory 
      care services.
    

      "Throughout my 27 years of leading Sunrise, I have been privileged to 
      see our passion for improving quality of life for seniors fuel our 
      growth from a single community to a thriving organization that has truly 
      helped change the way seniors are served. I've known Mark Ordan for many 
      years and his proven business skills and enthusiasm for what we do will 
      make him a very effective leader. He and the entire Sunrise team can 
      count on my continued active support," said Paul Klaassen.
    

      Mr. Ordan joined Sunrise as chief investment and administrative officer 
      earlier in 2008, after having served most recently as CEO and a director 
      of The Mills Corporation. Previously, he founded and was CEO for Fresh 
      Fields Markets, Inc., served as CEO for Balducci's and also sat on the 
      board of Federal Realty Investment Trust for ten years, serving as 
      non-executive chairman for five years.
    

      "I am honored to have the opportunity to serve Sunrise as CEO and to 
      follow Paul Klaassen, who has been a true pioneer for senior living. 
      Paul built a company with a unique resident-centered culture and 
      distinctive high-quality communities, which has become the leading 
      developer-operator in the $140 billion senior living field. With Paul's 
      continued guidance, I look forward to working with the board and our 
      team to champion quality of life for the residents and families we serve 
      and to build long-term value for our shareholders," said Mark Ordan.
    

      Sunrise also confirmed today that it intends to shortly add two new 
      independent directors to its Board of Directors and that it expects to 
      file its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 on July 31, 
      2008. Following the filing of its 2007 Form 10-K, Sunrise plans to file 
      its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for 2008.
