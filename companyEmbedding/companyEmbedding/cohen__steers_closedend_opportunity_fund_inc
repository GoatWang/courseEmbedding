Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The rate of return will vary and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate and shares, if sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Returns are historical and include change in share price and reinvestment of all distributions. An investor cannot invest directly in an index and index performance does not reflect the deduction of any fees, expenses or taxes.
Periods greater than 12 months are annualized.  Returns are historical and include change in share price and reinvestment of all distributions. The investment manager waived a portion of its management fees during certain periods shown above. Absent such waivers, NAV returns would have been lower.

To be eligible for addition to the S&P 500, companies must have a market capitalization of at least US$ 4 billion.

Estimates Only - Do Not Use for Tax Reporting Purposes

This table provides estimates of the Fund's distribution sources at the time of payment and should not be relied upon or used for tax planning or tax reporting purposes. A return of capital occurs when a portion of the money that you invested is paid back to you and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. The source of all distributions paid by the Fund, including net investment income, is subject to change. This is because the Fund primarily invests in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and similar companies. Distributions from REITs are attributed to various sources including net investment income, capital gains and return of capital. The estimate shown above is based on the prior year breakdown of the distributions from the REIT securities held by the Fund. The Fund generally will receive from these companies a final determination as to the source of distributions early next year.

	Income as determined under federal income tax regulations differs from GAAP. As a result, distributions are subject to recharacterization for federal income tax purposes. As the Fund has a capital loss carryover, any distribution paid to shareholders that exceeds the total of the Fund’s investment company taxable income must be characterized as ordinary income, up to the amount of the Fund’s net capital gain realized during the calendar year. This would cause a distribution that is classified as a return of capital under GAAP to be reported as ordinary income for tax purposes.

	The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after year-end and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV and these final amounts may vary significantly from the estimates provided above. Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year, will specify how the distributions paid by the Fund during the year should be characterized and reported on your tax return (e.g. ordinary income, return of capital and capital gain).




Important Information
NOT FDIC INSURED • MAY LOSE VALUE • NO BANK GUARANTEE
Expense ratios as disclosed in the Fund’s most recent annual report to stockholders dated December 31, 2016. Expense ratios are net of waivers and/or reimbursements.
Portfolio holdings are subject to change without notice. The mention of specific securities is not a recommendation or solicitation for any person to buy, sell or hold any particular security.  Top ten holdings are determined on the basis of the value of individual securities held. The Fund may also hold positions in other types of securities issued by the companies listed above. You can obtain a complete listing of holdings by clicking here.
NAV per share is as of the prior day’s market close of regular trading on the NYSE, generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, on each day the NYSE is open for trading.
Distribution Rate is calculated dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by the market price. Note that the number of income distributions is based on the fund’s distribution payment frequency (i.e. monthly or quarterly). A fund may pay distributions in excess of its net investment company taxable income and, to the extent this occurs, the distribution yield quoted will include a return of capital. The estimated return of capital for each distribution is also available on this Web site by clicking on the Distributions tab on each fund’s landing page.
SEC yield is calculated by dividing annualized net investment income per share during a 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share as of the close of that period. SEC yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning income on its current portfolio of securities. Since certain distributions received by the funds from real estate investment trusts (REITs) may consist of dividend income, return of capital and capital gains, and the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the year, the SEC yield has been adjusted for the funds that invest significantly in REITs based on estimates of return of capital and capital gains.
Quarterly distribution per share is as of the most recent quarter  end. The fund pays regular quarterly cash distributions to common shareholders at a level rate that may be adjusted from time to time, based on the projected income of the fund. The amount of quarterly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions. Each fund’s distributions reflect net investment income, and may also include net realized capital gains and/or return of capital. Return of capital includes distributions paid by a fund in excess of its net investment income and such excess is distributed from the fund’s assets. Under federal tax regulations, some or all of the return of capital distributed by a fund may be taxed as ordinary income.
In addition, distributions for funds investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs) may later be characterized as capital gains and/or a return of capital, depending on the character of the dividends reported to each fund after year-end by REITs held by a fund.
However, please note that distributions are subject to recharacterization for tax purposes and the final tax treatment of these distributions will be reported to shareholders after the close of each fiscal year on form 1099-DIV.
Risks of Investing in Closed-End Funds
Risks associated with investing in closed-end end funds generally include market risk, leverage risk, risk of anti-takeover provisions and non-diversification. In addition, shares of many closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value.
Underlying closed-end funds in which the Fund invests have additional fees, may utilize leverage, may not correlate to an intended index and may trade at a discount to their net asset values.

Cohen & Steers Closed-End Opportunity Fund, Inc. (FOF), Cohen & Steers Global Income Builder, Inc. (INB) and Cohen & Steers REIT and Preferred Income Fund, Inc. (RNP) Declare June 2015 Quarterly Distributions

Jun 09, 2015, 18:45 ET
		  		  																	
						 from   Cohen & Steers 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, June 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Boards of Directors of Cohen & Steers Closed-End Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NYSE:   FOF), Cohen & Steers Global Income Builder, Inc. (NYSE:   INB) and Cohen & Steers REIT and Preferred Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE:   RNP) (each a "Fund" and collectively, the "Funds") have declared second quarter 2015 distributions payable on June 30, 2015 to shareholders of record on June 22, 2015. The ex-dividend date is June 18, 2015. The distribution amounts for the Funds are summarized below: 



              Fund





Quarterly
Distribution 
Per Share





Cohen & Steers
Closed-End Opportunity Fund, Inc.




$0.2600














Cohen & Steers
Global Income Builder, Inc.




$0.2800














Cohen & Steers




$0.3700





REIT and Preferred Income Fund, Inc.
















The Funds pay regular quarterly cash distributions to common shareholders at a level rate that may be adjusted from time to time. Each Fund's distributions reflect net investment income, and may also include net realized capital gains and/or return of capital. Return of capital includes distributions paid by a Fund in excess of its net investment income, and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. Under federal tax regulations, some or all of the return of capital distributed by a Fund may be taxed as ordinary income. The amount of quarterly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions.
In addition, distributions for the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and/or closed-end funds (CEFs) may later be characterized as capital gains and/or a return of capital, depending on the character of the dividends reported to each Fund after year end by the REITs and CEFs held by a Fund.
The amount and composition of each Fund's distribution is disclosed quarterly at cohenandsteers.com; however, this information may change after year end once the final tax characteristics of all Fund distributions can be determined with certainty. Final tax characteristics of all fund distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year.
More information is available at cohenandsteers.com.
