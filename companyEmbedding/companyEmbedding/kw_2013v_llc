		Used and New Diesel Generators  
                 


				WPP offers a wide selection of quality diesel generators in sizes ranging from 20kW – 2500kW. Whether you seek portable or stationary diesel generators―for prime, continuous or standby usage―we can ensure you find what you are looking for.
The simplest explanation of a generator’s function: it provides electrical power. A diesel generator is the combination of a diesel engine with an alternator (also called a generator end) to generate electrical energy.   This alternator houses electrical conductors which react to the engine’s mechanical energy and convert it into useful electrical power.
We have many informative articles describing how generators work and which to choose for a particular application.

Project:
Fall / Spring Yard Clean Up



With all of the rain NY has been having my yard looked like a rainforest. Price and his team came in and I can now point to my yard with pride - not despair. He is scheduled to return for some minor work but I intend to keep his company for the duration of the summer ahead.

This is my second time using Mr. Price's service. He planted fall window boxes and created a beautiful tree bed. People stop and marvel over his work and want his contact information. His service is top notch and very reasonable. It is obvious he has a passion for his work.

Project:
Landscape a Back Yard



Price was Amazing and his team so beyond professional! 
I have been dramatized with a few workers that have worked for us and luckily I can say these were the good batch of the great ones!!! the place was left immaculate clean after they left just as it should be.  His team beyond professional knows the topic to ask first before proceeding with what they think is good and not confirming with me.  So friendly and whatever you ask it just gets done.   My backyard and front of my home looks like it stepped out of a magazine cover and that's the look I wanted!!! Love them!!!!

Project:
Install Sod



This project deserves 10 stars!   Five doesn't do it justice. Most professional sod installation we've ever had!  In addition to the sod installation, the company upgraded our small urban garden with additional flowers and installed the most beautiful street tree pit EVER!  All this beauty for a very fair price.  We were so impressed with the job they did, we've hired them to come back and do our window boxes.  We've used professional landscapers for many years, but  KW Price is the BEST in NYC.

Project:
Landscape Yard or Gardens



100% top-notch work and service. Extremely fair pricing. We have a small garden area which needed a complete overhaul. We spoke about what he thought we may want to consider and he came up with a few recommendations. We truly relied on KW Price for their expertise. The work was quick, efficient and impeccable they left my property spotless. After a day, I noticed that some of the plants they incorporated into the design weren't too happy. they came right out the next day and replaced them.  I would HIGHLY recommend KW Price, without question!

KW Price was excellent!   They price was very reasonable.   They came to my urban backyard and trimmed my tree my neighbors tree growing over my backyard and carted all the debris off the property.  They left the backyard very clean.  I would hire them again.

                                 in Bronx, NY

Project:
Landscape Yard or Gardens



KW Price reached out to me right away and had a proposal in my hands one day later. I put him in touch with my father who needed the services.  I'm not too keen on findings services on line, but i would not hesiitate if the service is anywhere near KW Prices.  He is professional, prompt, and got the job done within 2 days.  I absolutely love the finish product.  He did all that we spoke about and now the family has a beautifully landscaped yard to enjoy.  It was ugly and scarey before KW Price. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE WHO ASK.

What is the screening process that Service Professionals go through in order to become members of the HomeAdvisor network?





Verify Trade License
            HomeAdvisor checks to see if the business carries the appropriate state-level license. 
Verify Insurance
            As a part of our screening process, we encourage professionals to carry general liability insurance. We require coverage for hundreds of services. 
Verification of State Business Filings
            For business types that require a Secretary of State filing, we confirm that the business is in good standing in the state in which it is located.
Criminal Records Search
            HomeAdvisor uses 3rd party data sources to conduct a criminal search for any relevant criminal activity associated with the owner/principal of the business.
Sex Offender Search
            We confirm that the owner/principal is not listed on the official state Sex Offender web site in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located. 
Bankruptcy Search
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the history of the principal/owner of the business for bankruptcy filings by or against them.
Legal Search for Civil Judgments
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the principal/owner of the business for state level civil legal judgments entered against them.
Liens Search
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the principal/owner of the business for liens placed against them.
Identity Verification (SSN)
            HomeAdvisor verifies the social security number(s) of the owner/principal for identity check purposes. This check applies primarily to smaller business entities.
Identity Verification (Reverse Phone Lookup)
            We conduct a reverse business phone lookup to identify records matching the phone number information provided by the business.








NOTE: Member service professional information confirmed as described above may change or expire over time; while HomeAdvisor attempts to maintain accurate and up-to-date information, and confirms changes when notified, we cannot guarantee that profile and screening information is accurate. Therefore, we recommend that before working with a service professional you verify that information presented is still current and/or acceptable to you.


Please see
        
        
        
          
          
            
            HomeAdvisor's Terms and Conditions for a full description of how we screen Service Professionals


**Only for U.S. service professionals 
















            HomeAdvisor's Screening Process
         
HomeAdvisor uses the following criteria to screen service professionals at the time they apply for membership in our network:







Licensing
Applicants must carry required state-level licensing to perform work in the trade and service area for which they apply.




Sex Offender Search
We check the official sex offender website in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located to confirm that there is not a match with the applicant.




Legal Search for Civil Judgments
We use third-party data sources to check the principal/owner of each business for bankruptcy filings and significant state-level civil legal judgments, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, occurring within 12 months prior to application for membership in the HomeAdvisor network.






Criminal Records Search
HomeAdvisor uses third-party sources to conduct a criminal search, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, for relevant criminal activity associated with the business owner/principal within three years prior to application.




State Business Filings
We confirm that service professionals applying as corporations or limited liability companies are in good standing in the state in which they are located.




Identity Verification (Social Security Number)
HomeAdvisor verifies the social security numbers of business owners/principals to confirm their identities. (This applies primarily to small businesses.)







            Notification to residents of AL, CO, DE, GA, ID, KS, KY, LA, ME, MA, MI, MS, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, SD, UT, VA, VT, WY: HomeAdvisor uses a third party to screen professionals. The comprehensiveness of the records included in the national criminal database which our third party vendor uses varies by state. Please be aware that your state may be limited in its reporting. For more information click on the "Instant Database Searches" tab on the following webpage:
