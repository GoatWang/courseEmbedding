JCP Investment Management Group Send Letter To CST Brands CEO And Board

		  Outline Views on Issues and Opportunities Facing CSTHope to Continue Constructive Dialogue to Enhance Shareholder Value

						 from   JCP Investment Management, LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


HOUSTON, Dec. 22, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- JCP Investment Management, LLC ("JCP"), Josh Schechter and Brad Radoff (together with their affiliates, "JCP Investment Management Group" or "we"), collectively a significant shareholder of CST Brands, Inc. ("CST" or the "Company") (NYSE:   CST), today announced it has delivered a letter to the Chief Executive Officer, Kim Lubel, and CST's Board of Directors.
The full text of the letter follows:
December 22, 2015
Kim Lubel, Chief Executive Officer  
CST Brands, Inc. 
One Valero Way, Building D, Suite 200 
San Antonio, Texas 78249 
cc: Members of the Board of Directors 
Dear Kim,
JCP Investment Management, LLC ("JCP"), Josh Schechter and Brad Radoff (together with their affiliates, "we") collectively own approximately 1 million of the outstanding shares of CST Brands, Inc. ("CST" or the "Company").  Over the past several months, members of our group have discussed with you various issues we believe have plagued CST's operating and share price performance.  As a follow up to our conversations, we outline below for the benefit of the full CST Board of Directors (the "Board") and our fellow shareholders our views regarding the issues facing the Company and the opportunities to create value at CST.
Specifically, we are concerned about the following issues, which have persisted since the 2013 spin off from Valero Energy Corporation:

Below-industry average merchandise margins; 


Sub-optimal returns on new store builds and related concerns about significant planned CapEx; 


Stagnant merchandise same-store sales relative to peers; 


Mismanagement of CrossAmerica, including distribution coverage ratio that has declined to an unsustainable level; 


Slow growth and unclear Food Service strategy; and 


Staggered board without adequate shareholder representation. 
All of the above factors have weighed on the share price causing CST to trade at a significant discount to its peer group and substantially below the strategic value of the franchise. Furthermore, we are not alone in our frustration with the Company's operational and share price performance.  Within the last two weeks, another shareholder has publicly voiced concerns and a leading sell-side research analyst appeared to agree with their analysis. 
As you well know, the convenience store industry is undergoing rapid consolidation.  Within the last eighteen months, multiple transactions have taken place in the industry, most of them at Enterprise Value/EBITDA multiples in excess of where CST currently trades.  We understand this trend quite well since two of us were on the Board of Directors of The Pantry, Inc. ( "The Pantry") which was acquired by Alimentation Couche-Tard for approximately $1.8 billion and generated meaningful total shareholder return from the date we joined the Board of The Pantry.     
We have studied the 2020 plan for CST, similar to our analysis as Board members at The Pantry and have concluded that the risk of achieving the 2020 vision and the upside to that vision should be compared to the immediate value that could be realized in a strategic sale.
CST is a highly attractive asset.  The Company has high market share in several Texas markets and an attractive niche market in eastern Canada.  CST owns the vast majority of its real estate and has an attractive land bank.  We strongly believe that there would be significant interest in CST from strategic buyers and the Board should explore and consider the opportunities. 
We have appreciated our open and constructive dialog with you to date and hope we can continue that discussion with you and the Board.
Best, 



James Pappas

Innovation









Today, we are working at P&G to build a better company. Our goal is clear—meeting the needs of consumers better than the best competitors to deliver winning total shareholder return. We are doing this by focusing on a stronger portfolio, setting new standards of excellence, bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do, and empowering our people to keep the consumer at the center of everything we do.
Building a better company demands a streamlined, focused approach to our portfolio, and ensuring our brands continue to delight consumers.
A Strengthened Portfolio

Global leader in 10 categories with 65 brands that leverage P&G’s core strengths
Daily-use categories where purchase intent and choice are driven primarily by a specific job to do and the product's effectiveness
A focused portfolio for faster growth and higher profitability

We are also establishing a higher standard of excellence for all our brands. Success requires bringing these standards to every brand, and we are investing to fuel our growth by making these standards a reality.
New Standards of Excellence

Irresistibly Superior Products
Irresistibly Superior Packaging
Superior Brand Communications
Excellent Retail Execution
Winning Customer and Consumer Value Equation

Investing for growth requires bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do.  This approach has allowed us to deliver on our initial productivity commitment and to raise the bar with plans to save even more.

Productivity

$10 billion saved from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016.
Up to an additional $10 billion in savings from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2021.
The objective: balanced top-and-bottom line growth that consistently delivers total shareholder return in the top-third of our peer group.

Our efforts are underpinned by an organization that is experienced, agile, accountable and committed to win. To further strengthen our performance, we’re also designing our structures to enable greater speed and agility, and we’re moving resources closer to consumers and customers, driving deeper mastery and accountability.
Empowering Our Organization and Culture

Today, 70% of our commercial function employees reside in local markets—executing innovation, advertising, and merchandising programs by leveraging their unique local knowledge.
In large markets, such as the US and China, we’re moving to end-to-end accountability. This model gives category business leaders full profit and loss responsibilities.
In smaller markets, we’re implementing a “freedom within a framework,”  empowering leaders to make real-time changes in strategy without engaging regional or global resources.
We’re also hiring from the outside—with the number of external hires quadrupling across five different levels of management including senior leadership.

Winning results happen when we earn them—every day, every week, every month, every quarter and every year—in every brand and in every country in which we compete.  And today, we are building a better company that is delivering on just that.

Innovation









Today, we are working at P&G to build a better company. Our goal is clear—meeting the needs of consumers better than the best competitors to deliver winning total shareholder return. We are doing this by focusing on a stronger portfolio, setting new standards of excellence, bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do, and empowering our people to keep the consumer at the center of everything we do.
Building a better company demands a streamlined, focused approach to our portfolio, and ensuring our brands continue to delight consumers.
A Strengthened Portfolio

Global leader in 10 categories with 65 brands that leverage P&G’s core strengths
Daily-use categories where purchase intent and choice are driven primarily by a specific job to do and the product's effectiveness
A focused portfolio for faster growth and higher profitability

We are also establishing a higher standard of excellence for all our brands. Success requires bringing these standards to every brand, and we are investing to fuel our growth by making these standards a reality.
New Standards of Excellence

Irresistibly Superior Products
Irresistibly Superior Packaging
Superior Brand Communications
Excellent Retail Execution
Winning Customer and Consumer Value Equation

Investing for growth requires bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do.  This approach has allowed us to deliver on our initial productivity commitment and to raise the bar with plans to save even more.

Productivity

$10 billion saved from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016.
Up to an additional $10 billion in savings from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2021.
The objective: balanced top-and-bottom line growth that consistently delivers total shareholder return in the top-third of our peer group.

Our efforts are underpinned by an organization that is experienced, agile, accountable and committed to win. To further strengthen our performance, we’re also designing our structures to enable greater speed and agility, and we’re moving resources closer to consumers and customers, driving deeper mastery and accountability.
Empowering Our Organization and Culture

Today, 70% of our commercial function employees reside in local markets—executing innovation, advertising, and merchandising programs by leveraging their unique local knowledge.
In large markets, such as the US and China, we’re moving to end-to-end accountability. This model gives category business leaders full profit and loss responsibilities.
In smaller markets, we’re implementing a “freedom within a framework,”  empowering leaders to make real-time changes in strategy without engaging regional or global resources.
We’re also hiring from the outside—with the number of external hires quadrupling across five different levels of management including senior leadership.

Winning results happen when we earn them—every day, every week, every month, every quarter and every year—in every brand and in every country in which we compete.  And today, we are building a better company that is delivering on just that.

("Fiesta" or the "Company") (FRGI), with aggregate ownership of approximately 8.6% of the Company's outstanding shares, today commented on Fiesta's disappointing first quarter earnings announcement.JCP was disappointed, but not surprised, by the Company's first quarter 2017 results announcement. Beyond Fiesta's poor reported performance, including a 10.7%1 decline in April comparable restaurant transaction counts at Pollo Tropical from the same period in 2016, CEO Richard Stockinger highlighted a number of alarming issues plaguing Fiesta's operations, including:sub-optimal product specifications,inefficient kitchen procedures,low front-of-the-house hospitality,ill-managed labor schedules, andineffective advertising program.In fact, the Company is facing so many issues that Mr. Stockinger apparently has a list of 170 action items that must be taken to address Fiesta's ever-worsening performance. We appreciate a good list, but what Fiesta really needs is a sense of accountability – something that has been lacking in the boardroom for far too long.Following Monday's earnings call, we believe stockholders now can fully appreciate the "deferred maintenance needs" referred to in the Company's April 24th press release announcing certain preliminary financial results and the "Strategic Renewal Plan." The fact that the Board wasted more than $70 million investing in new markets while neglecting the core Florida market and failing to maintain these once highly profitable stores demonstrates the need to hold the incumbent directors accountable who authorized this value destruction.We remind stockholders that not one non-executive director has stepped down from the Board despite the Company's continued underperformance.A vote on the GOLD proxy for John B. Morlock and James C. Pappas means a vote for:Increased management accountability  We intend to establish stated EBITDA goals and other performance metrics to make expectations clear and enhance accountability  Improved corporate governance  We intend to seek stockholder approval to declassify the Board and eliminate other stockholder-unfriendly governance practices  Additional restaurant expertise on the Board  Messrs. Morlock and Pappas each bring a wealth of restaurant industry experience  Direct stockholder representation in the boardroom  We will bring an owner's mentality to ensure decisions are made with the best interests of public stockholders in mind  Reduced influence of Jefferies  There are still 3 Jefferies-affiliated directors on the Board despite Jefferies selling its entire position after previously owning approximately 28.3% of the Company. We are running against 2 of these directors: Barry J. Alperin and Brian P. Friedman  The time for accountability is now. We urge stockholders to send a clear message to the Board that Fiesta's continued underperformance and pattern of entrenchment will not be tolerated by voting the GOLD proxy to elect our highly qualified candidates John B. Morlock and James C. Pappas. VOTE THE GOLD PROXY CARD TO ELECT JOHN B. MORLOCK AND JAMES C. PAPPAS TODAYIf you have any questions, or require assistance with your vote, please contact InvestorCom, toll-free at (877) 972-0090, call direct at (203) 972-9300About JCP Investment Management:JCP Investment Management, LLC is an investment firm headquartered in Houston, TX that engages in value-based investing across the capital structure.  JCP follows an opportunistic approach to investing across different equity, credit and distressed securities largely in North America.____________________ 1 Fiesta's May 8, 2017 Earnings Call TranscriptInvestor Contacts:James C.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
