History[edit]
Founding and early history (1994-2006)[edit]
Terra Firma traces its origins to 1994 when Guy Hands formed Nomura Principal Finance Group, which focused on European private equity investments. Hands joined Nomura after three other banks, including his previous employer Goldman Sachs, turned down his investment plan.[2] At Nomura, Hands and his team completed over $20 billion of leveraged buyouts. By 2000, Hands was reported to have generated profits for the bank in excess of $1.9 billion making him a star financier in London.[3][4][5] The group’s most notable previous acquisitions included Annington Homes, as well as William Hill, the UK bookmaker, and Angel Trains, the UK rolling stock operating company[6]

In 2002, with support from Nomura, Hands completed a spin-out of the bank's private equity operations to form Terra Firma, after first contemplating a move to another major financial institution.[7][8] The previous year, there had been reports that Nomura had too much of its capital invested in the Principal Finance Group and that Hands' profile was overshadowing the bank.[2] The existing portfolio of investments that the Principal Finance Group at Nomura held from 1994 through 2002 was transferred to a new fund named Terra Firma Capital Partners I and Terra Firma continued to manage those investments for Nomura. Nomura also provided a cornerstone commitment to Terra Firma's first independent fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners II.[9]
In 2004, Terra Firma completed fundraising for its first private equity fund with over €2 billion in investor commitments.[10] The firm had closed on its first €1 billion of capital by late 2002, only a matter of a few months after launching the firm, but amidst a difficult fundraising environment required more than a year to finish fundraising.[11] Investors in the fund included Wilshire Associates, Partners Group, Horsley Bridge, Adams Street Partners, NIB Capital, Citigroup and Canada Pension Plan.[10] At the time, this represented the largest debut fund for a European private equity firm.[12] The firm had completed its first transaction as an independent firm in mid-2003 with the £315 million acquisition of Waste Recycling Group, the largest operator of landfills in the U.K.[6]
Terra Firma closed its second independent fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners III in June 2007 with approximately €5.4 billion of investor commitments.[13] The closing of the fund coincided with the announcement of the firm's ill-fated investment in EMI just weeks earlier and a high-profile attempt to acquire U.K. chemist Alliance Boots, which was ultimately acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.[13] In raising Terra Firma Capital III, the firm made a strong display of avoiding "club deals", transactions completed alongside other private equity firms. In addition to presenting what was described as unique investment opportunities, Terra Firma was active in providing equity co-investment opportunities to limited partner investors in its funds.[14]
Terra Firma was the first large private equity firm based in the UK to comply with the Walker Guidelines on transparency and disclosure. In April 2008, the firm published its first ever Annual Review,[15] which exceeded the Walker reporting requirements and set a standard for voluntary private equity reporting in the UK.[16]
Terra Firma has endorsed the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA)’s private equity principles[17] and is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment.
EMI Investment (2007-2011)[edit]

Terra Firma acquired EMI in a $4.7 billion (£2.4 billion) public-to-private buyout transaction in August 2007.[18][19] It was one of the last large European buyouts completed before the financial crisis. Terra Firma invested in the deal through its TFCP II and TFCP III funds, and also included a number of equity co-investors in the transaction.[20]
Following the transition, several important artists including Radiohead walked away from the label, while other artists such as Paul McCartney left ahead of the takeover.[21] At the same time, The Rolling Stones signed a one-album deal with Interscope Records/Universal Music Group outside of its contract with EMI, which expired on February 2008.[22][23][24] Thirty Seconds to Mars and Joss Stone attempted to leave EMI due to their dissatisfaction with the Terra Firma takeover but EMI threatened legal action against them for breach of contract.[25] Under Terra Firma’s ownership, EMI also signed several significant new acts, including: Tinie Tempah, Eliza Doolittle, David Guetta, Lady Antebellum and Professor Green.
Around the same time, EMI announced restructuring plans to cut between 1,500 and 2,000 jobs[26] and to reduce costs by £200 million a year. As a result, the U.K. chief executive Tony Wadsworth left EMI shortly after the buyout.[26]
By the fall of 2008, the firm's investment in EMI was clearly troubled with a large debt load and weak earnings[27][28] In early 2009, Terra Firma wrote down the value of its investment by €1.37 billion, approximately 46% of its original value.[29][30] However, Terra Firma and Hands personally continued to put new money into the company in order to avoid a default under its loan obligations to lender, Citigroup.[31][32] By 2010, it was reported that Hands had invested between 60% and 70% of his personal net worth in the EMI transaction.[33]
In December 2009, Terra Firma filed a lawsuit against EMI's primary lender Citigroup, claiming the bank engaged in fraud during its auction of the company in 2007.[34] The lawsuit went to trial in New York in late 2010[35] and resulted in a jury finding in favor of Citigroup and against Terra Firma.[36]
Citigroup took ownership of EMI Group from Terra Firma on February 1, 2011, wiping out the firm's investments and writing off £2.2 billion of debt.[37][38] Terra Firma was reported to have lost $2.5 billion in the EMI transaction, representing roughly one-third of Terra Firma's investor's capital as well as more than 60% of Hands' personal net worth.[36][39]
In May 2013, the verdict from the New York trial was overturned on appeal and a new trial announced, after it was found that the American trial Judge, Jed Rakoff, had incorrectly instructed the jury. The US federal appeals court noted that “because the district court’s jury instructions were based on an inaccurate understanding of the relevant English law, the case must be vacated and remanded for a new trial.[40]
A new judge-led trial is due to take place in London in June 2016.[41] The original claim that Citi had lied about the presence of a rival bidder in the auction for EMI, which led Terra Firma to bid for the music group, will be heard by the English court. Filings show that a new, additional claim, that Citi failed to disclose relevant information about EMI's finances, will also be heard.[42]
Post-EMI (since 2011)[edit]
In mid-2011, months after the loss of EMI, Terra Firma began speaking with potential investors about the firm's next fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners IV, targeting to raise upwards of £2.5 billion, which would be roughly half the size of its predecessor which raised £4.8 billion.[43][44] With the exception of EMI, the balance of Terra Firma’s current fund was reportedly performing well, although the fund was still under water[clarification needed].[39][45] In November 2011, Terra Firma was reported to be in discussions with a sovereign wealth fund about a new capital commitment to allow the firm to continue investing after the end of the investment period of TFCP III.[46] In March 2012 they bought The Garden Centre Group[47] and July of the same year bought Four Seasons Health Care.[48] In December 2012 the acquisition of Annington Homes was completed.[49]
In July 2013, Terra Firma partially exited Deutsche Annington, Germany’s largest private landlord, through an IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.[50] It later fully exited the company in May 2014 through a distribution in specie to investors in the Terra Firma Deutsche Annington fund.
In August 2013, Terra Firma sold Phoenix Natural Gas to funds managed by Hastings, the Australian infrastructure fund manager.[51]
In September 2015, Terra Firma appointed Justin King as vice-chairman.[52] That same month is also completed the sale of German motorway services operator Tank & Rast to a consortium led by Allianz SE.[53] Terra Firma Chairman and CIO Guy Hands announced in 2015 that the firm will only charge investors on money which has been invested in deals, rather than the industry norm of charging fees on all committed capital, an approach described as a “radical break with industry conventions”.[54] In February 2017, Terra Firma Capital Partners started a sale process for its wind-energy business in the United States.[55]
Investments[edit]
Between 1994 and 2011, Terra Firma and its predecessor invested approximately €13 billion in equity and completed transactions with an aggregate enterprise value of €44 billion.
Terra Firma is known for its failed investment in British music company EMI, which was later taken over by Citigroup, the main lender in the investment.[56]

The firm's early investments, while still a division of Nomura, focused on housing (Annington Homes), leasing companies and pubs. Since 2002, the firm has made major investments in the waste management (Waste Recycling Group), energy (BGCL, East Surrey Holdings, Phoenix Natural Gas, and Infinis), aircraft leasing (AWAS), cinema (Odeon Cinemas/UCI) and music sectors (EMI). TFCP has also made significant investments in German residential housing (Deutsche Annington) and motorway services (Tank & Rast). As of 2015 Terra Firma have announced their intentions to sell off the ODEON & UCI Cinema Group for a reported £1 Billion.[57] In July 2016, the company was bought for $921 million by U.S AMC Theaters, which is owned by Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group, subject to European Commission approval. The deal received approval from the European Commission on 17 November 2016, and was completed on 30 November 2016.
More recently, Terra Firma has been an active investor in renewable energy.[58][59] Its investments include Infinis,[60] a UK independent pure green energy business, EverPower,[61] a U.S. based wind energy business and RTR,[62] an Italian solar energy business.
Investment funds[edit]
Since founding in 1994, Terra Firma has raised five private equity funds.

Terra Firma Capital Partners I (TFCP I) was formed in 2002 to house the assets that had been acquired from 1994 through 2002, while the team was still part of Nomura. Nomura was the sole investor in this fund.[63]
Terra Firma Capital Partners II (TFCP II), the firm's first independent fund, was closed in February 2004 with €2.1 billion of investor commitments. In addition to Nomura, which made a cornerstone investment, the fund raised capital from 65 investors from 21 countries.[63]
Terra Firma Deutsche Annington (TFDA) was formed in 2006 to house the firm's German housing investments Deutsche Annington (DAIG). The firm raised €2.1 billion of investor commitments from 21 investors.[63]
Terra Firma Capital Partners III (TFCP III) was closed in May 2007 with €5.4 billion of investor commitments. The fund's limited partnership comprises 159 investors from 26 countries.[63]
Terra Firma Special Opportunities Fund I (TFSOFI) closed in December 2012 and is a single asset fund raised to acquire Annington Homes from Nomura. TFSOFI raised a total of £470 million from investors around the world, both institutional and private.[63]

In mid-2011, Terra Firma began speaking with potential investors about the firm's next fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners IV. Terra Firma is targeting to raise upwards of £2.5 billion, which would be roughly half the size of its predecessor with raised £4.8 billion.[43][44]

History[edit]
Founding and early history (1994-2006)[edit]
Terra Firma traces its origins to 1994 when Guy Hands formed Nomura Principal Finance Group, which focused on European private equity investments. Hands joined Nomura after three other banks, including his previous employer Goldman Sachs, turned down his investment plan.[2] At Nomura, Hands and his team completed over $20 billion of leveraged buyouts. By 2000, Hands was reported to have generated profits for the bank in excess of $1.9 billion making him a star financier in London.[3][4][5] The group’s most notable previous acquisitions included Annington Homes, as well as William Hill, the UK bookmaker, and Angel Trains, the UK rolling stock operating company[6]

In 2002, with support from Nomura, Hands completed a spin-out of the bank's private equity operations to form Terra Firma, after first contemplating a move to another major financial institution.[7][8] The previous year, there had been reports that Nomura had too much of its capital invested in the Principal Finance Group and that Hands' profile was overshadowing the bank.[2] The existing portfolio of investments that the Principal Finance Group at Nomura held from 1994 through 2002 was transferred to a new fund named Terra Firma Capital Partners I and Terra Firma continued to manage those investments for Nomura. Nomura also provided a cornerstone commitment to Terra Firma's first independent fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners II.[9]
In 2004, Terra Firma completed fundraising for its first private equity fund with over €2 billion in investor commitments.[10] The firm had closed on its first €1 billion of capital by late 2002, only a matter of a few months after launching the firm, but amidst a difficult fundraising environment required more than a year to finish fundraising.[11] Investors in the fund included Wilshire Associates, Partners Group, Horsley Bridge, Adams Street Partners, NIB Capital, Citigroup and Canada Pension Plan.[10] At the time, this represented the largest debut fund for a European private equity firm.[12] The firm had completed its first transaction as an independent firm in mid-2003 with the £315 million acquisition of Waste Recycling Group, the largest operator of landfills in the U.K.[6]
Terra Firma closed its second independent fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners III in June 2007 with approximately €5.4 billion of investor commitments.[13] The closing of the fund coincided with the announcement of the firm's ill-fated investment in EMI just weeks earlier and a high-profile attempt to acquire U.K. chemist Alliance Boots, which was ultimately acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.[13] In raising Terra Firma Capital III, the firm made a strong display of avoiding "club deals", transactions completed alongside other private equity firms. In addition to presenting what was described as unique investment opportunities, Terra Firma was active in providing equity co-investment opportunities to limited partner investors in its funds.[14]
Terra Firma was the first large private equity firm based in the UK to comply with the Walker Guidelines on transparency and disclosure. In April 2008, the firm published its first ever Annual Review,[15] which exceeded the Walker reporting requirements and set a standard for voluntary private equity reporting in the UK.[16]
Terra Firma has endorsed the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA)’s private equity principles[17] and is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment.
EMI Investment (2007-2011)[edit]

Terra Firma acquired EMI in a $4.7 billion (£2.4 billion) public-to-private buyout transaction in August 2007.[18][19] It was one of the last large European buyouts completed before the financial crisis. Terra Firma invested in the deal through its TFCP II and TFCP III funds, and also included a number of equity co-investors in the transaction.[20]
Following the transition, several important artists including Radiohead walked away from the label, while other artists such as Paul McCartney left ahead of the takeover.[21] At the same time, The Rolling Stones signed a one-album deal with Interscope Records/Universal Music Group outside of its contract with EMI, which expired on February 2008.[22][23][24] Thirty Seconds to Mars and Joss Stone attempted to leave EMI due to their dissatisfaction with the Terra Firma takeover but EMI threatened legal action against them for breach of contract.[25] Under Terra Firma’s ownership, EMI also signed several significant new acts, including: Tinie Tempah, Eliza Doolittle, David Guetta, Lady Antebellum and Professor Green.
Around the same time, EMI announced restructuring plans to cut between 1,500 and 2,000 jobs[26] and to reduce costs by £200 million a year. As a result, the U.K. chief executive Tony Wadsworth left EMI shortly after the buyout.[26]
By the fall of 2008, the firm's investment in EMI was clearly troubled with a large debt load and weak earnings[27][28] In early 2009, Terra Firma wrote down the value of its investment by €1.37 billion, approximately 46% of its original value.[29][30] However, Terra Firma and Hands personally continued to put new money into the company in order to avoid a default under its loan obligations to lender, Citigroup.[31][32] By 2010, it was reported that Hands had invested between 60% and 70% of his personal net worth in the EMI transaction.[33]
In December 2009, Terra Firma filed a lawsuit against EMI's primary lender Citigroup, claiming the bank engaged in fraud during its auction of the company in 2007.[34] The lawsuit went to trial in New York in late 2010[35] and resulted in a jury finding in favor of Citigroup and against Terra Firma.[36]
Citigroup took ownership of EMI Group from Terra Firma on February 1, 2011, wiping out the firm's investments and writing off £2.2 billion of debt.[37][38] Terra Firma was reported to have lost $2.5 billion in the EMI transaction, representing roughly one-third of Terra Firma's investor's capital as well as more than 60% of Hands' personal net worth.[36][39]
In May 2013, the verdict from the New York trial was overturned on appeal and a new trial announced, after it was found that the American trial Judge, Jed Rakoff, had incorrectly instructed the jury. The US federal appeals court noted that “because the district court’s jury instructions were based on an inaccurate understanding of the relevant English law, the case must be vacated and remanded for a new trial.[40]
A new judge-led trial is due to take place in London in June 2016.[41] The original claim that Citi had lied about the presence of a rival bidder in the auction for EMI, which led Terra Firma to bid for the music group, will be heard by the English court. Filings show that a new, additional claim, that Citi failed to disclose relevant information about EMI's finances, will also be heard.[42]
Post-EMI (since 2011)[edit]
In mid-2011, months after the loss of EMI, Terra Firma began speaking with potential investors about the firm's next fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners IV, targeting to raise upwards of £2.5 billion, which would be roughly half the size of its predecessor which raised £4.8 billion.[43][44] With the exception of EMI, the balance of Terra Firma’s current fund was reportedly performing well, although the fund was still under water[clarification needed].[39][45] In November 2011, Terra Firma was reported to be in discussions with a sovereign wealth fund about a new capital commitment to allow the firm to continue investing after the end of the investment period of TFCP III.[46] In March 2012 they bought The Garden Centre Group[47] and July of the same year bought Four Seasons Health Care.[48] In December 2012 the acquisition of Annington Homes was completed.[49]
In July 2013, Terra Firma partially exited Deutsche Annington, Germany’s largest private landlord, through an IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.[50] It later fully exited the company in May 2014 through a distribution in specie to investors in the Terra Firma Deutsche Annington fund.
In August 2013, Terra Firma sold Phoenix Natural Gas to funds managed by Hastings, the Australian infrastructure fund manager.[51]
In September 2015, Terra Firma appointed Justin King as vice-chairman.[52] That same month is also completed the sale of German motorway services operator Tank & Rast to a consortium led by Allianz SE.[53] Terra Firma Chairman and CIO Guy Hands announced in 2015 that the firm will only charge investors on money which has been invested in deals, rather than the industry norm of charging fees on all committed capital, an approach described as a “radical break with industry conventions”.[54] In February 2017, Terra Firma Capital Partners started a sale process for its wind-energy business in the United States.[55]
Investments[edit]
Between 1994 and 2011, Terra Firma and its predecessor invested approximately €13 billion in equity and completed transactions with an aggregate enterprise value of €44 billion.
Terra Firma is known for its failed investment in British music company EMI, which was later taken over by Citigroup, the main lender in the investment.[56]

The firm's early investments, while still a division of Nomura, focused on housing (Annington Homes), leasing companies and pubs. Since 2002, the firm has made major investments in the waste management (Waste Recycling Group), energy (BGCL, East Surrey Holdings, Phoenix Natural Gas, and Infinis), aircraft leasing (AWAS), cinema (Odeon Cinemas/UCI) and music sectors (EMI). TFCP has also made significant investments in German residential housing (Deutsche Annington) and motorway services (Tank & Rast). As of 2015 Terra Firma have announced their intentions to sell off the ODEON & UCI Cinema Group for a reported £1 Billion.[57] In July 2016, the company was bought for $921 million by U.S AMC Theaters, which is owned by Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group, subject to European Commission approval. The deal received approval from the European Commission on 17 November 2016, and was completed on 30 November 2016.
More recently, Terra Firma has been an active investor in renewable energy.[58][59] Its investments include Infinis,[60] a UK independent pure green energy business, EverPower,[61] a U.S. based wind energy business and RTR,[62] an Italian solar energy business.
Investment funds[edit]
Since founding in 1994, Terra Firma has raised five private equity funds.

Terra Firma Capital Partners I (TFCP I) was formed in 2002 to house the assets that had been acquired from 1994 through 2002, while the team was still part of Nomura. Nomura was the sole investor in this fund.[63]
Terra Firma Capital Partners II (TFCP II), the firm's first independent fund, was closed in February 2004 with €2.1 billion of investor commitments. In addition to Nomura, which made a cornerstone investment, the fund raised capital from 65 investors from 21 countries.[63]
Terra Firma Deutsche Annington (TFDA) was formed in 2006 to house the firm's German housing investments Deutsche Annington (DAIG). The firm raised €2.1 billion of investor commitments from 21 investors.[63]
Terra Firma Capital Partners III (TFCP III) was closed in May 2007 with €5.4 billion of investor commitments. The fund's limited partnership comprises 159 investors from 26 countries.[63]
Terra Firma Special Opportunities Fund I (TFSOFI) closed in December 2012 and is a single asset fund raised to acquire Annington Homes from Nomura. TFSOFI raised a total of £470 million from investors around the world, both institutional and private.[63]

In mid-2011, Terra Firma began speaking with potential investors about the firm's next fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners IV. Terra Firma is targeting to raise upwards of £2.5 billion, which would be roughly half the size of its predecessor with raised £4.8 billion.[43][44]

History[edit]
Founding and early history (1994-2006)[edit]
Terra Firma traces its origins to 1994 when Guy Hands formed Nomura Principal Finance Group, which focused on European private equity investments. Hands joined Nomura after three other banks, including his previous employer Goldman Sachs, turned down his investment plan.[2] At Nomura, Hands and his team completed over $20 billion of leveraged buyouts. By 2000, Hands was reported to have generated profits for the bank in excess of $1.9 billion making him a star financier in London.[3][4][5] The group’s most notable previous acquisitions included Annington Homes, as well as William Hill, the UK bookmaker, and Angel Trains, the UK rolling stock operating company[6]

In 2002, with support from Nomura, Hands completed a spin-out of the bank's private equity operations to form Terra Firma, after first contemplating a move to another major financial institution.[7][8] The previous year, there had been reports that Nomura had too much of its capital invested in the Principal Finance Group and that Hands' profile was overshadowing the bank.[2] The existing portfolio of investments that the Principal Finance Group at Nomura held from 1994 through 2002 was transferred to a new fund named Terra Firma Capital Partners I and Terra Firma continued to manage those investments for Nomura. Nomura also provided a cornerstone commitment to Terra Firma's first independent fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners II.[9]
In 2004, Terra Firma completed fundraising for its first private equity fund with over €2 billion in investor commitments.[10] The firm had closed on its first €1 billion of capital by late 2002, only a matter of a few months after launching the firm, but amidst a difficult fundraising environment required more than a year to finish fundraising.[11] Investors in the fund included Wilshire Associates, Partners Group, Horsley Bridge, Adams Street Partners, NIB Capital, Citigroup and Canada Pension Plan.[10] At the time, this represented the largest debut fund for a European private equity firm.[12] The firm had completed its first transaction as an independent firm in mid-2003 with the £315 million acquisition of Waste Recycling Group, the largest operator of landfills in the U.K.[6]
Terra Firma closed its second independent fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners III in June 2007 with approximately €5.4 billion of investor commitments.[13] The closing of the fund coincided with the announcement of the firm's ill-fated investment in EMI just weeks earlier and a high-profile attempt to acquire U.K. chemist Alliance Boots, which was ultimately acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.[13] In raising Terra Firma Capital III, the firm made a strong display of avoiding "club deals", transactions completed alongside other private equity firms. In addition to presenting what was described as unique investment opportunities, Terra Firma was active in providing equity co-investment opportunities to limited partner investors in its funds.[14]
Terra Firma was the first large private equity firm based in the UK to comply with the Walker Guidelines on transparency and disclosure. In April 2008, the firm published its first ever Annual Review,[15] which exceeded the Walker reporting requirements and set a standard for voluntary private equity reporting in the UK.[16]
Terra Firma has endorsed the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA)’s private equity principles[17] and is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment.
EMI Investment (2007-2011)[edit]

Terra Firma acquired EMI in a $4.7 billion (£2.4 billion) public-to-private buyout transaction in August 2007.[18][19] It was one of the last large European buyouts completed before the financial crisis. Terra Firma invested in the deal through its TFCP II and TFCP III funds, and also included a number of equity co-investors in the transaction.[20]
Following the transition, several important artists including Radiohead walked away from the label, while other artists such as Paul McCartney left ahead of the takeover.[21] At the same time, The Rolling Stones signed a one-album deal with Interscope Records/Universal Music Group outside of its contract with EMI, which expired on February 2008.[22][23][24] Thirty Seconds to Mars and Joss Stone attempted to leave EMI due to their dissatisfaction with the Terra Firma takeover but EMI threatened legal action against them for breach of contract.[25] Under Terra Firma’s ownership, EMI also signed several significant new acts, including: Tinie Tempah, Eliza Doolittle, David Guetta, Lady Antebellum and Professor Green.
Around the same time, EMI announced restructuring plans to cut between 1,500 and 2,000 jobs[26] and to reduce costs by £200 million a year. As a result, the U.K. chief executive Tony Wadsworth left EMI shortly after the buyout.[26]
By the fall of 2008, the firm's investment in EMI was clearly troubled with a large debt load and weak earnings[27][28] In early 2009, Terra Firma wrote down the value of its investment by €1.37 billion, approximately 46% of its original value.[29][30] However, Terra Firma and Hands personally continued to put new money into the company in order to avoid a default under its loan obligations to lender, Citigroup.[31][32] By 2010, it was reported that Hands had invested between 60% and 70% of his personal net worth in the EMI transaction.[33]
In December 2009, Terra Firma filed a lawsuit against EMI's primary lender Citigroup, claiming the bank engaged in fraud during its auction of the company in 2007.[34] The lawsuit went to trial in New York in late 2010[35] and resulted in a jury finding in favor of Citigroup and against Terra Firma.[36]
Citigroup took ownership of EMI Group from Terra Firma on February 1, 2011, wiping out the firm's investments and writing off £2.2 billion of debt.[37][38] Terra Firma was reported to have lost $2.5 billion in the EMI transaction, representing roughly one-third of Terra Firma's investor's capital as well as more than 60% of Hands' personal net worth.[36][39]
In May 2013, the verdict from the New York trial was overturned on appeal and a new trial announced, after it was found that the American trial Judge, Jed Rakoff, had incorrectly instructed the jury. The US federal appeals court noted that “because the district court’s jury instructions were based on an inaccurate understanding of the relevant English law, the case must be vacated and remanded for a new trial.[40]
A new judge-led trial is due to take place in London in June 2016.[41] The original claim that Citi had lied about the presence of a rival bidder in the auction for EMI, which led Terra Firma to bid for the music group, will be heard by the English court. Filings show that a new, additional claim, that Citi failed to disclose relevant information about EMI's finances, will also be heard.[42]
Post-EMI (since 2011)[edit]
In mid-2011, months after the loss of EMI, Terra Firma began speaking with potential investors about the firm's next fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners IV, targeting to raise upwards of £2.5 billion, which would be roughly half the size of its predecessor which raised £4.8 billion.[43][44] With the exception of EMI, the balance of Terra Firma’s current fund was reportedly performing well, although the fund was still under water[clarification needed].[39][45] In November 2011, Terra Firma was reported to be in discussions with a sovereign wealth fund about a new capital commitment to allow the firm to continue investing after the end of the investment period of TFCP III.[46] In March 2012 they bought The Garden Centre Group[47] and July of the same year bought Four Seasons Health Care.[48] In December 2012 the acquisition of Annington Homes was completed.[49]
In July 2013, Terra Firma partially exited Deutsche Annington, Germany’s largest private landlord, through an IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.[50] It later fully exited the company in May 2014 through a distribution in specie to investors in the Terra Firma Deutsche Annington fund.
In August 2013, Terra Firma sold Phoenix Natural Gas to funds managed by Hastings, the Australian infrastructure fund manager.[51]
In September 2015, Terra Firma appointed Justin King as vice-chairman.[52] That same month is also completed the sale of German motorway services operator Tank & Rast to a consortium led by Allianz SE.[53] Terra Firma Chairman and CIO Guy Hands announced in 2015 that the firm will only charge investors on money which has been invested in deals, rather than the industry norm of charging fees on all committed capital, an approach described as a “radical break with industry conventions”.[54] In February 2017, Terra Firma Capital Partners started a sale process for its wind-energy business in the United States.[55]
Investments[edit]
Between 1994 and 2011, Terra Firma and its predecessor invested approximately €13 billion in equity and completed transactions with an aggregate enterprise value of €44 billion.
Terra Firma is known for its failed investment in British music company EMI, which was later taken over by Citigroup, the main lender in the investment.[56]

The firm's early investments, while still a division of Nomura, focused on housing (Annington Homes), leasing companies and pubs. Since 2002, the firm has made major investments in the waste management (Waste Recycling Group), energy (BGCL, East Surrey Holdings, Phoenix Natural Gas, and Infinis), aircraft leasing (AWAS), cinema (Odeon Cinemas/UCI) and music sectors (EMI). TFCP has also made significant investments in German residential housing (Deutsche Annington) and motorway services (Tank & Rast). As of 2015 Terra Firma have announced their intentions to sell off the ODEON & UCI Cinema Group for a reported £1 Billion.[57] In July 2016, the company was bought for $921 million by U.S AMC Theaters, which is owned by Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group, subject to European Commission approval. The deal received approval from the European Commission on 17 November 2016, and was completed on 30 November 2016.
More recently, Terra Firma has been an active investor in renewable energy.[58][59] Its investments include Infinis,[60] a UK independent pure green energy business, EverPower,[61] a U.S. based wind energy business and RTR,[62] an Italian solar energy business.
Investment funds[edit]
Since founding in 1994, Terra Firma has raised five private equity funds.

Terra Firma Capital Partners I (TFCP I) was formed in 2002 to house the assets that had been acquired from 1994 through 2002, while the team was still part of Nomura. Nomura was the sole investor in this fund.[63]
Terra Firma Capital Partners II (TFCP II), the firm's first independent fund, was closed in February 2004 with €2.1 billion of investor commitments. In addition to Nomura, which made a cornerstone investment, the fund raised capital from 65 investors from 21 countries.[63]
Terra Firma Deutsche Annington (TFDA) was formed in 2006 to house the firm's German housing investments Deutsche Annington (DAIG). The firm raised €2.1 billion of investor commitments from 21 investors.[63]
Terra Firma Capital Partners III (TFCP III) was closed in May 2007 with €5.4 billion of investor commitments. The fund's limited partnership comprises 159 investors from 26 countries.[63]
Terra Firma Special Opportunities Fund I (TFSOFI) closed in December 2012 and is a single asset fund raised to acquire Annington Homes from Nomura. TFSOFI raised a total of £470 million from investors around the world, both institutional and private.[63]

In mid-2011, Terra Firma began speaking with potential investors about the firm's next fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners IV. Terra Firma is targeting to raise upwards of £2.5 billion, which would be roughly half the size of its predecessor with raised £4.8 billion.[43][44]

History[edit]
Founding and early history (1994-2006)[edit]
Terra Firma traces its origins to 1994 when Guy Hands formed Nomura Principal Finance Group, which focused on European private equity investments. Hands joined Nomura after three other banks, including his previous employer Goldman Sachs, turned down his investment plan.[2] At Nomura, Hands and his team completed over $20 billion of leveraged buyouts. By 2000, Hands was reported to have generated profits for the bank in excess of $1.9 billion making him a star financier in London.[3][4][5] The group’s most notable previous acquisitions included Annington Homes, as well as William Hill, the UK bookmaker, and Angel Trains, the UK rolling stock operating company[6]

In 2002, with support from Nomura, Hands completed a spin-out of the bank's private equity operations to form Terra Firma, after first contemplating a move to another major financial institution.[7][8] The previous year, there had been reports that Nomura had too much of its capital invested in the Principal Finance Group and that Hands' profile was overshadowing the bank.[2] The existing portfolio of investments that the Principal Finance Group at Nomura held from 1994 through 2002 was transferred to a new fund named Terra Firma Capital Partners I and Terra Firma continued to manage those investments for Nomura. Nomura also provided a cornerstone commitment to Terra Firma's first independent fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners II.[9]
In 2004, Terra Firma completed fundraising for its first private equity fund with over €2 billion in investor commitments.[10] The firm had closed on its first €1 billion of capital by late 2002, only a matter of a few months after launching the firm, but amidst a difficult fundraising environment required more than a year to finish fundraising.[11] Investors in the fund included Wilshire Associates, Partners Group, Horsley Bridge, Adams Street Partners, NIB Capital, Citigroup and Canada Pension Plan.[10] At the time, this represented the largest debut fund for a European private equity firm.[12] The firm had completed its first transaction as an independent firm in mid-2003 with the £315 million acquisition of Waste Recycling Group, the largest operator of landfills in the U.K.[6]
Terra Firma closed its second independent fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners III in June 2007 with approximately €5.4 billion of investor commitments.[13] The closing of the fund coincided with the announcement of the firm's ill-fated investment in EMI just weeks earlier and a high-profile attempt to acquire U.K. chemist Alliance Boots, which was ultimately acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.[13] In raising Terra Firma Capital III, the firm made a strong display of avoiding "club deals", transactions completed alongside other private equity firms. In addition to presenting what was described as unique investment opportunities, Terra Firma was active in providing equity co-investment opportunities to limited partner investors in its funds.[14]
Terra Firma was the first large private equity firm based in the UK to comply with the Walker Guidelines on transparency and disclosure. In April 2008, the firm published its first ever Annual Review,[15] which exceeded the Walker reporting requirements and set a standard for voluntary private equity reporting in the UK.[16]
Terra Firma has endorsed the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA)’s private equity principles[17] and is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment.
EMI Investment (2007-2011)[edit]

Terra Firma acquired EMI in a $4.7 billion (£2.4 billion) public-to-private buyout transaction in August 2007.[18][19] It was one of the last large European buyouts completed before the financial crisis. Terra Firma invested in the deal through its TFCP II and TFCP III funds, and also included a number of equity co-investors in the transaction.[20]
Following the transition, several important artists including Radiohead walked away from the label, while other artists such as Paul McCartney left ahead of the takeover.[21] At the same time, The Rolling Stones signed a one-album deal with Interscope Records/Universal Music Group outside of its contract with EMI, which expired on February 2008.[22][23][24] Thirty Seconds to Mars and Joss Stone attempted to leave EMI due to their dissatisfaction with the Terra Firma takeover but EMI threatened legal action against them for breach of contract.[25] Under Terra Firma’s ownership, EMI also signed several significant new acts, including: Tinie Tempah, Eliza Doolittle, David Guetta, Lady Antebellum and Professor Green.
Around the same time, EMI announced restructuring plans to cut between 1,500 and 2,000 jobs[26] and to reduce costs by £200 million a year. As a result, the U.K. chief executive Tony Wadsworth left EMI shortly after the buyout.[26]
By the fall of 2008, the firm's investment in EMI was clearly troubled with a large debt load and weak earnings[27][28] In early 2009, Terra Firma wrote down the value of its investment by €1.37 billion, approximately 46% of its original value.[29][30] However, Terra Firma and Hands personally continued to put new money into the company in order to avoid a default under its loan obligations to lender, Citigroup.[31][32] By 2010, it was reported that Hands had invested between 60% and 70% of his personal net worth in the EMI transaction.[33]
In December 2009, Terra Firma filed a lawsuit against EMI's primary lender Citigroup, claiming the bank engaged in fraud during its auction of the company in 2007.[34] The lawsuit went to trial in New York in late 2010[35] and resulted in a jury finding in favor of Citigroup and against Terra Firma.[36]
Citigroup took ownership of EMI Group from Terra Firma on February 1, 2011, wiping out the firm's investments and writing off £2.2 billion of debt.[37][38] Terra Firma was reported to have lost $2.5 billion in the EMI transaction, representing roughly one-third of Terra Firma's investor's capital as well as more than 60% of Hands' personal net worth.[36][39]
In May 2013, the verdict from the New York trial was overturned on appeal and a new trial announced, after it was found that the American trial Judge, Jed Rakoff, had incorrectly instructed the jury. The US federal appeals court noted that “because the district court’s jury instructions were based on an inaccurate understanding of the relevant English law, the case must be vacated and remanded for a new trial.[40]
A new judge-led trial is due to take place in London in June 2016.[41] The original claim that Citi had lied about the presence of a rival bidder in the auction for EMI, which led Terra Firma to bid for the music group, will be heard by the English court. Filings show that a new, additional claim, that Citi failed to disclose relevant information about EMI's finances, will also be heard.[42]
Post-EMI (since 2011)[edit]
In mid-2011, months after the loss of EMI, Terra Firma began speaking with potential investors about the firm's next fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners IV, targeting to raise upwards of £2.5 billion, which would be roughly half the size of its predecessor which raised £4.8 billion.[43][44] With the exception of EMI, the balance of Terra Firma’s current fund was reportedly performing well, although the fund was still under water[clarification needed].[39][45] In November 2011, Terra Firma was reported to be in discussions with a sovereign wealth fund about a new capital commitment to allow the firm to continue investing after the end of the investment period of TFCP III.[46] In March 2012 they bought The Garden Centre Group[47] and July of the same year bought Four Seasons Health Care.[48] In December 2012 the acquisition of Annington Homes was completed.[49]
In July 2013, Terra Firma partially exited Deutsche Annington, Germany’s largest private landlord, through an IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.[50] It later fully exited the company in May 2014 through a distribution in specie to investors in the Terra Firma Deutsche Annington fund.
In August 2013, Terra Firma sold Phoenix Natural Gas to funds managed by Hastings, the Australian infrastructure fund manager.[51]
In September 2015, Terra Firma appointed Justin King as vice-chairman.[52] That same month is also completed the sale of German motorway services operator Tank & Rast to a consortium led by Allianz SE.[53] Terra Firma Chairman and CIO Guy Hands announced in 2015 that the firm will only charge investors on money which has been invested in deals, rather than the industry norm of charging fees on all committed capital, an approach described as a “radical break with industry conventions”.[54] In February 2017, Terra Firma Capital Partners started a sale process for its wind-energy business in the United States.[55]
Investments[edit]
Between 1994 and 2011, Terra Firma and its predecessor invested approximately €13 billion in equity and completed transactions with an aggregate enterprise value of €44 billion.
Terra Firma is known for its failed investment in British music company EMI, which was later taken over by Citigroup, the main lender in the investment.[56]

The firm's early investments, while still a division of Nomura, focused on housing (Annington Homes), leasing companies and pubs. Since 2002, the firm has made major investments in the waste management (Waste Recycling Group), energy (BGCL, East Surrey Holdings, Phoenix Natural Gas, and Infinis), aircraft leasing (AWAS), cinema (Odeon Cinemas/UCI) and music sectors (EMI). TFCP has also made significant investments in German residential housing (Deutsche Annington) and motorway services (Tank & Rast). As of 2015 Terra Firma have announced their intentions to sell off the ODEON & UCI Cinema Group for a reported £1 Billion.[57] In July 2016, the company was bought for $921 million by U.S AMC Theaters, which is owned by Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group, subject to European Commission approval. The deal received approval from the European Commission on 17 November 2016, and was completed on 30 November 2016.
More recently, Terra Firma has been an active investor in renewable energy.[58][59] Its investments include Infinis,[60] a UK independent pure green energy business, EverPower,[61] a U.S. based wind energy business and RTR,[62] an Italian solar energy business.
Investment funds[edit]
Since founding in 1994, Terra Firma has raised five private equity funds.

Terra Firma Capital Partners I (TFCP I) was formed in 2002 to house the assets that had been acquired from 1994 through 2002, while the team was still part of Nomura. Nomura was the sole investor in this fund.[63]
Terra Firma Capital Partners II (TFCP II), the firm's first independent fund, was closed in February 2004 with €2.1 billion of investor commitments. In addition to Nomura, which made a cornerstone investment, the fund raised capital from 65 investors from 21 countries.[63]
Terra Firma Deutsche Annington (TFDA) was formed in 2006 to house the firm's German housing investments Deutsche Annington (DAIG). The firm raised €2.1 billion of investor commitments from 21 investors.[63]
Terra Firma Capital Partners III (TFCP III) was closed in May 2007 with €5.4 billion of investor commitments. The fund's limited partnership comprises 159 investors from 26 countries.[63]
Terra Firma Special Opportunities Fund I (TFSOFI) closed in December 2012 and is a single asset fund raised to acquire Annington Homes from Nomura. TFSOFI raised a total of £470 million from investors around the world, both institutional and private.[63]

In mid-2011, Terra Firma began speaking with potential investors about the firm's next fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners IV. Terra Firma is targeting to raise upwards of £2.5 billion, which would be roughly half the size of its predecessor with raised £4.8 billion.[43][44]

History[edit]
Founding and early history (1994-2006)[edit]
Terra Firma traces its origins to 1994 when Guy Hands formed Nomura Principal Finance Group, which focused on European private equity investments. Hands joined Nomura after three other banks, including his previous employer Goldman Sachs, turned down his investment plan.[2] At Nomura, Hands and his team completed over $20 billion of leveraged buyouts. By 2000, Hands was reported to have generated profits for the bank in excess of $1.9 billion making him a star financier in London.[3][4][5] The group’s most notable previous acquisitions included Annington Homes, as well as William Hill, the UK bookmaker, and Angel Trains, the UK rolling stock operating company[6]

In 2002, with support from Nomura, Hands completed a spin-out of the bank's private equity operations to form Terra Firma, after first contemplating a move to another major financial institution.[7][8] The previous year, there had been reports that Nomura had too much of its capital invested in the Principal Finance Group and that Hands' profile was overshadowing the bank.[2] The existing portfolio of investments that the Principal Finance Group at Nomura held from 1994 through 2002 was transferred to a new fund named Terra Firma Capital Partners I and Terra Firma continued to manage those investments for Nomura. Nomura also provided a cornerstone commitment to Terra Firma's first independent fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners II.[9]
In 2004, Terra Firma completed fundraising for its first private equity fund with over €2 billion in investor commitments.[10] The firm had closed on its first €1 billion of capital by late 2002, only a matter of a few months after launching the firm, but amidst a difficult fundraising environment required more than a year to finish fundraising.[11] Investors in the fund included Wilshire Associates, Partners Group, Horsley Bridge, Adams Street Partners, NIB Capital, Citigroup and Canada Pension Plan.[10] At the time, this represented the largest debut fund for a European private equity firm.[12] The firm had completed its first transaction as an independent firm in mid-2003 with the £315 million acquisition of Waste Recycling Group, the largest operator of landfills in the U.K.[6]
Terra Firma closed its second independent fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners III in June 2007 with approximately €5.4 billion of investor commitments.[13] The closing of the fund coincided with the announcement of the firm's ill-fated investment in EMI just weeks earlier and a high-profile attempt to acquire U.K. chemist Alliance Boots, which was ultimately acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.[13] In raising Terra Firma Capital III, the firm made a strong display of avoiding "club deals", transactions completed alongside other private equity firms. In addition to presenting what was described as unique investment opportunities, Terra Firma was active in providing equity co-investment opportunities to limited partner investors in its funds.[14]
Terra Firma was the first large private equity firm based in the UK to comply with the Walker Guidelines on transparency and disclosure. In April 2008, the firm published its first ever Annual Review,[15] which exceeded the Walker reporting requirements and set a standard for voluntary private equity reporting in the UK.[16]
Terra Firma has endorsed the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA)’s private equity principles[17] and is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment.
EMI Investment (2007-2011)[edit]

Terra Firma acquired EMI in a $4.7 billion (£2.4 billion) public-to-private buyout transaction in August 2007.[18][19] It was one of the last large European buyouts completed before the financial crisis. Terra Firma invested in the deal through its TFCP II and TFCP III funds, and also included a number of equity co-investors in the transaction.[20]
Following the transition, several important artists including Radiohead walked away from the label, while other artists such as Paul McCartney left ahead of the takeover.[21] At the same time, The Rolling Stones signed a one-album deal with Interscope Records/Universal Music Group outside of its contract with EMI, which expired on February 2008.[22][23][24] Thirty Seconds to Mars and Joss Stone attempted to leave EMI due to their dissatisfaction with the Terra Firma takeover but EMI threatened legal action against them for breach of contract.[25] Under Terra Firma’s ownership, EMI also signed several significant new acts, including: Tinie Tempah, Eliza Doolittle, David Guetta, Lady Antebellum and Professor Green.
Around the same time, EMI announced restructuring plans to cut between 1,500 and 2,000 jobs[26] and to reduce costs by £200 million a year. As a result, the U.K. chief executive Tony Wadsworth left EMI shortly after the buyout.[26]
By the fall of 2008, the firm's investment in EMI was clearly troubled with a large debt load and weak earnings[27][28] In early 2009, Terra Firma wrote down the value of its investment by €1.37 billion, approximately 46% of its original value.[29][30] However, Terra Firma and Hands personally continued to put new money into the company in order to avoid a default under its loan obligations to lender, Citigroup.[31][32] By 2010, it was reported that Hands had invested between 60% and 70% of his personal net worth in the EMI transaction.[33]
In December 2009, Terra Firma filed a lawsuit against EMI's primary lender Citigroup, claiming the bank engaged in fraud during its auction of the company in 2007.[34] The lawsuit went to trial in New York in late 2010[35] and resulted in a jury finding in favor of Citigroup and against Terra Firma.[36]
Citigroup took ownership of EMI Group from Terra Firma on February 1, 2011, wiping out the firm's investments and writing off £2.2 billion of debt.[37][38] Terra Firma was reported to have lost $2.5 billion in the EMI transaction, representing roughly one-third of Terra Firma's investor's capital as well as more than 60% of Hands' personal net worth.[36][39]
In May 2013, the verdict from the New York trial was overturned on appeal and a new trial announced, after it was found that the American trial Judge, Jed Rakoff, had incorrectly instructed the jury. The US federal appeals court noted that “because the district court’s jury instructions were based on an inaccurate understanding of the relevant English law, the case must be vacated and remanded for a new trial.[40]
A new judge-led trial is due to take place in London in June 2016.[41] The original claim that Citi had lied about the presence of a rival bidder in the auction for EMI, which led Terra Firma to bid for the music group, will be heard by the English court. Filings show that a new, additional claim, that Citi failed to disclose relevant information about EMI's finances, will also be heard.[42]
Post-EMI (since 2011)[edit]
In mid-2011, months after the loss of EMI, Terra Firma began speaking with potential investors about the firm's next fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners IV, targeting to raise upwards of £2.5 billion, which would be roughly half the size of its predecessor which raised £4.8 billion.[43][44] With the exception of EMI, the balance of Terra Firma’s current fund was reportedly performing well, although the fund was still under water[clarification needed].[39][45] In November 2011, Terra Firma was reported to be in discussions with a sovereign wealth fund about a new capital commitment to allow the firm to continue investing after the end of the investment period of TFCP III.[46] In March 2012 they bought The Garden Centre Group[47] and July of the same year bought Four Seasons Health Care.[48] In December 2012 the acquisition of Annington Homes was completed.[49]
In July 2013, Terra Firma partially exited Deutsche Annington, Germany’s largest private landlord, through an IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.[50] It later fully exited the company in May 2014 through a distribution in specie to investors in the Terra Firma Deutsche Annington fund.
In August 2013, Terra Firma sold Phoenix Natural Gas to funds managed by Hastings, the Australian infrastructure fund manager.[51]
In September 2015, Terra Firma appointed Justin King as vice-chairman.[52] That same month is also completed the sale of German motorway services operator Tank & Rast to a consortium led by Allianz SE.[53] Terra Firma Chairman and CIO Guy Hands announced in 2015 that the firm will only charge investors on money which has been invested in deals, rather than the industry norm of charging fees on all committed capital, an approach described as a “radical break with industry conventions”.[54] In February 2017, Terra Firma Capital Partners started a sale process for its wind-energy business in the United States.[55]
Investments[edit]
Between 1994 and 2011, Terra Firma and its predecessor invested approximately €13 billion in equity and completed transactions with an aggregate enterprise value of €44 billion.
Terra Firma is known for its failed investment in British music company EMI, which was later taken over by Citigroup, the main lender in the investment.[56]

The firm's early investments, while still a division of Nomura, focused on housing (Annington Homes), leasing companies and pubs. Since 2002, the firm has made major investments in the waste management (Waste Recycling Group), energy (BGCL, East Surrey Holdings, Phoenix Natural Gas, and Infinis), aircraft leasing (AWAS), cinema (Odeon Cinemas/UCI) and music sectors (EMI). TFCP has also made significant investments in German residential housing (Deutsche Annington) and motorway services (Tank & Rast). As of 2015 Terra Firma have announced their intentions to sell off the ODEON & UCI Cinema Group for a reported £1 Billion.[57] In July 2016, the company was bought for $921 million by U.S AMC Theaters, which is owned by Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group, subject to European Commission approval. The deal received approval from the European Commission on 17 November 2016, and was completed on 30 November 2016.
More recently, Terra Firma has been an active investor in renewable energy.[58][59] Its investments include Infinis,[60] a UK independent pure green energy business, EverPower,[61] a U.S. based wind energy business and RTR,[62] an Italian solar energy business.
Investment funds[edit]
Since founding in 1994, Terra Firma has raised five private equity funds.

Terra Firma Capital Partners I (TFCP I) was formed in 2002 to house the assets that had been acquired from 1994 through 2002, while the team was still part of Nomura. Nomura was the sole investor in this fund.[63]
Terra Firma Capital Partners II (TFCP II), the firm's first independent fund, was closed in February 2004 with €2.1 billion of investor commitments. In addition to Nomura, which made a cornerstone investment, the fund raised capital from 65 investors from 21 countries.[63]
Terra Firma Deutsche Annington (TFDA) was formed in 2006 to house the firm's German housing investments Deutsche Annington (DAIG). The firm raised €2.1 billion of investor commitments from 21 investors.[63]
Terra Firma Capital Partners III (TFCP III) was closed in May 2007 with €5.4 billion of investor commitments. The fund's limited partnership comprises 159 investors from 26 countries.[63]
Terra Firma Special Opportunities Fund I (TFSOFI) closed in December 2012 and is a single asset fund raised to acquire Annington Homes from Nomura. TFSOFI raised a total of £470 million from investors around the world, both institutional and private.[63]

In mid-2011, Terra Firma began speaking with potential investors about the firm's next fund, Terra Firma Capital Partners IV. Terra Firma is targeting to raise upwards of £2.5 billion, which would be roughly half the size of its predecessor with raised £4.8 billion.[43][44]

Our Culture

We encourage our people to challenge accepted views


We have a distinct way of working which embodies:
Creativity: We encourage our people to challenge perceived wisdom and established market views. We actively promote an entrepreneurial environment.
Tenacity: Transforming a business which needs fundamental change requires determination and commitment, particularly when challenging the accepted way of doing things. It requires us to set ambitious targets for ourselves and for our portfolio businesses.
Transparency: We encourage a culture of open communication. This improves the quality of our decision-making and the effectiveness of our teams. It is also essential in order that all our stakeholders – customers, employees, investors, suppliers, unions, governments and trade bodies understand our objectives, plans and results, and how our activities and businesses contribute to the wider community. 
Operating in a non-hierarchical environment: We have flat and flexible teams because we believe that to create value, everyone’s contribution should be sought directly and their opinions and ideas considered without being filtered. We like the challenge and rigour this brings to the decision-making process. There are no contrived limitations on how quickly individuals can progress through the organisation; Terra Firma gives people the opportunity to develop their roles as quickly as their ability allows.





William Burnard (Legal Counsel), Ishan Bharadwaj (Associate Director)

About private equity

Private equity aims to create long-term value by transforming businesses away from the public markets


As a private equity investment firm, we typically raise private equity funds from large institutional investors such as pension funds, financial institutions, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, and family offices. By investing in private equity, these institutions aim to seek higher returns to improve their overall performance. 
The private equity funds we raise are used to acquire asset-backed businesses that can be transformed through fundamental change. As a private equity firm, we aim to create long-term value by transforming businesses away from the public markets. We search for opportunities which have been overlooked. We actively seek out investments in sectors which may be out of favour and in businesses which have been under-managed or under-capitalised. 
Through a combination of strategic change, improved management and sustained investment, we transform our private equity portfolio businesses, creating value for all our stakeholders. These healthier companies are subsequently sold or listed on the public stock markets to realise a return for the investors in our funds.




"Private equity has done an extraordinary job over the years of redefining and reinvigorating businesses that have experienced turbulent times and required new business models"
Tim Pryce

Funds

We have a long track record of superior performance


Terra Firma manages and/or advises the following investment funds: 

Terra Firma Capital Partners I – The fund comprised assets acquired between 1994 and 2002, and is now fully realised. Nomura International plc was the sole equity investor in the portfolio.

Terra Firma Capital Partners II – TFCP II was closed in February 2004, raising a total of €2.1 billion. It is currently managing investments on behalf of 62 investors from 20 countries. The fund was established to follow Terra Firma’s strategy of making control investments in asset- or cash flow-rich companies in complex and often regulated sectors, principally in Europe.

Terra Firma Capital Partners III – TFCP III was closed in May 2007, raising a total of €5.4 billion. It is currently managing investments on behalf of 150 investors from 26 countries. The fund follows the same investment strategy as TFCP II.

Terra Firma Deutsche Annington – TFDA was established in 2006 and held Terra Firma’s German housing assets, in Deutsche Annington Immobilien Group. Terra Firma raised €2.1 billion‎ through TFDA in order to buy Deutsche Annington, along with CPI, from TFCPI. TFDA acquired 82.5%, with the balance being acquired by CPI. Additional capital was secured to allow Deutsche Annington to continue its strategy of acquiring principally German residential properties. In 2013, Deutsche Annington completed an IPO and began trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with a free float of 15.6%. In May 2014, with Terra Firma’s ownership of Deutsche Annington at 67.3%, TFDA distributed its Deutsche Annington shares on a pro rata basis to the TFDA investors. 

Terra Firma Special Opportunities Fund I - TFSOFI closed in December 2012 and is a single asset fund raised to acquire Annington Homes from Nomura. TFSOFI raised a total of £470 million from investors around the world, both institutional and private.

Annington Homes

Annington Homes is the largest private owner of residential property in England and Wales


Annington was created in 1996 to acquire more than 57,400 residential properties from the Ministry of Defence (the ‘MoD’), the majority of which were immediately leased back to the MoD on a 200-year lease. Annington refurbishes and sells or rents on the open market those homes released by the MoD as surplus to its needs. 
The business now owns approximately 40,000 homes, the majority of which are still leased to the MoD.
 
Investment strategy
Asset-Backed: Annington acquired 57,400 residential properties – making it one of the largest private owners of residential property in England and Wales. Currently Annington owns almost 40,000 homes, with most still leased to the MoD.
Requiring Fundamental Change: A new business was created to manage the properties Annington leased to the MoD and to refurbish and sell or rent on the open market those homes released by the MoD as surplus.
 
Creating Value


Transforming strategy


The strategy for the newly created business was to develop a flexible and cost-effective refurbishment and sales capability to maximise the potential from sites released by the MoD, and to explore specific opportunities related to either the existing portfolio or further MoD housing requirements.
Annington created a flexible sales organisation to deal with fluctuating numbers of properties released in unpredictable geographic locations. Through sensitive pricing strategies and the careful use of incentives, home ownership has been made a realistic option for those who have previously been priced out of the UK’s property market. Annington has sold nearly 18,000 homes to the public, with the majority sold to first-time buyers, and many to Service or ex-Service personnel. 
Since 2004, Annington has built or achieved planning permission for more than 2,500 new homes, of which more than 1,000 have been affordable homes.




Strengthening management


The properties were acquired with no management. A team was appointed to establish an effective governance and operating structure. Annington’s operating model is based on a small core team that uses outsourcing as a major tool to meet the fluctuating requirements of the business.




Developing through capital expenditure


Capital expenditure has been deployed on property and site improvements to maximise the value from house sales. With the types of properties that Annington owns, the location and environment are very important and it dedicates substantial investment to creating an attractive environment and ‘street scene’ around the properties.




Building through mergers and acquisitions


Annington has added value through planning, redevelopment and infill development. It has also used available cash to acquire additional properties to lease to either the MoD or private tenants. Annington continues to work with the MoD to find creative solutions to its housing challenges and to look for opportunities to leverage its established management platform. 




Lowering the cost of capital to create extra upside


The stable government-backed rental cash flow from the leased estate, along with proceeds from the sale of properties released, and Annington’s impressive track record have enabled the business to maintain an appropriate level of leverage.




Status of Investment: The Annington investment is held by the Terra Firma Special Opportunities Fund I.
