LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- A joint venture between Western Avenue Capital and Northstar Enterprise Opportunity Fund I, LP ("NCP Enterprise") announced that it has acquired Foothill Square Shopping Center, a 120,000 square foot anchored retail center in Oakland, CA. The well-established property was originally developed in 1962 and underwent a major renovation between 2013 and 2016 whereby the property was significantly remodeled and expanded. Given the transitional nature of the asset, the joint venture seeks to stabilize the asset for the long term and benefit from the attractive going in yield and basis.

Foothill Square Shopping Center is strategically positioned adjacent to the MacArthur Freeway (I-580) just off the Foothill Blvd exit and is the only major grocery-anchored retail center with direct access along Interstate 580 for eight miles north and four miles south. The property's highly visible and easily accessible location has supported the neighboring community for more than 50 years. "The acquisition presents a unique opportunity to stabilize and reposition a cash flowing asset in an infill community in the Bay Area," stated David Kasirer, partner at Western Avenue Capital. The property is 95 percent leased to national and regional tenants including FoodsCo (shadow), Ross Dress for Less, Wells Fargo, Davita, Rainbow and a Head Start school, in addition to multiple leases negotiated during the acquisition process.
"Our company has a track record of acquiring similar properties across the West Coast and we will continue to support the attractive tenant mix and community in Foothill Square," said Jonathan Kasirer, partner at Western Avenue Capital. "We intend to continue to work with professional and reliable capital partners like Northstar," stated Joshua Kaplan, partner at Western Avenue Capital.
Peter Auerbach, NCP Enterprise Co-Founder and CIO stated: "This opportunity delivered the optimal value-add investment opportunity – the ability to significantly increase income through a repositioning of the property in an infill, growth market.  We are pleased with the immediate cash flow in an area we believe is poised for growth. We are pleased to work with Western Avenue Capital in our first investment in the Northstar Enterprise Opportunity Fund I."
Brian Watson, Founder & CEO of Northstar Commercial Partners and the Enterprise Fund stated:  "One of the tenets of our business is to do well by doing good, as we must in local communities to create jobs and opportunities. We believe that this area of Oakland is growing, and we are excited to be involved in helping create new opportunity through our efforts on this asset.  We are pleased with our partners at Western Avenue and look forward to using our best efforts to provide partners with reasonable risk adjusted returns."

Western Avenue Capital and Northstar Commercial Partners has acquired Oakland, California-based Foothill Square Shopping Center, a shopping mall. No financial terms were disclosed.
PRESS RELEASE
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — A joint venture between Western Avenue Capital and Northstar Enterprise Opportunity Fund I, LP (“NCP Enterprise”) announced that it has acquired Foothill Square Shopping Center, a 120,000 square foot anchored retail center in Oakland, CA. The well-established property was originally developed in 1962 and underwent a major renovation between 2013 and 2016 whereby the property was significantly remodeled and expanded. Given the transitional nature of the asset, the joint venture seeks to stabilize the asset for the long term and benefit from the attractive going in yield and basis. The joint venture is the first investment of the recently launched NCP Enterprise Fund I.
Foothill Square Shopping Center is strategically positioned adjacent to the MacArthur Freeway (I-580) just off the Foothill Blvd exit and is the only major grocery-anchored retail center with direct access along Interstate 580 for eight miles north and four miles south. The property’s highly visible and easily accessible location has supported the neighboring community for more than 50 years. “The acquisition presents a unique opportunity to stabilize and reposition a cash flowing asset in an infill community in the Bay Area,” stated David Kasirer, partner at Western Avenue Capital. The property is 95 percent leased to national and regional tenants including FoodsCo (shadow), Ross Dress for Less, Wells Fargo, Davita, Rainbow and a Head Start school, in addition to multiple leases negotiated during the acquisition process. 





“Our company has a track record of acquiring similar properties across the West Coast and we will continue to support the attractive tenant mix and community in Foothill Square,” said Jonathan Kasirer, partner at Western Avenue Capital. “We intend to continue to work with professional and reliable capital partners like Northstar,” stated Joshua Kaplan, partner at Western Avenue Capital.
Peter Auerbach, NCP Enterprise Co-Founder and CIO stated: “This opportunity delivered the optimal value-add investment opportunity – the ability to significantly increase income through a repositioning of the property in an infill, growth market. We are pleased with the immediate cash flow in an area we believe is poised for growth. We are pleased to work with Western Avenue Capital in our first investment in the Northstar Enterprise Opportunity Fund I.”
Brian Watson, Founder & CEO of Northstar Commercial Partners and the Enterprise Fund stated: “One of the tenets of our business is to do well by doing good, as we must in local communities to create jobs and opportunities. We believe that this area of Oakland is growing, and we are excited to be involved in helping create new opportunity through our efforts on this asset. We are pleased with our partners at Western Avenue and look forward to using our best efforts to provide partners with reasonable risk adjusted returns.”

Mosaic International School, IDOE Preschool-6 School, finds new home in Northstar Commercial Partners Building
        																																
              

          Leveraging his experience reviving and revitalizing distressed properties, Brian Watson helped acquire 7035 W. 25th Avenue in Gary, Indiana (former Grissom School Building) as the new home for Mosaic International School Preschool-6 Program.

GARY, Ind., March 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Mosaic International School, accredited by Indiana Department of Education to serve students in the state of Indiana, has found a permanent home in a building purchased for the school by Northstar Commercial Partners.
The 43,000 sq. ft. building located at 7035 W. 25th Avenue, Gary, IN provides the space for Mosaic International to build out their full Preschool – Sixth Grade offering in the Black Oak neighborhood.








Andrea Carter, Mosaic International's founder, has a plethora of teaching and educational leadership experience. "At Mosaic, we believe that every child deserves a high-quality education and is committed to raising kingdom leaders for global impact," Carter said.
Mosaic International offers unique programming and currently serves students in preschool through sixth grade. The school is committed to developing the whole child: mind, body, and character, raising global leaders to impact the world. At Mosaic, data driven instruction is indispensable for improving academic achievement. This approach is deeply embedded in the school's culture, which creates a framework where all students can learn.
Mosaic International shared a facility with the Boys & Girls Club, but lacked the space to expand their program offerings that were critical for student success such as their after school intensive reading and math tutoring. Northstar heard of Mosaic's plight and offered their assistance in helping Mosaic secure their own facility.
"For over 15 years, Northstar has had a strong track record of buying vacant and distressed assets from lenders, corporations, and other owners throughout the United States, improving these assets and placing them back into productivity to create jobs, opportunities, and empowerment for people in their local communities," said Northstar Commercial Partners' Founder & CEO, Brian Watson.
"We're so excited that the former Grissom Elementary School in Gary will allow Mosaic school to continue to grow and expand their Preschool offering," Watson continued. Northstar Commercial Partners will invest additional capital in the property to meet the needs of Mosaic International and to ensure that the facility meets state regulations as a place that houses children.
Providing alternative choice schools, like Mosaic, has been mentioned as a top priority for Secretary Education Betsy DeVos and both Mosaic and Northstar look forward to working on local and national levels to advance continued quality and choice in education.
