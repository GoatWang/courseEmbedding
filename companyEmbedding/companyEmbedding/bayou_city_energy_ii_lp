Bayou City Raises Approximately $1.0 Billion In Two Years For E&P Investments; Closes Second Fund At $310 Million Hard Cap









PR Newswire




Apr 3, 2017 8:27 AM EDT













 


















































    HOUSTON, April 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Bayou City Energy ("Bayou City", "BCE", or the "Firm") has now raised $946 million since its 2015 inception to be invested in the North American E&P sector. Most recently, the Firm reached its $310 million hard cap and held the final closing of Bayou City Energy II, L.P. ("Fund II") on March 31, 2017.  William McMullen, BCE Founder and Managing Partner, said: "The appetite for oil and gas investments is spectacular. Investors are looking for attractive entry points and differentiated ways to create value in the E&P space. We are fortunate to have such sophisticated partners that possess a clear understanding of the upstream oil and gas landscape. With the closing of our second fund, we have more dry powder to find and cultivate deals that meet our exhaustive criteria." Bayou City makes privately negotiated, control equity investments in the upstream space in the general range of $5 million to $50 million per platform company. The Firm also seeks to make dedicated drilling capital commitments ("Drilling Partnerships") to leading operators in order to accelerate the development of de-risked locations.  McMullen added: "We want to thank our current and newest investors for their trust and support. We already closed one transaction in Fund II, the purchase of preferred stock in High Mesa, Inc., and look forward to adding additional platform companies and drilling partnerships soon."  Mark Stoner, BCE Partner, concluded: "We are pleased to have raised our second fund within such a short time period. The capital needs of E&P operators remain heightened in this lower for longer price environment, and BCE is committed to partnering with experienced management teams capable of efficiently deploying capital in both our core strategies, platform companies and drilling partnerships."     Latham & Watkins LLP served as fund formation counsel. Bayou City did not engage a placement agent in connection with the formation of the fund.

Bayou City Energy Purchases Preferred Stock in High Mesa, an Established STACK Operator



Current2016Archive


Back to News



09/12/2016

HOUSTON, Sept. 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Bayou City Energy ("Bayou City" or BCE") today announced its affiliate, BCE-MESA Holdings LLC ("BCE-MESA") completed the purchase of preferred stock in High Mesa, Inc. ("High Mesa"). High Mesa is a privately held Delaware corporation, of which the common stock is owned by management of High Mesa, and the preferred stock is owned by BCE-MESA and HPS Investment Partners, LLC ("HPS"). High Mesa has interests in oil and gas assets, most notably Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (the "Company", "Alta Mesa", or "AMH"). BCE-MESA, which is managed by BCE, includes an investment from affiliates of Intervale Capital, a middle-market energy services private equity firm. In connection with this investment, High Mesa appointed BCE Founding Partner, William McMullen, to its board of directors.
Alta Mesa was founded in 1987 and has a multi-decade track-record of creating value across multiple conventional and unconventional basins. Since drilling its first horizontal STACK well in 2012, the Company has emerged as a leading operator in the prolific STACK oil window of Kingfisher County, Oklahoma. Within Kingfisher County, Alta Mesa has over 95,000 net acres, is currently producing approximately 16,000 BOE per day and is currently operating four rigs across its position.


William McMullen said, "Through their continuous technical refinement and diligent approach to thoroughly understanding the STACK, AMH continues to execute on its operational objectives. We initiated our relationship with AMH and HPS in January through a drilling JV, and completion of this preferred equity investment is based on management's demonstrated success and bright outlook. We are thrilled to further strengthen our relationship with High Mesa, its management team and HPS."
AMH's CEO, Hal Chappelle, added, "We value our relationship with Bayou City Energy, and we believe their team is the ideal partner to invest alongside our existing partner, HPS, and to help our company continue to achieve its objectives in the STACK."
"HPS is excited for AMH to expand its relationship with BCE beyond the drilling JV and welcomes BCE as an additional preferred investor at High Mesa," said Don Dimitrievich, a Managing Director at HPS. "BCE, like HPS, shares management's vision and understands the tremendous growth potential and value of AMH."
Intervale Capital Managing Partner, Charles Cherington, said, "Intervale is truly excited to partner with BCE-MESA, AMH and HPS, and to assist with the growth of their already meaningful enterprise. This upstream investment, which represents an enhancement to Intervale's core focus on energy services, reflects the compelling results, team and assets AMH has assembled. Through the BCE-MESA investment, we can collectively leverage the operational efficiencies, technical expertise, and learning curve AMH has created to progressively expand their platform and advance their development program."
