More Testimonials







So, What's a PFOA?And What's The Big Deal?

So, What's a PFOA?

No, it’s not a new form of algae or a strange bug. PFOA is the acronym for Perflurooctanoic Acid, C8HF15O2, which is a chemical used in the production of PTFE, Teflon™, for water proofing canvas and other outdoor fabrics. As the PTFE material breaks down, it releases PFOA into the atmosphere. Some products are intentionally made with PFOA.
It was discovered that PFOA has been found in the bloodstream of over 98% of American men, women and children. No one is exactly sure how it made its way into the bloodstream of such a large number of people, but the EPA is now pressuring industry to eliminate its use.
The study has shown that PFOA was still present in the human body approximately four years after exposure and that levels were only reduced by approximately one half. PFOA has been implicated in causing cancer of the pancreas, testicles, liver and mammary glands. It’s also been linked to miscarriages, thyroid problems, low birth weights and weakened immune systems.
Aurora Marine’s latest discovery CANVAS SHIELD™ fabric guard is a new Waterproofing coating for marine and other outdoor fabrics and clothing that does not use PTFE, Teflon or Silicone. The secret is that it utilizes Nanoized Polymers and is completely PFOA free. It’s also a much greener alternative; it’s nontoxic, nonflammable when dry, VOC compliant and safe for most natural and synthetic fabrics.
CANVAS SHIELD fabric guard penetrates deep into the fabric to coat and protect each thread, rather than just residing on the surface, so it continues to protect against water migration when the surface coating is worn away from washing, abrasion and environmental degradation. Even though water no longer beads on the surface, your marine canvas still remains waterproof if protected with CANVAS SHIELD fabric guard. The fabric maintains its natural breathability, flexibility and color, even after repeated application. Re-application is recommended annually or when the fabric finally loses its waterproofing ability.
In addition to waterproofing, it also resists stains, mold, UV and color fading.
For best results, the fabric must be clean, dry and free of surfactant residue from soap or detergents. Aurora has also developed FABRI-KLEAN™ fabric cleaner, specifically for pre-cleaning fabrics prior to treatment with CANVAS SHIELD fabric guard and for regular maintenance. FABRI-KLEAN is a free rinsing, concentrated, low sudsing and environment friendly, water based and water activated cleaner with deep penetrating power to clean the threads, not just the surface. It’s effective at removing oil based as well as organic soil such as airborne pollutants, bird droppings, dirt, mold, even grass stains and fish blood. Wet the surface first and spray a bit of the environment friendly concentrate onto the surface, agitate it with a brush and rinse it clean. It’s free rinsing so there is no residue to affect adhesion. When dry, spray on two coats of CANVAS SHIELD fabric guard and allow to cure for 24 hours. Enjoy your waterproof canvas.
Maintenance is easy. Just rinse dirt off with a garden hose. If tough stains, such as bird droppings, remain, we recommend washing with FABRI-KLEAN. When washed with free rinsing FABRI-KLEAN, CANVAS SHIELD can withstand multiple washing before re-application is required.

5.0 out of 5 starsgreat music and songsByAmazon Customeron October 25, 2012is so nice to be able to download music that is from my generation. Most of my albums have suffered  wear and tear after many moves back and forth across the country. No matter how you try to protect them they stil wind up with scratches and skips and slowly able to financially replace all my old LPs with digital music and having Amazon store them also in the cloud it means I never have to worry about your failure or losing my favorite books and music

Top critical reviewSee all 2 critical reviews› 1.0 out of 5 starsDreadfulByBennion September 28, 2016Possibly the worst recording of Showboat ever. The sound is tinny and the recording artists quite poor.Only recommendation: recordings with Paul Robeson and Irene Dunne. We really need a full recordingof the movie version of Show Boat with both of them.
