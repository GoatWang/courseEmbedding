The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

WELCOME
Virtual Instruments, Software Synths, Sample Libraries, Loops, Sounds, and Audio Tools for the Modern Musician.
                    
                    Click here to learn more about ILIO. 

At  ILIO you’ll find everything you need to make music like a Virtual Instrument master.  Whether you’re starting out or whether you’re a working professional musician,  this is the place you’ll find the most incredible software instruments, sample  CD-ROMS, sample libraries and even tools such as Vienna Suite and Vienna  Ensemble Pro. 
ILIO enables you to harness the power of technology in order to  create musical masterpieces that would otherwise require a full orchestra or  stage full of rockers. If you have an ear for music, and are itching to get  inventive, we have the products for you. From your favorite Virtual Instrument  to a sample library that will help you round off the perfect track, ILIO is the  place that has it all. You might have a deep love for music and desire to  create musical masterpieces that get people tapping their feet or you might be  a creative artist who desires nothing more than to embrace freedom of  expression. 
Take a few moments to look around our site and you’re guaranteed to  find something that will spark your interest.
 WHO SHOULD SHOP AT ILIO?
Anyone  with a love for making music, really. Our sample CD-ROMS, sample libraries, audio processing products (Vienna Suite, TH2)  and various Virtual Instrument products (Omnisphere, Ivory II), are almost all  you need to create an inspiring musical work. If you only have knowledge of one particular instrument and would like to put together a piece of music that  requires many other instruments there’s bound to be something on the ILIO site  for you. Similarly, if you’re a singer and would like to compose your own  backtracks, the products on this website are ideal. 
 The  great thing about using a sample library and Virtual Instrument is that you can  take the concept of a “one-man-band” to a whole new level. These innovative  computer programs give you an affordable way to create music from the comfort of your own home studio. Not everyone has thousands of dollars to invest in  musical instruments, studio time and everything else that goes into making a good  track. The products on the ILIO website offer you a simpler way to get started. Once you’re on your feet and have made some moves in the right direction, the  rest will follow.
