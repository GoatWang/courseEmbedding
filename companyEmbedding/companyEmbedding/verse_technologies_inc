Court of Appeal, Second District, Division 2, California.
VERSA TECHNOLOGIES, INC., Petitioner, v. SUPERIOR COURT OF the State of California, COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, Respondent; Perry Dean MOTSINGER, Real Party in Interest.*
Civ. 52650.
    Decided: March 03, 1978

		Dolan & Davis by Robert E. Kelly, Jr., Los Angeles, for petitioner. No appearance for respondent court. James H. Davis and John M. Inferrera, Los Angeles, for real party in interest.
Petition for writ of mandate to require respondent court to vacate its order denying petitioner's motion for summary judgment and to enter a new and different order granting said motion.  We granted an alternative writ.FACTS:Real party in interest, Perry Dean Motsinger, was injured by the alleged malfunction of a certain blow-molding machine and alleged that the malfunction was caused by, among other things, the defective operation of a certain cam-operated air valve.  The valve bore the legend “VERSA,” and was alleged to have been manufactured by petitioner, Versa Technologies, Inc.Versa Technologies, Inc., filed a motion for summary judgment supported by the affidavit of its president to the effect that the valve in question had not been manufactured by Versa Technologies, Inc., of Racine County, Wisconsin.  The declaration of Robert E. Kelly, Jr., Esq., counsel for Versa Technologies, Inc., alleged that the valve was easily identifiable as having been manufactured by Versa Products Company, of New Jersey.The declaration of John M. Inferrera, Esq., one of the lawyers representing real party and plaintiff Motsinger, shows that he twice offered to enter a voluntary dismissal as to Mr. Kelly's client, once before the motion for summary judgment was heard, and again after Mr. Kelly's motion for summary judgment had been denied.Mr. Inferrera filed no counter-affidavits in opposition to Mr. Kelly's motion.  It is alleged that the motion was denied upon the ground that there was no showing that the photographs of the valve, upon which the president of Versa Technologies, Inc., based his affidavit, represented the actual product which allegedly caused the injury.  Mr. Inferrera takes the position that he did not know whether the valve was identical to the one that allegedly caused the injury, while Mr. Kelly takes the position that it was represented to him to be similar to the valve that caused the injury and that he photographed the valve so represented at Mr. Inferrera's office.DISCUSSION:The purpose of a motion for summary judgment is to discover proof, to expedite litigation, and to provide for prompt disposition of actions where there is, in fact, no triable issue.  (Martin v. General Finance Co., 239 Cal.App.2d 438, 48 Cal.Rptr. 773; Bank of America, etc. v. Oil Well S. Co., 12 Cal.App.2d 265, 55 P.2d 885; Newport v. City of Los Angeles, 184 Cal.App.2d 229, 7 Cal.Rptr. 497.)Where, as in the present case, it is conceded by counsel for real party and plaintiff that he has named the wrong party, it is his duty to file a voluntary dismissal whether such dismissal is requested, agreed to, or not.  Presumably, as soon as the motion for summary judgment was filed, counsel for real party was put upon notice that he should determine whether Versa Technologies, Inc., was indeed the manufacturer of the valve in question.  Since counsel for real party informs us under penalty of perjury that he offered to file a voluntary dismissal even after petitioner's motion had been denied, we must assume that he had made the determination that petitioner was not, in fact, the manufacturer of the valve.  Instead of filing a dismissal, however, he filed opposition to this petition.It is true that, by means of interrogatories and requests for admissions, counsel for petitioner might have constructed an air-tight motion for summary judgment.  It is also true that his motion is something less than artful.  We believe, however, that, where a question of identity of one of the parties is raised in the form of a motion for summary judgment, then the opposing party should be required, at the very least, to file a counter-affidavit under penalty of perjury setting forth the facts upon which he bases his good-faith belief that the party is the actual manufacturer of the product involved.Some of the facts which are before us may not have been before the superior court possibly because the superior court took the position that no opposition was necessary.  Surely if the superior court had known that counsel for real party was willing to file a voluntary dismissal, it would have granted the motion for summary judgment. It would seem that counsel have put the courts to a good deal of trouble merely to satisfy a clash of personalities.Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue requiring respondent court to vacate the order of December 22, 1977, denying petitioner's motion for summary judgment, and enter a new and different order granting said motion.BEACH, Associate Justice.
ROTH, P. J., and FLEMING, J., concur.

Technical Support, Troubleshooting
Whether you have a small or large network of PC's, we can help in ensuring that you limit risks to your network.
We also offer service agreements (3, 6 and 12 months) that give you a fixed number of hours per month where we come in and perform maintenance, upgrades and any other task you might need on your computers. Emergency service calls are also included in these agreements.
Other services:

New computer and peripheral purchases
Network layout and design, whether new or expanding
Network setup and security, protecting your data
Virus and malware removal
Optimizing and speeding up computers — they all slow down with age
Backup and recovery procedures (disaster planning)
Software, PC and network training
Writing and editing services

Website Design, Maintenance and Support
We can build your website from scratch or maintain an existing one. From simple HTML to server code, we can deliver results and help you meet your objectives.
We build all our websites, database applications, workflow or e-commerce sites, so that you can control over 95% of the site's content...without any special skills or software tools. By giving you this ability, you save money in the long run. Money that you would otherwise spend on web designers "tweaking" your site's content.
If you're looking for a web solution that is budget oriented, gives you the tools you need to meet your objectives, we encourage you to talk with us.
With Verse Technologies, we'll take the time with you to explore all the different options you may have. The bottom line, after all, is that you get what you want when it comes to your web site.
Our aim is to use technology that is understood by you; technology that you are both knowledgeable and comfortable with. Whether this is done through deploying available solutions or designing new ones from the ground up, the end result will be tools that are useful to you, now and into the future.
Graphics Design
You don't have to contract with another company for your graphics needs. From digital to print products, we have all the necessary tools to see your vision through to completion.
Social Media Consulting and Integration
Social media has been a life saver for many companies. If you haven't already started, we can help you navigate the various paths to ensure you undertake those avenues that are right for you. 
Our initial consultation with you is at no charge. If you've been considering adding social media to your marketing portfolio, we'd be happy to come in and discuss the options with you.
Affordable Rates
Unlike most technology companies where the charge is a fixed rate, oftentimes well above $100 per hour, our rates are structured so that the longer we're on site our rate actually decreases. Our starting rate is $85 per hour and goes down to $65.
We also offer email and phone support, but we don't bill like lawyers. If it's a simple question we're answering, we typically don't charge. If we spend over 15 minutes, you're only going to be charged at a flat rate of $65 (first hour) to $50 per hour, billed in 15-minute increments. This same rate applies if we are remotely troubleshooting computer problems.
For a complete and current list of rates, please email us.

Verse Technologies - Windows XP
















End of Support: April 8, 2014
Windows XP support from Microsoft has ended as of April 8. That means that they will not provide anymore updates (Windows updates) for security flaws, system enhancements or the like for Windows and any Microsoft products being run under Windows XP.
Migrating from Windows XP
        If you are going to migrate from Windows XP to a newer operating system, try looking for a computer with Windows 7 on it. Better yet, look for Windows 7 Professional (more options and tools). Try to steer clear of Windows 8 as this new operating  can be a culture shock for someone who is comfortable with working in Windows XP.

 
Still Using Windows XP?
Note: Read the highlighted areas below on the status of Windows 7, 8 and the next OS 10.
Just because Microsoft has stopped providing support and updates to Windows XP (see sidebar) doesn't mean you have to stop using your computer. However, it does mean that it will be more vulnerable to threats from the Internet.
There are measures you can take to mitigate these threats, but at some point you will have to either upgrade your existing computer (not recommended) or replace your computer with one with a new operating system on it.
Upgrading an Existing Windows XP Computer
This method is not recommended because a newer operating system (Windows 7 or 8) may not run on your existing computer due to hardware incompatibility.
To test your computer for Windows 8.1 compatibility, go to Microsoft's Compatibility Center's website (opens a new window).
The reason a newer operating system may not work with your old computer is because of old technology with both your software programs you use or the hardware (and devices) you use.
Replacing Your XP Machine
This is by far the best choice, but it can be costly. Costly not only for the computer itself, but for the newer software programs you'll have to buy for it. Not all of your existing programs will work under Windows 7 or 8.
If you're going to move to Windows 8.1, you'll find there's a learning curve (a steep learning curve!). Microsoft has changed the familiar Start button interface with a panel layout (more favorable to touch panel devices). There is a way to get to the somewhat-similar old interface, but it can be confusing for most people and that interface isn't entirely like what we're all used to.
If you move to Windows 7, you'll find it very similar to Windows XP. Windows 7 will be around for awhile to come, but it will eventually be archived much like XP. Also, to get Windows 7, you're going to have to hunt for it from the manufacturers (Dell, HP, etc.). It's still available on new computers, it's just harder to find (Microsoft is really pushing Windows 8).
[December, 2014 Update: There will be no Windows 9. In Microsoft's words, "9 will be too closely associated with 8," which carry with it too many negative feelings. Windows 10 "technical preview" is being tested at this time. No release date has been specified, but Microsoft "promises" that it will be out in the latter part of 2015.]
[December, 2014 Previews: Search Youtube for Windows 10 (or click here) for some walk-throughs on the new OS. Skip the searching and watch this one (it's provides a pretty good overview).]
[Fall, 2014 Update: Windows 7 has become much easier to find (thanks to Windows 8) on new computers as Microsoft has made a commitment to abandon Windows 8 entirely. They will continue to support it, but it's going much the way Windows Millennium edition went. See this page for End of Support/Life details on Microsoft systems; scroll to the Windows section for OS's.]
[May, 2014 Update: A reputable "insider" to all things Microsoft says that the company is working on "Windows 9," to debut as early as the third quarter of 2014. There may be truth to this as Windows 8 has been so poorly received by the business community.]
Continue to Use Windows XP
If you're going to continue to use Windows XP, there are certain things that you should ensure you have on it for protection.
If the Windows XP computer is not attached (nor will it ever be in the future) to the Internet, then you can use it for as long as the hardware will hold out.
In reality, however, most computers are attached to the Internet. In this case you need to ensure you have at least all of the following software programs on your computer:

An anti-malware program
An anti-virus program
And a firewall 

Anti-Malware Software
There are some free anti-malware programs available, just search for "antimalware software" (or click here for Google results). The one I like and recommend is from Malwarebytes (opens a new window). There's a free version available, but buy a registered copy of it (there are more options for you). You can buy it for home or business (they have a bulk licensing program). Pricing starts at around $24.95.
Do not use Microsoft's anti-malware products as they will not be updated due to end of support.
Anti-Virus Software
Whatever brand or version you currently use, check with the producers of it to ensure you will still be getting updates for it.
Like anti-malware software, there are many anti-virus software programs available for free. Again, just search for "antivirus software" (click here for Google results).
I like AVG (free or purchased). For the free version, see their website (opens a new window). You can also purchase a version of it as you go through the installation process. The purchased version gives you more protection tools; review their options to see what best fits your needs.
Again, do not use a Microsoft anti-virus product.
Firewall
You should at least have Windows Firewall on 24/7. Better yet (to stay away from Microsoft products that are no longer supported), download a firewall software product. There are many free ones still available. Search for "firewall software" (click here for Google results).
For a solid free firewall, check out Zone Alarm's Firewall (opens new window). They have a version you can buy as well.
Web Surfing
Microsoft's Internet Explorer is probably the most-susceptible web browser for attacks of all kinds. It's a buggy browser (and it's slower than other browsers as well). And now that Microsoft has stopped support for XP, their IE browser is going to be targeted more often in the future by hackers.
If you continue to use your Windows XP computer, it is imperative that you do not use Internet Explorer at all.
Firefox (new window) is a much more secure, faster, and ever-evolving browser that you can continue to use and it will receive updates when they are available. Google's Chrome (new window) is another choice, though for the technically inclined it doesn't offer a lot of configuration choices. 
There are many more browsers besides these two alternatives. See Wikipedia's  entry (new window) for a complete listing.
Summary
Once you have the three products on your computer, make absolutely certain that they are working properly and are receiving updates (new anti-virus and anti-malware definition files). Make certain your firewall is on. And do not use MS's Internet Explorer.
You can extend the life of your XP computer by following the steps above. It doesn't guarantee your computer won't be compromised from an outside threat, but it will lessen the likelihood.
If you or your company wants help in any of the above areas, configuring your XP computer(s), or in migrating to new computers,  I'd be happy to assist you. Please send me an email (or call me at 207.221.0206) and we can discuss your objectives.
Stephen

Versa Technologies Inc.










Absolutely Wonderful Company
“Versa Technologies Inc has been an absolutely wonderful company to work with. Our company, Tarheel Basement Systems, moved to the Winston area this summer and I doubt this experience would have been as easy as it has been without Versa and their entire staff. They have helped build our phone system to our needs and then continue to help us train and learn everything. Communication is quick and always with the best service I have ever experienced. I highly recommend this company!”
Sydney Blake, Tarheel Basement Systems

Customer Service and Satisfaction
“I’ve been using Versa since opening my agency. Clay Poindexter and his team of professionals have always been my first choice for technology issues. Great company that truly understands customer service and satisfaction!”
