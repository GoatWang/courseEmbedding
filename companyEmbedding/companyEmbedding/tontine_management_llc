Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

What is an LLC?
Like a corporation, a limited liability company (or "LLC"), is a separate and distinct legal entity.  This means that an LLC can have its own tax identification number and bank account.  The primary advantage of an LLC is that its owners have "limited liability," meaning that, under most circumstances, the owners are not personally liable for the liabilities and debts of the LLC.  For example, if an LLC is forced into bankruptcy, the owners will not be required to pay the LLC's debts with their own money.  If the assets of the LLC are not enough to cover the debts and liabilities, the creditors generally cannot look to the owners, managers or officers for relief.

An LLC can be taxed either as a "pass-through" entity, like a sole proprietorship or partnership, or as a regular corporation.  By default, an LLC is taxed as a pass-through entity, where the owners just pay taxes on the profits of the LLC at their individual 
tax rates.  This is different from a regular C Corporation, which pays a corporate tax on its net income before distributing profits to the stockholders (the owners) as dividends.  When the corporation distributes profits, the stockholders 
also must pay income tax on these dividends.  Most LLC owners choose to have the profits pass-through so that taxes are only paid once on the profits. 
TotalLegal™ has helped over 1 million people nationwide make essential personal and business legal documents themselves.

Common Questions

Does a Will need to be notarized?What makes a Will legal?Can married couples create one Will that covers both people?What is the TotalLegal plan?What is your free offer?





A Secure and Trusted Way to Protect Your Family
A Will can protect your assets and helps minimize the chances of a contest over your estate. If you die without one, your estate may not be distributed as you would choose. Use a Will to:
Provide for your family
Specify whom you would like to receive your property
State your funeral and burial instructions
Create a trust for minor children
Disinherit a person(s)
Name a guardian for minor children

A Promissory Note is a written contract between Lender and Borrower that sets forth the terms and conditions upon which money is being borrowed and will be paid back.  Promissory Notes are also commonly used in sales transactions where the Buyer does not pay the balance in full at the time of the purchase.  If a Borrower defaults on the terms of a Promissory Note, the Lender can take legal action. TotalLegal makes it easy to create a Promissory Note customized to meet your needs.
