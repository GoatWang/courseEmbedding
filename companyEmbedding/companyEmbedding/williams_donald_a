Description

Don Williams in Ireland CD
If anyone ever needed proof that music is an international language, then they need to look no further than Don Williams. Don picks his songs with all the skills of a class winemaker picking grapes – only the best will do, and the vintage results, as fans around the world all know, is just about the best blend of emotions the heart could ask for.
Don William’s music is the stuff of experience. Like a fine wine, as Don has matured then the songs have even deeper emotional resonance. This is a man who has lived life, who knows the depth of feeling and emotion ordinary people are capable of, not only in Texas, but in all the other places where his straightforward simplicity has made its mark – Brazil, Britain, Ireland, Africa, Australia, Finland, Norway and many more.

Product Description▼▲
This is volume one of Donald M. Williams commentary on Psalms featuring the Introduction, critical notes, and bibliography that also apply to volume two. Section-by-section commentary, contemporary illustrations and outlines, and understandable language make this an excellent resource for preachers and teachers. The New King James and the Masoretic text are referred to throughout the study. All Hebrew is transliterated and supplied in parentheses.  Dr. Donald Williams has been a pastor of Mt. Soledad Presbyterian Church and more recently the Cost Vineyard in La Jolla, California. He has been a lecturer in religion at Claremont MacKenna College in California and an adjunct professor at Fuller Theological Seminary. Dr. Williams holds degrees from Princeton University and Princeton Theological Seminary and holds a Ph.D. from Columbia University.  The Preacher's Commentary series combines historical setting and textual interpretation with spiritual insights and contemporary illustrations that are specifically designed for those endowed with the privilege of communicating God's Word. The end result is a commentary by preachers/teachers for other preachers/teachers that is the ultimate resource for sermon and lesson preparation.

Publisher's Description▼▲
General editor Lloyd J. Ogilvie brings together a team of skilled and exceptional communicators to blend sound scholarship with life-related illustrations. The design for the Preacher's Commentary gives the reader an overall outline of each book of the Bible. Following the introduction, which reveals the author's approach and salient background on the book, each chapter of the commentary provides the Scripture to be exposited. The New King James Bible has been chosen for the Preacher's Commentary because it combines with integrity the beauty of language, underlying Hebrew and Greek textual basis, and thought-flow of the 1611 King James Version, while replacing obsolete verb forms and other archaisms with their everyday contemporary counterparts for greater readability. Reverence for God is preserved in the capitalization of all pronouns referring to the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. Readers who are more comfortable with another translation can readily find the parallel passage by means of the chapter and verse reference at the end of each passage being exposited. The paragraphs of exposition combine fresh insights to the Scripture, application, rich illustrative material, and innovative ways of utilizing the vibrant truth for his or her own life and for the challenge of communicating it with vigor and vitality.


Author Bio▼▲
       Don Williams (PhD, Columbia University and Union Theological Seminary) is founding pastor of the Coast Vineyard Christian Fellowship in California and has taught at Claremont McKenna College and Fuller Theological Seminary.

This article originally appeared on AlterNet.Noam Chomsky, 87, is without a doubt the most significant academic figure to cast a highly critical eye on U.S. foreign policies. The 2016 U.S. presidential primaries are in motion and with democratic socialist Bernie Sanders challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, it may be prudent for valued thinkers like Chomsky to turn that eye in on American soil and the inner gears of its political machine.Aaron Williams: Many people now get their daily news via the news feed on their social media accounts. Unfortunately, these articles are sometimes posted by publications with a particular political leaning and use misleading or misinforming titles that paint their side more favorably. Fortunately, there are many who see past the headline and leave critical feedback.

Noam Chomsky: Furthermore, social media tend to be quite superficial. And they appear to encourage what some young people call “skim reading.”Williams: How important do you think social media has become these days for making an informed public and how much of an impact do you think it can have on grassroots movements?Chomsky: They are useful for organizing, but as information sources they do not begin to compare with print media, in my opinion. Nor do TV or radio.Williams: Bernie Sanders has been quite outspoken about breaking up banks that are “too big to fail.” Rolling Stone recently published an article that speculated on the idea ultimately doing more harm than voters may realize, with corporate bank spinoffs making much more money than they would before a breakup, with some people being driven out of banking to form much less regulated hedge funds. What is your opinion on this? Do you think banks that are “too big” should be broken up?Chomsky: The consequences should be carefully explored. I haven’t done so.Williams: What are your opinions on the surprising progress of Donald Trump? Could it be explained by a climate of fear?Chomsky: Fear, along with the breakdown of society during the neoliberal period. People feel isolated, helpless, victim of powerful forces that they do not understand and cannot influence. It’s interesting to compare the situation in the ‘30s, which I’m old enough to remember. Objectively, poverty and suffering were far greater. But even among poor working people and the unemployed, there was a sense of hope that is lacking now, in large part because of the growth of a militant labor movement and also the existence of political organizations outside the mainstream.Williams: With like outspoken socialists Bernie Sanders and UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn’s current successes, is this a new political age and is this a direct result of austerity?Chomsky: Sanders, in my opinion, is an honest and decent New Deal Democrat. Corbyn expresses stands of traditional Labour. The fact that they are regarded as “extreme” is a comment on the shift to the right of the whole political spectrum during the neoliberal period.Williams:Who do you see becoming the next U.S. president?Chomsky: I can express hopes and fears, but not predictions.
