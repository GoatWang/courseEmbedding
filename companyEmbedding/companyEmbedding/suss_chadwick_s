Plus sizes 	                    Plus sizes (sizes 16W-24W and 1XL-2XL) are designed to flatter a full-figured woman with a height of 5'4" to 5'7". These garments have a more ample cut and allow for more ease than misses. Compared to the misses fit, shoulder widths are proportionally narrower. Pants have a longer rise in back, a fuller seat and are less fitted through the waistline. 	                      SIZES BUST WAIST HIP   1X 	                        16W	                        18W	                        20W	                     	                        44"	                        46"	                        48"	                     	                        38"	                        40"	                        42"	                     	                        46"	                        48"	                        50"	                       2X 	                        22W	                        24W	                     	                        50"	                        52"	                     	                        44"	                        46"	                     	                        52"	                        54"	                       3X 	                        26W	                     	                        54"	                     	                        48"	                     	                        56"
