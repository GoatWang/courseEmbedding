BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means: 
1. provide any required product labeling information

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock
                        
3. provide an opportunity to review and confirm the transaction before the sale is completed

                            4. provide a receipt summarizing the transaction after the purchase
                        









Honor Promises









            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle: Tech with a side of pizza

Amazon? Check. Apple? Yup. But there’s a good chance your third guess is wrong, at least according to Domino’s CEO J. Patrick Doyle.We believe by transaction counts we’re in the top five of e-commerce companies in the world. We know we’re behind Apple and Amazon, but we may be as high as third. Large screens in Domino's tech offices show up-to-the-minute sales numbers at the company's 12,000 restaurants across the world. The company also tracks on which platform customers are ordering. - Tommy Andres/MarketplaceDomino’s is the second-largest pizza company in the world behind Pizza Hut. The company sells a million pies a day at more than 12,000 restaurants around the world, and one in eight pizzas purchased in the U.S. is from a Domino’s franchise. But the reason Doyle considers it an e-commerce site is because half of Domino’s sales are now digital.Nearly half of Domino's corporate headquarters work in technology. A full wing of the office is lined with cubicles, white boards, video monitors and signs like this one. - Tommy Andres/MarketplaceThe company hit it big on innovation, albeit a more analog version. Founder Tom Monaghan invented a firm cardboard box that kept pizza hot and prevented squishing in the company's early days, and years later an employee came up with a combination ladle and spoon called the "spoodle" that Domino's now uses worldwide. The ''spoodle'' allows pizza cooks to spoon sauce and spread it evenly with the same tool. Every second counts when you have a 30 minutes-or-less guarantee. The company honors the invention with a display case in the lobby at Domino's HQ. - Tommy Andres/MarketplaceThe speed and convenience Domino's became known for made the company digital-ready in a lot of ways. Now customers can order pizzas from a smart phone, a smart watch, a smart TV, even a smart car, and all it takes is one tweet, one text, one voice command or even one emoji. It calls the platform “Anyware.”So is Domino’s a pizza company or a tech company? Well, that’s complicated….We employ about 700 people here in Ann Arbor [at Domino’s headquarters], and about 300 of them are in technology.Anyware is the latest phase in Domino’s five-year-in-the-making reinvention plan, one that started the company back at the drawing board in 2010.Our pizza sucksThe first step in fixing a problem is admitting it exists.I still remember getting everybody into this room and saying, "Folks, we gotta make a change.” We’ve got to do something different. Let’s start from scratch.Roxanne Swamba was one of Domino's corporate chefs responsible creating the company's new pizza recipe in 2010. It was in this test kitchen at the Ann Arbor headquarters where then-President J. Patrick Doyle told his employees, ''We have a problem.'' - Tommy Andres/MarketplaceThe room Doyle is referring to is the Domino’s test kitchen. It was there in 2010 that Domino’s chefs experimented with new ingredients and recipes. After months of testing, the company rolled out a new and improved formula. But instead of simply stamping “new and improved” on the box, Doyle and crew did something rather unorthodox. They told the world their pizza wasn’t very good.
The official title of the ad campaign was “Domino’s Pizza Turnaround,” but the media quickly dubbed it the “Our Pizza Sucks” campaign. In the first commercial, focus group participants called the sauce bland and the crust cardboard-like. The face of the ad campaign was Domino's then-president J. Patrick Doyle, who apologized to customers and told them he wanted to do better.To keep turning dough into dough, Domino's needed a better crust. Here's where the recipe for ''uncardboard-like'' crust was born back in 2010. - Tommy Andres/MarketplaceThis is a company that had built the whole brand around fast and reliable delivery, and Marketing 101 says you focus on your point of differentiation. We kept talking about delivery and 30 minutes or less, and it just stopped working. We realized that everyone in the world who wanted fast convenient pizza was already buying from us, and the people who wanted a great pie simply were not.Pizzas created in the test kitchen of Domino's corporate headquarters in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Doyle says employees are constantly working to craft new creations. - Tommy Andres/MarketplaceIt may seem crazy to tell customers your namesake product isn’t up to snuff, especially in the midst of a recession, but the unexpected honesty worked.Our sales that first quarter we relaunched were up 14.3 percent. We were up 9.9 percent for the year, and I will tell you if I had known we were 9.9 and not 10.0 on December 31, I would’ve bought some pizzas myself. Keeping up with the Papa JohnsesReinvention for Domino’s wasn’t just a one-step process. Since unveiling its new pizza recipe, the company has released new sandwiches, pastas, chicken dishes and breads. In 2012 it publicly dropped “Pizza” from its name and re-branded all of its stores.Doyle says the company is constantly whipping up new products and improving tried-and-true ones in its test kitchen and relies on consumers for final approval. There are 15 booths, each outfitted with a slot for sliding slices to customers and gauging their grins and gags. Domino’s calls it the “sensory panel.”The ''Sensory Booth'' is used to test out new ingredients, pizza combinations and more on consumers at Domino's HQ. - Tommy Andres/MarketplaceWe do it not only for new products, but we also do it if we’re looking for a new cheese supplier or a new pepperoni supplier, that sort of thing. It has to be an identical match to what we’ve designated the perfect pepperoni.One of the challenges to creating new menu items at Domino's is that everything has to be cooked on the same eight-minute conveyor belt oven. Doyle says a lot of the new menu items start at the stores, where customers make requests and franchisee owners fiddle. They then come to corporate for testing. Largely everything we make goes through the same oven for the same time at the same temperature. It's a big operating requirement. You look at a lot of different restaurants — McDonald's for instance has eight or 10 different cooking platforms in each store. We have one. We have an oven. So everything we make, we've got to be able to make well through that oven. It makes it a little harder on the front end to get the products right, but that's also what makes our stores so efficient is we do have fundamentally just one cooking platform in the store. Domino's employees sit on this side of the Sensory Booth and gauge consumers' thoughts on new products. - Tommy Andres/MarketplaceTo keep pace with the surge in fast-casual restaurants, Domino’s is also trying to improve its atmosphere. Though it still has no plans to put seating in any of its franchises, Doyle says he wants the small portion of customers who come into a store to be able to watch their pizza being made. He calls it the “pizza theater” concept.Cheese ain't the only thing with cultureDomino’s HQ has a glass-encased mock-up of a Domino’s franchise right in the heart of the building. Doyle says everyone in the company has to learn how to make a pizza, even if they’re destined for a cubicle.Every other week, we’ve got a training class here where we’re training everybody who is above store level on the basics of Domino’s pizza. We set this up and run it as a store. If you’re an accountant, if you’re in marketing, if you’re in technology, you’re going to learn the basics, and you’re going to learn about how what you do day to day affects the stores.In the heart of Domino's HQ is a fully functioning store. All employees, regardless of their position, start here making a pizza and running mock daily operations to get a feel for the business. - Tommy Andres/MarketplaceDomino’s has built a passionate workforce at its mothership and also throughout its worldwide franchises. Doyle boasts that 90 percent of franchisee owners started as employees at Domino’s stores. Perhaps that’s why die-hard employees are sometimes referred to as “Dominoids.” There’s even a companywide cheer.How do you say "pepperoni" in Swahili?Domino’s has opened more than 3,000 restaurants in 80 countries since it reinvented its pizza in 2010. There are now more than 5,000 stores in the U.S. and 7,000 overseas. Last year the company made $4.8 billion of its $8.9 billion in sales outside of the U.S., and Doyle says they’re just scratching the surface.  Ninety-five percent of the world’s population lives outside of the U.S. There is lots of room to grow.A hallway at Domino's World Resource Center is lined with the flags of the 80 countries in which Domino's pizza can be ordered. - Tommy Andres/MarketplaceDoyle says Domino’s has seen success in the U.K., Russia, Brazil and Nigeria, but India has been the company’s runaway hit. “We are quickly approaching 1,000 stores in India,” Doyle said. “That is now by store count our biggest market outside of the U.S.”But setting up shop overseas comes with challenges. The Asian diet, for example, doesn't historically include cheese and much of the world is lactose intolerant. Figuring out what’s going to sell in each market requires local input.We control quality here, but in terms of taste, the new pizza topping that’s going to come out in Mumbai, people in Ann Arbor are going to be fascinated by what they’re doing there, but we've got a separate group that works with our master franchisee in India. They have all of their stores in India, they've got their own marketing team there, and they come up with the new product launches there. We make sure the quality is right, but they’re the ones coming up with the ideas because they've got their fingers on the pulse of the consumer in Mumbai.Growth in China has been slow for Domino’s so far. Maybe part of the reason is the Peanut Mayonnaise Heart Crust Pizza it offers there.Courtesy: Domino'sNo such thing as too much pizzaSo, Domino’s has 12,000 restaurants worldwide and sells 1 million pies a day. Surely growth is slowing, right? This might be the only time Domino’s openly says, “not so fast….”We think we can get another 1,000 stores in the U.S., and as big as we are, we’re only selling one in eight pizzas in the U.S.Only?Marketplace host Kai Ryssdal with Doyle near the entrance of the tech wing at the Domino's World Resource Center. - Tommy Andres/MarketplaceFollow Kai Ryssdal at @kairyssdal. Kai RyssdalKai Ryssdal is the host and senior editor of Marketplace, the most widely heard program on business and the economy — radio or television, commercial or public broadcasting — in the country.
