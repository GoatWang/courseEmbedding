Metals & Mining Company Research Reports


Mining companies, as a rule, carry out such activities as the discovery of reserves, their mining and processing.  Various geological materials are mined – be it coal, gold or silver ore, chromite, salt, and a far more. Some companies specialize on certain products (e.g. metals or minerals), but the industry behemoths offer goods belonging to different product categories.  
Companies active in the mining industry vary according to the size and types of their operations.  Nevertheless, the market is dominated by manufacturers receiving over USD 500 million in revenues annually. BHP Billiton, Vale, Rio Tinto, Shenhua and Suncor are amid companies determining the path of the industry. 
The Catalogue is full of innumerable research reports containing profiles of the major and minor companies involved in metals and mining industries. Besides containing all-inclusive profiles of metals and mineral companies, reports offer unique data on companies’ strengths and weaknesses, financial performance, recent developments and future prospects. Detailed discussions of legal and political framework, product offerings and key competitors are also available in the research studies.

Who We Are



Golden Star is an established West African gold mining company. We have two producing mines in Ghana and we are transforming into a high grade, low cost, non-refractory gold producer.
Golden Star is listed on the NYSE MKT stock exchange (ticker: GSS), the Toronto Stock Exchange (ticker: GSC) and the Ghana Stock Exchange (ticker: GSR).
The investment case for Golden Star is as follows:
Expand All   >

Established, mid-tier gold producer


Golden Star has a 17 year history of producing gold in Ghana. We have two producing mines, Wassa and Prestea, in the south-west of the country, and in 2017 we are on track to produce 255-280,000 ounces of gold at a cash operating cost of $780-860/oz. Ghana is a stable jurisdiction with a century-long history of mining and good existing infrastructure



Production is expanding and costs are reducing


Between 2016 and 2019 Golden Star’s production is expected to increase by 60% and its cash operating costs are expected to decrease by 29%. The key drivers for these changes are Golden Star’s two high grade development projects, Wassa Underground and Prestea Underground. Wassa Underground achieved commercial production in January 2017 and Prestea Underground is expected to follow it into commercial production in Q3 2017.



Strong exploration upside potential


Golden Star has significant potential to expand its Mineral Reserves and the lives of its operations through converting its Mineral Resources to Reserves. There is also substantial potential to expand our Mineral Reserves outside of the current resource area. Golden Star’s mineral concession areas cover approximately 85km of the 250km Ashanti Gold Belt. We have the largest land package of any company operating in Ghana, including the major gold producers.



Experienced management team


Golden Star has an experienced management team with a track record of discovery and project delivery. Sam Coetzer, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is a mining engineer by background with over 26 years’ experience. He previously worked for Kinross, Xstrata Nickel, Xstrata Coal and Placer Dome at open pit and underground mining operations.



Undervalued compared to peer group


Golden Star has significant potential for share price growth as despite our strong performance since the start of 2016, we remain undervalued compared to our peer group on a number of metrics. We intend to continue to increase our share price by developing a reputation for delivery.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Environment




Golden Star is committed to meeting or surpassing regulatory requirements in all of its exploration, development, mining, and closure activities while safeguarding the local environment for our stakeholder communities and for future generations. To access our environment policy, please click here.
At Golden Star, operations are guided with a precautionary approach to environmental management. The aim is to minimize our environmental footprint, while promoting greater overall environmental responsibility both within Golden Star and our stakeholder communities. We approach these environmental responsibilities proactively, and with due care. Over the past few years, Golden Star has undertaken the following initiatives:

Water
Water management is fundamental to our operations and we remain committed towards maintaining local water quality and the sustainability of current and future water allocation. This is achieved by: 

Reducing clean water in flows into the plant; 
Maximizing the reuse of water in our processing plants; 
Providing secondary containment for all our reaction vessels so protecting the receiving environment; and 
Establishing engineered, purpose-built wetland treatment marshes for biological treatment and polishing of waters before they are discharged to the downstream receiving environment. 

Rehabilitation and next land use planning
Golden Star is committed to sustainable land use and mine-site rehabilitation as an integral part of all the phases of project development and execution. Initiatives include: 

Progressive rehabilitation of pits and waste dumps; 
Where pit sequencing allows, backfilling pits so allowing a next land use agreed to by our stakeholders;
Introduction of our award-winning oil palm project as an economic livelihood project for artisanal miners and other community members.

History


Incorporated in May 1992, Golden Star is an established gold mining company with operations in Ghana. For more information on our key milestones, please explore our timeline below.
Expand All   >

2016

Wassa
The first stope is blasted at Wassa Underground in July 2016 in the F Shoot zone of the deposit, with commercial production achieved on January 1, 2017. Development continues and drilling results continue to confirm wide zones of high grade gold mineralization in the B Shoot.
Prestea
Underground infrastructure refurbishment is largely completed by the end of 2016 and Prestea Underground is expected to be in commercial production by mid-2017. Alimak stoping is selected as the mining method for Prestea Underground due to its safety and efficiency benefits.
The Prestea Open Pits deliver substantially higher gold production in 2016 than expected. The mining lease for the Mampon deposit, which will be mined in 2017, is received. Mampon’s high grade ore will be blended with ore from Prestea Open Pits to extend the mine life of the Prestea Open Pits into the second half of 2017.
        



2015

Wassa
The Feasibility Study is completed for Wassa Underground. Funding is secured from Royal Gold for the development of Wassa Underground and Prestea Underground. Construction of the twin declines at Wassa Underground begins in mid-2015.
Prestea
A Feasibility Study for Prestea Underground is completed in late 2015. Mining begins at Prestea Open Pits and Prestea Underground is expected to be in production in mid-2017.
Bogoso
The high cost refractory operations at Bogoso are terminated in the third quarter of 2015.



2014

Wassa
The Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) is released for Wassa Underground. Development is estimated to require initial capital expenditure of $41 million and reduce life of mine cash operating costs to below $800 from the start of 2015. Open pit mining at Father Brown is sidelined due to higher mining costs. 
Prestea
A PEA is released on the development of Prestea Underground. 



2013

Wassa
Alterations to the Wassa plant are completed to enable processing of deeper, harder ores. Ongoing drilling below the Wassa pits continues to extend underground mineralization 400m to the south. Work commences to transform the Wassa pits into a single large pit – the Wassa Main Pit.
Bogoso
Tailings retreatment commenced.



2012

Wassa 
Drilling commences of the deeper zones below the Wassa pits. Results are promising, indicating the potential for an underground mining operation.
Bogoso 
The non-refractory plant is converted successfully to a tailings reprocessing facility. The back-filling of the Plant North pit is completed.



2011

Wassa
Mining at Adiokrom is completed and open pit mining at Father Brown commences. 
Bogoso
The Biox® tanks at the Refractory Processing Plant are upgraded.



2010

Bogoso
Mining of the Plant North pit ceases. Mining continues at the Chujah and Buesichem pits.



2009

Wassa
Mining of the Benso deposit is completed, while mining at the Adiokrom deposit commences. Deep drilling suggests potential underground mining is possible at both the Adiokrom and Father Brown deposits.
Bogoso
Construction of a back-up 20MW diesel-fired power station at Bogoso is completed. 



2008

Wassa
Mining of the Benso deposit commences, feeding higher grade ore to the Wassa plant.
Bogoso
Bogoso mine operations are optimized but the processing plants are impacted by intermittent grid power supply. 



2007

Wassa
Construction of an 80km dedicated haul road from the Hwini-Butre deposits to the Wassa mine is completed.
Bogoso
The Bogoso Refractory Processing Plant is commissioned in July.



2006

Wassa
Wassa is connected to grid power, reducing power costs dramatically. St. Jude Resources is acquired, which owned the Hwini-Butre and Benso concessions. Resource drilling on these concessions commences.
Bogoso
Processing of the non-refractory ores in the Bogoso plant continues but deeper, more sulphidic ore demonstrates the need for the refractory processing plant, which continues to be constructed. The Prestea Underground Mineral Resources total nearly 2 million ounces.



2005

Wassa
The carbon in leach (CIL) plant is commissioned.
Bogoso
Construction of the Bogoso Refractory Processing Plant, designed to use Biox® technology, commences. At Prestea, the West Reef area drilling returns encouraging results leading to further expenditures on drilling and underground refurbishment.



2004

Wassa
A Feasibility Study is completed on converting Wassa from a heap leach operation to a conventional CIL plant and construction begins.
Bogoso
The capacity of the refractory processing plant capacity is doubled. The West Reef area is identified as prospective and underground drilling commences.



2003

Wassa
Golden Star acquires the Wassa Gold Mine from Standard Bank for $16 million as a result of their foreclosure of Glencar Mining assets.
Bogoso
A Feasibility Study on the refractory Mineral Reserves commences, with use of Biox® technology contemplated. The Plant North pit on the Prestea concession is commissioned.



2002

Bogoso
The Prestea concession is acquired from the joint venture between the Government of Ghana and the Ghana National Mineworkers Union. Prestea had been in intermittent production since the 1890s, producing over 9 million ounces of gold from underground mining techniques. Work to repair the pumping system and dewater the mine, refurbish both shafts, and repair electrical and ventilation systems commences.



1999

Bogoso
Golden Star acquires the Bogoso concessions and the associated infrastructure. Mining of oxide ores continues while investing heavily in exploration drilling. This exploration is successful, ultimately increasing the non-refractory Mineral Reserves tenfold and finding millions of ounces of refractory ore.
