Sevion is applying its integrated suite of technologies to develop new classes of therapies against previously inaccessible targets
Antibody Pipeline
Sevion has created functional antibodies that modulate G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, two classes of targets that have proven difficult to address using conventional antibody discovery approaches.
SVN-001
SVN-001 is an ion channel blocking antibody which is potentially the first therapeutic antibody against this target class. SVN-001 targets an ion channel, Kv1.3, which has been implicated in a number of different autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. By targeting a unique subset of immune cells, SVN-001 is not broadly immunosuppressive, which improves the safety profile compared to typical immunosuppressants. Sevion is advancing SVN-001 through preclinical development where it has demonstrated potent activity.
SVN-002
SVN-002 is a unique antibody against an oncology target that holds the potential to significantly impact highly metastatic tumors that are resistant to anti-VEGF treatments. The target is highly expressed in clear cell renal carcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis. Sevion is advancing SVN-002 through preclinical development.
Chimerasome Pipeline
SVN-003
SVN-003 is a chimerasome/insulin product which preferentially delivers insulin to the liver. It has extremely potent glucose regulation properties in animal models.
To learn more about our pipeline and technologies, please see our publications and presentations.

					Full Description



Sevion Therapeutics, Inc., incorporated on September 30, 1999, is a development-stage biotech company. The Company is engaged in building and developing a portfolio of therapeutics, from both internal discovery and acquisition, for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases. The Company is engaged in the development and licensing of technology to discover and engineer monoclonal antibodies. The Company's product candidates are derived from multiple technology platforms, such as cell-based arrayed antibody discovery, ultralong antibody scaffolds and Chimerasome nanocages.The Company has various antibodies in its preclinical pipeline. The Company's antibody therapeutic candidates target the potassium channel, voltage dependent (Kv1.3) ion channel, which is essential in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Other antibodies in its pipeline target cell surface molecules involved in cancer progression. The Company has developed the spatially addressed antibody library with an expansive combinatorial collection of recombinant antibodies, in which each well contains a single species of antibody of known concentration, composition and sequence. The Company's spatially addressed library allows it to evaluate the therapeutic potential of each antibody individually in a non-competitive way and allows direct discovery on the cell surface. The discovery system unlocks epitopes, targets, and functions that are only identifiable in the context of a living cell.The Company has discovered and humanized a class of therapeutic antibodies derived from cows. The ultralong Complementary Determining Region 3 (CDR3), structural domain found in cow antibodies, consists of a knob on a stalk that protrudes far from the antibody surface. Using both the humanized spatially addressed antibody library and direct engineering of the knob, the Company is exploring the ability of utilizing the knob and stalk structure to functionally interact with therapeutic targets, including G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs), ion channels and other multispanning membrane therapeutic targets on the cell surface.The Company's lead antibody, SVN001, is an ion channel-blocking antibody. SVN001 targets an ion channel, Kv1.3, which is implicated in a number of different autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. The Company's product candidate, SVN002, is an antibody against an oncology target that affects metastatic tumors that are resistant to the class of drugs that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The target is expressed in clear cell renal carcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis. The Company has discovered fully human antibodies against additional oncology targets, including receptor tyrosine-protein kinase-2 (ErbB2), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase-3 (ErbB3), Chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) and Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R), which are engineered to have activity in in-vitro systems. These cell surface proteins are validated in the disease fields of oncology and diabetes.
