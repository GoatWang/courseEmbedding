Balanced Fund









Share








































What is a 'Balanced Fund'
A balanced fund combines a stock component, a bond component and sometimes a money market component in a single portfolio. Generally, these hybrid funds stick to a relatively fixed mix of stocks and bonds that reflects either a moderate, or higher equity, component, or conservative, or higher fixed-income, component orientation.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Balanced Fund'
      Balanced funds are geared toward investors who are looking for a mixture of safety, income and modest capital appreciation. The amounts this type of mutual fund invests into each asset class usually must remain within a set minimum and maximum.Although they are in the "asset allocation" family, balanced fund portfolios do not materially change their asset mix. This is unlike life-cycle, target-date and actively managed asset-allocation funds, which make changes in response to an investor's changing risk-return appetite and age or overall investment market conditions.Equities and InflationInvestors who have dual investment objectives favor balanced funds. Typically, retirees or investors with low risk tolerance utilize these funds for growth that outpaces inflation and income that supplements current needs. While retirees generally scale back risk as age advances, many individuals recognize the need for equity exposure as life expectancies increase. While the equity holdings of a balanced fund tend to lean toward large, dividend-paying companies, those issues typically provide long-term total returns that track the S&P 500 Index. Historically, inflation has averaged about 3%, while the S&P 500 averaged about 9.8% from 1928 through 2014. Equities prevent erosion of purchasing power and help ensure long-term preservation of retirement nest eggs.Income NeedsThe bond component of a balanced fund serves two purposes: creating an income stream and tempering portfolio volatility. Investment-grade bonds such as AAA corporate issues and U.S. Treasurys provide interest income from semi-annual payments, while large-company stocks offer quarterly dividend payouts to enhance yield. Retired investors may take distributions in cash to bolster income from pensions, personal savings and government subsidies.Secondarily, bonds and Treasurys hold much less volatility than stocks. Bondholders have a claim against assets of a company while stocks represent ownership, bearing all inherent risk if bankruptcy occurs. Hence, debt security prices do not move in lockstep with equities, and their stability prevents wild swings in the share price of a balanced fund.Balanced Fund Performance ExampleThe Vanguard Balanced Index Fund has a below-average risk rating from Morningstar with an above-average reward profile. Through 10 years ending June 15, 2016, the fund, holding about 60% stock and 40% bonds, has returned 6.78% on average with a 1.89% trailing 12-month yield.

                Separately Managed Accounts: A Mutual Fund Alternative            


    By Katrina Lamb 






Share















































The investment management world is divided into retail and institutional investors. On one side are the traditional products designed for middle-income individual investors, like the retail classes of mutual funds; these have modest initial investment requirements. On the other side are managed strategies for institutions, with imposing minimum requirements of $25 million or more. In between these, however, is the growing universe of separately managed accounts (SMAs) targeted at wealthy (but not necessarily ultra-wealthy) individual investors. This article will examine the world of SMAs and what investors--or their financial advisors--should keep in mind when considering these investment vehicles.
SEE: Separately Managed Accounts: A Boon For AllDefining Managed Separate AccountsA SMA is a portfolio of assets under the management of a professional investment firm. In the United States, the vast majority of such firms are called registered investment advisors, and operate under the regulatory auspices of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 and the purview of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). One or more portfolio managers are responsible for day-to-day investment decisions, supported by a team of analysts, operations and administrative staff. SMAs differ from pooled vehicles like mutual funds in that each portfolio is unique to a single account (hence the name). In other words, if you set up a separate account with Money Manager X, then Manager X has the discretion to make decisions for this account that may be different from decisions made for other accounts.
Say, for example, that a manager operates a diversified core equity strategy including 20 stocks. The manager decides to launch a mutual fund containing these stocks and also a separately managed account offering. Assume that at the outset, the manager invests all portfolios with the same weight--both the mutual fund and the SMAs. From a client's perspective, the beneficial interests in either vehicle are identical at the outset, but the statements will look different. For the mutual fund client, the position will show up as a single-line entry bearing the mutual fund ticker--most likely a five-letter acronym ending in "X." The value will be the net asset value from the close of business on the statement's effective date. The SMA investor's statement, however, will list each of the equity positions and values separately, and the total value of the account will simply be the aggregate value of each of the positions. 
From this beginning point, things will begin to diverge. Decisions the manager makes for the mutual fund--including the timing for purchase and sale of shares, dividend reinvestment and distributions--will affect all fund investors in the same way. For SMAs, however, the decisions are at the account level and will therefore vary from one investor to another.
SEE: Wrap It Up: The Terms And Benefits Of Managed Money
Mass CustomizationThe high level of customization is one of the main selling points of SMAs, particularly when it comes to individual taxable accounts. Portfolio transactions have expense and tax implications. With managed accounts, investors can feel like they have a greater degree of control over these decisions, and that they are more closely attuned to the objectives and constraints set forth in the investment policy statement. 
So what is the price of entry for this extra level of customized attention? There is no single answer for the several thousand managers that make up the SMA universe. As a general rule of thumb, the price of entry starts at $100,000. SMAs targeted to high net worth retail investors tend to set account minimum balances between $100,000 and $5 million. For strategies designed especially for institutional managers, minimum account sizes may range from $10 million to $100 million.  
For style-based investors who seek exposure to several different investment styles (e.g., large-cap value, small-cap growth) the price of entry goes up, as there will be a separate SMA, and a separate account minimum, for each style chosen. For example, an investor seeking style-pure exposure in the four corners of the style box--large cap, small cap, value and growth--might need to have at least $400,000 available to implement an SMA-based strategy. Other investors may prefer an all-cap blend (or core) approach that could be found through a single manager. 
Fee StructuresOne of the difficulties inherent in making an apples-to-apples comparison among investment offerings is that fee structures vary. This is even trickier for SMAs than for mutual funds, for reasons we will explain here.
Mutual fund fees are fairly straightforward. The key number is the net expense ratio, including the management fee (for the professional services of the team that runs the fund), miscellaneous ancillary expenses and a distribution charge called a 12(b)1 fee for certain eligible funds. Many funds also have different types of sales charges. Funds are required to disclose this information in their prospectuses and show explicitly how the fund expenses and sales charges would affect hypothetical returns over different holding periods. Investors can easily obtain these prospectuses from the fund's parent company, either online or through the mail. Separate accounts do not come with prospectuses. Managers list their basic fee structures in a regulatory filing called a Form ADV Part 2. An investor can obtain this document by contacting the manager, but they tend not to be as widely available through unrestricted online downloads as mutual fund prospectuses. Moreover, the published fee schedule in the ADV Part 2 is not necessarily firm - it is subject to negotiation between the investor (or the investor's financial advisor) and the money manager. Often, it is not a single fee but a scale in which the fee (expressed as a percentage of assets under management) decreases as the asset volume (the amount invested) increases.
The Importance of Due DiligenceBecause SMAs do not issue registered prospectuses, investors or their advisors need to rely on other sources for investigating and evaluating the manager. In investor-speak, this is referred to as due diligence. A comprehensive due diligence will elicit sufficiently detailed information regarding all of the following areas: 
Performance DataA manager should be prepared to share performance data (annual and preferably quarterly returns achieved) since inception of the strategy. The information is contained on a composite--a table showing aggregate performance for all fee-paying accounts in that strategy. A good question to ask here is whether the composite complies with the Global Investment Performance Standards set by the CFA Institute and whether a competent third-party auditor has provided a letter affirming compliance with the standards.  
Philosophy and ApproachEach manager has a unique investment philosophy and way of going about applying that philosophy to an investment approach. You will want to know whether the manager has a more active or passive style, a top-down or bottom-up approach, how he or she manages alpha and beta risk, the strategy's performance benchmark and other similar information. 
Investment ProcessFind out who makes the decisions and how they get carried out; the roles and responsibilities of portfolio managers, analysts, support staff and others; who comprises the investment committee and how often it meets and the sell discipline and other key aspects of the process. 
OperationsSome managers have extensive in-house trading platforms, while others outsource all non-core functions to third-party providers like Schwab or Fidelity. You also need to understand transaction expenses and how they can affect your bottom line. Another useful area of information here is client and account services. Among other things, here you can find out about net client activity--how many new clients did the firm originate and how many left over a defined time period? What were the circumstances surrounding those who left? 
Organization and CompensationHow the firm is organized and how it pays its professionals--especially the managers whose reputations and track records are the big draw--is an extremely important area to cover. Understand the calculations behind incentive compensation. Are the manager's incentives aligned with those of the investor? This is a must. 
Compliance HistoryRed flags include prominent infractions with the SEC or other regulatory bodies, fines or penalties levied and lawsuits or other adverse legal situations. The SEC considers separate account managers to be investment advisors subject to the provisions of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. 
Much of this information can be obtained from the manager's Form ADV Parts 1 and 2 (with Part 2 having more of the details on strategy, approach, fees and biographical information on the principal team members). Performance data should be available directly from the manager, either online or through personal contact with a manager representative. The representative should also be able to coordinate phone or in-person meetings with key team members, and direct your questions appropriately on compliance and other issues.
The Bottom LineBy virtue of the account minimums, separately managed accounts are certainly not for everybody. If you have the means, they can be a useful alternative to mutual funds or other pooled vehicles and more closely align with your own specific return objectives, risk tolerance and special circumstances.

 Fact SheetJun 30, 2017


 CommentaryMar 31, 2017







The Fund
The Fund invests worldwide in companies principally engaged in the discovery, development, production or distribution of products (or services) related to scientific advances in health care, including biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, managed  health care, and medical equipment and supplies.



The Approach
The portfolio managers seek to purchase stocks that are reasonably priced in relation to their fundamental value and that the portfolio managers believe will grow in value over time regardless of short-term market fluctuations. The stock selection proces s is based on numerous factors, including the potential to increase market share (for larger companies), and the potential of research and development projects (for smaller companies). The team is based in Boston and London.



The Features
Growth in the health care sector is led by aging demographics, innovation and rising global incomes. As the global population ages and becomes wealthier, we believe health care spending is likely to continue to rise. Innovation drives growth in the secto r, as increased scientific understanding leads to new breakthroughs.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund. References to investments are  to the Portfolio's holdings.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Because the Fund investments may be concentrated in a particular industry, the Fund share value may fluctuate more than that of a less concentrated fund. Investments in foreign instruments or curr encies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Smaller companies are generally subject to greater price fluctuations, limited liquidity, h igher transaction costs and higher investment risk than larger, established companies. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risk s and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

6. The Morningstar Health Category includes funds that invest in companies in the medical and health-care industries.
7. Alpha measures risk-adjusted performance, showing excess return delivered at the same risk level as the benchmark. Beta measures the volatility of a fund relative to the overall market. R-Squared represents the percentage of the portfolio's movement that  can be explained by the general movement of the market. Standard deviation measures the historic volatility of a fund. Sharpe Ratio uses standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk.
8. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
Global equity markets delivered solid gains in the first quarter of 2017 despite a pullback by U.S. stocks late in the period amid dimming prospects for President Donald Trump's pro-business agenda.
U.S. stocks advanced for much of the period, extending the rally that began with President Trump's election in November. Responding to continued economic growth, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) raised its benchmark interest rate in March and indicated  that further rate hikes would be coming in 2017.Taking the Fed action as a vote of confidence in the U.S. economy, stocks rose following the rate hike. Bank stocks led the advance on expectations that bank earnings would benefit from higher rates. Stron g manufacturing and jobs data also boosted equity markets. During February, the U.S. added 235,000 new jobs, topping forecasts, while the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.7%.
But U.S stocks reversed course after President Trump's health care bill was withdrawn from Congress. The health care failure raised concerns about the prospects for the president's future economic initiatives, including tax reduction and infrastructure s pending. Equities recouped some of the lost ground in the final days of the three-month period.
Globally, signs of economic gains across a broad spectrum of regions encouraged investors during the period. In Asia, rising demand for semiconductors and other electronics boosted growth in the region's export-oriented economies. In Europe, positive eco nomic data and receding political risks helped push stocks higher. Even countries long-mired in recession, such as Russia and Brazil, showed signs of recovery during the period.The MSCI World Index11 finished the quarter up 6.38%, driven by str ong returns across the majority of sectors. Ten of the 11 index sectors posted positive returns for the quarter, led by information technology and healthcare, while energy was the lone negative-performing sector.


Performance Summary 
For the first quarter of 2017, the Worldwide Health Sciences Fund Class A Shares outperformed the MSCI World Healthcare Index (the Index), returning 9.22% at NAV, vs. 8.44% for the Index.

Healthcare is off to a strong start in 2017, with all index sub-industries posting positive returns for the first quarter. The health care sector's positive performance was driven by a number of factors, including strong earnings releases from major heal th care companies, new drug approvals, positive clinical trial results coming out of the biotechnology industry and a stall in the President's health care agenda in Congress.
Health care technology was the best-performing industry, followed by life science tools, and equipment and suppliers. Health care providers and services lagged for the quarter.
Both stock selection and industry positioning relative to the Index were positive influences on Fund performance for the first quarter.
The Fund's overweight to the United States was additive to performance, as the U.S. outperformed much of the world during the quarter. Additionally, the Fund's underweight to Japan and overweight to Belgium aided relative returns.

Contributors 
Positive contributors for the Fund's performance include:

Stock selection was strong for the quarter, most notably in health care equipment and suppliers and pharmaceuticals.
The Fund's relative underweight to health care providers and services, as well as positive stock selection within the industry boosted returns for the quarter.
The top contributor from a stock selection standpoint for the first quarter was Wright Medical Group., a maker of joint implants and bone graft substitutes. The company reported higher-than-expected revenues and investors are optimistic about the company 's robust pipeline.
Within biotech, Incyte Corporation, a biopharma company which focuses on oncology and autoimmune diseases, remained a top-contributor to Fund performance. Vertex Pharmaceuticals was a positive contributor as well, as the company published positive result s for one of its late-stage Cystic Fibrosis drugs.
Additional contributors included health care equipment company Intuitive Surgical Inc. and pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Japanese ophthalmic drug maker Santen Pharmaceuticals.



Detractors 
Negative contributors for the Fund's performance include:

Stock selection within biotechnology was a detractor to the Fund's relative performance, although somewhat offset by the Fund's overweight relative to the  industry.
The Fund's relative performance was also hindered by an underweight to life sciences and tools, as well as negative stock selection for the quarter within the industry.
Stock detractors for the quarter included pharma companies Zoetis Inc., which reported somewhat mixed fourth quarter revenue results, and Bristol-Myers Squibb which had announced in early January news that accelerated approval for their lung cancer drug  would not be sought. Additionally, biotech company Alexion Pharmaceuticals detracted from Fund performance as investors remain cautious on the name after the recent management changes.



Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
The overall health care sector has been stuck in a range since mid-2015 after a strong multi-year rally. We think that within the broader sector, specific industries such as pharmaceuticals and biotech are offering value. In fact, both industries are tra ding on the lower end of their historical valuation ranges in terms of price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios.
With the first attempt of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) failing, we are watching for either a congressional pivot toward tax reform or one last push to address healthcare reform. As the political spotlight slowly shifts away from healthcare , we can get back to fundamentals.
Within the overall sector, we're looking for innovation. We favor companies that deliver strong returns on capital and companies that have a very solid competitive advantage. Among these companies, there are some amazing things going on right now in rese arch and development (R&D). For the past 30 years, oncology companies have been trying to move away from chemotherapy to develop targeted therapies that go right after tumors. Now, companies like Bristol Myers, Roche and Merck are actually trying to harn ess the human immune system to target tumors. We continue to believe there will always be a market for innovative solutions to the world's health problems.
