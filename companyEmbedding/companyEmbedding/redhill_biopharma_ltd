RedHill Biopharma Ltd. (Nasdaq: RDHL) – which recently commenced commercial efforts and an ongoing expansion in Raleigh following the recruitment of a number of former Salix employees – has reported initial net revenues in the second quarter of 2017.
Revenues of $500,000 were for the period between June 12 and June 30 following the start of U.S. promotional activities for Donnatal and sale of EnteraGam, both gastrointestinal products, according to RedHill. The company reported it had immaterial net revenues in the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of 2017.

“Our strategy is to become a revenue generating, specialty GI pharma company with commercial presence in the U.S. to set the stage for potential launch by RedHill of our late clinical stage, potential blockbuster GI products if approved by the FDA,” said RedHill co-founder and CEO Dror Ben-Asher on a company call reporting second quarter financial results July 25. “RedHill remains focused on diligent execution and … implementation of exactly that strategy with several ongoing Phase III GI programs as well as the commencement last month of U.S. specialty GI promotional activity with two commercial products.”




 


RedHill reported research and development expenses of $8.4 million in the second quarter of 2017, up $2.4 million from the second quarter of 2016, primarily due to ongoing late state clinical studies for a number of products in development by the company. And it reported general and administrative expenses of $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2017, up $1.2 million from the second quarter of last year, largely due to the establishment of U.S. commercial operations.
The company also stated that it clocked selling and marketing expenses for the first time this year, with selling, marketing and business development expenses of $3.4 million in the second quarter. Operating loss was $13.5 million for the second quarter of 2017, up $6.3 million from the second quarter of 2016.
As of June 30, RedHill had cash and equivalents of $51 million.
“Additional commercial GI products are planned to be added to the basket of our specialty GI U.S. sales force later this year, potentially utilizing and increasing economies of scale,” said Ben-Asher.

RedHill Biopharma Ltd. (Nasdaq: RDHL) – which recently commenced commercial efforts and an ongoing expansion in Raleigh following the recruitment of a number of former Salix employees – has reported initial net revenues in the second quarter of 2017.
Revenues of $500,000 were for the period between June 12 and June 30 following the start of U.S. promotional activities for Donnatal and sale of EnteraGam, both gastrointestinal products, according to RedHill. The company reported it had immaterial net revenues in the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of 2017.

“Our strategy is to become a revenue generating, specialty GI pharma company with commercial presence in the U.S. to set the stage for potential launch by RedHill of our late clinical stage, potential blockbuster GI products if approved by the FDA,” said RedHill co-founder and CEO Dror Ben-Asher on a company call reporting second quarter financial results July 25. “RedHill remains focused on diligent execution and … implementation of exactly that strategy with several ongoing Phase III GI programs as well as the commencement last month of U.S. specialty GI promotional activity with two commercial products.”




 


RedHill reported research and development expenses of $8.4 million in the second quarter of 2017, up $2.4 million from the second quarter of 2016, primarily due to ongoing late state clinical studies for a number of products in development by the company. And it reported general and administrative expenses of $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2017, up $1.2 million from the second quarter of last year, largely due to the establishment of U.S. commercial operations.
The company also stated that it clocked selling and marketing expenses for the first time this year, with selling, marketing and business development expenses of $3.4 million in the second quarter. Operating loss was $13.5 million for the second quarter of 2017, up $6.3 million from the second quarter of 2016.
As of June 30, RedHill had cash and equivalents of $51 million.
“Additional commercial GI products are planned to be added to the basket of our specialty GI U.S. sales force later this year, potentially utilizing and increasing economies of scale,” said Ben-Asher.

(RDHL) (Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange:RDHL) ("RedHill" or the "Company"), a specialty biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development and commercialization of late clinical-stage, proprietary, orally-administered, small molecule drugs for gastrointestinal (GI) and inflammatory diseases and cancer, today announced the signing of an exclusive license agreement with Entera Health Inc. ("Entera Health"), a privately held U.S. company focused on the research, manufacturing, and commercialization of value-added proteins and protein co-products, granting RedHill the exclusive U.S. rights to EnteraGam®2.EnteraGam® is a commercially-available medical food intended for the dietary management of chronic diarrhea and loose stools which must be administered under medical supervision. 2016 net sales of EnteraGam® in the U.S. were over $5 million. EnteraGam® is a serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) with a unique mechanism of action intended to restore gut balance. EnteraGam® has been studied for various uses, such as diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated enteropathy3.Guy Goldberg, RedHill`s Chief Business Officer, said: "We look forward to initiating the promotion of Donnatal®4 and EnteraGam® in mid-2017. We are currently in advanced stages of building RedHill`s commercial operations in the U.S. and are excited to complement our product portfolio with a second commercial product geared towards gastroenterologists. We would like to thank our new partners at Entera Health and look forward to a successful long-term partnership."Adi Frish, RedHill`s Senior VP, Business Development and Licensing, said: "This is another important step in implementing our strategic plan of becoming a revenue-generating, gastrointestinal-focused, specialty pharmaceutical company in the U.S. We continue to pursue additional commercial product opportunities in the specialty GI area to further expand our commercial operations. In parallel, we continue to advance the development of our three Phase III GI products, which, if approved by the FDA, we intend to commercialize in the U.S."Aage Lauridsen, Entera Health`s CEO, said: "We are very pleased to partner with RedHill to secure the continued marketing of EnteraGam® in the U.S. and are confident that RedHill`s sales team will continue to grow the value of this unique product."Under the terms of the agreement, RedHill licensed the exclusive U.S. rights to EnteraGam® for all indications for human use. RedHill will pay Entera Health tiered royalties on net sales generated from the sale of EnteraGam® by RedHill, and is not required to make any upfront or milestone payments. Under the terms of the agreement, Entera Health will also grant RedHill certain U.S. rights to its FDA-approved dicyclomine hydrochloride5 oral solution USP (10 mg/5 ml), an antispasmodic and anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agent indicated for the treatment of functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome.Numerous publications of clinical studies and retrospective chart reviews support the use of SBI in the dietary management of chronic diarrhea and loose stools4. The combined effect of SBI is intended to fulfill a distinctive nutritional requirement associated with various gastrointestinal conditions, where chronic diarrhea or loose stools are present and normal dietary proteins alone are insufficient. SBI has been shown in clinical studies to reduce loose stools and improve stool consistency as well as other symptoms, such as abdominal pain, bloating and urgency, in patients with chronic diarrhea and loose stools4. Several studies in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn`s disease, suggest that SBI improves clinical symptomatic management of patients who are not fully managed on traditional therapies4. SBI has also been studied in patients with fecal incontinence with chronic diarrhea, in patients with celiac and non-celiac gluten sensitivity with chronic diarrhea and in additional gastrointestinal indications4.Read MoreNo significant interactions of EnteraGam® with commonly prescribed medications or therapies have been reported. According to Entera Health, it is estimated that since EnteraGam® was introduced in 2013, nearly 3 million doses of EnteraGam® have been administered to patients in the U.S., with an overall adverse events rate of less than 0.2%, with no serious adverse events attributed to EnteraGam® during post-marketing surveillance.In January 2017, RedHill announced an exclusive co-promotion agreement with a subsidiary6 of Concordia International Corp., granting RedHill certain promotional rights in the U.S. for Donnatal®, a prescription oral drug used with other drugs in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and acute enterocolitis (inflammation of the small bowel).About EnteraGam®:EnteraGam® (a serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate, SBI) is a medical food product intended for the dietary management of chronic diarrhea and loose stools. EnteraGam® must be administered under medical supervision. EnteraGam® binds microbial components7, such as toxic substances released by bacteria, that upset the intestinal environment. This helps prevent them from penetrating the lining of the intestine, which may contribute to chronic diarrhea and loose stools in people who have specific intestinal disorders8 9.Safety Information:EnteraGam® contains beef protein; therefore, patients who have an allergy to beef or any other component of EnteraGam® should not take this product.  EnteraGam® has not been studied in pregnant women, in women during labor and delivery, or in nursing mothers.  The choice to administer EnteraGam® during pregnancy, labor and delivery, or to nursing mothers is at the clinical discretion of the prescribing physician.EnteraGam® does not contain any milk-derived ingredients such as lactose, casein, or whey.  EnteraGam® is gluten-free, dye-free and soy-free. Please see full Product Information.To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Entera Health, Inc. at 1-855-4ENTERA (1-855-436-8372), or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 (1-800-332-1088) or www.fda.gov/medwatch.About Donnatal®:Donnatal® (Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide), a prescription drug, is classified as possibly effective as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and acute enterocolitis. Donnatal® slows the natural movements of the gut by relaxing the muscles in the stomach and intestines and acts on the brain to produce a calming effect. Donnatal® comes in two formulations: immediate release Donnatal® Tablets and immediate release Donnatal® Elixir, a fast-acting liquid.Important Safety Information:Donnatal® is contraindicated in patients who have glaucoma, obstructive uropathy, obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract, paralytic ileus, unstable cardiovascular status, severe ulcerative colitis, myasthenia gravis, hiatal hernia with reflux esophagitis, or known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. Patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding or who have autonomic neuropathy, hepatic or renal disease, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia or hypertension should notify their doctor before taking Donnatal®. Side effects may include: dryness of the mouth, urinary retention, blurred vision, dilation of pupils, rapid heartbeat, loss of sense of taste, headache, nervousness, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, insomnia, nausea, vomiting and allergic reactions which may be severe.Further information, including prescribing information, can be found on www.donnatal.com.Please see the following website for complete important safety information about Donnatal®: http://www.donnatal.com/professionals/important-safety-information/About RedHill Biopharma Ltd.:RedHill Biopharma Ltd.
