Shanghai: State-run shipbuilding group CSSC has announced that it has appointed Chen Jianliang as the president of Hudong Zhonghua Shipbuilding.
The position had been vacant since former president Gu Tiquan was arrested for corruption charges last year. Gu denied all the charges against him in a court trial in December, and the case is still pending.
Chen had served as the general manager of Hudong Zhonghua Shipbuilding and a director of Jiangnan Heavy Industry.
In the meantime, CSSC also appointed Huang Yiping and Du Keshun as the general manager of Jiangnan Changxing Shipbuilding and general manager of Shanghai Shipyard respectively.
