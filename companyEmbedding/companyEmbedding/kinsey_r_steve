This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Kinsey rallies community for Stop the Violence and Peace March


(Jul 26, 2017) Rep. Stephen Kinsey



PHILADELPHIA, July 26 – State Rep. Stephen Kinsey, D-Phila., is rallying community members, churches, law enforcement and community organizations for a Stop the Violence and Peace March planned for Friday, Aug. 4. The march will begin at 6:30 p.m. at the 6300 block of Moylan St. (off West Washington Lane in Germantown). “The level of violence in Philadelphia in the past 30 days is intolerable and unacceptable. A string of shootings has been unleashed and we need to touch every community in our city to find a way to get guns out of the hands of irresponsible people,” Kinsey said. Statistics show that homicides are up 20 percent in Philadelphia. As of this past week, the Philadelphia police has documented 169 homicides, compared to 142 at the same time last year. “Enough is enough. Just last week an innocent woman was driving her car in Logan and was struck by a stray bullet. In Grays Ferry, a 16-year-old was shot while attending a cookout. These are just a few examples of the senseless shootings in our community,” Kinsey said. “Our families deserve to live in safe and productive communities. Our children deserve to live in a peaceful environment that ensures a better future for them and, consequently, for all our neighbors.” Kinsey said the march is aimed to empower the people of our local communities and to let them know that there are leaders and organizations who care about them and their quality of life.

Run of oppressive heat sparks water deliveries to first responders, seniors


(Jul 24, 2017) Rep. Stephen Kinsey



PHILADELPHIA, July 24 – July and August are the hottest months of the year, so the prospect of hot-weather injuries continues to exist, said state Rep. Stephen Kinsey, D-Phila., who will kick off bottled-water deliveries with local elected officials to police officers, firefighters and senior citizens across the 201st Legislative District .    "There is the threat of heat injury and we want to take precautions keeping local residents equipped with water," Kinsey said. "We have folks without air conditioning, seniors who have difficulties withstanding the heat, and people out there working in the hot sun. People need reminded to drink plenty of water, take breaks and find cool shelter when working or playing outside for long periods of time."   Kinsey will be delivering more than 5,000 bottles of water to area residents and sharing tips on how to beat the heat, such as:     Stay hydrated by drinking lots of water and do not overexert yourself.   Try to stay indoors as much as possible.   Check on elderly friends and neighbors, and those with medical conditions. For additional help, call the Philadelphia Corporation for the Aging Senior Helpline at 215-765-9040.   Know the City of Philadelphia "Cooling Centers" at http://gsg.phila.gov/map .   Register at https://alert.pa.gov to receive emergency alerts for when temperatures spike and other emergencies strike.     Kinsey also said that he encourages seniors in need of water to contact his  Read more


 













Kinsey: Sickle cell funding is secured, patients will continue to get treatment  


(Jul 19, 2017) Rep. Stephen Kinsey



PHILADELPHIA, July 19 – State Rep. Stephen Kinsey, D-Phila., said he is pleased with the funding appropriated to the cause of sickle cell disease on the 2017-18 state spending plan .   “I’m glad the legislature kept sickle cell patients as a priority on this year’s spending plan and appropriated the necessary money to support individuals and families whose lives have been touched by the disease. Now we can continue research activities that can lead to improved treatment and, one day, a cure,” Kinsey said.   Sickle cell funding for fiscal year 2017-18 reaches $1.26 million, the same amount appropriated for the 2016-17 fiscal year. The funds will be administered by the Pennsylvania Department of Health.   “I’ve been a strong advocate for sickle cell funding because this is a disease with a high prevalence among African-Americans and people who live in households with low family incomes. For this populations, attaining and maintaining high-quality health insurance is even more difficult,” Kinsey said. “We held events, rallies and meetings and the efforts have come to fruition.”   Sickle cell anemia is a serious blood disorder that causes acute pain, severe anemia, infections and vascular blockages that can lead to widespread organ damage and death. It is a genetic disease, affecting 2 million Americans, most often African-Americans and Hispanics. Until the past few decades, most people with sickle cell disease did not  Read more

Stephen Kinsey, D-Phila., announced he will host a public safety meeting at 6:30 p.m. Thursday, July 6 at Wesley Enhanced Living at Stapeley, 6300 Green St. Kinsey is partnering with the Duval Improvement Association, one of Philadelphia’s oldest community associations, to provide neighbors with strategies to keep the area safe.

John Hearn, the new police captain for the 14th Police District. “It is important that we equip residents with the skills necessary to keep our communities safe,” Kinsey said. “No one knows our neighborhoods more than the people who live in them. That is why it is even more important that we work together to build healthy and sustaining communities. Meetings like these are important in establishing goals to create community change and seeing them through.” The meeting is open to the community, and constituents with questions should contact Kinsey’s office at 215-849-6592.

Kinsey: Spending plan passed by the legislature protects services for residents


(Jun 30, 2017) Rep. Stephen Kinsey



HARRISBURG, June 30 – State Rep. Stephen Kinsey, D-Phila., said he is pleased with the bipartisan spending plan passed today by the legislature.   “Today we are taking positive steps toward the financial health of our commonwealth. Our $32 billion spending plan reflects investments in public education and supports our senior citizens, and human services,” Kinsey said. “This bill appropriates necessary money needed to support educators in our communities, human services and health programs, and contributions to our pension system.”   Within a year, this funding will provide an additional $100 million for basic education, a $25 million increase for special education, and another $30 million for Pre-K Counts and Head Start programs. Pennsylvania’s 14 state-owned universities will see an $8.9 million increase, while funding will continue for the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.   “For Philadelphia, this boost in education means an extra $34 million for basic and special education. If we invest that money wisely to capitalize on our children’s capacities and maximize the support and learning opportunities, then we really stand a good chance of setting our communities on a trajectory of success,” Kinsey said.   Kinsey, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said he is glad lawmakers were able to reach bipartisan support to fund important human services initiatives and maintain existing  Read more

 Kinsey, Fitzgerald applaud ‘stop-and-go’ bill passage in the House  


(Jun 27, 2017) Rep. Stephen Kinsey



HARRISBURG, June 27 – State Reps. Stephen Kinsey and Isabella Fitzgerald, both D-Phila., today applauded the passage of a bill in the House of Representatives that would address the issue of nuisance establishments that sell alcohol and disrupt communities.   House Bill 1547 would allow the state Liquor Control Board to designate saturated nuisance market areas, where violations would be subject to enhanced penalties, fines and suspensions, and allow the board to remove licenses from those areas.   Kinsey, who held a public meeting in March with Fitzgerald on the issue of these nuisance establishments, said this legislation is a major step in addressing how these stores disrupt local communities.   “The residents of Philadelphia deserve to have the best quality of life possible without the problems caused by stop-and-go issues,” Kinsey said. “I applaud Rep. Jordan Harris and my fellow colleagues from Philadelphia for joining forces to combat this issue head-on with this legislation.   “I am encouraged to continue the conversation and bring an end to these unwanted businesses.”   Fitzgerald echoed her colleague’s comments.   “Between the public meetings and the tireless work by my colleagues, we are moving forward to take action and eliminate the problems with these nuisance establishments,” Fitzgerald said. “I remain committed to working with state and local agencies to reverse the negative trend of consequences  Read more

Kinsey-Brown resolution celebrates Juneteenth National Freedom Day


(Jun 19, 2017) Rep. Stephen Kinsey



HARRISBURG, June 19 – The Pennsylvania House of Representatives unanimously adopted a resolution  (H.R. 375)  introduced by Reps. Stephen Kinsey and Vanessa Brown, D-Phila., which recognizes the third Saturday in June as Juneteenth National Freedom Day in Pennsylvania.   Juneteenth celebrates the heritage, family and community spirit of African culture. The celebrations originated in 1865, when 13,000 black Union soldiers from Pennsylvania escorted Gen. Gordon Granger to Galveston, Texas, to read Order No. 3 and free the last slaves in the United States, kick-starting a 140-year-old “Juneteenth” tradition that today recognizes both the freedom of slaves and the endurance of African culture in North America.   "It is hard to imagine today, in our world of instant communication, that it took almost three years for the freedoms granted in Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation to be expressed to the slaves in Texas," Brown said. “This celebration represents a triumph of the human spirit over slavery. It’s a salute to the soldiers who carried the message to Galveston, to every last slave who was freed after the Civil War, and to the African culture that endured even the most stringent oppression,” Brown said.   "Diversity and inclusion are critical components of our country’s development and success. If a group of people are not allowed to participate culturally, we fail to understand and appreciate our differences and  Read more
