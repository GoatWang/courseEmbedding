            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

OPPORTUNITY SELECTION
A COMPELLING ANGLE

Adopt a different perspective and you open up a world of opportunities. The interesting question then is which opportunities will pass the closest, most disciplined scrutiny and reward you? 








A SPECIALIST STRATEGY
A MEASURED APPROACH

As with all approaches, it is a question of priorities.
Our focus is primarily on the construction of specialist strategies that should provide excess returns on a risk-adjusted basis. That is where our concentration is centred. Get that  right and everything else falls into place. 








OPEN MINDS
ORIGINAL THINKING

The great opportunities are never obvious. They do not sit in the path of well-worn thinking, waiting for you. Those who explore possibility and intelligently evaluate risk are the people most likely to benefit from what goes largely unnoticed by the crowd.






Polygon is a global investment firm. Founded in 2002, our goal
is the creation of investment alpha based on a disciplined,
repeatable, research-driven process. Our thinking is sometimes
bold, often original and is driven by the commitment of a diverse
team.  Polygon is owned by Tetragon
Financial Group Limited.

This website includes statements that are, or may be deemed to
be, "forward looking statements". These forward looking statements
can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology,
including the terms "believes", "estimates", "anticipates",
"expects", "intends", "may", "will" or "should" or, in each case,
their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. These
forward looking statements include all matters that are not
historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this
website and include statements regarding the intentions, beliefs or
current expectations of Polygon concerning, among other things, the
investment performance, results of operations, financial condition,
liquidity and prospects of Polygon. By their nature, forward
looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they
relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not
occur in the future. Forward looking statements are not guarantees
of future performance. Polygon's actual investment performance,
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may differ
materially from the impression created by the forward looking
statements contained on this website. In addition, even if the
investment performance, results of operations, financial condition
and liquidity of Polygon are consistent with the forward looking
statements contained in this website, those results or developments
may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent
periods. Polygon does not undertake to update any of these
forward-looking statements.

Polygon Convertible Opportunity Fund wins Eurohedge Convertibles & Volatility award for the fourth time


The  Polygon
Convertible Opportunity Fund has won the 2016 Eurohedge Award in
the Convertibles & Volatility category.  There were four
other nominees for this award.
This is the fourth time in six
consecutive years that the Polygon Convertible Opportunity Fund has
received this award, which we believe reflects Polygon's focus on
long-term alpha generation.
Reade Griffith, co-Founder of
Polygon, commented: "We are delighted that the expertise and hard
work of Mike Humphries and the Convertible team has been recognised
by EuroHedge, as part of their highly-regarded Awards. To have won
this award for a fourth time since 2010 is testament to the team's
approach in building a portfolio which has exhibited low
correlation to passive indices and is based on robust research and
our employees' depth of experience across European and North
American markets."
Polygon was also nominated for
Management Firm of the Year, and the Polygon Distressed
Opportunities Fund was a nominee in the Event Driven &
Distressed category.
The EuroHedge Award is
compiled by EuroHedge magazine, a publication of Hedge Fund
Intelligence. Information about the award, including nomination and
winning criteria, is available below and at www.hedgefundintelligence.com.
 
To be considered for an award, funds must submit performance
data to the HedgeFund Intelligence Database and have at least a
12-month track record history.
The only exception to this rule is for new fund awards where a
minimum seven-month track record is required; for these awards, the
funds' whole performance history to date is taken into account.
Winners are decided using an established methodology based upon
a combination of Sharpe ratios and returns over the relevant time
period.
Nominations are decided by those funds in each peer group that
achieve the strongest Sharpe ratios over 12 months, so long as they
also beat the median returns in their relevant peer groups and are
within 10% of their high-water marks.
The eventual winners will be the funds that have the best
returns, as long as they also have Sharpe ratios within 25% of the
best Sharpe of the nominees in their relevant peer groups.
Most of the award categories require a minimum asset level.

UK REGULATORY
DISCLOSURES











1. Introduction
The European Capital Requirements Directive ("CRD")
introduced capital adequacy standards and an associated supervisory
framework in the EU based on the Basel II rules. It affects banks,
building societies as well as certain investment firms. The
Directive was introduced into the UK by the Financial Services
Authority. The new framework consisted of three
'pillars'.
Pillar 1

The minimum capital required by a firm to meet credit, market
and operational risk.

Pillar 2

A regular assessment of a firm's regulatory capital, through a
process known as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process
("ICAAP"), which determines whether the amount of internal capital
is sufficient to cover all the risks to which the firm is exposed
or whether additional capital needs to be held against the risks
not covered in Pillar 1.

Pillar 3

This introduces public disclosure of qualitative and
quantitative information and is aimed to encourage market
discipline by providing market participants access to key
information on a firm's capital, risk exposures and risk management
processes.

The rules in BIPRU 11 set out the Pillar 3 requirements.
This document is designed to meet the Pillar 3 requirements. The
rules permit Polygon to omit any information that is considered
immaterial, such that its omission would be unlikely to change or
influence the decision of those relying on that information. In
addition, Polygon may omit required disclosures which it regards as
propriety or confidential. Propriety information is that which may
undermine Polygon's competitive position if it is shared.
Information is considered to be confidential where there are
obligations binding Polygon to confidentiality with its customers,
suppliers and counterparties.
No omissions have been made on the grounds that the
relevant information is propriety or confidential.  Certain
information has been omitted on the ground that it is immaterial
(see the section headed "Items omitted from the Pillar 3
Disclosures").
2. Scope and
application
Polygon is authorised and regulated by the Financial
Conduct Authority (the "FCA") and as such is subject to minimum
capital requirements, based on its categorization as a BIPRU
firm.
Polygon serves or, in the future may serve, as the
investment manager to various funds and other investment vehicles
and accounts.
Polygon does not form part of a consolidation group for
prudential purposes. The LLP was authorised by the Financial
Services Authority from 4th  of May, 2011 and became
authorised by the FCA on 1st  of April
2013.
3. Risk Management and the
Risk Management Process
Polygon is governed by an Executive Committee (the
"Executive Committee"). The Risk Committee and Infrastructure
Committee report to the Executive Committee and with their input
the Executive Committee determines the business strategy and risk
appetite for Polygon. The Executive Committee includes Polygon's
Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") and Chief Investment
Officer.
For various reasons, the Executive Committee considers
that from a regulatory capital perspective, Polygon is a relatively
low risk organization. For example Polygon does not directly take
custody of any investor assets.
Due to the small size of Polygon and its relatively low
risk profile, the Executive Committee considers that Polygon does
not warrant the need for a separate risk management function within
Polygon. Risk management is undertaken by the Risk Committee with
the assistance of the CEO together with support from internal
compliance, legal and operations teams. In addition, Polygon
retains external professional services firms for expert advice and
consultation, as and where considered appropriate.
The Executive Committee of Polygon, through formal and
informal meetings, is actively involved in determining Polygon's
business strategy and implementing processes to mitigate risks.
Polygon's risk profile is assessed, as part of the ICAAP process,
at least annually and more frequently as and when the need arises,
at the discretion of the Executive Committee.
The Executive Committee also determines how the risks
Polygon faces may be mitigated and assesses the arrangements to
manage those risks on an ongoing basis. The Executive Committee
meets both formally and informally to discuss current projections
for profitability, cash flow, regulatory capital management,
business planning and risk management. The Executive Committee
manages Polygon's business and identifies risks through a framework
of policy and procedures taking account of relevant laws,
standards, principles and rules (including FCA principles and
rules) with the aim of operating a defined and transparent risk
management framework. These policies and procedures are updated as
required.
The Executive Committee has identified that credit,
business and operational, and market risks are the main areas of
risk to which Polygon is exposed. The Executive Committee formally
review the risks, controls and other risk mitigation arrangements
and assesses their effectiveness. Where the Executive Committee
identifies material risks, it considers the financial impact of
these risks as part of Polygon's business planning and capital
management and concludes whether the amount of regulatory capital
is adequate.
4. Credit Risk
Client Concentration
Polygon's clients may include funds
and other investment vehicles and accounts. This may result in a
high client concentration risk. Polygon is financially dependent
upon the Funds and separate accounts. Their continued support is
enshrined in their management agreements.
5. Business and Operational
Risk
Operational risk is defined by the FCA as the risk of loss
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and
systems or from external events, including legal risk. The
Management Committee has identified relevant risks and related
mitigation and controls as part of its ICAAP review.
Polygon has policies and procedures and ongoing
operational and related compliance monitoring to help identify
weaknesses and potential control failures which are required to be
reported promptly when observed to the Executive
Committee.
6. Market Risk
The Executive Committee believes that Polygon's market
risks, which include the potential effects of a long term downturn
in financial markets and foreign currency exchange risk, would not
have a direct material effect on Polygon due to its funding
relationship with the Funds.
7. Regulatory
Capital
Polygon's capital position as at the
year ended 31 December 2016 was as follows:




Capital Item


$'000




Tier 1 Capital


8,515




Total Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital


   
 nil     




Deductions


nil




Total Available Capital after
Deductions


8,515




The LLP is a relatively small firm with a simple operational
infrastructure. The LLP's market risk is mainly limited to foreign
exchange risk on its foreign currency cash balances. In addition,
the LLP is subject to credit risk on management and performance
fees receivable from the Funds. The LLP follows the standardised
approach to market risk and the simplified standard approach to
credit risk. The LLP is subject to the Fixed Overhead Requirement
and is not required to calculate operational risk capital though it
considers this as part of its process to identify the level of risk
based capital required
Polygon is a BIPRU firm for the purposes of the FCA's capital
requirements rules and, as such, its minimum capital requirement is
the greatest of: 

The base capital requirement of €50,000;
The sum of its market and credit risk requirements; and
The 13 Week Fixed Overheads Requirement ("FOR").

The Executive Committee considers that
the available capital at 31 December 2016 more than adequately
exceeds the minimum capital requirement of the FOR.
The LLP's capital requirements for
regulatory purposes as at the year ended 31 December 2016 is
summarised as follows:




Requirement Item


$'000




Base capital requirement


59




Sum of market and credit risk
requirement


1,360




Fixed overhead requirement


4,631




Total Available Capital after
Deductions


8,515




 
As at 31 December 2016 the LLP's regulatory capital
requirement is $4,631 and the LLP's regulatory capital of $8,515
exceeds the minimum capital requirement by $3,884. As such, the
LLP's regulatory capital exceeds its regulatory capital requirement
by 184%.
Remuneration
The LLP maintains a written remuneration policy designed to
comply with the rules and guidance relating to the FCA's
Remuneration Code as it applies to BIPRU firms (the "Remuneration
Rules").  The LLP's remuneration policy applies to its members
and employees whose professional activities have a material impact
on the LLP's risk profile ("Remuneration Code Staff").  The
LLP's Executive Committee oversees the LLP's remuneration of
Remuneration Code Staff. 
The total compensation of Remuneration Code Staff is generally
structured as a base salary or, in the case of LLP members, a fixed
profit allocation and a year-end bonus or, in the case of LLP
members, a discretionary profit allocation.  The payment of
any such year-end bonus or year-end distribution of profits is
subject to various conditions and the amount may be zero under
certain circumstances.  In the case of other Remuneration Code
Staff, the amount of any year-end bonus or year-end distribution of
profits is entirely discretionary and is based on a number of
considerations, including, among other things, the relevant member
of staff's experience and performance in the role, the overall
performance of the investment strategy that the employee supports
(if applicable), the profitability of the Polygon group, and
competitive pay practices and industry benchmarks.  The
relative weight accorded to each of these factors is also
discretionary.
A portion of any year-end bonus or, as the case may be, year-end
distribution of profits awarded to Remuneration Code Staff is
subject to mandatory deferral.  Deferred amounts may be
invested in one or more of the private investment funds managed by
the Polygon group and/or shares in the Firm's listed affiliate,
Tetragon Financial Group Limited (TFG).  Remuneration Code
Staff who voluntarily elect to leave Polygon (other than in
connection with retirement) will typically forfeit all or
significant portions of their unvested deferred compensation and
thus have an economic incentive to remain with Polygon..
Polygon takes into account the specific nature of its own
activities (including the nature of its revenues) in conducting any
ex-ante risk adjustments to year-end bonuses.  Polygon has
elected not to make ex-post risk adjustments to year-end bonuses,
as permitted under the Remuneration Rules.  Polygon may,
however, reduce prior year deferred compensation awards under
certain circumstances. 
All Remuneration Code Staff support Polygon's investment
management activities (Polygon's only "business area" for purposes
of the Remuneration Rules) and either are "senior managers" of
Polygon or perform a significant influence function. 
  
Items omitted from
the Pillar 3 Disclosures
Polygon's  minimum
capital requirement under Pillar 1 is driven by its FOR and not the
sum of its credit risk and market risk requirements.  Polygon
has, accordingly, concluded that the detailed disclosure
requirements in relation to credit risk and market risk set out in
BIPRU 11.5.4R(2)-(4), BIPRU 11.5.5-11.5.13R, and BIPRU
11.5.15R-11.5.16R may be excluded from the Pillar 3 Disclosures on
the grounds that they are immaterial (in accordance with BIPRU
11.3.5R).
Polygon does not engage in
securitization activity and the securitization disclosures in BIPRU
11.5.17R are not applicable.  Polygon has, therefore,
concluded that it is permitted to exclude such disclosures from the
Pillar 3 Disclosures on the grounds that they are immaterial (in
accordance with BIPRU 11.3.5R).
Commitment to the UK
Stewardship Code
Under Rule 2.2.3R of the FCA's Conduct of Business Sourcebook,
Polygon Global Partners LLP ("Polygon") is required to include on
this website a disclosure about the nature of its commitment to the
UK Financial Reporting Council's Stewardship Code (the "Code") or,
where it does not commit to the Code, its alternative investment
strategy. The Code is a voluntary code and sets out a number of
principles relating to engagement by investors with UK equity
issuers.
Polygon acts as the investment manager to one or more private
investment funds and other accounts (collectively the "Polygon
Clients"). Polygon's investment strategy is such that the Polygon
Clients may hold long positions in equities, including UK equities.
The Code is therefore relevant to some aspects of Polygon's trading
on behalf of the Polygon Clients.
While Polygon generally supports the objectives that underlie
the Code, it has chosen not to commit to the Code. Polygon's
investment strategy involves the Polygon Clients holding positions
in a variety of asset classes and in a variety of jurisdictions
globally. Polygon's approach in relation to engagement with issuers
(and members of their management teams) in all of the jurisdictions
in which the Polygon Clients invest is determined on a case-by-case
basis. Consequently, Polygon does not consider it appropriate to
commit to any particular voluntary code of practice relating to any
individual jurisdiction.
