One never really felt as though you worked “for” him as much as “with” him.  He has the unique talent of making everyone, from the shop floor to the top floor, recognize that they are an integral part of the growth and development of the Company.   He is approachable, empowering and compassionate and our labor management relationship improved greatly during his tenure.  I would jump at the chance to work for Chris again!

              There's a little “Good Will Hunting” in Chris DiSantis.You know the story: a kid from a working-class neighborhood is found to be a  genius and ultimately rises above his environment to do great things. That's Mr. DiSantis — though he didn't wait quite as long as Will did to have his talents discovered. Mr. DiSantis' dad knew his son had brains all along, and he wasn't about to let him squander them. “He was a bit of a perfectionist,” Mr. DiSantis said of his father. “Whether you were washing the car or getting A's, it had to be perfect.” The elder Mr. DiSantis worked his way up the hard way, starting as a mechanic and eventually becoming a project manager at a company that converted old U.S. Navy  vessels into state-of-the-art  warships in the family's hometown of Philadelphia.  He made things a little easier for his son, who at a young age was proving himself worthy of the effort and investment his family put into him. Chris DiSantis became the first student from his high school to get into the Ivy Leagues when he was accepted by Dartmouth.  “The standards were so much higher, I struggled the first year-and-a-half,” Mr. DiSantis said. He turned it around, however, ultimately graduating summa cum laude with a tough double major. After a stint in investment banking, a 24-year-old Mr. DiSantis went to work for a client who had a group of manufacturing companies  headquartered in Pittsburgh.  His first task was to close a  factory in Michigan, but after  being there a month, he had other plans. “I said to him, "I think we're about to make a very bad mistake. I don't think we should shut this plant down; it's just had bad  management in the past.' ” Then he went a step further and told his boss, “I think you should make me president and let me turn it around.” It worked, not only for Mr.  DiSantis, but for the workers at the plant who ultimately kept their jobs. Three years later, Mr. DiSantis called his boss with worse news than usual: Another plant the boss wanted turned around was, in Mr. DiSantis' opinion, not worth saving. Fine, his boss told him — you fire those people, personally. “He was teaching me a lesson,” Mr. DiSantis said. “The lesson was that once you have to do that, you'll do whatever you have to do to not have to do it again.” Today, Mr. DiSantis is president and chief operating officer of Hawk Corp., a major maker of brake pads and other friction materials for  aircraft and heavy equipment.  He has sold three divisions of the company in nine years as part of a mission to refocus the company on its core business.  And he doesn't plan on leaving anytime soon. “There's a lot more to be done here,” he said.
