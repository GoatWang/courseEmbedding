Flash Point
Patented innovation in flash point testing

At which temperatures will your sample burn, ignite or cause fire? How are your flammable liquids composed, and what are their properties? Volatility is directly related to a substance‘s flash point temperature (flammability). Anton Paar’s flash point testing equipment safely and easily determines the values you require for processing, storing, transporting and classification of dangerous liquids.

Flash Point
Patented innovation in flash point testing

At which temperatures will your sample burn, ignite or cause fire? How are your flammable liquids composed, and what are their properties? Volatility is directly related to a substance‘s flash point temperature (flammability). Anton Paar’s flash point testing equipment safely and easily determines the values you require for processing, storing, transporting and classification of dangerous liquids.
