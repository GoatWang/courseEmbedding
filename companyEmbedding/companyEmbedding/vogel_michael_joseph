Career[edit]
Vogel writes about music, literature, film and popular culture. His critically acclaimed 2011 book, Man in the Music: The Creative Life and Work of Michael Jackson, was described by the Associated Press as "a fascinating read and really a must have for any fan of Jackson."[1] Filmmaker Spike Lee characterized it has having "brilliantly cracked the DNA, the code, the artistry of Michael Joseph Jackson."[2] Vogel's work has been featured in The Atlantic,[3] The Huffington Post,[4] and PopMatters.[5] In 2013, he was ranked #15 by Sonifly in a list of “Most Influential Music Journalists in Social Media.”[6]

Biography[edit]
Vogel made national headlines in 2004 when, as Student Vice President of Academics at Utah Valley University, he invited film maker Michael Moore to speak on campus.[7] The invitation incited an uproar amongst the predominantly conservative Utah County community.[8] Vogel subsequently wrote a book about the experience entitled Free Speech 101; the book became a 2007 Independent Publisher Book Award Finalist.[9] An award-winning documentary, This Divided State (in which Vogel appears), also recounts the story of Michael Moore's controversial visit to Utah Valley.[10]
