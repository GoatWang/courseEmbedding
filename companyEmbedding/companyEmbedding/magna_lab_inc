Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

	MAGNA-LAB INC. AND SUBSIDIARY









	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(Unaudited)








	NOTE 1 -

	BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION:







	The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X for smaller reporting companies and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Magna-Lab Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Cardiac MRI, Inc. (collectively, the “Company”) and all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  All adjustments which are of a normal recurring nature and, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the more complete information and the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016.  The operating results for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending February 28, 2017.








	NOTE 2

	- DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S ACTIVITIES AND GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATION:








	Company Activities -

	The Company is focused on engaging in a “reverse merger” transaction with an unrelated business that would benefit from the Company’s public reporting status.  Additional activities have included preserving cash, making settlements with creditors, attempting to raise capital and continuing the Company’s public reporting.







	The Company was previously engaged in research, development and commercialization activities until it ceased such activities during the period September 2002 through March 2003.  The Company’s efforts to raise additional capital or enter into a strategic arrangement in order to complete commercialization of its cardiac diagnostic Illuminator products and development of its Artery View product or to seek other means to realize value through sale, license or otherwise have been unsuccessful.








	Going Concern Consideration

	- As indicated in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, at November 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $-0- of cash and approximately $1,367,000 in negative working capital and stockholders’ deficit and negative cash flows from operations.  For the nine months ended November 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of approximately $109,000 and utilized approximately $36,000 of cash in operating activities.  Further, losses are continuing subsequent to November 30, 2016.  These factors, among others, indicate that the Company is in need of additional financing or a strategic arrangement in order to continue its planned activities for the fiscal year that began on March 1, 2016.  The Company’s plans to deal with this uncertainty are described above in “Company Activities.”  Management’s plans to raise capital, enter into a strategic arrangement or sell or merge with an unrelated business have not been successful to date and there can be no assurance that management’s plans can be realized at all.  While a shareholder provided the Company with additional loans subsequent to November 30, 2016 (Note 4), such amounts are not sufficient to continue operations for the coming twelve months and the Company has no commitment for further financing.  These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue operations as a going concern.  No adjustments have been made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities which could result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.








	NOTE 3 –

	NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE:







	The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of U.S. GAAP with respect to computing its net loss per common share.  Net loss per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of Class A Common and Class B Common shares outstanding.







	Basic loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity.  Since there are no options, warrants or derivative securities outstanding, basic and diluted loss per share were the same for the three and nine month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015.

	Contents







	 




	NOTE 4 –

	NOTES PAYABLE – RELATED PARTY:







	Notes payable include 12% unsecured notes payable to the Company’s principal stockholder, Magna Acquisition LLC (“MALLC”) in the aggregate principal amount of $504,000, plus approximately $392,000 of interest accrued.  Such notes become due 120 days after issuance and, as such, approximately $504,000 principal amount of such notes are overdue at November 30, 2016.  The notes that are overdue bear interest at 15% per year subsequent to their maturity date.







	On June 7, 2016, MALLC loaned an additional $25,000 to the Company on the same terms as above.







	The Company intends to make a proposal to this principal stockholder to convert all amounts outstanding to them (including overdue amounts) into common stock of the Company.







	Subsequent to November 30, 2016, MALLC loaned the Company an additional $7,500.








	NOTE 5 –

	ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUALS:







	Approximately $106,000 of accounts payable relates to intellectual property counsel fees and costs including approximately $68,000 of which that has been paid by and is therefore due to the Company’s Chairman and President for payments he has made on the Company’s behalf to preserve certain intellectual property rights. This officer ceased making such payments several years ago and, as such, the underlying intellectual property became compromised.







	Accrued expenses and other current liabilities includes approximately $18,000 payable to a third party, guaranteed by our principal stockholder, for amounts paid to an account payable in October 2007 on our behalf.  This amount was repayable if the proposed merger transaction with this party was not completed.  This party subsequently merged with a third party and abandoned its possible transaction with the Company, however there has not been a demand for repayment of this amount.   The Company believes it would be entitled to an offset for recovery of certain costs from this third party associated with that proposed transaction pursuant to understandings between the parties.







	Some of the amounts recorded as accounts payable may have passed the statute of limitations for purposes of the vendor seeking recovery of such monies.  The Company has not undertaken a formal study to evaluate recorded payables past the statute of limitations for purposes of possible write-off of such payables.  See also Notes 3 and 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016 for other information on outstanding liabilities and related matters.







	There was no activity in the restructuring accrual for the pre-1997 activities during the three and nine months ended November 30, 2016 or 2015.  The Company periodically adjusts the remaining accrual based on the status of the matters and activity given the passage of time.








	NOTE 6 –

	STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:







	In accordance with GAAP, the Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of those awards.  Stock awards to consultants and other non-employees are accounted for based on an estimate of their fair value at the time of grant.  The fair value of each option or warrant grant under GAAP is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: risk free interest rate of 5%; no dividend yield; expected option lives of five to nine years and expected volatility in excess of 200%.







	In April 2004, the Board of Directors agreed to reserve 90,000 shares of class A common stock for issuance to directors and management in the event that their efforts result in Board approval of a merger or financing transaction.    The criteria for recognition of this share compensation was met on July 24, 2008 and the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $10,000 reflecting the fair value of the 90,000 shares at the date of entry into the agreement at the closing bid price of the Company’s stock.  Because of cash constraints, the Company has not been able to issue such shares.  However, for accounting purposes, the Company has accounted for such shares as though they have been issued.

	Forward Looking Statements



	 



	Some of the statements contained in this report discuss our plans and strategies for our business or state other forward-looking statements, as this term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Statements that are not statements of historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements.  The words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "plan," "intend," "should," "seek," "will," and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying them.  These forward-looking statements reflect the current views of our management.  However, various risks, uncertainties and contingencies could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these statements.   See our Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016 for a discussion of certain known risks; also see Part II, Item 1A.







	Overview, Background and History









	We are currently a “shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company.  We no longer have any full-time employees and our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers serve on a part-time consulting basis.









	Prior to March 2003, our business had been focused on pre-revenue development and commercialization of disposable medical devices designed to enhance the effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging in detection and diagnosis of heart disease.  Due to the unavailability of funding, beginning in the fall of 2002 we essentially ceased all of our operations including product development and commercialization activities.  Our efforts to realize value for our prior business and MRI technology have been unsuccessful.  As a result, we view our most viable option to be merging with an unrelated operating company that would benefit from our status as a reporting company in a so-called “reverse merger” transaction.  Entering into a “reverse merger” would likely involve very substantial dilution to the existing stockholders.  It would, however, provide an opportunity to return some value to stockholders.  While we have identified and explored merging with a number of candidates over the past few years, and entered into definitive agreements with one candidate (which agreement was subsequently terminated) we have no commitments to merge with any company at the present time.









	In order to raise cash to continue our efforts to pursue a reverse merger, on October 31, 2005, the Company consummated a stock purchase agreement with Magna Acquisition LLC (“MALLC”) which resulted in a change of control of our Company.  Under the agreement, we sold 300,000 shares of Class A Common Stock to MALLC for gross proceeds of $190,000, before expenses.  Contemporaneous with the new investment, MALLC purchased from our former principal stockholder 307,727 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, representing all the shares of our common stock owned by that stockholder.  Two of our directors and our Chief Financial Officer serve as sole managers of MALLC, with the ability to vote and dispose of the shares of our Company owned by MALLC by majority vote.  These directors have assumed a lead role with management in pursuing financing and merger candidates and operating matters.









	MALLC has been responsible for substantially all of our funding since October 2005.  During the period from October 2005 to November 30, 2016, MALLC loaned us an aggregate $504,000 under a series of promissory notes payable that mature 120 days from issuance.  At November 30, 2016, approximately $504,000 face amount of such notes were beyond their maturity date and therefore due on demand.  The notes bear interest at 12% per year increasing to 15% per year for periods beyond maturity.  On June 7, 2016, MALLC loaned the Company an additional $25,000 on the same terms as above.  The Company intends to make a proposal to MALLC to convert all of the amounts outstanding to them (including overdue amounts) into common stock of the Company.









	Subsequent to November 30, 2016, MALLC loaned the Company an additional $7,500.







	While we have reduced our expenditures very significantly, we do not have sufficient cash to continue our activities for the coming twelve months.  We currently do not have any commitments for new funding.

	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations








	Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources -

	At November 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $ -0- cash and approximately $1,367,000 in negative working capital and stockholders’ deficit and negative cash flows from operations.  For the nine months ended November 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of approximately $109,000 and utilized approximately $36,000 of cash in operating activities.  Further, losses are continuing subsequent to November 30, 2016.  Although our principal investor loaned us an additional $7,500 subsequent to November 30, 2016, this is not sufficient for our operations for the next twelve months and we have no commitments for future funding.  These factors, among others, indicate that the Company is in need of additional financing or a strategic arrangement in order to continue its planned activities for the fiscal year that began on March 1, 2016.  These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue operations as a going concern.







	Our plan of operations for the coming twelve months is to pursue our “reverse merger” strategy by seeking, evaluating and negotiating with merger candidates and to continue to take actions to preserve our cash and continue our public reporting.  We do not have the cash resources to continue our plan for the coming twelve months, even at our reduced expenditure levels.  As such, we may have to take further measures or cease activities altogether, including terminating our public reporting status.







	We currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures.










	Results of Operations –

	During the three and nine months ended November 30, 2016, our net loss was approximately $43,000 and $109,000, respectively, compared to a net loss of approximately $31,000 and $100,000, respectively, in the three and nine months ended November 30, 2015.  The increase in the loss is due higher consulting and professional costs in 2016 as well as higher interest costs as a result of higher debt levels and higher default interest in the three and nine months ended November 30, 2016.









	Our expenses, particularly professional and consulting fees, can increase significantly if we are actively engaged in negotiations for a merger transaction or other activities.  There can be no assurance that any of our activities will result in any transaction.  Our interest expenses are increasing with additional outstanding borrowings which are increasingly at default interest rates (15%).







	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements -







	The Company has no material off balance sheet arrangements that are likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or capital expenditures.








	Critical Accounting Principles

	–







	We have identified critical accounting principles that affect our condensed consolidated financial statements by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments as well as considering newly adopted principals.  They are:










	Use of Estimates, Going Concern Consideration

	–  Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we are a “going concern.”  We are in need of immediate substantial additional capital or a strategic business arrangement in order to continue our planned activities.  There can be no assurance that our plans to address this need can be realized.   As such, we may be unable to continue operations as a going concern.  No adjustments have been made in the condensed consolidated financial statements that could result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.







	Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk







	Market risk is the sensitivity of income or loss to changes in interest rates, foreign exchanges, commodity prices, equity prices, and other market driven rates or prices.  We are not presently engaged in any substantive commercial business.  Accordingly, the risks associated with foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices are not significant.  Our debt obligations contain interest rates that are fixed and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

	The Company’s senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.



	 



	The Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.



	 



	 (b) 

	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.


	 

	There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter which is the subject of this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.



	 



	There are inherent limitations in any system of internal control. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives are met. Further, the design of a control system must consider that resources are not unlimited and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgment in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.

	PART II - OTHER INFORMATION







	Item 1A. Risk Factors








	Any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk.  

	Some of these many known risks that affect an investment in our Company (there can be others) include:



	 







	 







	·







	we have incurred significant net losses in the past and unless we receive additional financing, we may be forced to cease all operations and liquidate our Company,












	 







	·







	we may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities to raise capital and to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership,












	 







	·







	if we merge with an unrelated business, we would likely divest of any of our remaining cardiac MRI technology, partly in connection with or in anticipation of a merger with an unrelated business or such technology may remain with the Company and not receive any priority in allocation of any funding that may be available,












	 







	·







	if we merge with an unrelated business, it is likely that our current officers and directors may resign upon consummation of a business combination,












	 







	·







	because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, we may not be able to consummate a business combination with suitable growth potential,







	 





	 






	10











	Contents






	 







	 







	·







	we may be unable to obtain additional financing that may be needed to fund the operations and/or growth of the target business,












	 







	·







	we have no full time employees and are substantially dependent on the efforts of part-time management and members of the Board of Directors, working for per-diem or no cash compensation, none of whom are bound by term employment agreements and












	 







	·







	our significant stockholders and executive officers and directors currently are able, by virtue of their position as managers of Magna Acquisition LLC, a 56% stockholder of the Company, to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and their interests may conflict with those of other stockholders.











	For a more complete listing and description of these and other risks that the Company faces please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016.







	Item 3.   Defaults Upon Senior Securities









	As discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview, Background and History, approximately $479,000 principal amount of 12% notes payable to Magna Acquisition LLC (“MALLC) are in default at November 30, 2016 as a result of their non-payment when due.  Such notes now carry a default rate of interest of 15%.   

	 


	On June 7, 2016, MALLC loaned the Company another $25,000 on the same terms as the prior loans.

MAGNA-LAB INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
 
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
 
NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION:
 
The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X for smaller reporting
companies and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“GAAP”). The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Magna-Lab
Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Cardiac MRI, Inc. (collectively, the “Company”) and all significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. All adjustments which are of a normal recurring nature and, in
the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation have been included. These interim unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the more complete information and the Company’s audited consolidated
financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended February
28, 2017. The operating results for the three months ended May 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
be expected for the year ending February 28, 2018. All dollar amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars.
 
NOTE 2 -	DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S ACTIVITIES AND
GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATION:
 
Company Activities -
The Company is focused on engaging in a “reverse merger” transaction with an unrelated business that would benefit
from the Company’s public reporting status. Additional activities have included preserving cash, making settlements with
creditors, attempting to raise capital and continuing the Company’s public reporting.
 
The Company was previously
engaged in research, development and commercialization activities until it ceased such activities during the period September 2002
through March 2003. The Company’s efforts to raise additional capital or enter into a strategic arrangement in order to complete
commercialization of its cardiac diagnostic Illuminator products and development of its Artery View product or to seek other means
to realize value through sale, license or otherwise have been unsuccessful and therefore, in January 2017, the Company sold such
technology to its President and CEO in exchange for relief from certain liabilities.
 
Going Concern Consideration - As indicated in the accompanying
interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, at May 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $1,000 of cash and
approximately $1,415,000 in negative working capital and stockholders’ deficit and negative cash flows from operations. For
the three months ended May 31, 2017, the Company had a net loss of approximately $43,000 and utilized approximately $22,000 of
cash in operating activities. Further, losses are continuing subsequent to May 31, 2017. These factors, among others, indicate
that the Company is in need of additional financing or a strategic arrangement in order to continue its planned activities for
the fiscal year that began on March 1, 2017. The Company’s plans to deal with this uncertainty are described above in “Company
Activities.” Management’s plans to raise capital, enter into a strategic arrangement or sell or merge with an unrelated
business have not been successful to date and there can be no assurance that management’s plans can be realized at all. While
a shareholder provided the Company with an additional loan subsequent to May 31, 2017 (Note 4), such amounts are not sufficient
to continue operations for the coming twelve months and the Company has no commitment for further financing. These factors, among
others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue operations as a going concern. No adjustments have
been made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities
which could result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
NOTE 3 – NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE:
 
The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements
of U.S. GAAP with respect to computing its net loss per common share. Net loss per common share is computed based on the weighted
average number of Class A Common and Class B Common shares outstanding.
 


6 
Contents 

 
Basic loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing
loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted
into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity. Since there are no
options, warrants or derivative securities outstanding, basic and diluted loss per share were the same for the three month periods
ended May 31, 2017 and 2016.
 
NOTE 4 – NOTES PAYABLE – RELATED PARTY:
 
Notes payable include 12% unsecured notes payable to the Company’s
principal stockholder, Magna Acquisition LLC (“MALLC”) in the aggregate principal amount of $546,000, plus approximately
$432,000 of interest accrued. Such notes become due 120 days after issuance and, as such, approximately $517,000 principal amount
of such notes are overdue at May 31, 2017. The notes that are overdue bear interest at 15% per year subsequent to their maturity
date.
 
The Company intends to make a proposal to this principal stockholder
to convert all amounts outstanding to them (including overdue amounts) into common stock of the Company.
 
Subsequent to May 31, 2017, during June 2017, MALLC loaned an
additional $15,000 to the Company on the same terms as above.
 
NOTE 5 – ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUALS:
 
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities includes approximately
$18,000 payable to a third party, guaranteed by our principal stockholder, for amounts paid to an account payable in October 2007
on our behalf. This amount is repayable if the proposed merger transaction with this party was not completed. This party subsequently
merged with a third party and abandoned its possible transaction with the Company, however there has not been a demand for repayment
of this amount. The Company believes it would be entitled to an offset for recovery of certain costs from this third party associated
with that proposed transaction pursuant to understandings between the parties.
 
Some of the amounts recorded as accounts payable may have passed
the statute of limitations for purposes of the vendor seeking recovery of such monies. The Company has not undertaken a formal
study to evaluate recorded payables past the statute of limitations for purposes of possible write-off of such payables. See also
Notes 3 and 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended February 28, 2017 for other information on outstanding liabilities and related matters.
 
There was no activity in the restructuring accrual for the pre-1997
activities during the three months ended May 31, 2017 or 2016. The Company periodically adjusts the remaining accrual based on
the status of the matters and activity given the passage of time.
 
NOTE 6 – STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:
 
In accordance with GAAP, the Company recognizes the cost of
employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments in the financial statements based on the grant date fair
value of those awards. Stock awards to consultants and other non-employees are accounted for based on an estimate of their fair
value at the time of grant. The fair value of each option or warrant grant under GAAP is estimated on the date of the grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: risk free interest rate of 5%; no dividend
yield; expected option lives of five to nine years and expected volatility in excess of 200%.	
 
In April 2004, the Board of Directors agreed to reserve 90,000
shares of class A common stock for issuance to directors and management in the event that their efforts result in Board approval
of a merger or financing transaction. The criteria for recognition of this share compensation was met on July 24, 2008 and the
Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $10,000 reflecting the fair value of the 90,000 shares at the
date of entry into the agreement at the closing bid price of the Company’s stock. Because of cash constraints, the Company
has not been able to issue such shares. However, for accounting purposes, the Company has accounted for such shares as though they
have been issued.

NOTE 7 – EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

consolidated financial statements.

Condition and Results of Operations
 
Forward Looking
Statements
 
Some of the statements
contained in this report discuss our plans and strategies for our business or state other forward-looking statements, as this term
is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements that are not statements of historical facts may
be deemed to be forward-looking statements. The words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect,"
"plan," "intend," "should," "seek," "will," and similar expressions are intended
to identify these forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying them. These forward-looking statements
reflect the current views of our management. However, various risks, uncertainties and contingencies could cause our actual results,
performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these statements. See our Form 10-K for
the year ended February 28, 2017 for a discussion of certain known risks; also see Part II, Item 1A.
 
Overview, Background and History
 
We are currently a
“shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating
company. We no longer have any full-time employees and our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers serve on a part-time consulting
basis.
 
Prior to March 2003, our business had been
focused on pre-revenue development and commercialization of disposable medical devices designed to enhance the effectiveness of
magnetic resonance imaging in detection and diagnosis of heart disease. Due to the unavailability of funding, beginning in the
fall of 2002 we essentially ceased all of our operations including product development and commercialization activities. Our efforts
to realize value for our prior business and MRI technology have been unsuccessful. As a result, we view our most viable option
to be merging with an unrelated operating company that would benefit from our status as a reporting company in a so-called “reverse
merger” transaction. Entering into a “reverse merger” would likely involve very substantial dilution to the existing
stockholders. It would, however, provide an opportunity to return some value to stockholders. While we have identified and explored
merging with a number of candidates over the past few years, and entered into definitive agreements with one candidate (which agreement
was subsequently terminated) we have no commitments to merge with any company at the present time.
 
In January 2017, the Company’s President
and Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”)
with the Company. Under the Purchase Agreement, the CEO purchased all of the intellectual property rights, any and all physical
assets, any and all permits and all non-financial books, records, files, design specification, software and other data related
to the Company’s magnetic resonance imaging technology. In exchange for purchased assets, the CEO (a) assumed all liabilities
of the Company related exclusively to the purchased assets and (b) agreed to forgiveness of all indebtedness owing from the Company
totaling approximately $110,000 including intellectual property counsel fees and costs, $68,000 of which had been paid by and is
therefore due to the CEO for payments he has made on the Company’s behalf in prior years in an attempt to preserve certain
intellectual property rights at that time. The CEO ceased making such payments several years ago and, as such, the underlying intellectual
property became compromised.
 
In order to raise cash to continue our efforts
to pursue a reverse merger, on October 31, 2005, the Company consummated a stock purchase agreement with Magna Acquisition LLC
(“MALLC”) which resulted in a change of control of our Company. Under the agreement, we sold 300,000 shares of Class
A Common Stock to MALLC for gross proceeds of $190,000, before expenses. Contemporaneous with the new investment, MALLC purchased
from our former principal stockholder 307,727 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, representing all the shares of
our common stock owned by that stockholder. Two of our directors and our Chief Financial Officer serve as sole managers of MALLC,
with the ability to vote and dispose of the shares of our Company owned by MALLC by majority vote. These directors have assumed
a lead role with management in pursuing financing and merger candidates and operating matters.
 
MALLC has been responsible for substantially
all of our funding since October 2005. During the period from October 2005 to May 31, 2017, MALLC loaned us an aggregate $546,000
under a series of promissory notes payable that mature 120 days from issuance. At May 31, 2017, approximately $517,000 face amount
of such notes were beyond their maturity date and therefore due on demand. The notes bear interest at 12% per year increasing to
15% per year for periods beyond maturity. In June 2017, MALLC loaned the Company an additional $15,000 on the same terms as above.
The Company intends to make a proposal to MALLC to convert all of the amounts outstanding to them (including overdue amounts) into
common stock of the Company.

Contents 

 
While we have reduced our expenditures very
significantly, we do not have sufficient cash to continue our activities for the coming twelve months. We currently do not have
any commitments for new funding.
 
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital
Resources - At May 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $1,000 cash and approximately $1,415,000 in negative working capital
and stockholders’ deficit and negative cash flows from operations. For the three months ended May 31, 2017, the Company had
a net loss of approximately $43,000 and utilized approximately $22,000 of cash in operating activities. Further, losses are continuing
subsequent to May 31, 2017. Although our principal investor loaned us an additional $15,000 in June 2017, this is not sufficient
for our operations for the next twelve months and we have no commitments for future funding. These factors, among others, indicate
that the Company is in need of additional financing or a strategic arrangement in order to continue its planned activities for
the fiscal year that began on March 1, 2017. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue operations as a going concern.
 
Our plan of operations
for the coming twelve months is to pursue our “reverse merger” strategy by seeking, evaluating and negotiating with
merger candidates and to continue to take actions to preserve our cash and continue our public reporting. We do not have the cash
resources to continue our plan for the coming twelve months, even at our reduced expenditure levels. As such, we may have to take
further measures or cease activities altogether, including terminating our public reporting status.
 
We currently have no material commitments
for capital expenditures.
 
Results of Operations – During
the three months ended May 31, 2017, our net loss was approximately $43,000 compared to a net loss of approximately $34,000 in
the three months ended May 31, 2016. The increase in the loss is due principally to the higher debt levels and higher default interest
in the three months ended May 31, 2017 that resulted in an increase in interest expense as well as certain costs associated with
exploring a merger candidate.
 
Our expenses, particularly
professional and consulting fees, can increase significantly if we are actively engaged in negotiations for a merger transaction.
There can be no assurance that any of our activities will result in any transaction. Our interest expenses are increasing with
additional outstanding borrowings which are increasingly at default interest rates (15%).
 
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements -
 
The Company has no material off balance
sheet arrangements that are likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or capital expenditures.
 
Critical
Accounting Principles –
 
We have identified critical accounting principles
that affect our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements by considering accounting policies that involve the
most complex or subjective decisions or assessments as well as considering newly adopted principals. They are:
 
Going Concern Consideration –
Our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we are a “going concern.”
We are in need of immediate substantial additional capital or a strategic business arrangement in order to continue our planned
activities. There can be no assurance that our plans to address this need can be realized. As such, we may be unable to continue
operations as a going concern. No adjustments have been made in the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
that could result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
Our other accounting policies, which we
do not consider critical accounting policies, are contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements at February 28,
2017 contained in our Form 10-K.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk
 
Market risk is the
sensitivity of income or loss to changes in interest rates, foreign exchanges, commodity prices, equity prices, and other market
driven rates or prices. We are not presently engaged in any substantive commercial business. Accordingly, the risks associated
with foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices are not significant. Our debt obligations contain interest rates
that are fixed and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
 
Item 4T. Controls and Procedures
 
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures.  The Company’s senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
Act”) designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and
principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.
 
The Company has evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of and with the participation of management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based
on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are effective.
 
(b) Changes in Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter which is the subject of this
report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
 
There are inherent limitations in any system
of internal control. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that its objectives are met. Further, the design of a control system must consider that resources are not unlimited and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgment in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons,
by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
Any investment in our common
stock involves a high degree of risk. Some of these many known risks that affect an investment in
our Company (there can be others) include: 
 

·we have incurred significant net losses in the past and unless we receive additional financing, we
may be forced to cease all operations and liquidate our Company,
 

·we may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities to raise capital and to complete a business
combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership,
 

·if we merge with an unrelated business, we would likely divest of any of our remaining cardiac MRI
technology, partly in connection with or in anticipation of a merger with an unrelated business or such technology may remain with
the Company and not receive any priority in allocation of any funding that may be available,
 


11 
Contents 

 

·if we merge with an unrelated business, it is likely that our current officers and directors may resign
upon consummation of a business combination,
 

·because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities,
we may not be able to consummate a business combination with suitable growth potential,
 

·we may be unable to obtain additional financing that may be needed to fund the operations and/or growth
of the target business,
 

·we have no full time employees and are substantially dependent on the efforts of part-time management
and members of the Board of Directors, working for per-diem or no cash compensation, none of whom are bound by term employment
agreements and
 

·our significant stockholders and executive officers and directors currently are able, by virtue of
their position as managers of Magna Acquisition LLC, a 56% stockholder of the Company, to influence matters requiring stockholder
approval and their interests may conflict with those of other stockholders.
 
For a more complete listing
and description of these and other risks that the Company faces please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February
28, 2017.
 
Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities
 
As discussed in Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview, Background and History, approximately $517,000
principal amount of 12% notes payable to Magna Acquisition LLC (“MALLC) are in default at May 31, 2017 as a result of their
non-payment when due. Such notes now carry a default rate of interest of 15%.  In
June 2017, MALLC loaned the Company another $15,000 on the same terms as the prior loans.
