Product Care





Curv® Material
On the InnovAire Collection and 7R Collection
Wipe down the entire outside surface with cleaning spray and a non-abrasive dry cloth. For best results, clean the entire panel, not just the smudged area. These cleaners should not be used on any fabric lining.
*Note: When using any commercial product, follow the manufacturer's directions carefully.
Aviator Leather
On the Aviator Leather Collection
Clean this leather with warm water and a soft cloth. For best results, clean the entire panel evenly, not just the soiled spot. Do not saturate. Allow to dry thoroughly. We do not recommend using saddle soaps, commercial leather cleaners or preservatives. While these products will not harm the leather, they often contain wax or oil, which can darken the leather or cause it to permanently show water spots.
Ballistic Nylon
On The Intensity® Collection
Ballistic nylon is treated to repel water, dirt and stains, which makes cleaning easy. Clean with mild soap and water using a nylon-bristled brush. Do not saturate the fabric. For best results, clean the entire panel, not just the soiled area. Stubborn stains may be treated with Simple Green®, Fantastik®, Woolite® or 409®. Foaming upholstery cleaners made for wool-nylon blend fabrics also works well. After your fabric has been cleaned, spray it with Scotchgard® to restore its water, dirt and stain resistance properties. These cleaners should not be used on leather trim.**Note: When using any commercial cleaning product, follow the manufacturer's directions carefully.
Belting Leather – Vegetable Tanned
On the Tweed Belting Collection, Wings Belting Collection, Hudson Belting Collection, Intensity Belting Collection
Belting Leather is a vegetable tanned leather and is tanned using extracts from tree bark and various other plants. Vegetable tanning creates leather that has resilience, firmness, and strength. Care of the leather is required, as vegetable tanning is a natural process and does not have a protective coating. Because of this natural process, a drop of water may mark the leather. With time and care, the leather will develop a beautifully aged appearance, called patina. To clean the leather, use saddle soap, glycerin-based soap, or a simple unscented glycerin soap bar. Ensure cleansers do not contain drying agents like acetone or alcohol. Allow the leather to dry slowly, away from direct sunlight or heat. Conditioners can be used to moisturize the leather, avoiding products that contain wax. If leather protectant is applied, ensure the product is endorsed for vegetable tanned leather. Buffing with a soft, dry cloth will create a lustrous finish.
Belting Leather
On The Belting Leather Collection, The Wings® Collection, The Tweed™ Collection, The J Hartmann Reserve Collection
A high-quality leather product. Any grain, lines, marks or slight differences in color are natural signs impressed on the surface of the hide, and are not detrimental to its quality. To clean, regularly wipe clean with a soft, slightly moist cloth. Only use special leather care products and test them on a less visible part. Never use excessive quantities, and do not rub hard. Remove any moisture immediately with a soft cloth. Always store leather in a cool, dry, well ventilated location and protect from heat and direct sunlight.
Diamond Monogram Jacquard Fabric
On The Wings® Collection
Diamond monogram jacquard and stripe fabric is treated to repel water, dirt and stains, which makes cleaning easy. Clean with mild soap and cold water using a damp cloth. For best results, clean the entire panel evenly, not just the soiled area. Do not saturate the fabric. Allow to dry thoroughly. Spray with Scotchgard® to restore water and stain resistance properties. 
*Note: When using any commercial product, follow the manufacturer's directions carefully.
English Bridle Leather
On The Luxe™ Collection
Clean with warm water and a soft cloth. For best results, clean the entire panel evenly, not just the soiled spot. Do not saturate. Allow to dry thoroughly.
We do not recommend using saddle soaps, commercial leather cleaners or preservatives. While these products will not harm the leather, they often contain wax or oil, which can darken the leather or cause it to permanently show water spots.  Scuffs or bruises can be minimized by rubbing the area with a soft, dry cloth. This brings the natural oils to the surface.
Full Grain Leather
On The Capital™ Collection
Clean this leather with warm water and a soft cloth. For best results, clean the entire panel evenly, not just the soiled spot. Do not saturate. Allow to dry thoroughly. We do not recommend using saddle soaps, commercial leather cleaners or preservatives. While these products will not harm the leather, they often contain wax or oil, which can darken the leather or cause it to permanently show water spots.
Italian Embossed Leather
On The Luxe™ Collection
Clean all leather with warm water and a soft cloth. For best results, clean the entire panel evenly, not just the soiled spot. Do not saturate. Allow to dry thoroughly. We do not recommend using saddle soaps, commercial leather cleaners or preservatives. While these products will not harm the leather, they often contain wax or oil, which can darken the leather or cause it to permanently show water spots.
Packcloth
On The Packcloth Collection
The nylon is treated to repel water, dirt and stains, which makes cleaning easy. Clean with mild soap and water using a nylon-bristled brush. Do not saturate the fabric. For best results, clean the entire panel, not just the soiled area.
Tweed™ Fabric
On The Tweed™ Collection
Hartmann’s exclusive tweed fabric is treated to repel water, dirt and stains, which makes cleaning easy. Clean with mild soap and water using a nylon-bristled brush. For best results, clean the entire panel evenly, not just the soiled area. Do not saturate the fabric. Stubborn stains may be treated with Simple Green®, Fantastik®, Woolite®, or 409®. Foaming upholstery cleaners made for wool-nylon blend fabrics also work well. After your piece has been cleaned, spray the fabric with Scotchgard® to restore its water and stain resistance properties. These cleaners should not be used on leather trim.
*Note: When using any commercial cleaning product, follow the manufacturer's directions carefully.
Wool Fabric
On The Luxe™ Collection
Hartmann’s exclusive wool fabrics are treated to repel water, dirt and stains, which makes cleaning easy. Spot clean when necessary. Do not saturate the fabric. Allow to dry thoroughly.
Polycarbonate
On the PC4 Collection
Wipe down the entire outside surface with Pledge® Wipes or Pledge® spray and a non-abrasive dry cloth. For best results, clean the entire panel, not just the smudged area. These cleaners should not be used on leather trim®.
*Note: When using any commercial product, follow the manufacturer's directions carefully. Linings
General Care and Cleaning
All cases are lined with fabrics that are treated to repel moisture and resist permanent staining, which makes cleaning easy. Most soil and stains can be removed by using commercially available spot removers such as K- 2R®.
*Note: When using any commercial cleaning product, follow the manufacturer's directions carefully. Hardware
Avoid oiling locks or hinges, since oil may leak in and stain case linings or clothing. If hardware should become scratched, rub lightly with fine steel wool and re-seal with lacquer or clear nail polish.
*Note: When using any commercial product, follow the manufacturer's directions carefully.

Warranty Information





For the Warranty Repair Process, visit our Service and Repair page
For more information please visit the warranty FAQs

Since 1877, Hartmann has created products with impeccable construction and quality standards. Rigorous testing combined with outstanding workmanship, fine materials, and innovative designs exemplify this commitment to excellence. A quality warranty is a part of the durability, reliability, and superior service that is intrinsic to Hartmann.

2 Year Limited Warranty – Small Leather Goods (SLG) and Accessory Products
Coverage under the 2 Year Limited Warranty requires a retailer receipt as proof of purchase. For two years after a Hartmann Small Leather Good (SLG) or Accessory Product is purchased from an authorized Hartmann store or retailer, it is covered by the 2 Year Limited Warranty. The 2 Limited Year Warranty extends to the original purchaser or gift recipient.
The 2 Year Limited Warranty is offered on Locks, Luggage Straps, and Travel Pillows.

Year One of Ownership
If a Hartmann Small Leather Good (SLG) or Accessory Product is damaged during the first twelve (12) months of ownership, including damage caused by transit (by airlines for example), wear and tear, and manufacturer defects, Hartmann will cover repair expenses. The Product owner is responsible for all costs of getting the Product to an authorized Repair Center including, but not limited to, the cost of packaging, shipping and applicable taxes. Damages not covered are damage resulting from abuse, misuse (such as transportation of unusual items), neglect, or cosmetic damage (such as soiled fabrics or leather). Incidental and consequential damages are expressly disclaimed. If it is determined that Hartmann Product is damaged beyond repair, it will be replaced. If the Product is to be replaced and the product is no longer available, Hartmann will substitute a comparable Hartmann product.

Year Two of Ownership
For year two, Hartmann will repair defects in materials or workmanship. This warranty covers only manufacturing defects and does not cover any damage caused by misuse (such as transportation of unusual items), neglect, accidents, abrasion, exposure to extreme temperatures, solvents, acids, water, normal wear and tear, or transit damage (by airlines for example). Incidental and consequential damages are expressly disclaimed. The Product owner is responsible for all costs of getting the Product to an authorized Repair Center including, but not limited to, the cost of packaging, shipping and applicable taxes. The authorized Repair Center will determine whether or not the problem is covered by Hartmann’s warranty. If it is covered by Hartmann’s warranty, any repair and the cost of returning the product to you will be at Hartmann’s expense. In those cases where the warranty does not apply, we will promptly provide you with an estimate of any repair and return shipping costs that may be involved. While non-warranty maintenance or repairs on your Product can be performed by any company, Hartmann requires that you use only an authorized Repair Center for warranty repairs. Improper or incorrectly performed maintenance or repairs void this warranty. Labor charges and damages attributable to work performed by anyone other than an authorized Repair Center are not covered by this warranty. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any implied warranties are hereby excluded. The warranty provided herein is limited to the value of the Product. Manufacturing specifications are subject to change without notice. Product locks are intended only to prevent accidental opening and cannot necessarily prevent theft of the Product or its contents, breakage or entry by airline or airport personnel or governmental authorities. Inspect your Product immediately after handling by anyone other than you. If damaged in transit, submit a claim to the transit company (which is insured against damaging your product) at the place of arrival, and if possible, before clearing customs. This warranty is intended to give you specific legal rights. In addition to the rights described herein, you may also have other rights that vary from state to state or country to country with respect to the exclusion or application of implied warranties, incidental and consequential damages and repair and replacement. Consequently, the limitations or exclusions specifically contained in this warranty may not be applicable to you.

Proof of Purchase

	Hartmann and Braun
                         

 





 
Hartmann and Braun

Hartmann & Braun was founded in Germany in 1879, becoming a leading supplier of instrumentation devices by the turn of the century. In the 1920's, Hartmann & Braun expanded its offering to control equipment, and has since become a leading supplier of both instrumentation and control equipment to the German and pan-European markets.
Much of Hartmann & Braun's growth can be traced to strategic acquisitions, beginning with a series of geographical actions taking the company into key markets throughout Europe, South America, Africa, and Asia. In 1951, the group acquired controlling interest in Schoppe & Faeser, a leading German producer of automation equipment for the power industry. Other significant actions included the 1988 purchase of Applied Automation, a US-based leader in analytical products, and the 1991 acquisition of Sensycon, a leading German supplier of temperature measurement devices.

It makes sense to buy a safe, but when you start to think seriously about it and look at what the market has to offer, you very quickly realise that you are faced with a huge choice. Different models are suitable for different purposes, and you need to think about the security level, resistance grade and physical size of your safe. When purchasing a safe, you can rely completely on the help and advice of our experts – you will find detailed, all-round information on security levels and types of safe in the section Tips for buying a safe. 
 
Private individuals and business customers 
Some of our customers are private individuals, but many businesses also use and appreciate our products, because numerous branches of industry are subject to special requirements laid down by insurance companies. It can, for example, be mandatory to keep certain valuables or documents in a safe. Banks have always followed this rule, of course, but many other businesses are now also obliged to use a safe, which is also required to meet a certain security level.
There are a number of reasons why private individuals should invest in a safe. Firstly, of course, a safe protects valuables such as jewellery, cash or important documents against theft or other unauthorised access. Secondly, a safe with a fire protection rating also provides protection in other situations. For example, even in the event of a fire, the items in the safe are protected against the effects of heat, flames and extinguishing water, so you will have one thing fewer to worry about. 
 
Size is important
When considering the size of your new safe, please remember to plan for future growth. First determine which items you want to store in the safe now, which will give you the minimum size required.
However, since a safe is a long-term investment, it is vitally important to allow room for expansion. 
 If a business now intends to use a safe for the secure storage of important files, for example, it is possible that other documents will be added as time goes by. The same is true of safes in private homes, whose owners may add more items of jewellery or works of art to their collections.  
In addition, not only the size of the items stored in the safe is an important consideration, but also their value. This is obviously an issue that you should discuss with your insurance company to be sure that your cover is sufficient. However, the safe you choose must also be appropriate to the insurance policy; some companies require the insured items to be kept in a safe with a certain minimum security level. Our experts will be glad to give you the benefit of their wide safe-related experience and advise you about this particular aspect.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
