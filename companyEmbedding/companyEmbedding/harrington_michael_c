Michael C Harrington's Experience
Title: Vocations Director
               Company: Archdiocese of Boston
Job Details
               About the Archdiocese of Boston : The Diocese of Boston was founded on April 8, 1808 and was elevated to Archdiocese in 1875. Currently serving the needs of nearly 2 million Catholics, the Archdiocese of Boston is an ethnically diverse and spiritually enriching faith community consisting of 292 parishes, across 144 communities, educating approximately 46,000 students in its Catholic schools and 156,000 in religious education classes each year, ministering to the needs of 200,000 individuals through its pastoral and social service outreach and in support of a health care ministry that meets the needs of some 1 million patients each year. Mass is celebrated in nearly twenty different languages each week.
Title: Deacon
               Company: Most Holy Redeemer Church
Job Details
               Like all Christians, we members of Most Holy Redeemer Parish are called to a life "worthy of the gospel of Christ" (Phil 1, 27.) We achieve this by living our faith as a public act by the grace of Christ and the gift of his spirit received through participation in the Eucharist, prayer, and in relationship with others. We strive to respond to those who need our care, help, and love - especially those who have been otherwise abandoned by their fellow human beings. Whole communities in Africa devastated by AIDS have been forgotten by their brothers and sisters in other lands where, thanks to modern medicine, this terrible disease is now seen as manageable. We parishioners of MHR have, since the 1980s, known the pain, suffering and death that AIDS causes. As a Catholic faith community, we realize that Christ's light shines through the bleakest times and we hope to share that light of hope with our brothers and sisters in Tanzania and other African countries. We thus have made it our mission to partner with the Sisters of St. Therese of Tanzania and our sister parish, St. Teresa of San Francisco, in their AIDS orphans ministry. We hope to establish and nurture a loving, collaborative and prayerful bond with them that, consistent with the values of our parish, is as open and inclusive as the arms of our Most Holy Redeemer. The foundations of our mission are the following four pillars:RelationshipTo participate in the lives of the orphans of St. Therese so that they may find hope in our community and we can find hope in their strength and courage. To live out the reality of the mystical body of Christ by joining others throughout our church and beyond in a spirit of inter-faith cooperation to address and alleviate the suffering of our brothers and sisters in Africa.

The Harrington  Story


 
 
 




 Our Story

 


Today, Elden and Leora Booth
In the mid-1930s, LeRoy E. Harrington (who preferred to be called Harry) was a successful salesman for PABCO Building Products in California. Throughout h
is travels, Harry recognized an opportunity to start a business that would distribute roofing products exclusively, which was a new concept at the time. In early 1938, Harry, and his wife, Ilene, moved to Salt Lake City to start a roofing distributorship.
Harry canvassed the local lumberyards and offered to help them become specialized roofing dealers in trade for purchasing his products. Harry found a space on 2100 South in Salt Lake City which he rented from a local coal company. At this location he opened L.E. Harrington Company and remained there for several years.
In the early ’50s, Harry purchased a home and three acres to build a roofing yard at 1425 South 300 West. The location was good, but he had no access to telephone service, which he needed to effectively run his business.
Leroy E. Harrington, “Harry”
One day Harry went to the grocery store across the street which had phone service. The store was owned by Elden Booth. Elden had purchased the store after serving in the Merchant Marines during WWII, and marrying his sweetheart, Leora Christensen. Harry asked Elden to share his telephone service with him and offered to pay for it. He also needed help unloading products and asked if Elden was interested in helping out. Elden agreed to both, and their working relationship began that day.
As business grew, Harry offered Elden part-time work. While Harry wanted Elden to become more involved with the business, he recognized Elden’s need for more roofing experience. Harry suggested that Elden go to work for a local roofing contractor, which Elden did for two years.
Elden & Leora Booth
L. E. Harrington Company was the distributor of El Rey Roofing products. As business improved, Harry offered Elden full-time work. This enabled Ilene to turn over many of her responsibilities to Elden. One of his new found duties was in bookkeeping which he was hesitant about taking on. “But Harry was always there to teach me whatever I needed to learn,” Elden said
As Harry grew older, his health began to decline. This caused him to think about the company’s future. He decided to form a partnership with Charles “Charlie” Elliott of El Rey Roofing. With this reorganization, the business was renamed Harrington & Company. Harry remained president, Charlie became vice-president, and Elden was made secretary.
In 1965, the business was growing. With the previous addition of new roofing products, Harrington & Company needed space to expand. After negotiating with the railroad for some land of a more appropriate size, the property on 300 West was traded for a business site at 760 West Layton Avenue, where they still do business today.
As Harrington’s business continued to improve, and as time went on, Harry’s health began to rapidly diminish. After Charlie’s retirement, Ilene Harrington visited with Elden and expressed her concern about the future of the company. If something should happen to Harry, they wanted Elden to buy the business. This was due to Elden’s loyalty to Harry throughout the many years they had worked together.
Michael H. Booth, Brian E. Booth, Stephen C. Booth
Elden had a special relationship with Harry and Ilene Harrington. Elden often has stated that they treated him like the son they never had. On January 27, 1971, Elden purchased Harrington & Company, which he led for the next 45 years until he sold it to his sons.
As teenagers, Stephen, Michael, & Brian Booth were each given opportunities to work at Harrington & Company. Over the years, they have learned the various aspects of the business, while working in the roofing yard, as truck drivers and fork-lift operators, ridge-loaders, warehousemen, salesmen, and eventually owners. They credit their father for teaching them the value of dedication and hard work, that customers and employees are family and should be treated as such, that honesty is truly the best policy, and much, much more.
Today, they work hard to grow and improve Harrington & Company.

Susan was recognized for her work on behalf of clients facing state and local property tax issues and redevelopment/eminent domain matters. She is a preeminent practitioner in the field and has dedicated many years of service to pro bono organizations and numerous bar associations at the local and state levels, including having served as the President of the New Jersey State Bar Association.Finance LawBankruptcyTax LawDebt CollectionThe United States Supreme Court unanimously held that an entityâ€™s efforts to recover payment of a debt purchased from a third party for its own account is not subject to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the â€œActâ€ ). Justice Gorsuch, in his first written opinion as an Associate Justice for the United States Supreme Court, employed a traditional, plain language reading of the statutory text in explaining the decision of the Court. Despite the favorable nature of this ruling to banks and other entities which purchase debt in the marketplace, the impact of the Courtâ€™s decision is softened by the issues to which it did not grant certiorari, specifically whether a party qualifies as a debt collector under the Act if it regularly seeks to collect debts that it purchased for its own account.Business and Corporate LawCorporate LawThe Courtâ€™s decision is significant in light of the role that venture capitalists play in the development of startups and emerging growth companies and their evolving relationship with the founders of these companies. In most venture capital financings, the relevant parties will enter into a voting agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions for how the shares of a companyâ€™s capital stock are voted with respect to the composition of the board of directors, and voted or tendered in connection with an acquisition of the company. Generally speaking, an amendment to or waiver of a provision in such a financing agreement requires the consent of the company, the key holders (who are commonly the founders), and the investors. Investors can limit the risk associated with recalcitrant founders stalling or obstructing efforts by the company to raise additional capital if the founderâ€™s right to consent to an amendment is tied to the founderâ€™s continued provision of services, such that if a founder was terminated, he or she would lose his or her right to consent. Meanwhile, founders should remain wary of provisions of this sort, as there is ample precedent of investors forcing founders out of a company. In closing, parties would be wise to closely scrutinize the language included in financing documents, specifically voting agreements, which not only affect their rights, but also serve as the foundation for the partiesâ€™ relationship in guiding the future of the company. The facts of, and decision in, this case provide a stark example of the reality that while investors and founders generally have interests that are largely aligned, each likely seeking to increase, maximize and sustain value, there also remain significant areas of diverging interests. These interests must be considered in connection with a financing transaction and other corporate governance matters.Business DisputesHarnessing cleaner fuel for the future; perfecting new construction techniques; facilitating trade around the globe; discovering the latest technological advancesâ€”our clients are changing the way we live.
