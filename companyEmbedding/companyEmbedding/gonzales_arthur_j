From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Arthur J. Gonzalez


Born
Brooklyn, NY


Occupation
Professor of Law


Arthur J. Gonzalez was a United States Bankruptcy Court Judge for the Southern District of New York. Gonzalez received his undergraduate degree from Fordham University in 1969. Following graduation, he worked as a New York City public school teacher until 1982, earning a master's degree from the Brooklyn College School of Education. After earning a law degree in the Evening Program at Fordham in 1982, Gonzalez became an attorney for the Manhattan District Counsel Office of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). He left the IRS in 1988 and worked as a private lawyer for several firms. During this period, he earned a Master of Laws from New York University (NYU). In 1991, Gonzalez re-entered government to become an Assistant United States Trustee for the Southern District of New York. He was promoted in 1993 to become Trustee for New York, Connecticut, and Vermont. Judge Gonzalez was appointed Bankruptcy Judge in 1995.
Significant cases[edit]
Gonzalez handled the Chrysler LLC bankruptcy case until his retirement.[1] Previously, Gonzalez presided over the bankruptcy proceedings for WorldCom, at that point the largest U.S. bankruptcy case (since overtaken by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008), and Enron. The criminal proceedings against the corporate executives of WorldCom and Enron did not originate from the bankruptcy proceedings before Gonzalez via mandatory referral of possible crimes under Title 18 U.S.C. § 3057; in contrast the post petition corporate entities both sought releases and compensation for the benefit of their current and former senior officers.

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Gonzales, Arthur J Iii carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Gonzales, Arthur J Iii currently holds license 54097 (Hvac A/C Technician (Registered)), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Gonzales, Arthur J Iii



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Gonzales, Arthur J Iii



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Gonzales, Arthur J Iii



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

for any job, commercial or residential.

Medical Negligence

There are many types of medical malpractice cases, and each case is unique. If you think you have a case, but need more clarification, please contact us for a free case evaluation. Please be aware, however, the primary question in any medical malpractice case is “what are the damages?” Many people receive bad advice from doctors, they receive the wrong medication from pharmacies and even the best doctors can make mistakes. Despite receiving bad advice, and/or treatment, the patient is not severely injured or no permanent damage has occurred. But when serious injury or death occur, we are ready to step in and help. Medical malpractice cases are very expensive and time consuming. As a result, our firm focuses on medical malpractice cases involving serious, permanent injury and/or death.
Some of the more common types of medical malpractice cases are the following:
FAILURE TO DIAGNOSE A DISEASE OR CONDITION
This occurs after a medical professional incorrectly diagnoses a medical condition or disease. In some cases, this can have dire results as a patient’s health worsens beyond the reach of a cure.
FAILURE TO PROPERLY MONITOR PATIENTS WHILE TREATING A DISEASE OR ILLNESS
This includes the failure to properly monitor a patient’s care, treatment, response to treatment, and condition; failure to report changes in a patients situation; the use of incorrect equipment (or the incorrect use of proper equipment) when monitoring a patient’s status; failure to document monitoring processes and results. The medical professional has an obligation to correctly follow the progression of your care and keep you involved and informed in the process.
SURGICAL / ANESTHESIA ERRORS
Errors can occur in every type of surgical situation and procedure, from exploratory surgery to heart operations. Common high-risk surgeries include:

Gastric Bypass Surgery
Lasik Surgery
Spine Surgery
Cardiac Surgery



MEDICATION ERRORS
Pharmacy and prescription errors are the cause of tragic personal injury and wrongful death. There are many types of mistakes that can be made while treating patients – including errors in prescribing and/or filling patient medication. This can constitute medical malpractice. Growing in number, pharmacy errors and prescription mistakes account for as many as 98,000 deaths each year (according to an October 2003 study by the Journal of the American Medical Association).
PATIENTS RIGHTS
According to the AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION, patients are entitled to certain rights when being treated by medical professionals. Those rights are:

The right to considerate and respectful care.
The right to get complete, up to date information about diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis from your physician in terms that you can reasonably be expected to understand.
The right to get enough information about any proposed treatment or procedure to make informed consent – meaning that you should know enough about the expected benefits, possible hazards, and time needed for recovery to decide if you want the treatment or procedure.
The right to refuse treatment and to be advised of the possible medical consequences of doing so.
The right to every consideration of privacy concerning your own medical care program. Case discussion, consultation, examination, and treatment are confidential and should be conducted discreetly.
The right to expect all communications and records concerning your care be treated as confidential.
The right to a reasonable response to your request for services.
The right to know if the hospital plans to engage in any human experimentation that might affect your care or treatment. You have the right to refuse to participate in such research projects.
The right to expect reasonable continuity of care. You have the right to know in advance what appointment times and physicians are available, as well as the location for follow-up visits.
The right to be informed about continuing health care requirements after discharge.
The right to examine and receive an explanation of your bill regardless of whether it is paid by you or by another source.
The right to know what hospital rules and regulations apply to your conduct as a patient.

If you feel that your rights as a patient have been violated, or that you may be a victim of medical negligence, please contact Arthur J. Gonzalez P.C. for an free and objective evaluation of your case.

Personal Injuries

In this life, we are all required to conduct ourselves within the standard of care of a reasonable person; driving vehicles, boats, and maintaining our homes and offices. However, the failure to act as a reasonably prudent person is one of the most “normal” things we encounter in daily life. People are human beings and therefore make mistakes. But, if the mistakes, errors or negligence of one causes personal injury or damage to another, those who conducted themselves in a negligent manner may be found legally liable and financially responsible for the personal injuries and damages proximately caused by their negligence.
Arthur J. Gonzalez P.C. is an experienced and qualified association of legal professionals who will fight for the rights of those who have suffered injuries because of the negligence of others. Our team has successfully represented thousands of people who have sustained various types of personal injuries throughout Texas, and across the United States. In addition to our attorneys, and dedicated staff, the firm has many valuable resources available to properly represent personal injury accident victims.
The likelihood is that you or one of your loved ones will be involved in an accident at some point in your lifetime. A pedestrian may slip and fall on a damages sidewalk, or may be hit or run over by a vehicle. A motorist driving a car or truck may get into a collision with another motorist driving an automobile. A truck or 18-wheeler may be involved in a serious accident with another vehicle. The personal injuries and damages sustained in many types of accidents can be extremely severe.
In the event of an accident where another party is at fault, please follow these simple guidelines:

Call the police;
Call an ambulance for any injury causing accident;
Get immediate medical attention for any injuries sustained and always paramedics to transport injured parties to the hospital for care and treatment;
Do not admit anything to any party without contacting Arthur J. Gonzalez P.C. law office;
Exchange identifying information and insurance information with all parties;
Never discuss the case with the liable party’s insurance adjusters, attorneys or representatives about the facts of the case unless and until we advise such discussions;
Take pictures of the scene of the accident, the object causing the injury, and the injuries sustained
Do not sign any medical release forms unless they are provided to you by Arthur J. Gonzalez P.C.
Do not discuss the case with anyone; and
Contact Arthur J. Gonzalez at 832-487-0880.

Negligence and accidents are bound to happen, and severe personal injuries will be sustained. When accidents happen, contact Arthur J. Gonzalez. I will fight hard to provide you with the best solution to your problem.

When buying a policy, the person agrees to pay a premium, which is small, regular payment based on the losses that may occur. If the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy, the premium is usually higher. Premiums are often paid monthly, and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured item.Many types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item. The amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible. In the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers, the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what. If the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount, the insurance company does not pay anything. If the cost is greater than the deductible, the policyholder only pays the deductible, while the insurance pays the rest. Generally, the deductible amount is related to your premium, with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium, and vice-versa.Insurance Agents
Selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage. This is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation. Agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most. Based on their needs and individual risk, agents can often give potential customers a quote, which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy. This is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost, because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time. Insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly. Credit scores play a major role in insurance scores, but past insurance-claim history is also taken into account.While agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance, some sell several different types of insurance. Agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently, selling policies from several different insurers.Insurance ProductsAlmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances. Insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed. Some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all use.Automotive Insurance
Millions of Americans drive a car to get from place to place each day, so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types. In most states, the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car, up to a certain amount. Most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance, which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault. Liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident. It's important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others, not the policyholder themselves. In addition to liability insurance, car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident. For this purpose, liability, vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policy.Insurance can also be purchased for other vehicles, like motorcycles, ATVs, boats or RVs, and generally functions similarly to car insurance. Policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous, or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle. Many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles, ATVs, boats and RVs.Homeowners Insurance
Your home, condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for, so it makes sense to get it insured. Homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself, but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well. Many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policy.Like auto insurance, homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items. The primary coverage type is for the dwelling, insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it. Policies may also cover property within the home, with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets. Personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for, much like auto insurance.Property insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control. These are known as perils, and may include fire, flooding, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. You may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a high-risk area. Flood insurance is an exception, however, and can be purchased through the government-sponsored National Flood Insurance Program. Your lender may require this if you live in a flood-prone area.Health Insurance
To help pay for medical expenses, many people rely on their health insurance. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, almost every American is required to enroll in a health care plan, or they face a penalty. Health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance, although it is probably used to cover expenses more often, since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine. Health insurance also operates on a premium-deductible model, and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle. For example, if you visit doctors very infrequently, you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible. On the other hand, people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible. Dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by law.Life Insurance
When someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work, it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones. Many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost. Life insurance comes in two basic types: term and universal. With a term life insurance plan, you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time, usually 10 years or more. If you die at any point in that timeframe, your family receives a death benefit. If you're still around when the term is over, the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing. Universal life covers your entire life, and usually delivers a minimum benefit at death.Travel insurance
Travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel, whether it's losing luggage or medical treatment abroad. Travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations. Travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage. Specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks, like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation. Blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trip.Pet insurance
Pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog, cat or other domestic animal. Medical care for animals can be very costly, particularly because insurance for them is rare. By paying into a premium, you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication. While virtually unheard of a few years ago, pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to rise.Umbrella insurance
Umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies, usually home or auto insurance. Consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover. For example, most car insurance liability policies cover at least $25,000 per person or $50,000 per accident. But if the accident involves a very valuable car, or the victim is willing to pursue legal action, insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost. You may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policy.Insurance Claims BasicsTo receive a payout for an insurance policy, the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company. The basics of the process are straightforward, but can vary depending on the type of insurance.Claims Adjusters and Examiners
A claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company, and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided. An adjuster inspects claims related to property damage, as in the case of auto or home insurance policies. Claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance, and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedures.How To Make a Claim
Filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing, but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses. It's important to note that in the case of emergencies, you should always call 911 first. The safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insurance.Auto Insurance Claim: If you're involved in an accident, you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation. You can file a claim upon obtaining the police report. It's also a good idea, if possible, to take your own notes at the scene. The most important things to record are what happened before the accident, the date and time, traffic signs in the area and road conditions. Also be sure to get the other driver's name, address, license plate number and insurance information. Even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process. Once you have this documentation, call your insurance company right away.
Homeowners Insurance Claim: In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved. Take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible. If any of your possessions were damaged, use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim. Once an adjuster has made their own report, review it for accuracy.
Life Insurance Claim: Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.Finding Discounts on InsuranceInsurance is a wise investment, but it can make a dent in your monthly budget. Thankfully, there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you need.Shop and Compare
Perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.Buy Only What You Need
Insurance agents will often try to "upsell" on various extra products that may be useful for certain people, but are generally excessive for the average consumer. Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs. For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash. It can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policy.Take Advantage of Discounts
Insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances. In one of the most basic discounts, many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home, auto and life insurance policies from the same provider. Car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course. For those with teenagers on their plan, good grades can earn a small discount as well. Insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums. Some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel, federal employees, teachers, first responders and their families.
