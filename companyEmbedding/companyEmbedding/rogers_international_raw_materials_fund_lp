Rogers International Commodity Index®











The Rogers International Commodity Index® (“RICI®”) is a composite, U.S. dollar-based, total return index designed by James B. Rogers, Jr. (“Rogers”) in the late 1990s. RICI® was designed to meet the need for consistent investing in a broad based international vehicle; it represents the value of a basket of commodities consumed in the global economy, ranging from agricultural to energy and metal products. The value of this basket is tracked via futures contracts on 37 different exchange-traded physical commodities, quoted in four different currencies, listed on nine exchanges in four countries. 
 
The RICI® aims to be an effective measure of the price action of raw materials not just in the United States but also around the world. Indeed, the index's weights attempt to balance consumption patterns worldwide (in developed and developing countries) and specific contract liquidity.

in any Accounting Period or other fiscal period, including all of
the Partnership’s open positions in securities, commodities,
including futures, forward and option contracts and any and all
interests therein (“Positions”), minus the amount of
any Management Fee, as provided in Section 11.1, determined on
an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles; provided, however, that all of the Partnership’s
Positions shall be valued at their fair market value as of the end
of each Accounting Period. On all Positions which were open at the
beginning of an Accounting Period and subsequently closed during
the Accounting Period, gain or loss shall be determined on the
basis of the fair market values used at the close of the
immediately preceding Accounting Period. All questions relating to
valuation arising in determining Net Profits or Net Losses shall be
resolved by the Partnership’s regularly employed certified
public accountants, whose good faith decision shall, absent
manifest error or fraud, be final. For the avoidance of doubt, the
terms “Net Profit” and “Net Losses,” shall
exclude Partnership income or loss related to or arising out of the
bankruptcy of Refco Inc. and its affiliates, and any such income or
loss (in each case, regardless of source) shall be allocated only
among Partners (including former Partners) who were Partners as of
October 31, 2005, in accordance with their Partnership
Interests on such date.

Partners where no distinction is required by the context in which
the term is used herein.

“Partnership” means Rogers International Raw Materials
Fund, L.P., a limited partnership formed pursuant to the provisions

(v)
“Partnership Interest” means, with respect to a Limited

benefits to which a Limited Partner may be entitled to under this

obligations of this Agreement. Each Limited Partner’s
Partnership Interest shall, for all purposes, be the ratio that the
Net Asset Value of Units owned by that Limited Partner bears to the
aggregate Net Asset Value of all Units held by all Limited Partners
(including the General Partner, to the extent of any Units owned by
the General Partner). Reference to Limited Partners holding a

mean any Limited Partner or group of Limited Partners who own over
50% or at least such specified percentage, as the case may be, of
the aggregate Net Asset Value of all Units held by all Limited
Partners (including the General Partner, to the extent of any Units

otherwise herein.

PURPOSE

The
purpose of the Partnership is to trade and invest in a portfolio of
commodity futures, swaps and cash forward contracts traded on both
recognized exchanges and in the off-exchange or
“over-the-counter” markets throughout the world, as the
General Partner shall, in its sole discretion, determine. The
purpose of such trading and investing shall be to replicate, to the
extent deemed reasonably possible by the General Partner, the
component commodity positions which comprise the Index. The
Partnership may also invest its funds in Government Securities and
Government Security based financial products; provided that not
more than 20% of the interest may be allocated to the
Partnership’s commodities brokers and, otherwise, the
Partnership will receive all interest income earned on its
assets.

The
Partnership may engage in any and all activities related or
incidental to the activities described above. However, the
Partnership shall not operate in a manner which would cause it to
become an investment company required to register under the 1940
Act.

Section 8.1.
General Partner

(a) The
General Partner shall maintain a Capital Account in the Partnership
in an amount in its sole discretion, provided, however, that said
Capital Account shall be not less than the greater of $25,000 or 1%
of the Partnership’s Net Assets. In addition, for so long as
the General Partner is the general partner of the Partnership, the
General Partner shall maintain a minimum net worth of not less than
the greater of $50,000 or 5% of the total contributions to the
Partnership and to all other commodity pool programs for which the
General Partner serves as general partner; provided, however, that
in no event shall the General Partner be required to maintain a net
worth in excess of $1,000,000.

(b) A
Capital Account shall be established and maintained for the General
Partner, which shall be credited and debited as provided in
paragraph (g) of Article III.

(c) The
General Partner shall be deemed to be a Limited Partner to the
extent of the General Partner’s Capital Contribution, for all
purposes under this Agreement. All Capital Contributions of the
General Partner shall be evidenced by Units (as defined in
Section 8.2(a)).

Section 8.2.
Limited Partners

(a) Each
Limited Partner shall make an initial Capital Contribution to the
Partnership in the amount called for by his Subscription Agreement.
Each Limited Partner’s Capital Contribution is due upon
subscription. The Capital Contributions to be made to the
Partnership by the Limited Partners shall be divided into and
evidenced by units of Partnership Interests, calculated to four
decimal places (the “Units”), which may be issued in
one or more series (each, a “Series”) with a purchase
price per Unit specified in Section 8.3(a). Each Limited
Partner must agree to make an initial Capital Contribution of at
least $5,000.

(b) A
Capital Account shall be established for each Limited Partner,
which shall be credited and debited as provided in paragraph
(g) of Article III.

Section 8.3.
Sale of Units of Limited Partnership Interest

(a) The
General Partner shall solicit subscriptions for the purchase of
Units in an offering (the “Offering”), the terms of
which shall be as set forth in a prospectus (the
“Prospectus”) included in a registration statement
(each such registration statement a “Registration
Statement”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”). The purchase price per Unit shall be the
Net Asset Value per Unit (as that term is defined in
Section 8.3(c)) of the relevant Series as of the close of
business on the day preceding the effective date of the purchase;
provided, however, that the initial purchase price per Unit of any
Series of Units of which there are no outstanding Units shall be as
described in the Prospectus pursuant to which such Series of Units
is offered.

 

A-4


 


 


The
General Partner and affiliates of the General Partner may subscribe
for Units on the same terms and conditions as any other subscriber.
During the Offering, the General Partner may admit as a Limited
Partner, within its sole and unrestricted discretion, those persons
and entities who deliver to the Partnership an executed
Subscription Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof,
including payment of the subscription called for therein. Each
subscriber whose Subscription Agreement is accepted by the
Partnership as a Limited Partner, shall make its Capital
Contribution to the Partnership by delivering the full amount of
the subscription for Units by check or wire transfer.

The
General Partner may, in its sole discretion, employ registered
broker-dealers (“Soliciting Dealers”) to assist in the
offer and sale of the Units. All Soliciting Dealers employed by the
General Partner shall be required to execute a soliciting dealer
agreement in a form approved by the General Partner. The General
Partner shall be authorized to pay Soliciting Dealers the
compensation described in such soliciting dealer
agreement.

The number
of Units purchased by each subscribing Limited Partner, the amount
of the Capital Contribution each Limited Partner has made and the
Partnership Interest of each Limited Partner shall be recorded on a
schedule maintained by or on behalf of the General Partner. No
certificate or other evidence of ownership shall be issued in
respect of the Units or Partnership Interests other than this
Agreement, or a counterpart thereof which, when executed and
delivered by the General Partner, shall solely represent and
evidence the Units and Partnership Interests purchased by each
Limited Partner. However, the Partnership may retain a Subscription
Agent whose duties may include providing notification to Limited
Partners with respect to their ownership of Units, and the General
Partner shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to each Limited
Partner such reporting as required under the rules of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”).

(b) After
the termination of each Offering, the General Partner may, in its
discretion, make additional Offerings of Units on the following
terms and conditions:

(1) Each
subsequent Unit sold (“New Units”) shall require the
Capital Contribution specified by Section 8.3(a);

(2) New
Units sold during any month shall be accepted or rejected as of the
close of business on the last trading day of such month;

(3) Each
Limited Partner admitted in a subsequent Offering shall execute and
acknowledge such instruments as the General Partner may deem
necessary or desirable to effectuate such admission and to confirm
that the Additional Limited Partner has agreed to be bound by all
the covenants, terms and conditions of this Agreement;

(4) The
General Partner may register Units and/or make additional Offerings
of Units (including, for the avoidance of doubt, private
offerings), in its sole discretion. The General Partner does not,
however, have any obligation or duty to register any Units with any
authority. No Limited Partner shall have any preemptive or other
rights with respect to the issuance or sale of any additional
Units. The General Partner may, in its sole discretion, terminate
any offering of Units.

(c)
“Net Assets” of the Partnership for purposes of this
Agreement shall mean the Partnership’s total assets minus the
Partnership’s total liabilities, determined in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, with all open
positions marked to market. The term “Net Asset Value Per
Unit” for purposes of this Agreement means the Net Assets of
the Partnership attributable to each Series at the time of
calculation divided by the aggregate number of Units in each such
Series outstanding at that time.

Section 8.4.
Status of Capital Account of Limited Partner

Except as
otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, no Limited
Partner shall have the right to withdraw all or any part of the
credit balance in his Capital Account, to receive any Distribution
from the Partnership or to demand or receive property other than
cash in withdrawal of the credit balance of his Capital Account or
as Distributions of income. No Limited Partner shall have priority
over another Limited Partner in connection with the return of his
Capital Contributions or Distribution of the credit balance in his
Capital Account, or as to any other Distributions by the
Partnership; provided, however, that Limited Partners admitted
after October 31, 2005 shall not be entitled to participate in
any distributions to the Partnership made in connection with the
bankruptcy of Refco Inc. and its affiliates, regardless of source
of such distributions, or any Distributions (to Partners or former
Partners) of the proceeds of such distributions. Capital
contributed to the Partnership and the credit balance in a
Partner’s Capital Account shall not bear interest.

Section 8.5.
Withdrawal of Interests

(a) Upon
the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 8.5, a
Limited Partner may reduce or redeem all of its Partnership
Interest in the Partnership, and have part or all of the credit
balance in its Capital Account returned to it, by withdrawing funds
from its Capital Account.

(b) A
Limited Partner who desires to have all or a portion of the credit
balance in its Capital Account returned to it shall give the
General Partner written notice (a “Notice of
Withdrawal”) not less than six (6) business days prior
to the date as of which the Limited Partner desires to effect such
partial or complete withdrawal. The General Partner may, but shall
not be required to, employ a Subscription Agent as its agent to
receive and process any such Notice of Withdrawal. The Notice of
Withdrawal shall state the date upon which the withdrawal is
desired, which date must be the last trading day of any month (the
“Withdrawal Date”). In the case of a partial
withdrawal, such notice shall also specify either the percentage of
the credit balance in his Capital Account that he wishes to
withdraw at the Withdrawal Date, or the dollar amount of capital
which he wishes to have returned to him, subject to the requirement
that any such withdrawals may only be in increments of the Net
Asset Value of a Unit in the applicable Series and to the
additional terms and conditions set forth in this Section 8.5.
Any withdrawal request approved by the General Partner or its agent
shall be effective as of the close of business on the Withdrawal
Date specified in the Notice of Withdrawal. For purposes of this
Section 8.5, a “business day” is any day, Monday
through Friday, except U.S. federal holidays.

(c) In the
event a Limited Partner has delivered an appropriate Notice of
Withdrawal to the Partnership, the General Partner shall distribute
to the withdrawing Limited Partner, per Unit withdrawn, an amount
equal to the Net Asset Value Per Unit as of the effective time of
the withdrawal on the Withdrawal Date. Any such Limited
Partner’s Capital Account shall be reduced by the amount so
paid and its Partnership Interest shall be adjusted accordingly as
of the Withdrawal Date. Payment for the withdrawn Units shall be
made within 30 days after the Withdrawal Date. From the time of the
General Partner’s receipt of a Notice of Withdrawal to the
effective time of the withdrawal on the Withdrawal Date, the Units
will remain at risk in the business of the Partnership and the
withdrawing Limited Partner shall have all the rights of a Limited
Partner under this Agreement.

(d) No
Limited Partner may withdraw less than all of the credit balance of
its Capital Account in accordance with the above provisions if, as
of the Withdrawal Date, such withdrawal would reduce the credit
balance of its Capital Account to less than $5,000 (after
subtracting the amount such Limited Partner wishes to
withdraw).

(e)
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.5(d), if the
General Partner determines it is in the best interests of the
Partnership, it may permit a Limited Partner to withdraw part or
all of the credit balance in his Capital Account at any
time.

(f) A
Limited Partner shall have no personal liability for the debts,
liabilities and other obligations of the Partnership from and after
the effective time of the withdrawal on the Withdrawal Date as
provided in this Section 8.5, except to the extent provided
under Illinois law for Partnership debts and liabilities incurred
prior to such effective time on such date, and then only for
amounts withdrawn by or distributed to such Limited
Partner.

(g)
Subject to subsection (a) and (b) of this
Section 8.5 and to the following, the General Partner, acting
alone or, at its election, in conjunction with the Subscription
Agent, shall honor all Notices of Withdrawal in the order they are
received (on the basis of postmark or delivery, with the General
Partner selecting Units for withdrawal by lot with respect to
Notices of Withdrawal received on the same date). If, however, the
number of withdrawals requested for any month or over any other
given period of time, in the opinion of the General Partner,
(i) threatens the termination of the Partnership or the
Partnership’s tax year; or (ii) is otherwise detrimental
to the tax status of the Partnership, the General Partner may (but
is not required to) select by lot only so many withdrawals as will,
in its judgment, not result in such consequences. The General
Partner shall notify the Limited Partners in writing within 10 days
after the effective date of the withdrawal if their Units have not
been withdrawn. Any Units not withdrawn in this event shall remain
at risk in the business of the Partnership and shall not be
withdrawn absent another separate Notice of Withdrawal given in the
manner provided in this Section 8.5. In addition, if during
the ten day period preceding the effective date of withdrawal,
futures and forward contracts representing 10% or more of the
Partnership’s portfolio of futures positions cannot be traded
as a result of trading limits in applicable exchanges, then the
Partnership may (but is not required to) suspend all withdrawals
for a period of up to 10 days after the trading limit is no longer
applicable. In the event of a suspension of withdrawals, all Units
will remain at risk in the business of the Partnership and shall
not be withdrawn absent a Notice of Withdrawal given following the
lifting of the suspension by the General Partner and in the manner
otherwise provided in this Section 8.5.

 

A-6


 


 


(h) The
General Partner (in its capacity as General Partner or as a Limited
Partner) may withdraw any part or all of the credit balance in its
Capital Account, subject to Section 8.1(a), at the same times
and upon the same terms (including notice to the Partnership) as
the Limited Partners.

(i) If at
the close of business (as determined by the General Partner) on any
business day, the Net Asset Value per Unit has decreased to less
than 50% of the Net Asset Value per Unit on the most recent
month-end valuation date, after adding back all distributions, the
Partnership will liquidate all open positions as expeditiously as
possible and suspend trading. Within 7 business days after any such
suspension of trading, the General Partner shall declare a
“special redemption date.” Such special redemption date
shall be a business day within 30 business days from the date of
suspension of trading by the Partnership, and the General Partner
shall mail notice of such date to each Limited Partner and assignee
of Units of whom it has received written notice, by first class
mail, postage prepaid, not later than 7 business days of the date
of the decline of the Net Asset Value per Unit, together with
instructions as to the procedure such Limited Partner or assignee
must follow to have such Limited Partner’s or
assignee’s interest (only entire, not partial, interests may
be so redeemed unless otherwise determined by the General Partner)
in the Partnership redeemed on such date. Upon redemption pursuant
to a special redemption date, a Limited Partner or any other
assignee of whom the General Partner has received written notice,
shall receive from the Partnership an amount equal to the Net Asset
Value of such Limited Partner’s interest, determined as of
the close of business (as determined by the General Partner) on
such special redemption date. An assignee shall not be entitled to
redemption on any special redemption date until the General Partner
has received written notice of the assignment, transfer or
disposition under which the assignee claims an interest in the
Units to be redeemed. If, after such special redemption date, the
Net Assets of the Partnership are at least $5,000,000, the
Partnership may, in the discretion of the General Partner, resume
trading. If the preceding conditions are not met or the General
Partner determines not to resume trading, the Partnership will be
dissolved and terminated.

Section 8.6.
Additional Capital Contributions

Any
Limited Partner may make additional Contributions of Capital, but
only in the manner set forth in Section 8.3.

Section 8.7.
Removal of Limited Partners; Reduction of
Interests

(a) If any
application by or business activity of the Partnership or any
person or entity affiliated with the Partnership for membership or
participation in any commodities, options or securities exchange,
clearing agency, or other self-regulatory organization is denied,
limited, conditioned or otherwise adversely affected by reason of
any Limited Partner’s interest in the Partnership, and such
Limited Partner does not, within thirty (30) days following
receipt of written notice thereof, cure any defect or other cause
of such adverse action, to the sole and absolute satisfaction of
the General Partner, such Limited Partner shall be deemed to have
elected to have withdrawn his Capital Account in the manner
provided for in Section 8.5; provided, however, that such
withdrawal shall be effective as of the close of the month in which
said thirty (30) day period ends; and further provided that
the time limitations and further notice provisions contained in
Section 8.5(b) shall not apply. For purposes of determining
the balance in the Limited Partner’s Capital Account as of
the close of such month, the General Partner shall close the
Partnership’s books and allocate Net Profits and Net Losses
as of such date. Upon such withdrawal, such Limited Partner shall
have only such rights and be obligated to only such liabilities as
may otherwise be provided in this Agreement.

(b) If, at
the close of any month during the term of the Partnership, the
aggregate value of any class of equity interests of the Partnership
held by all ERISA Limited Partners would represent 25% or more of
the aggregate value of such class of equity interests held by all
Limited Partners (regardless of the reason for such overage), the
General Partner may, but shall not be required to, redeem Units
held by ERISA Limited Partners in an amount such that the aggregate
value of such class of equity interest held by all ERISA Limited
Partners does not equal 25% of the aggregate value of such class of
equity interest held by all Limited Partners. The amount of any
such redemption shall be paid, within 5 business days of such
reduction, to the appropriate Limited Partners as though the amount
had been withdrawn pursuant to Section 8.5. Units held by each
ERISA Limited Partner, if Units are redeemed hereunder, shall be
redeemed and shall be redeemed by the same percentage. Operation of
this Section 8.7(b) and the redemptions contemplated hereby
are expressly consented to by each ERISA Limited
Partner.

ALLOCATIONS
AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Section 9.1.
Allocation of Net Profits and Net Losses

Allocations
among Partners . Net
Profits and Net Losses of the Partnership shall be allocated among
the Partners during each Accounting Period in the proportion which
the Partnership Interest held by each such Partner on the first day
of the relevant Accounting Period bears to the total Partnership
Interest held by all Partners on such date. For the avoidance of
doubt, the terms “Net Profit” and “Net
Losses,” shall exclude Partnership income or loss related to
or arising out of the bankruptcy of Refco Inc. and its affiliates,
and any such income or loss (in each case, regardless of source)
shall be allocated only among Partners (including former Partners)
who were Partners as of October 31, 2005, in accordance with
their Partnership Interests on such date.

Section 9.2.
Distributions

(a)
Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.2(b), the
Partnership may distribute such portion of the Net Profits during
each Accounting Period as the General Partner, in its sole and
absolute discretion, shall determine from time to time. However,
the General Partner’s and Partnership’s general policy
shall be to not make any Distributions. Except to the extent
provided in Section 11.2, the amount of all Distributions to
Limited Partners shall be computed and paid to each of the Limited
Partners in the proportion which the Partnership Interest held by
each such Limited Partner on the first day of the relevant
Accounting Period bears to the total Partnership Interest held by
all Limited Partners on such date, except with respect to
Distributions related to proceeds to the Partnership arising out of
the bankruptcy of Refco Inc. and its affiliates, which proceeds
shall be allocated or Distributed solely to Partners (and former
Partners) who were Partners on October 31, 2005; and such
allocations or Distributions shall be made among such Partners (and
former Partners) pro rata in the same manner as described above
using Partnership Interests as of October 31, 2005 as the
basis of calculation.

(b) Before
making any Distribution, the Partnership must have available to it
unencumbered funds sufficient for such Distribution after taking
into account the amounts necessary to provide a reasonable reserve
for the continuing conduct of the business of the Partnership and
to provide the Partnership with normal working capital. The amount
of such reserve shall be determined by the General Partner in its
sole and absolute discretion and shall include such funds as the
General Partner deems reasonably necessary or appropriate in order
to meet the foreseeable requirements of the Partnership for the
Accounting Period in which the Distribution is to be
made.

Section 9.3.
Federal Income Tax Allocations

(a) The
Partnership’s income and expense and capital gain or loss
from its investment and trading operations shall be allocated among
the Partners pursuant to the following subparagraphs for federal
income tax purposes; provided, however, that Partnership income or
expense related to or arising out of the bankruptcy of Refco Inc.
and its affiliates, regardless of source, shall be allocated only
to those persons who were Partners on October 31, 2005, in
accordance with their Partnership Interests on such date. For the
avoidance of doubt, Partnership recoveries related to the
bankruptcy of Refco Inc. and its affiliates attributable to former
Partners shall be payable to such former Partners subject to
adjustment for any related expense (including, but not limited to,
litigation and indemnification expenses). Allocations shall be pro
rata from (i) short-term gain or loss and (ii) long-term
capital gain or loss and (iii) operating income or loss
realized and recognized by the Partnership.

(1) Items
of income gain, loss, deduction and expense shall be allocated pro
rata among the Partners based on their respective Capital Accounts
as of the end of each Accounting Period in which such items accrue,
after taking into account the allocation of Management Fees
attributable to such Partner.

(2) Any
gain or loss required to be taken into account in accordance with
Section 1256 of the Code shall be considered a realized gain
or loss for purposes of this Section 9.3.

(b) In the
event that a Partnership Interest has been assigned, the
allocations prescribed by this Section 9.3 shall be made with
respect to such Partnership Interest without regard to the
assignment, except that in the year of assignment the allocations
prescribed by this Section 9.3 shall be divided between the
assignor and the assignee based on the number of months each held
the assigned Partnership Interest.

 

A-8


 


 


(c) The
allocations set forth in this Section 9.3 are intended to
allocate taxable profit and loss among Partners generally in the
ratio and to the extent that Net Profit and Net Loss are allocated
under Section 9.1 so as to eliminate, to the extent possible,
any disparity between a Partner’s Capital Account and his tax
basis account with respect to each Unit then outstanding,
consistent with the principles set forth in Section 704(b) of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder.

(d)
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that
at the end of any Partnership taxable year, any Limited
Partner’s tax basis is adjusted for, or such Limited Partner
is allocated, or there is distributed to such Limited Partner, any
item described in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) in an
amount not reasonably expected at the end of such year, and such
treatment creates a deficit balance in such Limited Partner’s
tax basis, then such Limited Partner shall be allocated all items
of income and gain of the Partnership for such year and for all
subsequent taxable years of the Partnership until such deficit
balance has been eliminated. In the event that any such unexpected
adjustments, allocations or distributions create a deficit balance
in the tax basis accounts of more than one Limited Partner in any
Partnership taxable year, all items of income and gain of the
Partnership for such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years
shall be allocated among all such Limited Partners in proportion to
their respective deficit balances until such deficit balances have
been eliminated. Upon the dissolution and termination of the
Partnership, the General Partner must contribute to the Partnership
an amount equal to any deficit balance in its tax basis account.
This paragraph is intended to constitute a “qualified income
offset” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted in a
manner consistent therewith. Under no circumstances shall any
Limited Partner be obligated to the Partnership to restore any
deficit balance in his tax basis account.

Section 9.4.
Section 754 Election

The
General Partner may, in its sole and absolute discretion, make an
election on behalf of the Partnership under Section 754 of the
Code to adjust the tax basis of its assets.

Section 9.5.
Fiscal Year

Except as
otherwise required by the Code, the fiscal year of the Partnership
shall be the calendar year.

EXPLANATORY
NOTE

Rogers
International Raw Materials Fund, L.P. (the
“Partnership”) is filing this Form 10-K/A (Amendment
No. 1) to amend the Partnership’s disclosure in

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

Commission on March 30, 2011 (the “Initial 10-K
Filing”). Other than with respect to Item 9A (and new
certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the

should be read in conjunction with the Initial 10-K Filing and the
Partnership’s subsequent reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 9A.



CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES




Disclosure
Control and Procedures

Under the
supervision and with the participation of the Partnership’s
general partner, Beeland Management Company, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Partnership has
evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2010, the end of the
period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have identified
a material weakness have concluded that these disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2010. The
material weakness identified by Management’s evaluation is
the General Partner’s lack of personnel which does not allow
for the segregation of key duties related to internal control over
partner activity, expenses, and financial reporting. These
significant weaknesses did not result in any omission or
misstatement of information required to be disclosed in reports
filed by the Partnership’s financial reporting.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, an evaluation was conducted of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
(“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission. Based on the
evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework, a material weakness was identified in internal control
over partner activity, expenses, and financial reporting. A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. Beeland Management has identified the following
material weakness: The infrastructure of personnel responsible for
the daily administration is limited and does not allow for
segregation of key duties. This material weakness is pervasive
across all operations of the Partnership, and leads to a reasonable
possibility that material misstatement or fraud would not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. This control deficiency
has not caused any adjustment to the financial statements. Due to
this control deficiency, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of Beeland Management have concluded that Beeland
Management’s internal control over financial report was not
effective as of December 31, 2010.

Changes in
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were
no changes to internal control or financial reporting procedures
during the fourth quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to affect, internal control over financial
reporting. However, as discussed above, Beeland Management has
identified a material weakness in our internal control procedures
that could impact our financial reporting. While management has
taken certain steps to address the identified material weakness in
internal control procedures, as of the date of this report the
Beeland Management has not hired any additional personnel. Beeland
Management has, however, engaged consultants to assist in the
identification and design of effective internal controls; provided
employees of Beeland Management educational materials to assist
with their understanding of effective internal control and
financial reporting design and has developed procedures to better
document employee review and controls for third parties to test the
existence of controls.
