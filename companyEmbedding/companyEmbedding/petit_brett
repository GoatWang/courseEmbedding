Product Details


This session-strength Saison of summer pours tawny-gold and perfumes the air with tangy yeast and pungent hop aromas. The flavor is lightly earthy with spicy, flowery hops and a grain-and-bread malt character; caramel malt dukes it out with Saaz and Styrian Goldings through the middle before a palate-cleansingly dry finish.

Standout Brew
This was the clear winner among the 6 batches i prepared for summer. For someone new to brewing this has the added benefit of being heat tolerant and will not suffer off flavors if you don't have a clue about temperature control (like me). This beer has a fantastic saison funk up front that subsides into a mineral tasting finish that will bring you back for more. The OG is nice and low so you can enjoy a few on a hot day without getting sloppy. I love this beer.

Never misses
Well, 2 daughters, 2 weddings within 5 months. Made this beer for both and it absolutely evaporated. I added orange zest from 2 oranges and let it sit in the secondary for 2 weeks. Just a fabulous beer for any season. Smooth, yet full of body. One you can count on.

still brilliant
2nd time I've brewed this. Just fantastic. Absolutely love this style. I added coriander at 10 min and fresh orange peel from a medium size naval orange at 5 min and it does a dang fine impression of a Wit, just a bit more raw and wheatier. Rave reviews so far from people who've had some. Without the coriander/orange, its still a very smooth, earthy, honest belgian. Just great. After a mere 6 days in the bottle, I was blown away at how good it was, and it will only get better in the weeks to come. Hope I have a few bottles left to see. Will brew many, many more times. NB, don't ever "retire" this recipe...

Excellent Saison
I've brewed a few saisons, and this one is by far the best I've had. Having bottled three weeks ago, it is fully carbonated and has the distinct flavors, very similar to my favorite saison, Ommegang's Hennepin. This is also the first saison I've brewed with the dry yeast option. It was not as fussy as I have experienced with 3711 etc, and brought out all my favorite flavors of a saison. I will definitely be brewing this one regularly. Note: I added one pound of honey, at the end of the boil.

Easy with Great Results
Added a bit of corn sugar to up the abv. Also added orange peel and corriander. Fermented Wyeast 3711 at 80 for just 8 days. Gravity was way down and I was short on beer so I bottled. Even after just a week and a half in bottle this beer is excellent. Its light, refreshing and true to style.The beer has a thin head that sticks around for a while. There is a definite crisp hops character and the beer tastes very dry. Smells of lemon, pepper and maybe a bit of strawberry. Mouthfeel is dry, but not thin.

5th batch fermenting now
Am fermenting our 5th batch in the last year and a half or so of Petite Saison d'Ete right now. So, we like it. A lot. Everyone in the family and all our friends who have tried it, even the "Bud Lite" and "I don't really drink beer" crowd, really enjoy this one. Very enjoyable and tasty beer that is great fresh but gets better with age. Easy to brew and quick turn-around time. It is the house favorite by far and the numbers prove it.Some of our other favorites, on the repeat list: Curt & Kathy's Orange Blossom Honey sweet mead (2nd batch fermenting now), Phat Tyre (three times), Rye Stout, Dead Ringer IPA.Not big fans, but not bad, won't repeat: Rasberry Wheat, Chinook IPA and Irish Red.My sons and I started less than two years ago and have really enjoyed learning and experimenting. We are considering getting a few bee hives in order to supply our mead production. That stuff is wonderful. We made our first batch for Christmas last year. Long lead time, though, so having one or two batches a year is about max.Very happy with NB and the quality of their products, ingredients and instruction. Speed of delivery and package tracking is top notch. Haven't had a bad batch yet, knock on wood.

Loved by all
Awesome beer. I have been looking around for a long time trying to find a beer that Coors Lite drinkers, experienced homebrew drinkers and people that really don't even drink at all would like. Well this is it. Everyone loves this thing and you are able to drink it all night long. I did add 1lb of Corn Sugar 15 min before flame out to bring it to a 4.7%abv. If you are thinking of getting it just do it. You wont regret it.

Great Beer, Quick Turnaround
For the last six months, I have gotten into Saisons. I like the mellowed belgian character they can provide. This is is great because it provides a very fast beer (probably 2 weeks, I did 3 weeks from boil to drinking), with an excellent Wyeast French Saison strain. I really liked how the bottle carbonation went; very fine bubbles. I would use this just to bottle with! I threw rosemary, lemon, and extra Saaz into the boil, and this probably my favorite homebrew yet.

Ahh the taste of summer
Great easy to drink beer. Crisp and great aroma, with a bit of a lower abv, so you are not wasted after drink 4 of them. Time it for summer and you will be happy. Next time I will add some coriander and maybe an orange peel to zest it up a bit. It is definitely not needed, but would be a good compliment.

Great Kit for tweaking (Hoppy Saison w/Brett)
This beer is good as is, but find it kind of plain. I recently used this kit and added 3 oz of Citra Hops (1 oz each at 15, 10 and 5 min). I pitched the regular yeast and a Brett C yeast at the same time. I had my first taste last night at 4 weeks and its fantastic!! The Brett character is pretty mild at this point but present. For those that like Brett Beers, don't be afraid to try them, for a 100% brett beer you have to be patient, but pitching with another just add some character and after a few weeks in the keg the beer changes over time (got great advice from the people at Odd 13 Brewing in Lafayette, CO)..

My first really good brew!
I brewed this beer a couple months ago, in order to take it up with me on a weeks vacation, boating, skiing, fishing, and just general summer tomfoolery. This beer was the perfect complement to that type of fun. My brother-in-laws loved it! My wife loves it. This is my fourth batch of beer I've ever brewed. It's the first batch I've finished where at the end of the process I thought to myself, wow, you did everything exactly how you had planned to do it. The results were amazing. This is a fantastic beer, and I'm a self professed Saison snob. I love me some saison and this beer definitely is a fantastically drinkable version. The French Saison yeast strain gives it a unique flavor. Enjoy!

Great kit...better beer!
I added a cup of table sugar to boost the gravity on this a titch...ended up at 5.4%ABV with good attenuation and very little (if any) additional sweetness from the sugar boost. Had it in the primary for 2.5 weeks, and it's been bottled for just a week...even non-beer drinkers have said how much they like it. Nice citrusy nose, well balanced, and a dry finish begging for another sip, swallow, swig, or...rats...now I need another one.... :-)

What a delightful surprise
I bought this kit on a whim looking for a light summer style beer to have ready once the warm weather rolled into Pittsburgh. Well the weather is here and I just poured myself one of these and wow is it fantastic. I did a 3 gallon boil as my megapot hadn't arrived yet back in April. I did one week primary and then decided, in the interest of clarity for a summer beer, to do a brief secondary. I did a 1 week secondary and then kegged. The beer has been sitting under pressure for a little over two weeks and I had some when it was only under pressure for 3 days and it was ok but after 2+ weeks of conditioning and 85+ degrees here in pittsburgh this one is PERFECT. Buy it now, brew it now, and you'll thank me in July.

Great Beer
I brewed this for my buddy who doesn't care for IPA's and or Stouts and was pleasantly surprised at how it turned out. Have to admit I kinda like the more basic recipes cause they allow you to tweak and tinker with the beer. Added a pound of Orange Clover Honey at the end and bumped the ABV up a little. Still easy drinking and great spring/summer brew. Will be ordering this again...

Petite Saison d'Ete - GREAT for Summer
I tried mine with the Orange Peel, boiled, then into secondary only(2 oranges carefully peeled with special peeler, so as not to get any of the white part-Pith). After 2 weeks in bottle, just tried last night. Outstanding! Strongly recommend. This will be hard to save for summer!

I can't believe how great this brew was, in just four weeks. It's carbonated beautifully with a mounding head. Non-beer drinkers like it a lot, and it's an easy beer to drink.

Sensational first homebrew
I chose to brew this as my first ever homebrew, brewed this on a saturday and the NB Black IPA on sunday. I enjoy belgians quite a bit, and I thought this seemed fitting for spring/early summer. I followed the instructions with the exception of not racking it to secondary, I kept it on the yeast cake/troub the whole time. I made a 24hr yeast starter and the fermentation took off really quick. I sampled it right before bottling, and I was not impressed at all - it felt very watery and weak. Decided to bottle & see what carbonation would do for mouthfeel and flavor. Bottled with 5oz corn sugar - no problems at all. I waited a full 14 days before sampling my first bottle, and it was spot on! Such an improvement once it was carbed up! A month after bottling, I sampled this brew with 6 friends next to Boulevard's Tank 7 and Great Divide's Colette. Even as my first brew, this stands right up to the two I just mentioned, and my friends had a difficult time recognizing which was the homebrew. Bottom line - everyone really loves it and it is a very approachable beer!

Best brew that I've made thus far
I fermented in the primary for two weeks, and it's been bottle conditioning for a week. I couldn't wait til next week, so we cracked one open. Wow! If this is still green, I can only imagine how good this will be once it's fully conditioned.I might take it a step further and do a secondary on my next batch, just to reduce sediment and provide a little more clarity. But man, this is fully carbonated, beautifully colored, great head, great lacing, and has a great nose but isn't too hoppy on the tongue.

Awesome quick beer
I had this in the primary for 1 week then a bottle for a week, can taste the spiciness already but after another week the beer has started to settle out and has become a great beer already after 3 weeks. I will order this again and play with the recipe.

best one yet
I have only made 4 brews before this one, and I love dark beers but when I tasted a saison at brew club I had to make one. This by far had the best flavor and body. All the other kits I had made lacked the body/mouthfeel I expected but this one is simply amazing. I even opened my first bottle after 4 days because I was unavailing my porter, American cream ale, and pale ales to a couple buddies and they thought it was the best of the night!

Brilliant!
I have to start the review by saying I didn't *exactly* follow the recipe. I added coriander and bitter orange just like a Wit and followed the addition schedule just like the NB Wit kit. The result is so phenomenal, I can't put it into words. I can't believe I made this!!! The instructions say 2 weeks in the fermenter, but after 1 week, the gravity was down to 1.008, so I called it done. Bottled it up and after only 1 week in the bottle it is simply brilliant! Very easy to make, the French Saison yeast NB recommends from Wyest is easier to use than the Belgian version. This stuff *should* get better since I've only given it a week in the bottle, but I can't imagine it being better than it is now.This is a homerun summer session beer. 5 stars....

Great Beer
I made this kit but substituted Danstar Belle Saison for the listed choices. Fermented at 76-78 for two weeks. Bottled one week, and tasted great. Just like you expect from a saison - fruity, a bit funky, incredibly refreshing. I could drink it all day. My friends are big fans of this one.

i make the all-grain version of this, it's very good, better than even belgian/french commercial saisons. i add quite a bit of spice to it as well, coriander, orange peel, ginger, cardamom.... and a bit of honey or sugar at flame-out. saisons are great to tweak for personal preference.

never fails to impress
I really cannot decide which NB Saison recipe is best. They are all different and all fantastic. I really like the Petite because it's closer to a traditional. Not too high alcohol, not too hoppy. Just right. I add some spices, usually coriander and orange peel, and it is just great. Next go around I may bump the gravity a bit and go with ginger and orange peel and try to do a Hennepin clone.

Superb
I really liked this. I added another lb of wheat DME to up the ABV. Used the 3711 Yeast. My fermenting was in typical summer house temps around 80F. It came out spicy and delicious. After 3 months (6 weeks in the bottle) it really mellowed out and the spicy character subsided. Like they say - when you drink the last bottle, the beer is ready to drink. I will do this one again or I might go with the regular Saison as opposed to the petit because I like my beer to have a bit more kick.

Great Kit !!!
I recently decided to brew my own beer and came across Northern Brewer while researching over the internet. I picked this Extract kit based strictly on the rave reviews that it received. Well, I just finished my very first brew and ......Wow.....I will never buy grocery store beer again. I followed the instructions that came with the kit and used the 3711 French Saison Yeast. I also added orange peel and coriander seed because I a big fan of those Belgium brews. My first brew has excellent flavor and clarity...a nice head....and a kick....3711 is a fantastic yeast....I've got an ABV of 5.0%. I could not believe that I actually made this great beer. I also want to acknowledge the staff at Northern Brewer. I had a damaged yeast package on this first shipment that was immediately replaced at no charge. I am very happy that I chose Northern Brewer for my first attempt at home brewing....Now please restock this kit as soon as possible!

Smooth
I stumbled into brewing this brew. I intended on doing the petite orange but accidentally grabbed this because I was talking to someone. I've been making homebrew for about a year now and this is one of my best kits, not a lot of ingredients but still produces a distinctive taste. There's a peppery taste on the back end which I questioned if I would enjoy but I do very much. My batch yielded a higher ABV then I expected (around 5.5). It's also the lightest brew that I have made. I will be brewing this again because it won't last.

Good Summer Beer
This is a good simple refreshing farmhouse ale. I brewed it with the recommended Danstar dry yeast, and got a crisper smoother ale. The fermentation was quick and the beer was done a week early. The liquid yeasts will probably give different results with more of the citrus and spice flavors.

My third batch
I took this recipe and tinkered with it a bit. I added an ounce of German herzbrucker hops at 10 minutes, and a pound of honey at flameout. Everyone who tried the beer really liked it. Even with the extra additions, this remained a very simple, straightforward beer. Very light mouthfeel, and very refreshing. The star of this beer is the French saison yeast, which took the beer all the way down to a FG of 1.001! The yeast also produced a slightly fruity flavor that is very pleasant. If you buy this kit, get the WY3711 yeast. You won't be sorry. I plan on brewing more beers with this yeast as well.

You Better Get This One!
I usually like a darker beer like Irish Ales and even IPAs. I wanted to try a lighter beer for the summer season. I read through many of the reviews for Saisons and wandered upon this Petite Saison. It sounded a little dainty for me, but I gave it a shot. WOW!You have got to get this beer kit. The recipe was a little more difficult than what I'm used to doing. However, I followed the directions to the tee and I was blown away with the outcome. It was hoppy, but not like an IPA. It has a great head and laces wonderfully. Great carbonation. I don't have any complaint about this beer. I am ordering another one this week to make sure I don't run out of this beer.Great job, Northern Brewer!

Very nice summer beer
I wasn't expecting too much but thought I'd try this one mostly due to its 4 week & ready appeal. It is my second brew from Northern and I can see myself doing this one again (and again, and again.....) . Lighter taste than what I usually brew, it does have more kick than I expected ( okay, I should learn how to use the AVB tools).

Excellent Beer
I made this beer by using White Labs Trappist Ale and adding approximately 1 lb of honey to boost the OG to 1.052. Fermented out to 1.009 while using a fermentation temperature of 68 degrees. After primary fermentation was complete I let it sit in my basement at 73 degrees for 2 weeks and then legged it. What an excellent beer this is, well balanced light easy drinking with lots of yeast character and not overwhelming with esters. For me keeping this beer lower end of the fermentation range produced a very well balanced beer. If you are brewing this in the spring, for a great summer beer you may do well adding orange peel because I feel that would go extremely well with the flavor profile. I will be trying it this way for a summer Saison.

Sensation!
If I could give it 4.5 stars, I probably would, but it's a really great beer that deserves 5 over 4. My only issue with this otherwise phenomenal brew is that I wish it had just a bit more complexity to it. T'is delicious ... an easy drinking, citrus-hinting bundle of yum. I'll definitely brew it again, and perhaps try some honey or lemon or orange peel in the boil.

Perfect for Summer
If its warm out, this is beer to drink. Its sessionable, refreshing, and absolutely delicious. The kit is incredibly easy to brew and ready to drink in short order. After two weeks in primary and three days force carbing in the keg, this brew is perfect.

First Saison
Easy and great tasting! Perfect first saison kit to use. I went with Lallemand Belle yeast. Will definitely Belle again.

delicious, easy, and a great base for tinkering
It's astonishing to me that a beer this easy tastes this good. It's also a great base for tinkering. I added rose hips near the beginning of the boil, rose flowers near the end, and hibiscus flowers near the end of fermentation (based on a Jolly Pumpkin recipe), and it was great. We offer this "Scent of Flowers Saison" at a production put on by a theater company my brew-buddies and I are involved with, and people really seem to like it.It's a very accessible entry-point into slightly funky, tart beers, which made it perfect to offer to our theater audience.

Best batch, brews itself
I've haven't experienced the power of yeast until this batch. A very active fermentation creating a clean, citrusy beer of astonishing complexity. Was it drinkable? All positive reviews from beer fans and naught alike. Highly recommended for a quick easy great beer.

Excellent summer wheat
Just like the previous review states, this kit makes a great summer whet with bright golden color, amazing aroma and flavor. Easy to make, quick to ferment, just great all around.

Very nice summery wheat based beer
Just sampled the first of this on tap and it is delicious. Make a nice bright gold summery wheat beer with tons of aroma from the hops and a delicious yeasty banana citrus flavor. Much better than many commercial summer ales. Easy, quick turn around is highly suggested to try.

I was thinking of adding candi sugar the d1 at 10 minutes left in boil. Any thoughts



Joseph S



on Jan 11, 2016









BEST ANSWER: This will increase the overall gravity, and likely the the ABV. The final taste will depend on the yeast used. Feel free to experiment a little with this one. Don't add enough sugar to raise the gravity above the guidelines for this beer style. (SG 1.08 max) This kit is a little bit lighter Saison it would be probably be wise to excersize some caution unless you are trying for a high gravity variation.

I have made this now 4 times. The only changes I made was adding orange peel to the secondary. This beer was extraordinary. I made it for my daughter's wedding last summer and 5 gallons evaporated. So, I am wondering what you might be trying to gain?

That would be fine to do, and will mostly contribute alcohol to the beer, unless you use a darker colored version, which would of course add color to the mixture, as well as more flavors, depending on the candi syrup/sugar choice.

Should I store the Wyeast 3711 in the refrigerator? The packaging on the yeast andthe instructional document contradict themselves.



P U



on Jun 1, 2016









BEST ANSWER: Yes, store the Wyeast packages in the fridge. You can activate it in advance, to be sure your yeast is good before brewing; but you should store it in the fridge once fully activated, or if you're not going to brew for a while. -Mike W, Northern Brewer

The Virtual Reality Roller Coaster Has Arrived | Fortune.comEntertainmentSearchSearchFordU.S. Expands Probe Into Ford Explorers Over Carbon Monoxide ConcernsWMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: July 28COMPARECARDSSPONSOREDUberUber’s CEO Searchlight Reportedly Hits Former GE Head Jeff ImmeltSix Flags is debuting virtual reality roller coasters across its theme parks using Samsung Gear VR mobile headsets. Adobe Illustrator CC 2014 (Macintosh) Adobe Illustrator CC 2014 (Macintosh)Six FlagsThe Virtual Reality Roller Coaster Has ArrivedJohn GaudiosiMar 06, 2016Disney theme parks have been using virtual reality to design new rides and attractions, and Landmark Entertainment is building a virtual reality theme park in China. But now Six Flags Entertainment Corporation is bringing virtual reality to actual roller coasts across nine of its theme parks this month.Six Flags (six) has partnered with Samsung Electronics America to integrate the mobile Gear VR device into virtual reality rides that were designed to take advantage of every twist and turn in the roller coaster track. Samsung is now the “official technology partner” of Six Flags, and its Facebook (fb) Oculus technology is powering two new virtual reality rides.Nick DiCarlo, vice president and general manager of immersive products and virtual reality at Samsung, says Six Flags patrons will experience Gear VR from a Galaxy S6 edge. However, Gear VR is also compatible with Samsung’s latest smartphones including the newly introduced Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, as well as the Galaxy S6, S6 edge, S6 edge+, and Note5.Brett Petit, senior vice president of marketing for Six Flags, says the company has been exploring VR for years, but now the technology exists to deliver the types of one-of-a-kind experiences it was looking for.“The expertise and hardware that Samsung provides, with the Gear VR and their partnership with Oculus, is really what took this to the next level and made virtual reality on a roller coaster possible,” Petit says.Petit says using CAD (computer-aided design) drawings and technical layouts, Six Flags ride designers crafted the story lines, perfectly syncing the movements of each roller coaster with what riders are seeing on their Gear VR headsets, bringing it all to life.Six theme park rides will debut New Revolution virtual reality coasters, including Shock Wave at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington, Dare Devil Dive at Six Flags Over Georgia, The New Revolution at Six Flags Magic Mountain near Los Angeles, Ninja at Six Flags St. Louis in Eureka, Steamin’ Demon at The Great Escape in Lake George, New York, and Goliath at La Ronde in Montreal.New Revolution puts riders in the co-pilot seat of fighter jets battling aliens in air-to-air combat. The ride even allows riders to fire weapons at alien ships through new interactive gameplay technology that takes advantage of Gear VR’s video game capabilities.Three theme park rides have been converted to Superman virtual reality coasters, including Superman Krypton Coaster at Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio, Superman The Ride at Six Flags New England in Agawam, Massachusetts, and Superman Ride of Steel at Six Flags America in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.This ride focuses on the comic book super hero, bringing a 360-degree tour of Metropolis to life courtesy of Lex Corp Sky Tours. After Lex Luther and his Lex Bots wreak havoc with gravity in the city, riders fly along with Superman as he battles Lex and his mechanized minions to restore order to the city.By adding virtual reality to pre-existing rides, theme parks are able to change experiences from year to year without constructing new multi-million dollar rides.“The possibilities are almost endless when you consider all of the different concepts and themed worlds that can be created—we can now provide experiences you can only do in a virtual world, like the ability to fly alongside Superman, be the co-pilot of a jet fighter and save the planet, explore outer space…the list goes on,” Petit says. “We have the ability to swap out those virtual experiences or even give guests a choice of what adventure they want to ride each time.”One issue that Disney and other theme park developers have brought up with implementing virtual reality is hygiene, since so many guests ride a roller coaster on a typical day.Petit says all parts of the headset that touch a rider’s face and head are covered in an anti-microbial leather and cleansed between every use with anti-bacterial wipes.In addition, charging stations will be located at each ride to ensure there are sufficient phones available for guests throughout the day.Six Flags Entertainment Corporation has 18 parks across the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The company experienced a record 2015. Revenues grew $88 million, or 7.5%, to $1.3 billion last year. And attendance grew by 2.9 million guests, or 11.4%, to 28.6 million guests in 2015.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.
