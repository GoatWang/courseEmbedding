Interest in Securities of the Issuer.



 
Items 5(a) - 5(c) are hereby amended and restated to read as follows:
 
(a)           The aggregate percentage of Shares reported owned by each person named herein is based upon 24,478,344 Shares outstanding as of July 23, 2015, which is the total number of Shares outstanding as reported in the Issuer’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 30, 2015.

NEW YORK, Jan. 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- PW Partners Atlas Funds and HG Vora Capital Management (the "Nominating Stockholders"), who collectively own 6,371,133 shares or 26.2% of the outstanding shares of Town Sports International Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:   CLUB) ("Town Sports" or the "Company"), announced today that they have formally nominated six highly qualified and independent director nominees for election to the Board of Directors of Town Sports at its upcoming 2015 annual meeting of stockholders.  
The Nominating Stockholders released the following statement:
"As stockholders collectively owning more than 26% of Town Sports, we believe the Company needs to significantly revamp its board of directors to effect the changes necessary to maximize stockholder value. We believe our proposed slate of experienced operating and business professionals with significant expertise in the fitness industry and corporate finance will strengthen Town Sports' brands, right-size its cost structure, and make prudent capital allocation decisions for the benefit of all stockholders. The Company has failed to engage in a meaningful dialogue with us regarding our recommendations for enhancing stockholder value. The Company also rebuffed our good faith attempts to obtain meaningful representation on the Board and responded by adopting a 'poison pill' rights plan. Stockholders deserve directors who will proactively address the many issues facing Town Sports and be committed to meaningful value creation."
The Nominating Stockholders' slate of director nominees includes:
Glenn Colarossi (Age 54) who has served as Principal of Colarossi Spa & Health Club Consulting & Management LLC, a health club consulting and management firm providing development, design, branding, management and investment consulting services to health clubs and spas worldwide, since he founded it in 1991.

Mark A. McEachen (Age 56) who has served as the Chief Executive Officer of The Dolan Company, a leading provider of business information and professional services to the legal, financial, real estate and business sectors, since June 2014.

Mr. McEachen held a variety of positions at Freedom Communications, Inc. from May 2009 to June 2013, including Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
Jeffrey C. Neal (Age 69) who has been a Partner of Horizon Capital LLC, an investment company he co-founded specializing in investments in Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus, since June 2005. He previously served as a director of Caribou Coffee Company, Inc., a leading branded coffee company, from October 2005 to August 2008. Mr. Neal has held a variety of positions at Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. and a predecessor firm from 1973 to 2004, including Chairman of the Global Investment Banking Group.

He was also the Founder and Owner of Thomas Plummer Company, a provider of workshops, independent consulting and speaking engagements to the fitness industry, from 1990 to 2003.
