FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Thursday, December 22, 2016 
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Agrees to Pay More Than $283 Million to Resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Charges
Companies Agree to Pay Nearly $520 Million to U.S. Criminal and Regulatory Authorities, Representing the Largest Criminal Fine Imposed Against a Pharmaceutical Company for Violations of the FCPA
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Teva), the world’s largest manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products, and its wholly-owned Russian subsidiary, Teva LLC (Teva Russia), agreed to resolve criminal charges and to pay a criminal penalty of more than $283 million in connection with schemes involving the bribery of government officials in Russia, Ukraine and Mexico in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).
Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Assistant Director Stephen Richardson of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, and Assistant Special Agent in Charge William J. Maddalena of the FBI’s Miami Field Office made the announcement.
“Teva and its subsidiaries paid millions of dollars in bribes to government officials in various countries, and intentionally failed to implement a system of internal controls that would prevent bribery,” said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell.  “Companies that compete fairly, ethically and honestly deserve a level playing field, and we will continue to prosecute those who undermine that goal.”
“No matter where corruption occurs, the FBI and our global partners are committed to diligently rooting out the corruption that betrays the public trust and threatens a fair economy for all,” said FBI Assistant Director Stephen Richardson.
“As demonstrated by this case, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has a long reach,” said William J. Maddalena, Assistant Special Agent in Charge, FBI Miami.  “Teva’s egregious attempt to enrich themselves failed and they will now pay a tough penalty.”
According to the companies’ admissions, Teva executives and Teva Russia employees paid bribes to a high-ranking Russian government official intending to influence the official to use his authority to increase sales of Teva’s multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone, in annual drug purchase auctions held by the Russian Ministry of Health.  The corrupt arrangement occurred at the same time that the Russian government was seeking to reduce the amount spent on costly foreign pharmaceutical products, such as Copaxone.  Between 2010 and at least 2012, pursuant to an agreement with a repackaging and distribution company owned by the Russian government official, Teva earned more than $200 million in profits on Copaxone sales to the Russian government.  Moreover, the Russian official earned approximately $65 million in corrupt profits through inflated profit margins granted to the official’s company.      
Teva also admitted to paying bribes to a senior government official within the Ukrainian Ministry of Health to influence the Ukrainian government’s approval of Teva drug registrations, which were necessary for the company to market and sell its products in the country.  Between 2001 and 2011, Teva engaged the official as the company’s “registration consultant,” paid him a monthly fee and provided him with travel and other things of value totaling approximately $200,000.  In exchange, the official used his official position and influence within the Ukrainian government to influence the registration in Ukraine of Teva pharmaceutical products, including Copaxone and insulins.
In addition, Teva admitted that it failed to implement an adequate system of internal accounting controls and failed to enforce the controls it had in place at its Mexican subsidiary, which allowed bribes to be paid by the subsidiary to doctors employed by the Mexican government.  Teva admitted that its Mexican subsidiary had been bribing these doctors to prescribe Copaxone since at least 2005.  Teva executives in Israel responsible for the development of the company’s anti-corruption compliance program in 2009 had been aware of the bribes paid to government doctors in Mexico.  Nevertheless, Teva executives approved policies and procedures that they knew were not sufficient to meet the risks posed by Teva’s business and were not adequate to prevent or detect payments to foreign officials.  Teva also admitted that its executives put in place managers to oversee the compliance function who were unable or unwilling to enforce the anti-corruption policies that had been put in place.
Teva entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in connection with a criminal information, filed today in the Southern District of Florida, charging the company with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and one count of failing to implement adequate internal controls.  Pursuant to its agreement with the department, Teva will pay a total criminal penalty of $283,177,348.  Teva also agreed to continue to cooperate with the department’s investigation, enhance its compliance program, implement rigorous internal controls and retain an independent corporate compliance monitor for a term of three years.
Teva Russia has signed a plea agreement in which it has agreed to plead guilty to a one-count criminal information, also filed today in the Southern District of Florida, charging the company with conspiring to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.  The plea agreement is subject to court approval.  The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams of the Southern District of Florida and Teva Russia's initial court appearance has been scheduled for January 12, 2017.
In related proceedings, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a cease and desist order against Teva, whereby the company agreed to pay approximately $236 million in disgorgement to the SEC, including prejudgment interest.  Thus, the combined total amount of U.S. criminal and regulatory penalties to be paid by Teva is nearly $520 million.
The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including the fact that Teva did not timely voluntarily self-disclose the conduct, but did cooperate with the department’s investigation after the SEC served it with a subpoena.  Teva received a 20 percent discount off the low end of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range because of its substantial cooperation and remediation.  The company, however, did not receive full cooperation credit because of issues that resulted in delays to the early stages of the Fraud Section’s investigation, including vastly overbroad assertions of attorney-client privilege and not producing documents on a timely basis in response to certain Fraud Section document requests.  Because many of the company’s compliance enhancements were more recent, and therefore have not been tested, the DPA imposes an independent compliance monitor for a term of three years. 
The FBI’s International Corruption Unit and Miami Field Office investigated the case.  Fraud Section Trial Attorneys Rohan A. Virginkar and John-Alex Romano prosecuted the case.  The Fraud Section appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by the SEC in this matter.  The Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs and the Mexican Attorney General’s Office (Procuradura General de la República or PGR) also provided assistance in this matter.
The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters.  Additional information about the Justice Department’s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

History[edit]




Worker at Assia plant in the 1930s






Teva plant, Har Hotzvim, Jerusalem






Teva in Markham, Ontario


Teva's earliest predecessor was Salomon, Levin, and Elstein Ltd., a wholesale distributor based in Palestine that was founded in 1901, and used camels to make deliveries.[5] During the 1930s, new immigrants from Europe founded several pharmaceutical companies including Teva ("Nature" in Hebrew), Assia, and Zori. In 1951, Teva raised capital through the newly founded Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange after the formation of the new country, Israel.[citation needed]
In 1964, Assia and Zori merged and acquired a controlling interest in Teva. In 1976, these three companies merged into the modern-day Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. In 1980, Teva continued to follow its vision of becoming one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies by acquiring Ikapharm, then Israel's second largest drug manufacturer.[6]
In 1982, Teva was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Kfar Saba manufacturing plant, an essential milestone for marketing pharmaceuticals in the US.[citation needed]
In 2005, Teva opened a new, state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Har Hotzvim, a technology park in Jerusalem. The plant received FDA approval in early 2007.[7] Teva entered the Japanese market in 2005, and in 2008 established a generics joint venture with Kowa.[8]
In 2008, sales totalled $11.08 billion, $13.9 billion in 2009, and in 2010 total sales rose to $16.1 billion, of which a major portion was in Europe and North America. Teva acquired its U.S. rival Ivax Corporation in January 2006,[9][10] Barr in 2007 and Ratiopharm in 2010.
In 2010, Teva announced that it would build its main distribution center for the Americas in Philadelphia, PA, and was considering opening its US headquarters in the area.[7]
In 2010, it had 39,660 employees. In Israel, the number of workers rose 7.5% by 6,774.[11] In March 2010, Teva acquired German-based company Ratiopharm in a deal worth almost $5 billion, significantly expanding its European coverage.[12][13][14] In October 2010, Teva entered a licensing agreement with BioTime to develop and market BioTime's OpRegen for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration,[15] an effort that in 2013 received $1.5 billion in funding from Israel's Office of the Chief Scientist.[16] In May 2011 Teva announced it would purchase Cephalon for US$6.8 billion, to help expand its presence in the proprietary pharmaceuticals sector.[citation needed]
Teva Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (TAPI) operates within Teva as a stand-alone business unit. As well as providing for Teva's own needs, the TAPI division is an active competitor in world markets. In 2009, TAPI's sales to third parties totaled $565 million, and in 2010 sales rose by 13% to a total of $641 million.[citation needed]
In July 2017, it was reported that Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca since 2012, would become the next CEO of Teva, succeeding Erez Vigodman.[17][18]

Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
1980 to 1999[edit]
In 1980, Teva acquired Plantex.[30]
2000 to 2009[edit]
In 2000 Teva acquired Canada-based Novopharm.[31] In January 2006, Teva said it had completed the acquisition of IVAX Corporation for around $7.4 billion.[32] The acquisition price was $7.4 billion.[33] On December 23, 2008, Teva acquired Barr Pharmaceuticals for $7.5 billion, making Barr and Pliva (which Barr bought earlier) part of Teva.[34]
2010 onwards[edit]
On March 18, 2010, Teva said it planned to acquire German generic Ratiopharm for US$5 billion. The deal was completed in August 2010.[7] In May 2011, Teva bought Cephalon for US$6.8 billion.[35] The same month, Teva announced the ¥40 billion purchase of a majority stake in Japanese generic drug company Taiyo Pharmaceutical Industry, a move to secure a Japan-local production facility.[8] Teva completed the $934 million acquisition on July 2011.[36] In June 2013 Teva acquired US firm MicroDose for $40 million with as much as $125 million being paid in regulatory and developmental milestones [37] In January 2014, Teva acquired NuPathe, after outbidding Endo, for $144 million.[38] In June 2014, Teva acquired Labrys Biologics for up to $825 million,[39] the aim being to strengthen the company's migraine pipeline through addition of LBR-101, an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody therapeutic.[28] In March 2015, Teva acquired Auspex Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion growing its CNS portfolio.[40] In April, Teva offered to acquire Mylan for $40 billion,[41] only a fortnight after Mylan offered to buy Perrigo for $29 billion.[42] Teva's offer for Mylan was contingent on Mylan abandoning its pursuit of Perrigo.[43] Mylan stated in June 2015 that Teva’s disclosure that it had a 1.35 percent stake in Mylan violated US anti-trust rules.[44] In October, the company acquired Mexico-based Representaciones e Investigaciones Medicas (Rimsa) for around $2.3 billion.[45] In the same month Teva acquired Gecko Health Innovations.[46] In November 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Heptares Therapeutics with its work on small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists for migraine treatment, with the deal generating up to $410 million.[47]
Actavis Generics[edit]
Main article: Actavis
In July 2015, Allergan agreed to sell its generic drug business (Actavis Generics[48]) to Teva for $40.5 billion[49][50][51] ($33.75 billion in cash and $6.75 billion worth of shares).[52] As a result, Teva dropped its pursuit of Mylan. In order for the deal to gain regulatory approval, Teva sold off a number of assets, including a portfolio of five generic drugs to Sagent Pharmaceuticals for $40 million, as well as a further eight medicines to Dr. Reddy’s in a $350 million deal.[48] Teva also sold a further 15 marketed generics, as well as three others which were close to market, for $586 million to Impax Laboratories.[53][54] In July, Teva sold off a further 42 products to Australian generics company, Mayne Pharma, for $652 million; the deal moved Mayne up 50 spots, into the top-25 companies of US generic companies.[55] As part of the deal Teva will seek to raise $20 to $25 billion[56] through a bond sale.[57]
After completing the $39 billion acquisition of Actavis Generics, Teva announced another, smaller, deal with Allergan, agreeing to acquire its generic distribution business Anda for $500 million.[58]

Research and development[edit]




Copaxone, a Teva patented drug


Teva holds patents on multiple drugs, including: Copaxone, a specialty drug[59] (for the treatment of multiple sclerosis), now the world's best selling MS drug,[60] and Azilect (sold as Agilect in some countries) for treatment of Parkinson's disease. By July 2015 Copaxone held a "31.2 percent shares of total MS prescriptions in the United States."[60] Teva's new 40 mg version of Copaxone taken three times a week "accounted for 68.5 percent of total Copaxone prescriptions in the United States."[60] Copaxone accounts for about fifty percent of "Teva's profit and 20 percent of revenue."[60] Competitors' Glatopa, 20 mg version of Copaxone, is taken once a day.[60]
In June 2006, Teva received from the FDA a 180-day exclusivity period to sell simvastatin (Zocor) in the U.S. as a generic drug in all strengths except 80 mg. Teva presently[when?] competes with the maker of brand-name Zocor, Merck & Co.; Ranbaxy Laboratories, which has 180-day exclusivity for the 80 mg strength; and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, whose authorized generic version (licensed by Merck) is exempt from exclusivity.
In June 2010, the company announced it would discontinue its production of propofol, a major sedative estimated to be used in 75% of all US anesthetic procedures.[61]
In March 2015 Teva sold four anti-cancer compounds to Ignyta Inc. for $41.6 million. As part of the deal Teva sold the following compounds which were then renamed:[62]

CEP-32496 (renamed RXDX-105) a small molecule inhibitor of BRAF, EGFR and RET, now in Phase I/II trials
CEP-40783 (renamed RXDX-106) a small molecule inhibitor of AXL and c-Met in preclinical development
CEP-40125 (renamed RXDX-107) a nanoformulation of a modified bendamustine with potenital activity in solid tumours. Bendamustine Rapid Infusion as therapy for CLL and NHL is part of Teva's specialty drugs pipeline.[59]
TEV-44229 (renamed RXDX-108) a potent inhibitor of the kinase PKCiota

Legal issues[edit]
On June 25, 2010, Bayer sued Teva for falsely claiming that Gianvi, Teva's Generic of Yaz, was "stabilized by betadex as a clathrate."[63] The lawsuit stems from Bayer's US patent, 5798338, on the binding and preservative agents that were not in fact present in Gianvi. "In the preparation of such low-dosed dosage forms, strong fluctuations of the active ingredient concentrations in the dosage units occur almost unavoidably (inadequate content uniformity), which manifest themselves more strongly, the smaller the amount of the active ingredient. It has now been found that the drawbacks that are observed especially in the preparation and storage of dosage forms which contain low-dosed steroidal sex hormones can be avoided, at least to a large extent, if dosage forms are prepared that contain powdery cyclodextrin clathrates of these active ingredients."[64] The settlement of the lawsuit resulted in Teva changing its product marketing to remove the claim that it used the same ingredients as Yaz.[65][dead link] Bayer's patent is on a method specifically designed to prevent oxidative degradation of the estrogen.
In January 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided on the Copaxone patent in Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc..[66]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Teva Pharmaceutical of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[67]

History[edit]




Worker at Assia plant in the 1930s






Teva plant, Har Hotzvim, Jerusalem






Teva in Markham, Ontario


Teva's earliest predecessor was Salomon, Levin, and Elstein Ltd., a wholesale distributor based in Palestine that was founded in 1901, and used camels to make deliveries.[5] During the 1930s, new immigrants from Europe founded several pharmaceutical companies including Teva ("Nature" in Hebrew), Assia, and Zori. In 1951, Teva raised capital through the newly founded Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange after the formation of the new country, Israel.[citation needed]
In 1964, Assia and Zori merged and acquired a controlling interest in Teva. In 1976, these three companies merged into the modern-day Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. In 1980, Teva continued to follow its vision of becoming one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies by acquiring Ikapharm, then Israel's second largest drug manufacturer.[6]
In 1982, Teva was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Kfar Saba manufacturing plant, an essential milestone for marketing pharmaceuticals in the US.[citation needed]
In 2005, Teva opened a new, state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Har Hotzvim, a technology park in Jerusalem. The plant received FDA approval in early 2007.[7] Teva entered the Japanese market in 2005, and in 2008 established a generics joint venture with Kowa.[8]
In 2008, sales totalled $11.08 billion, $13.9 billion in 2009, and in 2010 total sales rose to $16.1 billion, of which a major portion was in Europe and North America. Teva acquired its U.S. rival Ivax Corporation in January 2006,[9][10] Barr in 2007 and Ratiopharm in 2010.
In 2010, Teva announced that it would build its main distribution center for the Americas in Philadelphia, PA, and was considering opening its US headquarters in the area.[7]
In 2010, it had 39,660 employees. In Israel, the number of workers rose 7.5% by 6,774.[11] In March 2010, Teva acquired German-based company Ratiopharm in a deal worth almost $5 billion, significantly expanding its European coverage.[12][13][14] In October 2010, Teva entered a licensing agreement with BioTime to develop and market BioTime's OpRegen for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration,[15] an effort that in 2013 received $1.5 billion in funding from Israel's Office of the Chief Scientist.[16] In May 2011 Teva announced it would purchase Cephalon for US$6.8 billion, to help expand its presence in the proprietary pharmaceuticals sector.[citation needed]
Teva Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (TAPI) operates within Teva as a stand-alone business unit. As well as providing for Teva's own needs, the TAPI division is an active competitor in world markets. In 2009, TAPI's sales to third parties totaled $565 million, and in 2010 sales rose by 13% to a total of $641 million.[citation needed]
In July 2017, it was reported that Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca since 2012, would become the next CEO of Teva, succeeding Erez Vigodman.[17][18]

Yitzhak Peterburg
February 2017 to present day
Peterburg held the position of Chairman since 2015. He was appointed as Interim President and CEO in 2017 succeeding Erez Vigodman. Since Israeli law does not permit the same individual to serve as CEO and Chairman, Sol J Barer took over as the Chairman of the board in February 2017.[29]


Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
1980 to 1999[edit]
In 1980, Teva acquired Plantex.[30]
2000 to 2009[edit]
In 2000 Teva acquired Canada-based Novopharm.[31] In January 2006, Teva said it had completed the acquisition of IVAX Corporation for around $7.4 billion.[32] The acquisition price was $7.4 billion.[33] On December 23, 2008, Teva acquired Barr Pharmaceuticals for $7.5 billion, making Barr and Pliva (which Barr bought earlier) part of Teva.[34]
2010 onwards[edit]
On March 18, 2010, Teva said it planned to acquire German generic Ratiopharm for US$5 billion. The deal was completed in August 2010.[7] In May 2011, Teva bought Cephalon for US$6.8 billion.[35] The same month, Teva announced the ¥40 billion purchase of a majority stake in Japanese generic drug company Taiyo Pharmaceutical Industry, a move to secure a Japan-local production facility.[8] Teva completed the $934 million acquisition on July 2011.[36] In June 2013 Teva acquired US firm MicroDose for $40 million with as much as $125 million being paid in regulatory and developmental milestones [37] In January 2014, Teva acquired NuPathe, after outbidding Endo, for $144 million.[38] In June 2014, Teva acquired Labrys Biologics for up to $825 million,[39] the aim being to strengthen the company's migraine pipeline through addition of LBR-101, an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody therapeutic.[28] In March 2015, Teva acquired Auspex Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion growing its CNS portfolio.[40] In April, Teva offered to acquire Mylan for $40 billion,[41] only a fortnight after Mylan offered to buy Perrigo for $29 billion.[42] Teva's offer for Mylan was contingent on Mylan abandoning its pursuit of Perrigo.[43] Mylan stated in June 2015 that Teva’s disclosure that it had a 1.35 percent stake in Mylan violated US anti-trust rules.[44] In October, the company acquired Mexico-based Representaciones e Investigaciones Medicas (Rimsa) for around $2.3 billion.[45] In the same month Teva acquired Gecko Health Innovations.[46] In November 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Heptares Therapeutics with its work on small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists for migraine treatment, with the deal generating up to $410 million.[47]
Actavis Generics[edit]
Main article: Actavis
In July 2015, Allergan agreed to sell its generic drug business (Actavis Generics[48]) to Teva for $40.5 billion[49][50][51] ($33.75 billion in cash and $6.75 billion worth of shares).[52] As a result, Teva dropped its pursuit of Mylan. In order for the deal to gain regulatory approval, Teva sold off a number of assets, including a portfolio of five generic drugs to Sagent Pharmaceuticals for $40 million, as well as a further eight medicines to Dr. Reddy’s in a $350 million deal.[48] Teva also sold a further 15 marketed generics, as well as three others which were close to market, for $586 million to Impax Laboratories.[53][54] In July, Teva sold off a further 42 products to Australian generics company, Mayne Pharma, for $652 million; the deal moved Mayne up 50 spots, into the top-25 companies of US generic companies.[55] As part of the deal Teva will seek to raise $20 to $25 billion[56] through a bond sale.[57]
After completing the $39 billion acquisition of Actavis Generics, Teva announced another, smaller, deal with Allergan, agreeing to acquire its generic distribution business Anda for $500 million.[58]

Research and development[edit]




Copaxone, a Teva patented drug


Teva holds patents on multiple drugs, including: Copaxone, a specialty drug[59] (for the treatment of multiple sclerosis), now the world's best selling MS drug,[60] and Azilect (sold as Agilect in some countries) for treatment of Parkinson's disease. By July 2015 Copaxone held a "31.2 percent shares of total MS prescriptions in the United States."[60] Teva's new 40 mg version of Copaxone taken three times a week "accounted for 68.5 percent of total Copaxone prescriptions in the United States."[60] Copaxone accounts for about fifty percent of "Teva's profit and 20 percent of revenue."[60] Competitors' Glatopa, 20 mg version of Copaxone, is taken once a day.[60]
In June 2006, Teva received from the FDA a 180-day exclusivity period to sell simvastatin (Zocor) in the U.S. as a generic drug in all strengths except 80 mg. Teva presently[when?] competes with the maker of brand-name Zocor, Merck & Co.; Ranbaxy Laboratories, which has 180-day exclusivity for the 80 mg strength; and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, whose authorized generic version (licensed by Merck) is exempt from exclusivity.
In June 2010, the company announced it would discontinue its production of propofol, a major sedative estimated to be used in 75% of all US anesthetic procedures.[61]
In March 2015 Teva sold four anti-cancer compounds to Ignyta Inc. for $41.6 million. As part of the deal Teva sold the following compounds which were then renamed:[62]

CEP-32496 (renamed RXDX-105) a small molecule inhibitor of BRAF, EGFR and RET, now in Phase I/II trials
CEP-40783 (renamed RXDX-106) a small molecule inhibitor of AXL and c-Met in preclinical development
CEP-40125 (renamed RXDX-107) a nanoformulation of a modified bendamustine with potenital activity in solid tumours. Bendamustine Rapid Infusion as therapy for CLL and NHL is part of Teva's specialty drugs pipeline.[59]
TEV-44229 (renamed RXDX-108) a potent inhibitor of the kinase PKCiota

Legal issues[edit]
On June 25, 2010, Bayer sued Teva for falsely claiming that Gianvi, Teva's Generic of Yaz, was "stabilized by betadex as a clathrate."[63] The lawsuit stems from Bayer's US patent, 5798338, on the binding and preservative agents that were not in fact present in Gianvi. "In the preparation of such low-dosed dosage forms, strong fluctuations of the active ingredient concentrations in the dosage units occur almost unavoidably (inadequate content uniformity), which manifest themselves more strongly, the smaller the amount of the active ingredient. It has now been found that the drawbacks that are observed especially in the preparation and storage of dosage forms which contain low-dosed steroidal sex hormones can be avoided, at least to a large extent, if dosage forms are prepared that contain powdery cyclodextrin clathrates of these active ingredients."[64] The settlement of the lawsuit resulted in Teva changing its product marketing to remove the claim that it used the same ingredients as Yaz.[65][dead link] Bayer's patent is on a method specifically designed to prevent oxidative degradation of the estrogen.
In January 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided on the Copaxone patent in Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc..[66]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Teva Pharmaceutical of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[67]

History[edit]




Worker at Assia plant in the 1930s






Teva plant, Har Hotzvim, Jerusalem






Teva in Markham, Ontario


Teva's earliest predecessor was Salomon, Levin, and Elstein Ltd., a wholesale distributor based in Palestine that was founded in 1901, and used camels to make deliveries.[5] During the 1930s, new immigrants from Europe founded several pharmaceutical companies including Teva ("Nature" in Hebrew), Assia, and Zori. In 1951, Teva raised capital through the newly founded Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange after the formation of the new country, Israel.[citation needed]
In 1964, Assia and Zori merged and acquired a controlling interest in Teva. In 1976, these three companies merged into the modern-day Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. In 1980, Teva continued to follow its vision of becoming one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies by acquiring Ikapharm, then Israel's second largest drug manufacturer.[6]
In 1982, Teva was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Kfar Saba manufacturing plant, an essential milestone for marketing pharmaceuticals in the US.[citation needed]
In 2005, Teva opened a new, state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Har Hotzvim, a technology park in Jerusalem. The plant received FDA approval in early 2007.[7] Teva entered the Japanese market in 2005, and in 2008 established a generics joint venture with Kowa.[8]
In 2008, sales totalled $11.08 billion, $13.9 billion in 2009, and in 2010 total sales rose to $16.1 billion, of which a major portion was in Europe and North America. Teva acquired its U.S. rival Ivax Corporation in January 2006,[9][10] Barr in 2007 and Ratiopharm in 2010.
In 2010, Teva announced that it would build its main distribution center for the Americas in Philadelphia, PA, and was considering opening its US headquarters in the area.[7]
In 2010, it had 39,660 employees. In Israel, the number of workers rose 7.5% by 6,774.[11] In March 2010, Teva acquired German-based company Ratiopharm in a deal worth almost $5 billion, significantly expanding its European coverage.[12][13][14] In October 2010, Teva entered a licensing agreement with BioTime to develop and market BioTime's OpRegen for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration,[15] an effort that in 2013 received $1.5 billion in funding from Israel's Office of the Chief Scientist.[16] In May 2011 Teva announced it would purchase Cephalon for US$6.8 billion, to help expand its presence in the proprietary pharmaceuticals sector.[citation needed]
Teva Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (TAPI) operates within Teva as a stand-alone business unit. As well as providing for Teva's own needs, the TAPI division is an active competitor in world markets. In 2009, TAPI's sales to third parties totaled $565 million, and in 2010 sales rose by 13% to a total of $641 million.[citation needed]
In July 2017, it was reported that Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca since 2012, would become the next CEO of Teva, succeeding Erez Vigodman.[17][18]

Yitzhak Peterburg
February 2017 to present day
Peterburg held the position of Chairman since 2015. He was appointed as Interim President and CEO in 2017 succeeding Erez Vigodman. Since Israeli law does not permit the same individual to serve as CEO and Chairman, Sol J Barer took over as the Chairman of the board in February 2017.[29]


Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
1980 to 1999[edit]
In 1980, Teva acquired Plantex.[30]
2000 to 2009[edit]
In 2000 Teva acquired Canada-based Novopharm.[31] In January 2006, Teva said it had completed the acquisition of IVAX Corporation for around $7.4 billion.[32] The acquisition price was $7.4 billion.[33] On December 23, 2008, Teva acquired Barr Pharmaceuticals for $7.5 billion, making Barr and Pliva (which Barr bought earlier) part of Teva.[34]
2010 onwards[edit]
On March 18, 2010, Teva said it planned to acquire German generic Ratiopharm for US$5 billion. The deal was completed in August 2010.[7] In May 2011, Teva bought Cephalon for US$6.8 billion.[35] The same month, Teva announced the ¥40 billion purchase of a majority stake in Japanese generic drug company Taiyo Pharmaceutical Industry, a move to secure a Japan-local production facility.[8] Teva completed the $934 million acquisition on July 2011.[36] In June 2013 Teva acquired US firm MicroDose for $40 million with as much as $125 million being paid in regulatory and developmental milestones [37] In January 2014, Teva acquired NuPathe, after outbidding Endo, for $144 million.[38] In June 2014, Teva acquired Labrys Biologics for up to $825 million,[39] the aim being to strengthen the company's migraine pipeline through addition of LBR-101, an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody therapeutic.[28] In March 2015, Teva acquired Auspex Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion growing its CNS portfolio.[40] In April, Teva offered to acquire Mylan for $40 billion,[41] only a fortnight after Mylan offered to buy Perrigo for $29 billion.[42] Teva's offer for Mylan was contingent on Mylan abandoning its pursuit of Perrigo.[43] Mylan stated in June 2015 that Teva’s disclosure that it had a 1.35 percent stake in Mylan violated US anti-trust rules.[44] In October, the company acquired Mexico-based Representaciones e Investigaciones Medicas (Rimsa) for around $2.3 billion.[45] In the same month Teva acquired Gecko Health Innovations.[46] In November 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Heptares Therapeutics with its work on small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists for migraine treatment, with the deal generating up to $410 million.[47]
Actavis Generics[edit]
Main article: Actavis
In July 2015, Allergan agreed to sell its generic drug business (Actavis Generics[48]) to Teva for $40.5 billion[49][50][51] ($33.75 billion in cash and $6.75 billion worth of shares).[52] As a result, Teva dropped its pursuit of Mylan. In order for the deal to gain regulatory approval, Teva sold off a number of assets, including a portfolio of five generic drugs to Sagent Pharmaceuticals for $40 million, as well as a further eight medicines to Dr. Reddy’s in a $350 million deal.[48] Teva also sold a further 15 marketed generics, as well as three others which were close to market, for $586 million to Impax Laboratories.[53][54] In July, Teva sold off a further 42 products to Australian generics company, Mayne Pharma, for $652 million; the deal moved Mayne up 50 spots, into the top-25 companies of US generic companies.[55] As part of the deal Teva will seek to raise $20 to $25 billion[56] through a bond sale.[57]
After completing the $39 billion acquisition of Actavis Generics, Teva announced another, smaller, deal with Allergan, agreeing to acquire its generic distribution business Anda for $500 million.[58]

Research and development[edit]




Copaxone, a Teva patented drug


Teva holds patents on multiple drugs, including: Copaxone, a specialty drug[59] (for the treatment of multiple sclerosis), now the world's best selling MS drug,[60] and Azilect (sold as Agilect in some countries) for treatment of Parkinson's disease. By July 2015 Copaxone held a "31.2 percent shares of total MS prescriptions in the United States."[60] Teva's new 40 mg version of Copaxone taken three times a week "accounted for 68.5 percent of total Copaxone prescriptions in the United States."[60] Copaxone accounts for about fifty percent of "Teva's profit and 20 percent of revenue."[60] Competitors' Glatopa, 20 mg version of Copaxone, is taken once a day.[60]
In June 2006, Teva received from the FDA a 180-day exclusivity period to sell simvastatin (Zocor) in the U.S. as a generic drug in all strengths except 80 mg. Teva presently[when?] competes with the maker of brand-name Zocor, Merck & Co.; Ranbaxy Laboratories, which has 180-day exclusivity for the 80 mg strength; and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, whose authorized generic version (licensed by Merck) is exempt from exclusivity.
In June 2010, the company announced it would discontinue its production of propofol, a major sedative estimated to be used in 75% of all US anesthetic procedures.[61]
In March 2015 Teva sold four anti-cancer compounds to Ignyta Inc. for $41.6 million. As part of the deal Teva sold the following compounds which were then renamed:[62]

CEP-32496 (renamed RXDX-105) a small molecule inhibitor of BRAF, EGFR and RET, now in Phase I/II trials
CEP-40783 (renamed RXDX-106) a small molecule inhibitor of AXL and c-Met in preclinical development
CEP-40125 (renamed RXDX-107) a nanoformulation of a modified bendamustine with potenital activity in solid tumours. Bendamustine Rapid Infusion as therapy for CLL and NHL is part of Teva's specialty drugs pipeline.[59]
TEV-44229 (renamed RXDX-108) a potent inhibitor of the kinase PKCiota

Legal issues[edit]
On June 25, 2010, Bayer sued Teva for falsely claiming that Gianvi, Teva's Generic of Yaz, was "stabilized by betadex as a clathrate."[63] The lawsuit stems from Bayer's US patent, 5798338, on the binding and preservative agents that were not in fact present in Gianvi. "In the preparation of such low-dosed dosage forms, strong fluctuations of the active ingredient concentrations in the dosage units occur almost unavoidably (inadequate content uniformity), which manifest themselves more strongly, the smaller the amount of the active ingredient. It has now been found that the drawbacks that are observed especially in the preparation and storage of dosage forms which contain low-dosed steroidal sex hormones can be avoided, at least to a large extent, if dosage forms are prepared that contain powdery cyclodextrin clathrates of these active ingredients."[64] The settlement of the lawsuit resulted in Teva changing its product marketing to remove the claim that it used the same ingredients as Yaz.[65][dead link] Bayer's patent is on a method specifically designed to prevent oxidative degradation of the estrogen.
In January 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided on the Copaxone patent in Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc..[66]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Teva Pharmaceutical of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[67]

History[edit]




Worker at Assia plant in the 1930s






Teva plant, Har Hotzvim, Jerusalem






Teva in Markham, Ontario


Teva's earliest predecessor was Salomon, Levin, and Elstein Ltd., a wholesale distributor based in Palestine that was founded in 1901, and used camels to make deliveries.[5] During the 1930s, new immigrants from Europe founded several pharmaceutical companies including Teva ("Nature" in Hebrew), Assia, and Zori. In 1951, Teva raised capital through the newly founded Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange after the formation of the new country, Israel.[citation needed]
In 1964, Assia and Zori merged and acquired a controlling interest in Teva. In 1976, these three companies merged into the modern-day Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. In 1980, Teva continued to follow its vision of becoming one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies by acquiring Ikapharm, then Israel's second largest drug manufacturer.[6]
In 1982, Teva was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Kfar Saba manufacturing plant, an essential milestone for marketing pharmaceuticals in the US.[citation needed]
In 2005, Teva opened a new, state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Har Hotzvim, a technology park in Jerusalem. The plant received FDA approval in early 2007.[7] Teva entered the Japanese market in 2005, and in 2008 established a generics joint venture with Kowa.[8]
In 2008, sales totalled $11.08 billion, $13.9 billion in 2009, and in 2010 total sales rose to $16.1 billion, of which a major portion was in Europe and North America. Teva acquired its U.S. rival Ivax Corporation in January 2006,[9][10] Barr in 2007 and Ratiopharm in 2010.
In 2010, Teva announced that it would build its main distribution center for the Americas in Philadelphia, PA, and was considering opening its US headquarters in the area.[7]
In 2010, it had 39,660 employees. In Israel, the number of workers rose 7.5% by 6,774.[11] In March 2010, Teva acquired German-based company Ratiopharm in a deal worth almost $5 billion, significantly expanding its European coverage.[12][13][14] In October 2010, Teva entered a licensing agreement with BioTime to develop and market BioTime's OpRegen for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration,[15] an effort that in 2013 received $1.5 billion in funding from Israel's Office of the Chief Scientist.[16] In May 2011 Teva announced it would purchase Cephalon for US$6.8 billion, to help expand its presence in the proprietary pharmaceuticals sector.[citation needed]
Teva Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (TAPI) operates within Teva as a stand-alone business unit. As well as providing for Teva's own needs, the TAPI division is an active competitor in world markets. In 2009, TAPI's sales to third parties totaled $565 million, and in 2010 sales rose by 13% to a total of $641 million.[citation needed]
In July 2017, it was reported that Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca since 2012, would become the next CEO of Teva, succeeding Erez Vigodman.[17][18]

Desheh returned to previous position of chief financial officer.[25][26][27] Vigodman served as the CEO of Makhteshim Agan until joining Teva, and was President and CEO of Strauss Group prior to this.[27] From 2014, Michael Hayden served as Teva's chief scientific officer and president of the company's global research and development.[28]


Yitzhak Peterburg
February 2017 to present day
Peterburg held the position of Chairman since 2015. He was appointed as Interim President and CEO in 2017 succeeding Erez Vigodman. Since Israeli law does not permit the same individual to serve as CEO and Chairman, Sol J Barer took over as the Chairman of the board in February 2017.[29]


Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
1980 to 1999[edit]
In 1980, Teva acquired Plantex.[30]
2000 to 2009[edit]
In 2000 Teva acquired Canada-based Novopharm.[31] In January 2006, Teva said it had completed the acquisition of IVAX Corporation for around $7.4 billion.[32] The acquisition price was $7.4 billion.[33] On December 23, 2008, Teva acquired Barr Pharmaceuticals for $7.5 billion, making Barr and Pliva (which Barr bought earlier) part of Teva.[34]
2010 onwards[edit]
On March 18, 2010, Teva said it planned to acquire German generic Ratiopharm for US$5 billion. The deal was completed in August 2010.[7] In May 2011, Teva bought Cephalon for US$6.8 billion.[35] The same month, Teva announced the ¥40 billion purchase of a majority stake in Japanese generic drug company Taiyo Pharmaceutical Industry, a move to secure a Japan-local production facility.[8] Teva completed the $934 million acquisition on July 2011.[36] In June 2013 Teva acquired US firm MicroDose for $40 million with as much as $125 million being paid in regulatory and developmental milestones [37] In January 2014, Teva acquired NuPathe, after outbidding Endo, for $144 million.[38] In June 2014, Teva acquired Labrys Biologics for up to $825 million,[39] the aim being to strengthen the company's migraine pipeline through addition of LBR-101, an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody therapeutic.[28] In March 2015, Teva acquired Auspex Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion growing its CNS portfolio.[40] In April, Teva offered to acquire Mylan for $40 billion,[41] only a fortnight after Mylan offered to buy Perrigo for $29 billion.[42] Teva's offer for Mylan was contingent on Mylan abandoning its pursuit of Perrigo.[43] Mylan stated in June 2015 that Teva’s disclosure that it had a 1.35 percent stake in Mylan violated US anti-trust rules.[44] In October, the company acquired Mexico-based Representaciones e Investigaciones Medicas (Rimsa) for around $2.3 billion.[45] In the same month Teva acquired Gecko Health Innovations.[46] In November 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Heptares Therapeutics with its work on small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists for migraine treatment, with the deal generating up to $410 million.[47]
Actavis Generics[edit]
Main article: Actavis
In July 2015, Allergan agreed to sell its generic drug business (Actavis Generics[48]) to Teva for $40.5 billion[49][50][51] ($33.75 billion in cash and $6.75 billion worth of shares).[52] As a result, Teva dropped its pursuit of Mylan. In order for the deal to gain regulatory approval, Teva sold off a number of assets, including a portfolio of five generic drugs to Sagent Pharmaceuticals for $40 million, as well as a further eight medicines to Dr. Reddy’s in a $350 million deal.[48] Teva also sold a further 15 marketed generics, as well as three others which were close to market, for $586 million to Impax Laboratories.[53][54] In July, Teva sold off a further 42 products to Australian generics company, Mayne Pharma, for $652 million; the deal moved Mayne up 50 spots, into the top-25 companies of US generic companies.[55] As part of the deal Teva will seek to raise $20 to $25 billion[56] through a bond sale.[57]
After completing the $39 billion acquisition of Actavis Generics, Teva announced another, smaller, deal with Allergan, agreeing to acquire its generic distribution business Anda for $500 million.[58]

Research and development[edit]




Copaxone, a Teva patented drug


Teva holds patents on multiple drugs, including: Copaxone, a specialty drug[59] (for the treatment of multiple sclerosis), now the world's best selling MS drug,[60] and Azilect (sold as Agilect in some countries) for treatment of Parkinson's disease. By July 2015 Copaxone held a "31.2 percent shares of total MS prescriptions in the United States."[60] Teva's new 40 mg version of Copaxone taken three times a week "accounted for 68.5 percent of total Copaxone prescriptions in the United States."[60] Copaxone accounts for about fifty percent of "Teva's profit and 20 percent of revenue."[60] Competitors' Glatopa, 20 mg version of Copaxone, is taken once a day.[60]
In June 2006, Teva received from the FDA a 180-day exclusivity period to sell simvastatin (Zocor) in the U.S. as a generic drug in all strengths except 80 mg. Teva presently[when?] competes with the maker of brand-name Zocor, Merck & Co.; Ranbaxy Laboratories, which has 180-day exclusivity for the 80 mg strength; and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, whose authorized generic version (licensed by Merck) is exempt from exclusivity.
In June 2010, the company announced it would discontinue its production of propofol, a major sedative estimated to be used in 75% of all US anesthetic procedures.[61]
In March 2015 Teva sold four anti-cancer compounds to Ignyta Inc. for $41.6 million. As part of the deal Teva sold the following compounds which were then renamed:[62]

CEP-32496 (renamed RXDX-105) a small molecule inhibitor of BRAF, EGFR and RET, now in Phase I/II trials
CEP-40783 (renamed RXDX-106) a small molecule inhibitor of AXL and c-Met in preclinical development
CEP-40125 (renamed RXDX-107) a nanoformulation of a modified bendamustine with potenital activity in solid tumours. Bendamustine Rapid Infusion as therapy for CLL and NHL is part of Teva's specialty drugs pipeline.[59]
TEV-44229 (renamed RXDX-108) a potent inhibitor of the kinase PKCiota

Legal issues[edit]
On June 25, 2010, Bayer sued Teva for falsely claiming that Gianvi, Teva's Generic of Yaz, was "stabilized by betadex as a clathrate."[63] The lawsuit stems from Bayer's US patent, 5798338, on the binding and preservative agents that were not in fact present in Gianvi. "In the preparation of such low-dosed dosage forms, strong fluctuations of the active ingredient concentrations in the dosage units occur almost unavoidably (inadequate content uniformity), which manifest themselves more strongly, the smaller the amount of the active ingredient. It has now been found that the drawbacks that are observed especially in the preparation and storage of dosage forms which contain low-dosed steroidal sex hormones can be avoided, at least to a large extent, if dosage forms are prepared that contain powdery cyclodextrin clathrates of these active ingredients."[64] The settlement of the lawsuit resulted in Teva changing its product marketing to remove the claim that it used the same ingredients as Yaz.[65][dead link] Bayer's patent is on a method specifically designed to prevent oxidative degradation of the estrogen.
In January 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided on the Copaxone patent in Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc..[66]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Teva Pharmaceutical of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[67]

History[edit]




Worker at Assia plant in the 1930s






Teva plant, Har Hotzvim, Jerusalem






Teva in Markham, Ontario


Teva's earliest predecessor was Salomon, Levin, and Elstein Ltd., a wholesale distributor based in Palestine that was founded in 1901, and used camels to make deliveries.[5] During the 1930s, new immigrants from Europe founded several pharmaceutical companies including Teva ("Nature" in Hebrew), Assia, and Zori. In 1951, Teva raised capital through the newly founded Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange after the formation of the new country, Israel.[citation needed]
In 1964, Assia and Zori merged and acquired a controlling interest in Teva. In 1976, these three companies merged into the modern-day Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. In 1980, Teva continued to follow its vision of becoming one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies by acquiring Ikapharm, then Israel's second largest drug manufacturer.[6]
In 1982, Teva was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Kfar Saba manufacturing plant, an essential milestone for marketing pharmaceuticals in the US.[citation needed]
In 2005, Teva opened a new, state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Har Hotzvim, a technology park in Jerusalem. The plant received FDA approval in early 2007.[7] Teva entered the Japanese market in 2005, and in 2008 established a generics joint venture with Kowa.[8]
In 2008, sales totalled $11.08 billion, $13.9 billion in 2009, and in 2010 total sales rose to $16.1 billion, of which a major portion was in Europe and North America. Teva acquired its U.S. rival Ivax Corporation in January 2006,[9][10] Barr in 2007 and Ratiopharm in 2010.
In 2010, Teva announced that it would build its main distribution center for the Americas in Philadelphia, PA, and was considering opening its US headquarters in the area.[7]
In 2010, it had 39,660 employees. In Israel, the number of workers rose 7.5% by 6,774.[11] In March 2010, Teva acquired German-based company Ratiopharm in a deal worth almost $5 billion, significantly expanding its European coverage.[12][13][14] In October 2010, Teva entered a licensing agreement with BioTime to develop and market BioTime's OpRegen for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration,[15] an effort that in 2013 received $1.5 billion in funding from Israel's Office of the Chief Scientist.[16] In May 2011 Teva announced it would purchase Cephalon for US$6.8 billion, to help expand its presence in the proprietary pharmaceuticals sector.[citation needed]
Teva Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (TAPI) operates within Teva as a stand-alone business unit. As well as providing for Teva's own needs, the TAPI division is an active competitor in world markets. In 2009, TAPI's sales to third parties totaled $565 million, and in 2010 sales rose by 13% to a total of $641 million.[citation needed]
In July 2017, it was reported that Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca since 2012, would become the next CEO of Teva, succeeding Erez Vigodman.[17][18]

In 2000 Teva acquired Canada-based Novopharm.[31] In January 2006, Teva said it had completed the acquisition of IVAX Corporation for around $7.4 billion.[32] The acquisition price was $7.4 billion.[33] On December 23, 2008, Teva acquired Barr Pharmaceuticals for $7.5 billion, making Barr and Pliva (which Barr bought earlier) part of Teva.[34]
2010 onwards[edit]
On March 18, 2010, Teva said it planned to acquire German generic Ratiopharm for US$5 billion. The deal was completed in August 2010.[7] In May 2011, Teva bought Cephalon for US$6.8 billion.[35] The same month, Teva announced the ¥40 billion purchase of a majority stake in Japanese generic drug company Taiyo Pharmaceutical Industry, a move to secure a Japan-local production facility.[8] Teva completed the $934 million acquisition on July 2011.[36] In June 2013 Teva acquired US firm MicroDose for $40 million with as much as $125 million being paid in regulatory and developmental milestones [37] In January 2014, Teva acquired NuPathe, after outbidding Endo, for $144 million.[38] In June 2014, Teva acquired Labrys Biologics for up to $825 million,[39] the aim being to strengthen the company's migraine pipeline through addition of LBR-101, an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody therapeutic.[28] In March 2015, Teva acquired Auspex Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion growing its CNS portfolio.[40] In April, Teva offered to acquire Mylan for $40 billion,[41] only a fortnight after Mylan offered to buy Perrigo for $29 billion.[42] Teva's offer for Mylan was contingent on Mylan abandoning its pursuit of Perrigo.[43] Mylan stated in June 2015 that Teva’s disclosure that it had a 1.35 percent stake in Mylan violated US anti-trust rules.[44] In October, the company acquired Mexico-based Representaciones e Investigaciones Medicas (Rimsa) for around $2.3 billion.[45] In the same month Teva acquired Gecko Health Innovations.[46] In November 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Heptares Therapeutics with its work on small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists for migraine treatment, with the deal generating up to $410 million.[47]
Actavis Generics[edit]
Main article: Actavis
In July 2015, Allergan agreed to sell its generic drug business (Actavis Generics[48]) to Teva for $40.5 billion[49][50][51] ($33.75 billion in cash and $6.75 billion worth of shares).[52] As a result, Teva dropped its pursuit of Mylan. In order for the deal to gain regulatory approval, Teva sold off a number of assets, including a portfolio of five generic drugs to Sagent Pharmaceuticals for $40 million, as well as a further eight medicines to Dr. Reddy’s in a $350 million deal.[48] Teva also sold a further 15 marketed generics, as well as three others which were close to market, for $586 million to Impax Laboratories.[53][54] In July, Teva sold off a further 42 products to Australian generics company, Mayne Pharma, for $652 million; the deal moved Mayne up 50 spots, into the top-25 companies of US generic companies.[55] As part of the deal Teva will seek to raise $20 to $25 billion[56] through a bond sale.[57]
After completing the $39 billion acquisition of Actavis Generics, Teva announced another, smaller, deal with Allergan, agreeing to acquire its generic distribution business Anda for $500 million.[58]

Research and development[edit]




Copaxone, a Teva patented drug


Teva holds patents on multiple drugs, including: Copaxone, a specialty drug[59] (for the treatment of multiple sclerosis), now the world's best selling MS drug,[60] and Azilect (sold as Agilect in some countries) for treatment of Parkinson's disease. By July 2015 Copaxone held a "31.2 percent shares of total MS prescriptions in the United States."[60] Teva's new 40 mg version of Copaxone taken three times a week "accounted for 68.5 percent of total Copaxone prescriptions in the United States."[60] Copaxone accounts for about fifty percent of "Teva's profit and 20 percent of revenue."[60] Competitors' Glatopa, 20 mg version of Copaxone, is taken once a day.[60]
In June 2006, Teva received from the FDA a 180-day exclusivity period to sell simvastatin (Zocor) in the U.S. as a generic drug in all strengths except 80 mg. Teva presently[when?] competes with the maker of brand-name Zocor, Merck & Co.; Ranbaxy Laboratories, which has 180-day exclusivity for the 80 mg strength; and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, whose authorized generic version (licensed by Merck) is exempt from exclusivity.
In June 2010, the company announced it would discontinue its production of propofol, a major sedative estimated to be used in 75% of all US anesthetic procedures.[61]
In March 2015 Teva sold four anti-cancer compounds to Ignyta Inc. for $41.6 million. As part of the deal Teva sold the following compounds which were then renamed:[62]

CEP-32496 (renamed RXDX-105) a small molecule inhibitor of BRAF, EGFR and RET, now in Phase I/II trials
CEP-40783 (renamed RXDX-106) a small molecule inhibitor of AXL and c-Met in preclinical development
CEP-40125 (renamed RXDX-107) a nanoformulation of a modified bendamustine with potenital activity in solid tumours. Bendamustine Rapid Infusion as therapy for CLL and NHL is part of Teva's specialty drugs pipeline.[59]
TEV-44229 (renamed RXDX-108) a potent inhibitor of the kinase PKCiota

Legal issues[edit]
On June 25, 2010, Bayer sued Teva for falsely claiming that Gianvi, Teva's Generic of Yaz, was "stabilized by betadex as a clathrate."[63] The lawsuit stems from Bayer's US patent, 5798338, on the binding and preservative agents that were not in fact present in Gianvi. "In the preparation of such low-dosed dosage forms, strong fluctuations of the active ingredient concentrations in the dosage units occur almost unavoidably (inadequate content uniformity), which manifest themselves more strongly, the smaller the amount of the active ingredient. It has now been found that the drawbacks that are observed especially in the preparation and storage of dosage forms which contain low-dosed steroidal sex hormones can be avoided, at least to a large extent, if dosage forms are prepared that contain powdery cyclodextrin clathrates of these active ingredients."[64] The settlement of the lawsuit resulted in Teva changing its product marketing to remove the claim that it used the same ingredients as Yaz.[65][dead link] Bayer's patent is on a method specifically designed to prevent oxidative degradation of the estrogen.
In January 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided on the Copaxone patent in Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc..[66]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Teva Pharmaceutical of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[67]

Teva's earliest predecessor was Salomon, Levin, and Elstein Ltd., a wholesale distributor based in Palestine that was founded in 1901, and used camels to make deliveries.[5] During the 1930s, new immigrants from Europe founded several pharmaceutical companies including Teva ("Nature" in Hebrew), Assia, and Zori. In 1951, Teva raised capital through the newly founded Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange after the formation of the new country, Israel.[citation needed]
In 1964, Assia and Zori merged and acquired a controlling interest in Teva. In 1976, these three companies merged into the modern-day Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. In 1980, Teva continued to follow its vision of becoming one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies by acquiring Ikapharm, then Israel's second largest drug manufacturer.[6]
In 1982, Teva was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Kfar Saba manufacturing plant, an essential milestone for marketing pharmaceuticals in the US.[citation needed]
In 2005, Teva opened a new, state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Har Hotzvim, a technology park in Jerusalem. The plant received FDA approval in early 2007.[7] Teva entered the Japanese market in 2005, and in 2008 established a generics joint venture with Kowa.[8]
In 2008, sales totalled $11.08 billion, $13.9 billion in 2009, and in 2010 total sales rose to $16.1 billion, of which a major portion was in Europe and North America. Teva acquired its U.S. rival Ivax Corporation in January 2006,[9][10] Barr in 2007 and Ratiopharm in 2010.
In 2010, Teva announced that it would build its main distribution center for the Americas in Philadelphia, PA, and was considering opening its US headquarters in the area.[7]
In 2010, it had 39,660 employees. In Israel, the number of workers rose 7.5% by 6,774.[11] In March 2010, Teva acquired German-based company Ratiopharm in a deal worth almost $5 billion, significantly expanding its European coverage.[12][13][14] In October 2010, Teva entered a licensing agreement with BioTime to develop and market BioTime's OpRegen for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration,[15] an effort that in 2013 received $1.5 billion in funding from Israel's Office of the Chief Scientist.[16] In May 2011 Teva announced it would purchase Cephalon for US$6.8 billion, to help expand its presence in the proprietary pharmaceuticals sector.[citation needed]
Teva Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (TAPI) operates within Teva as a stand-alone business unit. As well as providing for Teva's own needs, the TAPI division is an active competitor in world markets. In 2009, TAPI's sales to third parties totaled $565 million, and in 2010 sales rose by 13% to a total of $641 million.[citation needed]
In July 2017, it was reported that Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca since 2012, would become the next CEO of Teva, succeeding Erez Vigodman.[17][18]

Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
1980 to 1999[edit]
In 1980, Teva acquired Plantex.[30]
2000 to 2009[edit]
In 2000 Teva acquired Canada-based Novopharm.[31] In January 2006, Teva said it had completed the acquisition of IVAX Corporation for around $7.4 billion.[32] The acquisition price was $7.4 billion.[33] On December 23, 2008, Teva acquired Barr Pharmaceuticals for $7.5 billion, making Barr and Pliva (which Barr bought earlier) part of Teva.[34]
2010 onwards[edit]
On March 18, 2010, Teva said it planned to acquire German generic Ratiopharm for US$5 billion. The deal was completed in August 2010.[7] In May 2011, Teva bought Cephalon for US$6.8 billion.[35] The same month, Teva announced the ¥40 billion purchase of a majority stake in Japanese generic drug company Taiyo Pharmaceutical Industry, a move to secure a Japan-local production facility.[8] Teva completed the $934 million acquisition on July 2011.[36] In June 2013 Teva acquired US firm MicroDose for $40 million with as much as $125 million being paid in regulatory and developmental milestones [37] In January 2014, Teva acquired NuPathe, after outbidding Endo, for $144 million.[38] In June 2014, Teva acquired Labrys Biologics for up to $825 million,[39] the aim being to strengthen the company's migraine pipeline through addition of LBR-101, an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody therapeutic.[28] In March 2015, Teva acquired Auspex Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion growing its CNS portfolio.[40] In April, Teva offered to acquire Mylan for $40 billion,[41] only a fortnight after Mylan offered to buy Perrigo for $29 billion.[42] Teva's offer for Mylan was contingent on Mylan abandoning its pursuit of Perrigo.[43] Mylan stated in June 2015 that Teva’s disclosure that it had a 1.35 percent stake in Mylan violated US anti-trust rules.[44] In October, the company acquired Mexico-based Representaciones e Investigaciones Medicas (Rimsa) for around $2.3 billion.[45] In the same month Teva acquired Gecko Health Innovations.[46] In November 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Heptares Therapeutics with its work on small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists for migraine treatment, with the deal generating up to $410 million.[47]
Actavis Generics[edit]
Main article: Actavis
In July 2015, Allergan agreed to sell its generic drug business (Actavis Generics[48]) to Teva for $40.5 billion[49][50][51] ($33.75 billion in cash and $6.75 billion worth of shares).[52] As a result, Teva dropped its pursuit of Mylan. In order for the deal to gain regulatory approval, Teva sold off a number of assets, including a portfolio of five generic drugs to Sagent Pharmaceuticals for $40 million, as well as a further eight medicines to Dr. Reddy’s in a $350 million deal.[48] Teva also sold a further 15 marketed generics, as well as three others which were close to market, for $586 million to Impax Laboratories.[53][54] In July, Teva sold off a further 42 products to Australian generics company, Mayne Pharma, for $652 million; the deal moved Mayne up 50 spots, into the top-25 companies of US generic companies.[55] As part of the deal Teva will seek to raise $20 to $25 billion[56] through a bond sale.[57]
After completing the $39 billion acquisition of Actavis Generics, Teva announced another, smaller, deal with Allergan, agreeing to acquire its generic distribution business Anda for $500 million.[58]

Research and development[edit]




Copaxone, a Teva patented drug


Teva holds patents on multiple drugs, including: Copaxone, a specialty drug[59] (for the treatment of multiple sclerosis), now the world's best selling MS drug,[60] and Azilect (sold as Agilect in some countries) for treatment of Parkinson's disease. By July 2015 Copaxone held a "31.2 percent shares of total MS prescriptions in the United States."[60] Teva's new 40 mg version of Copaxone taken three times a week "accounted for 68.5 percent of total Copaxone prescriptions in the United States."[60] Copaxone accounts for about fifty percent of "Teva's profit and 20 percent of revenue."[60] Competitors' Glatopa, 20 mg version of Copaxone, is taken once a day.[60]
In June 2006, Teva received from the FDA a 180-day exclusivity period to sell simvastatin (Zocor) in the U.S. as a generic drug in all strengths except 80 mg. Teva presently[when?] competes with the maker of brand-name Zocor, Merck & Co.; Ranbaxy Laboratories, which has 180-day exclusivity for the 80 mg strength; and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, whose authorized generic version (licensed by Merck) is exempt from exclusivity.
In June 2010, the company announced it would discontinue its production of propofol, a major sedative estimated to be used in 75% of all US anesthetic procedures.[61]
In March 2015 Teva sold four anti-cancer compounds to Ignyta Inc. for $41.6 million. As part of the deal Teva sold the following compounds which were then renamed:[62]

CEP-32496 (renamed RXDX-105) a small molecule inhibitor of BRAF, EGFR and RET, now in Phase I/II trials
CEP-40783 (renamed RXDX-106) a small molecule inhibitor of AXL and c-Met in preclinical development
CEP-40125 (renamed RXDX-107) a nanoformulation of a modified bendamustine with potenital activity in solid tumours. Bendamustine Rapid Infusion as therapy for CLL and NHL is part of Teva's specialty drugs pipeline.[59]
TEV-44229 (renamed RXDX-108) a potent inhibitor of the kinase PKCiota

Legal issues[edit]
On June 25, 2010, Bayer sued Teva for falsely claiming that Gianvi, Teva's Generic of Yaz, was "stabilized by betadex as a clathrate."[63] The lawsuit stems from Bayer's US patent, 5798338, on the binding and preservative agents that were not in fact present in Gianvi. "In the preparation of such low-dosed dosage forms, strong fluctuations of the active ingredient concentrations in the dosage units occur almost unavoidably (inadequate content uniformity), which manifest themselves more strongly, the smaller the amount of the active ingredient. It has now been found that the drawbacks that are observed especially in the preparation and storage of dosage forms which contain low-dosed steroidal sex hormones can be avoided, at least to a large extent, if dosage forms are prepared that contain powdery cyclodextrin clathrates of these active ingredients."[64] The settlement of the lawsuit resulted in Teva changing its product marketing to remove the claim that it used the same ingredients as Yaz.[65][dead link] Bayer's patent is on a method specifically designed to prevent oxidative degradation of the estrogen.
In January 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided on the Copaxone patent in Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc..[66]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Teva Pharmaceutical of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[67]

History[edit]




Worker at Assia plant in the 1930s






Teva plant, Har Hotzvim, Jerusalem






Teva in Markham, Ontario


Teva's earliest predecessor was Salomon, Levin, and Elstein Ltd., a wholesale distributor based in Palestine that was founded in 1901, and used camels to make deliveries.[5] During the 1930s, new immigrants from Europe founded several pharmaceutical companies including Teva ("Nature" in Hebrew), Assia, and Zori. In 1951, Teva raised capital through the newly founded Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange after the formation of the new country, Israel.[citation needed]
In 1964, Assia and Zori merged and acquired a controlling interest in Teva. In 1976, these three companies merged into the modern-day Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. In 1980, Teva continued to follow its vision of becoming one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies by acquiring Ikapharm, then Israel's second largest drug manufacturer.[6]
In 1982, Teva was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Kfar Saba manufacturing plant, an essential milestone for marketing pharmaceuticals in the US.[citation needed]
In 2005, Teva opened a new, state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Har Hotzvim, a technology park in Jerusalem. The plant received FDA approval in early 2007.[7] Teva entered the Japanese market in 2005, and in 2008 established a generics joint venture with Kowa.[8]
In 2008, sales totalled $11.08 billion, $13.9 billion in 2009, and in 2010 total sales rose to $16.1 billion, of which a major portion was in Europe and North America. Teva acquired its U.S. rival Ivax Corporation in January 2006,[9][10] Barr in 2007 and Ratiopharm in 2010.
In 2010, Teva announced that it would build its main distribution center for the Americas in Philadelphia, PA, and was considering opening its US headquarters in the area.[7]
In 2010, it had 39,660 employees. In Israel, the number of workers rose 7.5% by 6,774.[11] In March 2010, Teva acquired German-based company Ratiopharm in a deal worth almost $5 billion, significantly expanding its European coverage.[12][13][14] In October 2010, Teva entered a licensing agreement with BioTime to develop and market BioTime's OpRegen for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration,[15] an effort that in 2013 received $1.5 billion in funding from Israel's Office of the Chief Scientist.[16] In May 2011 Teva announced it would purchase Cephalon for US$6.8 billion, to help expand its presence in the proprietary pharmaceuticals sector.[citation needed]
Teva Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (TAPI) operates within Teva as a stand-alone business unit. As well as providing for Teva's own needs, the TAPI division is an active competitor in world markets. In 2009, TAPI's sales to third parties totaled $565 million, and in 2010 sales rose by 13% to a total of $641 million.[citation needed]
In July 2017, it was reported that Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca since 2012, would become the next CEO of Teva, succeeding Erez Vigodman.[17][18]

Yitzhak Peterburg
February 2017 to present day
Peterburg held the position of Chairman since 2015. He was appointed as Interim President and CEO in 2017 succeeding Erez Vigodman. Since Israeli law does not permit the same individual to serve as CEO and Chairman, Sol J Barer took over as the Chairman of the board in February 2017.[29]


Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
1980 to 1999[edit]
In 1980, Teva acquired Plantex.[30]
2000 to 2009[edit]
In 2000 Teva acquired Canada-based Novopharm.[31] In January 2006, Teva said it had completed the acquisition of IVAX Corporation for around $7.4 billion.[32] The acquisition price was $7.4 billion.[33] On December 23, 2008, Teva acquired Barr Pharmaceuticals for $7.5 billion, making Barr and Pliva (which Barr bought earlier) part of Teva.[34]
2010 onwards[edit]
On March 18, 2010, Teva said it planned to acquire German generic Ratiopharm for US$5 billion. The deal was completed in August 2010.[7] In May 2011, Teva bought Cephalon for US$6.8 billion.[35] The same month, Teva announced the ¥40 billion purchase of a majority stake in Japanese generic drug company Taiyo Pharmaceutical Industry, a move to secure a Japan-local production facility.[8] Teva completed the $934 million acquisition on July 2011.[36] In June 2013 Teva acquired US firm MicroDose for $40 million with as much as $125 million being paid in regulatory and developmental milestones [37] In January 2014, Teva acquired NuPathe, after outbidding Endo, for $144 million.[38] In June 2014, Teva acquired Labrys Biologics for up to $825 million,[39] the aim being to strengthen the company's migraine pipeline through addition of LBR-101, an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody therapeutic.[28] In March 2015, Teva acquired Auspex Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion growing its CNS portfolio.[40] In April, Teva offered to acquire Mylan for $40 billion,[41] only a fortnight after Mylan offered to buy Perrigo for $29 billion.[42] Teva's offer for Mylan was contingent on Mylan abandoning its pursuit of Perrigo.[43] Mylan stated in June 2015 that Teva’s disclosure that it had a 1.35 percent stake in Mylan violated US anti-trust rules.[44] In October, the company acquired Mexico-based Representaciones e Investigaciones Medicas (Rimsa) for around $2.3 billion.[45] In the same month Teva acquired Gecko Health Innovations.[46] In November 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Heptares Therapeutics with its work on small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists for migraine treatment, with the deal generating up to $410 million.[47]
Actavis Generics[edit]
Main article: Actavis
In July 2015, Allergan agreed to sell its generic drug business (Actavis Generics[48]) to Teva for $40.5 billion[49][50][51] ($33.75 billion in cash and $6.75 billion worth of shares).[52] As a result, Teva dropped its pursuit of Mylan. In order for the deal to gain regulatory approval, Teva sold off a number of assets, including a portfolio of five generic drugs to Sagent Pharmaceuticals for $40 million, as well as a further eight medicines to Dr. Reddy’s in a $350 million deal.[48] Teva also sold a further 15 marketed generics, as well as three others which were close to market, for $586 million to Impax Laboratories.[53][54] In July, Teva sold off a further 42 products to Australian generics company, Mayne Pharma, for $652 million; the deal moved Mayne up 50 spots, into the top-25 companies of US generic companies.[55] As part of the deal Teva will seek to raise $20 to $25 billion[56] through a bond sale.[57]
After completing the $39 billion acquisition of Actavis Generics, Teva announced another, smaller, deal with Allergan, agreeing to acquire its generic distribution business Anda for $500 million.[58]

Research and development[edit]




Copaxone, a Teva patented drug


Teva holds patents on multiple drugs, including: Copaxone, a specialty drug[59] (for the treatment of multiple sclerosis), now the world's best selling MS drug,[60] and Azilect (sold as Agilect in some countries) for treatment of Parkinson's disease. By July 2015 Copaxone held a "31.2 percent shares of total MS prescriptions in the United States."[60] Teva's new 40 mg version of Copaxone taken three times a week "accounted for 68.5 percent of total Copaxone prescriptions in the United States."[60] Copaxone accounts for about fifty percent of "Teva's profit and 20 percent of revenue."[60] Competitors' Glatopa, 20 mg version of Copaxone, is taken once a day.[60]
In June 2006, Teva received from the FDA a 180-day exclusivity period to sell simvastatin (Zocor) in the U.S. as a generic drug in all strengths except 80 mg. Teva presently[when?] competes with the maker of brand-name Zocor, Merck & Co.; Ranbaxy Laboratories, which has 180-day exclusivity for the 80 mg strength; and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, whose authorized generic version (licensed by Merck) is exempt from exclusivity.
In June 2010, the company announced it would discontinue its production of propofol, a major sedative estimated to be used in 75% of all US anesthetic procedures.[61]
In March 2015 Teva sold four anti-cancer compounds to Ignyta Inc. for $41.6 million. As part of the deal Teva sold the following compounds which were then renamed:[62]

CEP-32496 (renamed RXDX-105) a small molecule inhibitor of BRAF, EGFR and RET, now in Phase I/II trials
CEP-40783 (renamed RXDX-106) a small molecule inhibitor of AXL and c-Met in preclinical development
CEP-40125 (renamed RXDX-107) a nanoformulation of a modified bendamustine with potenital activity in solid tumours. Bendamustine Rapid Infusion as therapy for CLL and NHL is part of Teva's specialty drugs pipeline.[59]
TEV-44229 (renamed RXDX-108) a potent inhibitor of the kinase PKCiota

Legal issues[edit]
On June 25, 2010, Bayer sued Teva for falsely claiming that Gianvi, Teva's Generic of Yaz, was "stabilized by betadex as a clathrate."[63] The lawsuit stems from Bayer's US patent, 5798338, on the binding and preservative agents that were not in fact present in Gianvi. "In the preparation of such low-dosed dosage forms, strong fluctuations of the active ingredient concentrations in the dosage units occur almost unavoidably (inadequate content uniformity), which manifest themselves more strongly, the smaller the amount of the active ingredient. It has now been found that the drawbacks that are observed especially in the preparation and storage of dosage forms which contain low-dosed steroidal sex hormones can be avoided, at least to a large extent, if dosage forms are prepared that contain powdery cyclodextrin clathrates of these active ingredients."[64] The settlement of the lawsuit resulted in Teva changing its product marketing to remove the claim that it used the same ingredients as Yaz.[65][dead link] Bayer's patent is on a method specifically designed to prevent oxidative degradation of the estrogen.
In January 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided on the Copaxone patent in Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc..[66]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Teva Pharmaceutical of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[67]

 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (NYSE:TEVA) has unveiled Vagifem’s generic version in the United States. Vagifem, or estradiol vaginal inserts, is an estrogen that is used in treating atrophic vaginitis in women that results from menopause.
“Our expanding portfolio of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies gives women a broader choice of products to manage their health needs cost-effectively. With this addition, patients and healthcare providers who prefer this unique dosage-form now have another, more affordable option for treatment,” Teva’s president and chief executive officer for Global Generic Medicines in North America, Andy Boyer, said.
Largest generics portfolio
With the new generic, the existing portfolio of Teva has now grown to include women’s health products numbering over 70. Overall Teva has a portfolio of close to 600 generic drugs. Teva is thus the pharmaceutical firm with the biggest portfolio of generic products that have been approved in the market. It is also a leader when it comes to first-to-file opportunities as it currently has 100 such opportunities in the United States. In the United States one in every six generic drug prescriptions is a Teva product.
In the first five months of this year sales of estradiol vaginal inserts in the United States were $379 million. The inserts should, however, be used cautiously as they might have adverse effects on some women. In women who use unopposed estrogens for instance the risk of getting endometrial cancer increases. Additionally for women who have only had estrogen-alone therapy, there was an increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and strike as well as dementia in women aged above 65.
Estradiol contraindications
Women who used estrogen therapy combined with progestin also stand a risk of invasive breast cancer, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and stroke. Those women aged over 65 also risk developing dementia.
Estradiol is also contraindicated in women who suffer from a known thrombophilic disorders, known protein S or protein C deficiency, known antithrombin deficiency or a known liver disease or impairment. It is also contraindicated in women with a suspected or known pregnancy.
On Monday shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries fell by 0.52% to close the day at $32.47.

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

  Home  Biotech Stocks  Generic Vagifem Launched In U.S. By Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (NYSE:TEVA)     Biotech Stocks  Generic Vagifem Launched In U.S. By Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (NYSE:TEVA)  ByAdam Russell -July 25, 2017 0  Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter


 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (NYSE:TEVA) has unveiled Vagifem’s generic version in the United States. Vagifem, or estradiol vaginal inserts, is an estrogen that is used in treating atrophic vaginitis in women that results from menopause.
“Our expanding portfolio of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies gives women a broader choice of products to manage their health needs cost-effectively. With this addition, patients and healthcare providers who prefer this unique dosage-form now have another, more affordable option for treatment,” Teva’s president and chief executive officer for Global Generic Medicines in North America, Andy Boyer, said.
Largest generics portfolio
With the new generic, the existing portfolio of Teva has now grown to include women’s health products numbering over 70. Overall Teva has a portfolio of close to 600 generic drugs. Teva is thus the pharmaceutical firm with the biggest portfolio of generic products that have been approved in the market. It is also a leader when it comes to first-to-file opportunities as it currently has 100 such opportunities in the United States. In the United States one in every six generic drug prescriptions is a Teva product.
In the first five months of this year sales of estradiol vaginal inserts in the United States were $379 million. The inserts should, however, be used cautiously as they might have adverse effects on some women. In women who use unopposed estrogens for instance the risk of getting endometrial cancer increases. Additionally for women who have only had estrogen-alone therapy, there was an increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and strike as well as dementia in women aged above 65.
Estradiol contraindications
Women who used estrogen therapy combined with progestin also stand a risk of invasive breast cancer, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and stroke. Those women aged over 65 also risk developing dementia.
Estradiol is also contraindicated in women who suffer from a known thrombophilic disorders, known protein S or protein C deficiency, known antithrombin deficiency or a known liver disease or impairment. It is also contraindicated in women with a suspected or known pregnancy.
On Monday shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries fell by 0.52% to close the day at $32.47.

History[edit]

Teva in Markham, Ontario


Teva's earliest predecessor was Salomon, Levin, and Elstein Ltd., a wholesale distributor based in Palestine that was founded in 1901, and used camels to make deliveries.[5] During the 1930s, new immigrants from Europe founded several pharmaceutical companies including Teva ("Nature" in Hebrew), Assia, and Zori. In 1951, Teva raised capital through the newly founded Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange after the formation of the new country, Israel.[citation needed]
In 1964, Assia and Zori merged and acquired a controlling interest in Teva. In 1976, these three companies merged into the modern-day Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. In 1980, Teva continued to follow its vision of becoming one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies by acquiring Ikapharm, then Israel's second largest drug manufacturer.[6]
In 1982, Teva was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Kfar Saba manufacturing plant, an essential milestone for marketing pharmaceuticals in the US.[citation needed]
In 2005, Teva opened a new, state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Har Hotzvim, a technology park in Jerusalem. The plant received FDA approval in early 2007.[7] Teva entered the Japanese market in 2005, and in 2008 established a generics joint venture with Kowa.[8]
In 2008, sales totalled $11.08 billion, $13.9 billion in 2009, and in 2010 total sales rose to $16.1 billion, of which a major portion was in Europe and North America. Teva acquired its U.S. rival Ivax Corporation in January 2006,[9][10] Barr in 2007 and Ratiopharm in 2010.
In 2010, Teva announced that it would build its main distribution center for the Americas in Philadelphia, PA, and was considering opening its US headquarters in the area.[7]
In 2010, it had 39,660 employees. In Israel, the number of workers rose 7.5% by 6,774.[11] In March 2010, Teva acquired German-based company Ratiopharm in a deal worth almost $5 billion, significantly expanding its European coverage.[12][13][14] In October 2010, Teva entered a licensing agreement with BioTime to develop and market BioTime's OpRegen for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration,[15] an effort that in 2013 received $1.5 billion in funding from Israel's Office of the Chief Scientist.[16] In May 2011 Teva announced it would purchase Cephalon for US$6.8 billion, to help expand its presence in the proprietary pharmaceuticals sector.[citation needed]
Teva Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (TAPI) operates within Teva as a stand-alone business unit. As well as providing for Teva's own needs, the TAPI division is an active competitor in world markets. In 2009, TAPI's sales to third parties totaled $565 million, and in 2010 sales rose by 13% to a total of $641 million.[citation needed]
In July 2017, it was reported that Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca since 2012, would become the next CEO of Teva, succeeding Erez Vigodman.[17][18]

Yitzhak Peterburg
February 2017 to present day
Peterburg held the position of Chairman since 2015. He was appointed as Interim President and CEO in 2017 succeeding Erez Vigodman. Since Israeli law does not permit the same individual to serve as CEO and Chairman, Sol J Barer took over as the Chairman of the board in February 2017.[29]


Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
1980 to 1999[edit]
In 1980, Teva acquired Plantex.[30]
2000 to 2009[edit]
In 2000 Teva acquired Canada-based Novopharm.[31] In January 2006, Teva said it had completed the acquisition of IVAX Corporation for around $7.4 billion.[32] The acquisition price was $7.4 billion.[33] On December 23, 2008, Teva acquired Barr Pharmaceuticals for $7.5 billion, making Barr and Pliva (which Barr bought earlier) part of Teva.[34]
2010 onwards[edit]
On March 18, 2010, Teva said it planned to acquire German generic Ratiopharm for US$5 billion. The deal was completed in August 2010.[7] In May 2011, Teva bought Cephalon for US$6.8 billion.[35] The same month, Teva announced the ¥40 billion purchase of a majority stake in Japanese generic drug company Taiyo Pharmaceutical Industry, a move to secure a Japan-local production facility.[8] Teva completed the $934 million acquisition on July 2011.[36] In June 2013 Teva acquired US firm MicroDose for $40 million with as much as $125 million being paid in regulatory and developmental milestones [37] In January 2014, Teva acquired NuPathe, after outbidding Endo, for $144 million.[38] In June 2014, Teva acquired Labrys Biologics for up to $825 million,[39] the aim being to strengthen the company's migraine pipeline through addition of LBR-101, an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody therapeutic.[28] In March 2015, Teva acquired Auspex Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion growing its CNS portfolio.[40] In April, Teva offered to acquire Mylan for $40 billion,[41] only a fortnight after Mylan offered to buy Perrigo for $29 billion.[42] Teva's offer for Mylan was contingent on Mylan abandoning its pursuit of Perrigo.[43] Mylan stated in June 2015 that Teva’s disclosure that it had a 1.35 percent stake in Mylan violated US anti-trust rules.[44] In October, the company acquired Mexico-based Representaciones e Investigaciones Medicas (Rimsa) for around $2.3 billion.[45] In the same month Teva acquired Gecko Health Innovations.[46] In November 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Heptares Therapeutics with its work on small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists for migraine treatment, with the deal generating up to $410 million.[47]
Actavis Generics[edit]
Main article: Actavis
In July 2015, Allergan agreed to sell its generic drug business (Actavis Generics[48]) to Teva for $40.5 billion[49][50][51] ($33.75 billion in cash and $6.75 billion worth of shares).[52] As a result, Teva dropped its pursuit of Mylan. In order for the deal to gain regulatory approval, Teva sold off a number of assets, including a portfolio of five generic drugs to Sagent Pharmaceuticals for $40 million, as well as a further eight medicines to Dr. Reddy’s in a $350 million deal.[48] Teva also sold a further 15 marketed generics, as well as three others which were close to market, for $586 million to Impax Laboratories.[53][54] In July, Teva sold off a further 42 products to Australian generics company, Mayne Pharma, for $652 million; the deal moved Mayne up 50 spots, into the top-25 companies of US generic companies.[55] As part of the deal Teva will seek to raise $20 to $25 billion[56] through a bond sale.[57]
After completing the $39 billion acquisition of Actavis Generics, Teva announced another, smaller, deal with Allergan, agreeing to acquire its generic distribution business Anda for $500 million.[58]

Research and development[edit]




Copaxone, a Teva patented drug


Teva holds patents on multiple drugs, including: Copaxone, a specialty drug[59] (for the treatment of multiple sclerosis), now the world's best selling MS drug,[60] and Azilect (sold as Agilect in some countries) for treatment of Parkinson's disease. By July 2015 Copaxone held a "31.2 percent shares of total MS prescriptions in the United States."[60] Teva's new 40 mg version of Copaxone taken three times a week "accounted for 68.5 percent of total Copaxone prescriptions in the United States."[60] Copaxone accounts for about fifty percent of "Teva's profit and 20 percent of revenue."[60] Competitors' Glatopa, 20 mg version of Copaxone, is taken once a day.[60]
In June 2006, Teva received from the FDA a 180-day exclusivity period to sell simvastatin (Zocor) in the U.S. as a generic drug in all strengths except 80 mg. Teva presently[when?] competes with the maker of brand-name Zocor, Merck & Co.; Ranbaxy Laboratories, which has 180-day exclusivity for the 80 mg strength; and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, whose authorized generic version (licensed by Merck) is exempt from exclusivity.
In June 2010, the company announced it would discontinue its production of propofol, a major sedative estimated to be used in 75% of all US anesthetic procedures.[61]
In March 2015 Teva sold four anti-cancer compounds to Ignyta Inc. for $41.6 million. As part of the deal Teva sold the following compounds which were then renamed:[62]

CEP-32496 (renamed RXDX-105) a small molecule inhibitor of BRAF, EGFR and RET, now in Phase I/II trials
CEP-40783 (renamed RXDX-106) a small molecule inhibitor of AXL and c-Met in preclinical development
CEP-40125 (renamed RXDX-107) a nanoformulation of a modified bendamustine with potenital activity in solid tumours. Bendamustine Rapid Infusion as therapy for CLL and NHL is part of Teva's specialty drugs pipeline.[59]
TEV-44229 (renamed RXDX-108) a potent inhibitor of the kinase PKCiota

Legal issues[edit]
On June 25, 2010, Bayer sued Teva for falsely claiming that Gianvi, Teva's Generic of Yaz, was "stabilized by betadex as a clathrate."[63] The lawsuit stems from Bayer's US patent, 5798338, on the binding and preservative agents that were not in fact present in Gianvi. "In the preparation of such low-dosed dosage forms, strong fluctuations of the active ingredient concentrations in the dosage units occur almost unavoidably (inadequate content uniformity), which manifest themselves more strongly, the smaller the amount of the active ingredient. It has now been found that the drawbacks that are observed especially in the preparation and storage of dosage forms which contain low-dosed steroidal sex hormones can be avoided, at least to a large extent, if dosage forms are prepared that contain powdery cyclodextrin clathrates of these active ingredients."[64] The settlement of the lawsuit resulted in Teva changing its product marketing to remove the claim that it used the same ingredients as Yaz.[65][dead link] Bayer's patent is on a method specifically designed to prevent oxidative degradation of the estrogen.
In January 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided on the Copaxone patent in Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc..[66]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Teva Pharmaceutical of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[67]

Generic FAQ



Generic FAQ
Go to Parent













Most Read
Central Nervous System (CNS)
                






What are generic drugs?

Generic drugs offer a therapeutic alternative to innovative drugs. They contain the same active ingredients as the original innovative products, and are available in the same strengths and dosage forms as the original.






✉










Why are generic drugs’ names different from the original drugs' names?

Regulators demand that generic drugs be given a different name from the original drugs, in order to avoid confusion. Typically, the generic name of a drug is based on the name of its API, whereas the names given to original drugs are intended for marketing purposes.






✉










Are generic drugs safe?

A generic drug is bioequivalent to the original innovative drug and meets the same quality standards. The active ingredient, the content, the dosage form and the usage of a generic drug are similar to those of an innovative drug. Generic drugs are essentially the same as the original drug, but are offered at a lower price.






✉










What does Bioequivalence mean?

Bioequivalence demonstrates a similar profile of behavior of two products in the human body, in terms of the rate and extent of absorption of the active pharmaceutical ingredient from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to the blood stream. Bioequivalence study is a regulatory requirement and is performed for all generic drugs to ensure their efficiency and the safety.






✉










How do you ensure generic drug safety, having tried it in only a limited number of patients?

The generic product's active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is identical to that of the innovative drug, its purity profile is similar and it is found to be bioequivalent; therefore its safety and efficacy are also comparable.






✉










Why are generic drugs cheaper?

Generic companies are not required to perform lengthy and costly toxicological and clinical studies; therefore, they can offer their products to the public at considerably lower costs.






✉










Does every drug have a generic equivalent?

As long as a drug is protected by patents, a generic alternative can't be launched. Sometimes a generic version is approved and available in a specific country or countries, while unavailable in others. However, with the growing emphasis on generics, multiple generic versions of an innovative drug are often developed around about the time it becomes "off patent". Nonetheless, in some instances, even after a patent has expired there is no generic alternative. This may happen due to cost considerations, in cases of drugs designed for a limited use or requiring complex manufacturing processes.






✉










Does the generic drug look the same as its original equivalent?

Sometimes the generic version of a drug may have a different color or shape from its innovative original, but these changes do not affect the drug's attributes.

When Breathing Doesn’t Come Easy
300 million people globally suffer from asthma, a chronic disease of the lungs characterized by recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing.In the US alone, 30 million people suffer from asthma which accounts for more than 10 million missed school days, and more than 14 million missed work days annually. The economic and societal burden of asthma is immense. Asthma can also be life-threatening, accounting for a quarter of a million deaths annually worldwide.Teva is proud to support programs that offer educational resources for people living with respiratory conditions.According to the WHO, 64 million people have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung ailment characterized by a persistent blockage of airflow from the lungs. More than 3 million people die of COPD each year and the WHO expects COPD to become the world’s third-leading cause of death by 2030. 
A Fresh Approach to Respiratory Care 
Teva is focused on developing and providing treatment options that address two major issues within the current treatment landscape for respiratory diseases: 1) treatment adherence and compliance and 2) treating asthma that remains uncontrolled despite the use of a standard of care therapy.In the treatment of asthma, the goal is to maintain asthma control so people with asthma can maintain good lung function, exhibit fewer symptoms and experience fewer asthma attacks. Teva delivers a range of respiratory medicines today, including controller and rescue therapy. We are also committed to the development of new treatment options. Teva’s focus is on combining our integrated strengths in specialty medicines (including both small molecules and biologics), device platforms and generics. In addition to our currently available medicines, Teva has a broad pipeline of treatment options currently in development with the goal of further enhancing our product offerings and addressing unmet needs within the respiratory community.
Optimizing Respiratory Therapies 
Patients often experience difficulties with the use of their inhalers and incorrect inhaler use can be linked to asthma exacerbations and ineffective control of asthma and COPD. Improper inhaler use can result in acute attacks of asthma or COPD and may increase the utilization of emergency care.Teva has developed a new, breath-actuated, dry-powder inhaler (DPI) device platform to deliver both maintenance and rescue therapies. This dry-powder delivery system is designed to be easier to use than traditional metered-dose inhaler (MDIs). DPIs deliver a dose of medication through breath actuation simply by inhaling. These devices further eliminate the need to coordinate activation of the device with taking a breath – a barrier to effective administration of inhaled medications from traditional MDIs.
