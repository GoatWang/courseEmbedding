What Are We?
A Study in Personal Ontology
Eric T. Olson

Philosophy of Mind

The first general study of the important question of what is the basic maetphysical nature of human people








What Are We?
A Study in Personal Ontology
Eric T. Olson
Philosophy of Mind



Description



From the time of Locke, discussions of personal identity have often ignored the question of our basic metaphysical nature: whether we human people are biological organisms, spatial or temporal parts of organisms, bundles of perceptions, or what have you. The result of this neglect has been centuries of wild proposals and clashing intuitions.What Are We? is the first general study of this important question. It beings by explaining what the question means and how it differs from others, such as questions of personal identity and the mind-body problem. It then examines in some depth the main possible accounts of our metaphysical nature, detailing both their theoretical virtues and the often grave difficulties they face.The book does not endorse any particular account of what we are, but argues that the matter turns on more general issues in the ontology of material things. If composition is universal--if any material things whatever make up something bigger--then we are temporal parts of organisms. If things never compose anything bigger, so that there are only mereological simples, then we too are simples--perhaps the immaterial substances of Descartes--or else we do not exist at all (a view Olson takes very seriously). The intermediate view that some things compose bigger things and others do not leads almost inevitably to the conclusion that we are organisms. So we can discover what we are by working out when composition occurs.

Reviews and Awards


"Olson presents all the serious options on personal ontology, together with the best reasons for and against them. And he shows that each of these options has implications for a wide variety of philosophical topics--not just personal identity over time--and also that those topics have implications for each of these options. What Are We? is clear enough to be of use to the philosophical novice, but sophisticated enough and fair enough to withstand the scrutiny of professional philosophers. For anyone who wants to understand the question "What are we?"--and who wants to see how to begin to answer that question in a principled way--there is to better guide than Olson's book."--Trenton Merricks, Times Literary Supplement
"This is a good book. Its philosophical sophistication and rigor should recommend it to anyone working on the metaphysics of persons, and its scope and readability should recommend it to anyone teaching metaphysics to upper level undergraduates or graduate students. Whether or not this is a question with an answer, accompanying Olson on his trip through the logical space it carves out is enjoyable and rewarding."--Michael O'Rourke, Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews

From 1989-1990, Olson was commanding officer of SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team ONE. He served on the Navy staff as assistant deputy chief of Naval Operations (Plans, Policy, and Operations). The commander in charge of all Navy SEALs during Desert Storm, Ray Smith, hand picked Olson to be on his staff. From Aug 1991 to Aug 1993, Olson commanded Special Boat Squadron TWO before rejoining DEVGRU.

Olson was promoted again in 1999 when he assumed command of Naval Special Warfare Command in Coronado, California till August 2002 when he was relieved by Rear Admiral Albert M. Calland III.

He is a Joint Specialty officer and Political-Military Affairs sub-specialist with emphasis on Africa and the Middle East. His awards include the Navy Distinguished Service Medal and Silver Star.
In addition to being the first three and four star Navy SEAL, Admiral Olson was the Bull Frog, the longest serving Navy SEAL still on duty.[5] At four-star flag rank, Olson was the highest-ranking Navy SEAL to hold the Bull Frog title. He was succeeded by Commander Brian Sebenaler and Admiral William McRaven, who had also succeeded him as Commander of the United States Special Operations Command and himself retired in 2014.[6]
Olson was the first person to ever throw a ceremonial first pitch for a post-season game at the new Yankee Stadium in 2009.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Composite Score:





                        Eric T. Olson, P.A. has received 0 out of 5 stars based on 0 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

The Human Animal
Personal Identity without Psychology
Eric T. Olson

Philosophy of Mind







The Human Animal
Personal Identity without Psychology
Eric T. Olson
Philosophy of Mind



Description



Most philosophers writing about personal identity in recent years claim that what it takes for us to persist through time is a matter of psychology. In this groundbreaking new book, Eric Olson argues that such approaches face daunting problems, and he defends in their place a radically non-psychological account of personal identity. He defines human beings as biological organisms, and claims that no psychological relation is either sufficient or necessary for an organism to persist. Rejecting several famous thought experiments dealing with personal identity, he instead argues that one could survive the destruction of all of one's psychological contents and capabilities as long as the human organism remains alive.

Reviews and Awards

Chosen as an Outstanding Academic Book of 1997 by Choice



"A very clear and powerfully argued defence of a most important and surprisingly neglected view."--Derek Parfit, author of Reasons and Persons (All Souls College, Oxford)
"For hundreds of years, almost all philosophers writing on the topic have supposed that personal identity is either entirely a matter of psychology or at least has an important and essential psychological component. This important book presents a powerful challenge to that assumption. If Dr. Olson is right, we are living animals and what goes on in our minds is wholly irrelevant to questions about our persistence through time. If this book receives the attention it deserves, it will transform philosophical thinking about personal identity."--Peter van Inwagen, author of An Essay on Free Will, Material Beings, and Metaphysics (University of Notre Dame)
"Olson's excellent and enjoyable book should be read by everyone with an interest in metaphysics. For those seriously interested in the philosophy of personal identity, or in our existence and identity, the matter is more serious; without much delay, you've got to get your hands on The Human Animal--Peter Unger, New York University
"A significant contribution to the field. It issues several important challenges to proponents of a psychological approach to personal identity."--Carol Rovane, Yale University

Description

                    From the time of Locke, discussions of personal identity have often ignored the question of our basic metaphysical nature: whether we human people are biological organisms, spatial or temporal parts of organisms, bundles of perceptions, or what have you. The result of this neglect has been centuries of wild proposals and clashing intuitions. What Are We? is the first general study of this important question. It beings by explaining what the question means and how it differs from others, such as questions of personal identity and the mind-body problem. It then examines in some depth the main possible accounts of our metaphysical nature, detailing both their theoretical virtues and the often grave difficulties they face. The book does not endorse any particular account of what we are, but argues that the matter turns on more general issues in the ontology of material things. If composition is universal-if any material things whatever make up something bigger-then we are temporal parts of organisms.If things never compose anything bigger, so that there are only mereological simples, then we too are simples-perhaps the immaterial substances of Descartes-or else we do not exist at all (a view Olson takes very seriously). The intermediate view that some things compose bigger things and others do not leads almost inevitably to the conclusion that we are organisms. So we can discover what we are by working out when composition occurs.show more

 ADM Eric T. Olson (USN, ret.)










Eric T. Olson retired from the United States Navy in 2011 after more than 38 years of military service. He served in special operations units throughout his career, during which he was decorated for valor and leadership. He commanded at every level and was the first Navy SEAL officer to be promoted to three- and four-star ranks.


Admiral Olson was commissioned in 1973 upon graduation from the United States Naval Academy. He studied Arabic and French at the Defense Language Institute, and he earned a Master of Arts degree in National Security Affairs from the Naval Postgraduate School.
Admiral Olson’s military career culminated as the head of the United States Special Operations Command, where he was responsible for the mission readiness of all Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps special operations forces. In this capacity, he led over 60,000 people and managed an annual budget in excess of ten billion dollars.

Admiral Olson is now an independent national security consultant who supports a wide range of private and public sector organizations. He currently serves as an Adjunct Professor in the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University and sits on the Board of Directors of Iridium Communications, Under Armour, LaserMax, Tracking Point, Imperatis and the non-profit Special Operations Warrior Foundation and National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum.
