Career[edit]
Huffman is a graduate of Wakefield School in The Plains, Virginia. He attended the University of Virginia, where he majored in Computer Science.[5] After graduating, Huffman teamed up with classmate Alexis Ohanian to start Reddit, which was initially funded by Y Combinator,[5] in 2005. Reddit was acquired by Condé Nast in 2006.[6]
In 2010, Huffman teamed up with Adam Goldstein to create the travel site Hipmunk, with funding also from Y Combinator.[3][4] In 2011, Huffman was named to Inc. magazine's 30 under 30 list.[7] Huffman is the instructor for "CS253: Web Development", an e-learning course that began on April 2012 offered by online education provider Udacity.[8]
In 2014 Huffman said that his decision to sell Reddit had been a mistake, and that the site's growth had exceeded his expectations.[9] On July 10, 2015, after Ellen Pao's resignation, Huffman was appointed CEO of Reddit.[2]
Shortly after being appointed CEO of Reddit in 2015, Huffman said that some controversial communities should not be on Reddit, writing that "neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen."[10] Huffman later stated while Reddit had not been created as a "bastion of free speech," the concept "is important to us." This in contrast with a 2012 interview in which Alexis Ohanian verbatim described Reddit as a "bastion of free speech."[11][12] Huffman later created new policies that would require users to opt into seeing some content, and blocking material that encourages "Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone."[13][14][15]
