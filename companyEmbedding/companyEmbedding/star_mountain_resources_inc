About the Micro Cap Industry




Humans have carried on mining operations since the beginning of time. Prehistoric people mined the “Lion Cave” in Swaziland for a type of iron oxide as early as 41,000 BC which they used like glitter to decorate their bodies. [1] Today, miners explore for oil, gas, rock salt, stone, gravel, coal and minerals—both base and precious metals—from every column of the periodic chart.
 
Mining is divided into two segments, surface and underground. Underground mining, once much more common, has been outpaced by surface mining in modern times. Surface mining delivers 85 percent of minerals and 98 percent of metallic ores. Quarrying, open pit mining, strip mining and mountaintop removal (used primarily for coal mining) are all forms of surface mining. [2]
 
Similarly, mining companies fall into either of two categories. Majors and Juniors.
Major mining companies are usually publicly-held multinational firms with revenue of $500 million or more. Their role in the industry is that of producer; they perform the on-going mining operation required to extract target minerals from the earth, then to handle mine closure and land reclamation once the site becomes unproductive.
 
Junior mining companies primarily take on the role of exploration. Their exploration activities provide the major companies with new sites to mine. [2] While their revenue seldom exceeds $50 million, it is the junior minors that drive industry growth.
 
Just as sales organizations often divide their sales team into “hunters” who find new business, and “farmers” who cultivate each account to maximize revenue, junior companies are the “hunters” of the mining industry. They secure its future. As such, junior mining companies as “playing a senior role” in the industry. [3]




What Juniors Do




Because junior companies are staffed with highly trained engineers, geophysicists, geologists and scientists, they have the expertise to identify sites that are most likely to produce target minerals in economic quantity over a significant period of time. Exploration includes studying properties that have previously been productive, usually referred to as “brown fields,” as well as so-called “green fields” that have not previously been mined. [3]
 
A range of technologies allow miners to evaluate a given plot. Geophysical surveys, often done from an aircraft, look for gravitational and magnetic signatures that indicate presence of a particular mineral. Electromagnetic studies determine the electrical conductivity of rock. Satellite imagery, including satellite-based spectroscopy, uses the visible spectrum and those beyond visible to identify desirable characteristics. These and other techniques lead to a step known as resource evaluation, a process that estimates the quality and expected yield from the site. This step requires drilling and core sampling. [4]

   A Golden Opportunity Star Mountain Resources Inc. is a micro cap mining company focused on the acquisition of mineral properties and their development into producing mines. We believe the business climate is favorable for the low cost acquisition of high value mineral properties and we intend to grow our company primarily through acquisitions. We are currently engaged in the activities necessary to re-start our Balmat zinc mining operation in St. Lawrence County, New York, recently acquired from HudBay Minerals. The restart will transform our company from a junior explorer to an active producer with a revenue stream in the latter part of 2016. www.StarMountainResources.com      Balmat Zinc Mine  Massive sulfide zinc mineralization was first recognized in the Balmat-Edwards district in 1838 and first production began in 1915. Since then, the district has produced in excess of 43 million tons of ore from the Balmat, Edwards, Hyatt, and Pierrepont mine complexes with average grades ranging from 8.6% Zn to 16.4% Zn. The Balmat Mine operated continuously from 1930 – 2003, when production ceased due to depressed zinc metal prices. Production resumed in 2006 to directly address a projected, short term concentrate shortfall at the parent company's smelter. The mine was closed and placed on care and maintenance in the fall of 2008 after the projected smelter need was addressed, in the face of a general economic turndown and resulting fall in zinc prices. The Balmat mine has produced a total of 30.7 million tons grading 8.6% zinc. The mine is fully permitted and in compliance with all current Federal and State mining regulations and is currently on care and maintenance status. Geology and Mineralization The Balmat-Edwards district zinc deposits occur in intensely folded, distorted and deformed Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks of the NW Adirondack Lowlands, subjected to high temperature and high pressure metamorphism during the Grenville Orogeny approximately 1.1 billion years ago. The zinc deposits are hosted in the Upper Marble Formation, a sequence of shallow water carbonate units characterized by siliceous, dolomitic, diopside-rich and evaporate-bearing marbles. Zinc orebodies exhibit tabular or pod-like geometries and occupy zones within the hinges and axial regions of folds and faults associated with the Sylvia Lake syncline, a major regional scale structure recognized at Balmat. The Balmat deposits are classified as SedEx-type, commonly defined as deposits formed from precipitation of metals from brines generated by evaporation and movement of fluids through carbonate and evaporate-rich rocks in marine sedimentary basins. The fluids/brines leach metals as they migrate through the sedimentary pile along regional and local structures and ultimately reach the sea floor where the metals precipitate as lenses and sheets in favorable structural and stratigraphic settings. Commodity: Zinc Location: St. Lawrence County, New York, in the historic Balmat-Edwards Mining District Ownership: Wholly owned by Star Mountain Resources Permits: Fully permitted and in compliance with all current Federal and State mining regulations Historical Production: 30.7 M tons grading 8.6% zinc Mine Plan: 8.5-year with excellent potential to increase life of mine and mining rate Mining Method: Modern mechanized underground mining using a combination of room and pillar and long hole stoping Mine: 4000 tons per day hoisting capacity, rubber tired, mobile mining fleet Mill: 5000 tons per day zinc concentrator, a tailings facility, a concentrate storage area, and rail and truck transportation infrastructure   BALMAT INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS  Permitted mining operation with planned production in 9 to 12 months after securing long-term debt financing. 	8.5-year mineral base with excellent potential to extend mine life 	Numerous mining practice and processing improvements will lower OPEX 	Northern Zinc acquisition adds unparalleled mining experience to SMRS 	Long-term power agreement ensures a 40% reduction in power costs 	Zinc market macro indicators are positive • Excellent local infrastructure     Chopar  The Chopar project covers approximately 2000-hectares in the Star Mining district of southern Utah, near the town of Milford. These holdings comprise 116 unpatented mining claims, fee-simple, patented mining claims and mineral leases on State of Utah lands. The Star Mining District is located in the Star Range of southwestern Utah, approximately 200 miles south-southwest of Salt Lake City. The Star Range hosts tilted and faulted, early Paleozoic to middle Mesozoic carbonate and clastic sedimentary rocks with Tertiary intrusive and extrusive rocks. Base metal and silver and gold mineralization is associated with the Tertiary intrusive event and includes vein-fissure type deposits, chimney-manto replacements, skarns and silicified breccia veins and pipes. The Chopar project area and the larger Star Mining District hold significant potential for economic concentrations of skarn and sediment-hosted Au-Ag mineralization. The presence of skarn mineralization in outcrop, in historic mines and in drill core and chips is encouraging. The extent of zones affected by contact metasomatism is potentially large enough to host orebodies of size and grade of interest to junior and major mining concerns. Southern Utah is a favorable jurisdiction for permitting and operating mines. In particular, the Star Mining District lies near rail and roads with access to national and international goods and products. The climate is mild and amenable to any mining methodology. The normal activist communities associated with Colorado, Arizona and California are substantially underrepresented. The operations of CS Mining, immediately adjacent to the project area are proof that small scale, open pit mining operations may be successfully permitted and operated in Beaver County.    Leadership   Joseph Marchal - CEO Joseph Marchal served as chief executive officer for Asia-Pacific Region of Chi-X Global Inc., a subsidiary of Instinet, LLC, from November 2008 to June 2009, where he was responsible for the Instinet platform expansion in the region.

Health and Safety
Star Mountain Resources Corporation regards the safety and health of our dedicated and hard working employees to be a value that will not be compromised. It is Star Mountains’s policy to provide a safe and healthy workplace for all of our employees. This can only be achieved through intelligent action, cooperation, and an understanding of safe work practices. Safety not only means compliance with rules and regulations, but also the development of personal work habits and practices that do not put ourselves or our co‐workers at risk. Safety and production must be an integrated process; therefore, no activity is to be deemed so important or urgent to justify the existence of unsafe conditions, acts, or practices.

 Star Mountain Resources Inc. is a small cap mining company focused on the acquisition of mineral properties and their development into producing mines. We believe the business climate is favorable for the low cost acquisition of high value mineral properties and we intend to grow our company primarily through acquisitions.
We are currently engaged in the activities necessary to re-start our Balmat zinc mining operation in St. Lawrence County, New York, recently acquired from HudBay Minerals. The restart will transform our company from a junior explorer to an active producer with a revenue stream in the latter part of 2016.
