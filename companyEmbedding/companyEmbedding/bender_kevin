                                    Hi Everyone! I am a recent MBA graduate from Schulich School of Business with 6.5 years of strong experience in Technology Consulting for Banking and Financial Services Industry (especially Capital Markets, Wholesale Banking and Order Management Systems). I have worked in multiple core banking projects for clients such as State Bank of India, Dehtscue Bank, Deutsche Equities, Equifax Inc. etc.
I started my professional career as a Developer and moved towards Business System Analyst - Team Lead roles in the later stages of my professional experience. Thus I have sound knowledge of all the stages of the SDLC and PMLC.

Post my MBA I have started working part-time for a Start-up Firm Recright Inc. as a Program Manager where I am involved in all the facets of the business including business strategy, analysis, technology, integration, database architecture, and project management. I am closely working with the CEO and CTO of the company to build a Business Intelligence application in HRMS practices.

I am looking for full-time opportunities in Technology Consulting and/or Busniess Analysis for firms in Bankiing and Financial Services Industry in Canada. I would be happy to provide further information when contacted.

                                    Hello Everyone.
I have been away for awhile,due to illness. I am back and ready to get back to work. Living in Calgary,Alberta, and at this point in time we are in a state of emergency. Calgary and Area is pretty much flooded and 100,000 people have been evacuated. So far I am fortunate and am high and dry. I am working from home office which is good. I am so happy that so far, there has been no loss of life. People have rallied together to help each other and many of us  who are dry are inviting the flood victims into our  private homes. Where there is no room centres have been set up and volunteers are helping out. The army is here to rescue those who cannot be reached.

                                    I cannot recall in my life, ever have knowing a set of twins. Would you believe that in the past four months I have done wedding videos for three sets of twins. Not just twins, but identical twins. And I mean identical.
Adding to that, I took another booking for a wedding video today and for the second time in a month, I am doing a wedding video where the brides name is Samantha and the grooms name is Chris.

                                    Working From Home

A Little Effort Leads To A Wealth Of Success

What would you do if you no longer had to worry about money? Where would you go? How would you spend your time?

If you�re like most people, you rarely stop to think about these kinds of questions. Too busy caught up in the day-to-day rat race, you�ve forgotten the dreams you had for yourself and your loved ones . . . or at least put them on the back burner for �later.�

Meanwhile, your life is passing you by. Birthdays come and go. Days blend into weeks and months, with only the occasional vacation or major life change to mix things up.

You know there must be more to life, but you�re not sure where to even begin making a change.

Here�s a thought for you: what if you could work from home? http://www.lifestylebusinessonline.com

                                    Hi everyone. I have just joined whoswho so would like to introduce myself. My name is Greg and I am from Brisbane, Australia.I am a videographer specialising in weddings. I will of course take on any other event that a client wants videoed.
Filming and photography has been a hobby since as far back as 1968, but it has only been in the last 12 months that I have taken it up as a full time job. This was due to restructering at my last job that made my position surplus. Having worked in the electrical and electronics fields all my life, I thought that this was all I could do, then suddenly I realised - hey, i have a lifetime hobby that i enjoy and have learnt so much about - step outside the square you've been boxed up in all those years and do something different. If you wish to have a look at my website you will find it at www.alloccasionsvideos.com.au

About Us
“Surround yourself with only people who are going to lift you higher” - Oprah Winfrey
The Bender Group has adopted a team approach by working with professional associates and alliances that provide value through passion and a desire to serve, with the ultimate purpose of creating prosperity for our clients.





Perry Bender, CPA - The force behind The Bender Group – learned early on of the struggles of Small Business. Growing up in a family owned company, being paid by the pieces produced provided the basis for understanding efficiency, effectiveness & replication in business.
Surviving the recession of the early eighties by an awakening to the true value of education, Perry started a hometown auto reconditioning business (still in operation today) that helped support him through a local community college with a liberal arts degree and MSU, studying political science, communications, and ending with a business degree, majoring in accounting and a minor in management. He earned his CPA designation (upon his first attempt at the examination) in 1993.
Between starting his own companies, working for several local and regional accounting firms and holding two controller positions, Perry has over 30 years experience working with Small Businesses.
“Putting the pieces together, with the end result of helping people and their businesses prosper, has been a vision and a work in progress for a very long time. 
Perry Bender

Kevin Nichols, CPA, PLLC - Working independently as a professional alliance, Kevin adds another dynamic to our Group with his experience in personal and corporate income tax preparation, financial counseling, and payroll and consulting services. He holds a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from Saginaw Valley State University and has been an adjunct faculty accounting professor at SVSU and Northwood University. His firm was established in 1988.
Kevin's mission is to strive for excellence in providing personal and professional services to his clients using advanced technology and sound professional standards.

Conach Marketing Group - Conach Marketing Group is a group of marketing, advertising and sales professionals with decades of experience in marketing, advertising and sales. The group was formed based on the common beliefs of its principals of how a firm should be run and how its clients should be treated.
To keep its overhead low while offering exceptional work, they have adopted a business model similar to the Design Build approach in construction or an OEM program in manufacturing. They have gathered a team of talented professionals who share their client- focused philosophy, who have specific expertise in areas such as website production, sales training, video production, and many others. This enables them to deliver the best services for your marketing investment, make a positive impact on your business, and have some fun while they do it.

Tracy Bender - Research & Development – has over 26 years experience through management, human resource and selling roles and brings experience from holding positions with Harry & David, RBF Inc., The Vitamin Shoppe and Dayton Hudson Department Stores.
She holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Interpersonal & Public Communications from Central Michigan University. She also owned and managed her own home accent retail store for 5 years.
Her experience, training, belief, and dedication to customer service adds a dynamic ingredient mixed with her understanding of balance between the physical, spiritual, family and the professional is a key attribute that makes her a valuable asset through this company to ultimately your company
