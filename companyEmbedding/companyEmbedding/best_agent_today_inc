Find a top real estate agent to sell your home 

  
    Your best move starts by selecting the right Realtor for you, even before you start looking for that next home. We can help you. BestAgentToday.com is the most innovative consumer-oriented site in the real estate marketplace. Compare Realtors, read reviews, and then interview candidates. For a smooth transaction, choose one of our verified top real estate agents.  







Our Independent Market Research



Our research team analyzes every transaction from every town in your state, to ensure that we have statistically valid results. We take all of that data and deliver the conclusions to you right here - in an easy-to-understand format. We provide you recent historical averages for similar properties in your town.  We also determine which realtors have performed well in the past 12 months. We look at each town separately, which means realtors are compared only with the other realtors in your market. Our proprietary system is designed to produce a very short list of agents from each town that we feel are among the best agents. Our goal is to find those agents that are truly professional, hard-working, and proficient at their craft. These agents are the ones most likely to get you the best deal in the shortest time. They are the only agents we are comfortable recommending to you.



Our proprietary Agent Productivity Index

After our independent research group has examined every transaction from every town in your state, we take all the data and run it through our proprietary statistical modeling system to develop our Agent Productivity Index. The model is weighted heavily towards the number of recent transactions an agent has completed, but also takes other factors into account, right down to the number and type of reviews we receive from customers like you. We use the API to determine which agents are solid, professional, and providing quality service to homeowners in your town. You can see each agent's API for your zip code on their individual profile page. Using our API as the starting point, we've selected an elite group of the best agents in each zip code to recommend to you.
But we don't stop there. We crank it up a notch to make your search even easier, by using our certification process. Read more about our certification program.





Our Certification Process



After completing our initial process of determining an agent's API and then selecting agents to recommend to you we personally contact those agents to see if they would like to become certified by us - essentially joining our top tier. In order to become certified we need to get their agreement on some very important points:
First - they must agree to respond to our customers promptly,Second - they must agree NOT to charge our customers any additional amounts because you connected with them through BestAgentToday.com.
We feel that these items should be an integral part of your decision, so we make them part of our decision too! And we're still not done! We go on to collect lots of additional information from them, including pictures, resumes, their contact information, and some of their fun facts that you see displayed on our site.

Our Agent Certification Process

After completing our initial process of determining an agent's API and then selecting the agents to recommend to you, we personally contact those agents to see if they would like to become certified by us - essentially moving to our top tier.
In order to become certified we need to get their agreement on some very important points:

First - they must agree to respond to our customers (you) promptly, and
Second - they must agree NOT to charge our customers (again, you) any additional amounts because you connected with them through BestAgentToday.com.

We feel that these items are an integral part of your decision, so we make them part of our decision too! And we're not done yet. Because your decision is based on personality also, we go on to collect lots of additional personal information from them too. Including pictures, resumes, their contact information, and some of their fun facts that you see displayed on our site.

  Our Story


  Like you, we have also been in the situation of selling a home. There were lots of questions we needed answered: When should we put our house on the market? How much could we get for it?
 
A seemingly endless list. Then came the question of who should we hire to sell our home. We discovered there really wasn’t a good way to find out just who the top agents were. We spent hours trying to locate agent information, and then hours more trying to make sense of it all. After struggling to find useful information, we started learning the best ways to do it, and found out which parts of the data were really important. We boiled all of the information down and made ourselves a very short list of the agents that were the real professionals in our town. At that point we could limit our decision making process to choosing the one we felt the most comfortable with. After that experience, we felt that we could help other people in the same situation. So we made the BestAgentToday.com website, and the rest is history. We became a research organization (which is why we call ourselves a ‘research organization’ - we’re very clever that way) and now we sift through the miles of data about every real estate transaction in your state. We’re independent and that means that we don’t play favorites with any brokerage companies. We play favorites with consumers! We think that you will appreciate the difference.







  You’ve come to the right place!

  Finding a top producing real estate agent shouldn't be challenging, and at Best Agent Today we make it easy.



We give you a unique combination of historical data combined with personality portraits of Realtors - all served with integrity and clarity. We hope that you will help us spread the word about Best Agent Today. Please share our site with your friends and people that can take advantage of our service.

Work From Home Call Center - Join Liveops | Join Liveops




















































Work from home customer service with Liveops
Welcome to the modern world of customer service, where skilled individuals work remotely on schedules that fit their life. Welcome to Liveops Nation. 
Our agents love what they do and it shows on every call. For them, this is more than work from home. Customer service is their calling and Liveops makes it possible for them to do the work they love on a schedule that works around their lives. 
Some agents work a few hours a week or a couple of times a month, earning extra money on easier call types. Others are true entrepreneurs who dive in and build their own business, choosing clients and brands they are passionate about and seeking opportunities to expand their skills.
These super-agents master home business skills including tech support, accounting and scheduling, all while being professional brand advocates and winning the hearts of customers, one interaction at a time.
If you love helping people and want to work from home, we offer you an unparalleled opportunity to find customer service work from home that fits your skill level, your interests and your life. 
Find your passion as you build your business. You can choose from a variety of customer-focused work ranging from easier entry-level calls that offer a lot of flexibility, to specialized work that requires specific skills and a greater weekly commitment. View our open opportunities  to see if we are accepting applications for the work that interests you.
The opposite of being a caged employee
Liveops customer service agents are independent contractors, giving them the freedom and flexibility to work around their lives.
Set up your own work space
Independent contractors purchase and maintain their own home office equipment and can set up their remote office to meet their needs and style. Review the technical requirements.
Choose how to reach your goals
Maximize your potential with opportunities that fit your skills. Review the expectations in your contract or statement of work, and complete certification on time.
Manage your business your way
You’re the boss! Set your performance goals, choose your schedule, opt in to additional learning, and define your professional style.
Money matters
You’ll be responsible for your taxes, health insurance and retirement planning. An accountant or tax professional can help you plan for taxes and deductions.
Make a Rewarding Investment in YOU!
Becoming an independent customer service agent with Liveops Nation is an investment in yourself and the work-life balance you want to achieve. Like any investment, it can take a little time to pay off. Some agents begin meeting their financial goals within their first few weeks while others tell us that it took one to three months for them to see success. 
Before you apply, make a commitment to stick with it and give yourself time to learn the ropes, build your performance and reach your goals. You won’t be doing this alone. You’ll be part of Liveops Nation—a network of people who were born to help.

Agent Opportunities
Customer Service -
Traditional customer care handling inquiries, complaints, exchanges, etc. Great for people who want flexibility. Some seasonal work.  
Food Order Taking -
Good for people who want to make extra cash nights and weekends or as an additional client for agents looking to expand their business. 
Inbound Sales -
Fast-paced calls for a variety of products and services with incentives that can quickly increase your earning potential. Great for people who want a lot of flexibility in scheduling and enjoy sales.
Insurance Claims -
We call these agents our insurance angels. Good choice for people who are empathetic and love helping people through difficult situations. Prior experience strongly recommended. 
Insurance Sales -
Inbound calls converting leads for top insurance companies. Great for new or seasoned insurance agents.
Patient Support -
Unique patient support program. Best for people who want to work 20-30 or more hours per week on a daytime schedule. 
Payroll Support -
Great for people with a combination of payroll and customer service experience. Best for people who want to work 20-30 or more hours per week.  
Roadside Assistance -
Great for people with some dispatch experience who want to work at least 10 hours per week. 

The weekend is when I take the bulk of my calls, usually no more than two hours per day during the week, and I make more at home than I would in a call center setting.

Why HealthCompare?



At HealthCompare we take the time upfront to learn about you. Your needs and your budget come first. Once we've gotten to know you, we research and present only those personalized health insurance quotes that best match your specific needs.




Our Licensed Sales Agent are available for assistance and guidance, and are happy to answer questions or start with a Needs Assessment. You can even use HealthCompare to complete your enrollment in certain plans over the telephone.




HealthCompare offers free, accurate comparisons for individual and family insurance.
















You can't predict accidents, but you can be protected if one happens
Many of today's medical plans have high deductibles designed to keep the monthly premiums more affordable. We have ways to
                        maintain lower medical premiums and the risk of high deductibles by including Ancillary plans that cover the cost of those
                        deductibles. To see you available options and plans, click below on the product type you are looking for.







Accident
                    Helps you handle the medical and out-of-pocket costs that add up after an accident injury.
                




Critical Illness
                    Pays you a lump sum cash payment for covered illnesses such as cancer, heart attack or stroke.
                




Short Term
                    Provides you coverage for a limited time period with affordable rates, flexible terms and peace of mind.
                




All Other Ancillary
                    Coverage plans to provide you Dental, Vision, Limited Medical, Short Term and Life Insurance
                







Simplifying access to better health insurance choices.
