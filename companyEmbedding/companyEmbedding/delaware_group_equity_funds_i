2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Objective

Delaware International Small Cap Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation.


Strategy

The Fund invests primarily in common stocks of non-US companies, which may include companies located or operating in developed or emerging markets.  Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 40% of its net assets in non-US securities and up to 30% of its net assets in emerging markets. The manager currently invests primarily in smaller capitalization companies domiciled outside of the United States.

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.


Total returns may reflect waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the manager and/or distributor for some or all of the periods shown. Performance would have been lower without such waivers and reimbursements.

Benchmark lifetime returns are as of the month end after the Fund's inception date. 
Performance at NAV assumes that no front-end sales charge applied. Performance at max offer price assumes that a front-end sales charge applied.

Class A shares have a maximum up-front sales charge of 5.75% and are subject to an annual distribution fee.

Prior to Dec. 29, 2010, the Fund had not engaged in a broad distribution of its shares and had been subject to limited redemption requests. The returns reflect expense limitations that were in effect during certain periods and that may have been lower than the Fund's current expenses. The returns would have been lower without the expense limitations.

Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs, or expenses. Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index.

Expense ratioGross1.51%Net1.38%
Net expense ratio reflects a contractual waiver of certain fees and/or expense reimbursements from June 30, 2017 to June 30, 2018. Please see the fee table in the Fund’s prospectus for more information.

Delaware International Small Cap Fund (formerly, Delaware Focus Global Growth Fund)  Quarterly commentary June 30, 2017
Within the Fund
While stock exposure largely drove the Fund’s performance during the second quarter of 2017, the consumer discretionary and healthcare sectors also contributed. From a country perspective, Australia and the United Kingdom contributed to performance. The Fund’s strongest individual contributors included Evotec, Aristocrat Leisure, and Fincantieri.
Shares of German drug research-and-development company, Evotec, continued to outperform during the second quarter after reporting better-than-expected results for its fiscal year ended 2016 and better margins in the first quarter of 2017. Moreover, the company achieved its first milestone payment for diabetes research from its research alliance with global pharmaceutical company Sanofi.
Australian company Aristocrat Leisure is a global manufacturer and seller of gaming machines. The company also supplies gaming systems, software, and other gaming-related products. Aristocrat Leisure outperformed during the quarter after reporting better-than-expected results at the end of May. Its North America Class III gaming business continued to grow and take market share. Its International Class III gaming business benefited from the recent launch of a new gaming product, Lightning Link. Additionally, digital daily average users (DAUs) continued to grow.
Fincantieri, an Italian shipbuilder focusing on cruise ships and navy vessels, outperformed after announcing new ship contracts with Viking Ocean Cruises and the French Navy. In addition, the company announced the anticipated acquisition of STX France as it continues to consolidate the market.
In contrast, from a sector perspective information technology detracted from the Fund’s performance during the quarter. From a country standpoint, South Korea and India weighed on performance. The Fund’s largest individual detractors included Tongda Group, Outokumpu, and Sumco.
Tongda Group is a Chinese consumer electronic component manufacturer. It supplies plastic and metal casings for notebook PCs, electrical appliances, and smartphones. The company’s share price declined during the quarter amid allegations of lost market share at one of its key customers, Chinese smartphone manufacturer Oppo. We decided to exit the Fund’s position in Tongda Group during the quarter.
Shares of Finnish stainless steel manufacturer and ferrochrome producer Outokumpu underperformed during the quarter after technical issues in one of its ferrochrome furnaces curtailed production. Additionally, the company said it expected ferrochrome pricing to be weaker throughout 2017.
Sumco, a Japanese manufacturer of silicon wafers, underperformed during the quarter because of concerns about an increased supply of silicon wafers. The company’s share price struggled, despite the relatively small announced capacity increase compared to the overall market and strength in demand. The company had benefited from tightness in the wafer market and a supportive pricing environment. 
Positioning and outlook
The Fund’s country and sector relative weights continue to be driven primarily by bottom-up stock selection and where we’re finding attractive opportunities. As a result, at the end of the quarter, the Fund’s largest sector overweights relative to its benchmark, the MSCI ACWI ex USA Small Cap Index, were consumer discretionary and materials. The largest country overweights were Brazil and France. The largest underweights relative to the benchmark from a country perspective were South Korea and Australia. Real estate and financials were the largest sector underweights. 
We continue to be confident about the opportunities present in international small-cap equities. While political and geopolitical uncertainty persists throughout the world, we believe the underlying economies in many regions remain supportive. Small-caps outside the United States have exhibited strong performance over the past few quarters, and we believe that should continue.
In our view, international small-caps are poised to catch up to the relative outperformance of US small-caps over the past decade. As the US economic recovery has been a step ahead of non-US markets, we see key catalysts that should lead to an inflection point, such as reduced political risk, strong earnings, or an overall encouraging macro environment. While we are mindful of the risks present, we remain optimistic. 
Regardless of the economic environment, we will continue to adhere to our disciplined approach that focuses on identifying positive fundamental change in companies that we view as having strong and sustainable business models.

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

International investments entail risks not ordinarily associated with US investments including fluctuation in currency values, differences in accounting principles, or economic or political instability in other nations.

Investing in emerging markets can be riskier than investing in established foreign markets due to increased volatility and lower trading volume. 

Investments in small and/or medium-sized companies typically exhibit greater risk and higher volatility than larger, more established companies.
