Fidgeting With Marketing: What Marketers Can Learn From The Success Of The Fidget Spinner

On June 9, 2017 By michaeljacobsenmarketingIn Branding, Business, Digital Media, Marketing, Uncategorized 


By Michael Jacobsen( Digital Marketing Expert from Toronto)

They are everywhere. You can’t escape them. Spinning around on fingers and spinning on the minds of many consumers. Fidget spinners has caused quiet a stir (or should I say spin) in the last few months to kids everywhere. For those of you who live under a rock, Fidget Spinners are a piece of plastic with holes in them that you flick to spin. Sounds simple. They were created to help people with attention deficit and other special needs concentrate in school. Since then, they have taken off and are being spun by millions of kids around the world. A simple product that took the world by storm. Here are 3 things that marketers can learn from the Fidget Spinner.

Be Universal

The cool thing with the Fidget Spinner is that anyone can use it. People of all ages can take their finger and flick the plastic to watch it spin. Marketers need to be able to reach out to their target audience but they also need to make their message universal. You want your message to be able to understand and available to anyone. They could have marketed the Fidget Spinners as a toy to cope with ADHD but instead made it more universal.
2. Build Brand Ambassadors
I have never seen an ad for Fidget Spinners on tv. I don’t think I saw any ads online. So how did I hear about them? I heard about them from the news media and friends with kids. Other people built up a reputation for the product and finally I caved in and bought one. The company never used an ad on me. They let other people build up the product. News media ate it up and really helped the Fidget Spinner become what it is today. It’s always best to let other people do the marketing for you. Reach out to influencers and the rest will be easy.
3. Keep It Simple
The interesting thing about the fidget spinner is that it doesn’t have any electronics in it. Nowadays, almost all toys or things we use are connected to Wifi and needs to be charged up, but not the Fidget Spinner. It’s so simple. People like simple things and same with marketing. Don’t overhype or add all this razzle dazzle. Just be authentic and understandable. People prefer authenticity over a show.

Michael A. Jacobsen Joining Omeros as Vice President, Finance and Chief Accounting Officer

SEATTLE, Aug. 13, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Omeros Corporation (NASDAQ:   OMER), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and commercializing products targeting inflammation, coagulopathies and disorders of the central nervous system, has announced that Michael A. Jacobsen is joining the company as vice president, finance and chief accounting officer.
"Mike's experience leading finance teams responsible for the commercial launch of biopharmaceutical products including Cialis®, one of the most successful drugs on the market, will be instrumental as we anticipate marketing approval for OMS302 next year," stated Gregory A. Demopulos, M.D., Omeros' chairman and chief executive officer. "With his deep background in accounting, business management and finance, I expect that Mike will begin contributing immediately to Omeros' planned transition to a commercial company."
"I am impressed by what the Omeros team has accomplished and by the tremendous potential of Omeros' development programs," said Mr. Jacobsen. "These are exciting times for Omeros, and I look forward to helping the company achieve commercial success for a long line of products, starting with OMS302."
Mr. Jacobsen brings over 30 years of senior business management and accounting experience to Omeros and led the finance teams responsible for the commercial launch of Cialis® and Recothrom®. His experience includes more than a decade of service as a senior finance and accounting officer with publicly traded medical research, drug development and biotechnology companies. Omeros' board of directors will appoint Mr. Jacobsen to his position of vice president, finance and chief accounting officer. 
Most recently, Mr. Jacobsen was vice president of finance and chief accounting officer of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly AVI BioPharma, Inc.). From 2007 to 2011, he was vice president and chief accounting officer at ZymoGenetics, Inc., a publicly traded biotechnology company acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) in October 2010, where his responsibilities included managing all aspects of accounting and financial information, tax planning and compliance, SEC reporting, annual audit and quarterly reviews, and purchasing. Subsequent to the merger, Mr. Jacobsen was responsible for migrating the ZymoGenetics financial operations and systems to BMS. Prior to ZymoGenetics, Mr. Jacobsen held various roles from 2001 to 2007 at ICOS Corporation, a publicly traded biotechnology company acquired by Eli Lilly in January 2007, including senior director of finance and corporate controller. Before joining ICOS, Mr. Jacobsen held the position of vice president of finance/chief financial officer at two publicly traded e-commerce and software companies. Mr. Jacobsen is a certified public accountant and received his bachelor's degree in accounting from Idaho State University.
