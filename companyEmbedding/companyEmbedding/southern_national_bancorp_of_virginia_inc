MCLEAN, Va. and RICHMOND, Va., Dec. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Southern National Bancorp of Virginia, Inc. (NASDAQ:    SONA) ("Southern National"), the holding company of Sonabank, and Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:    EVBS) ("Eastern Virginia"), the holding company of EVB, jointly announced today the signing of a definitive agreement to merge.  The combination brings together two banking companies with complementary business lines creating one of the premier banking institutions headquartered in the Commonwealth of Virginia.  








Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will have approximately $2.4 billion in total assets, $2.0 billion in total deposits, and $1.8 billion in total loans.  The company, which will assume the Southern National Bancorp of Virginia, Inc. name for the holding company and the Sonabank name for all banking operations, will maintain its corporate headquarters in McLean, Virginia and the headquarters of the bank in Richmond, Virginia. The company will have 47 branch locations covering markets in both Maryland and Virginia, including the Washington, D.C. and Richmond, Virginia MSAs. These attractive markets are often cited as having some of the best demographic and income profiles in the country characterized by low unemployment, strong population growth, new business starts and consistent capital expenditure.    
Pursuant to the merger agreement, which was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both companies, Eastern Virginia common and preferred shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio equal to 0.6313 shares of Southern National common stock for each share of Eastern Virginia common stock or preferred stock owned.  Based on the average closing price of Southern National's common stock for the ten trading days ended December 12, 2016, the transaction is valued at approximately $178.3 million, or $9.72 per share of Eastern Virginia common and preferred stock.  Southern National shareholders will own approximately 51.4 percent of the combined company and Eastern Virginia shareholders will own approximately 48.6 percent.  
Southern National and Eastern Virginia jointly project 16 percent cost savings of their combined noninterest expense base as a result of operational synergies and the consolidation of some locations.  The transaction is expected to be materially accretive to earnings per share with minimal dilution to tangible book value, all of which is projected to be earned back within two years.  Additionally, the combined company will be well-capitalized by all regulatory standards at the time of closing.  
The management team of the combined company will be comprised of Joe A. Shearin, currently President and CEO of Eastern Virginia, as President and CEO, Georgia S. Derrico, currently Chairman and CEO of Southern National, as Executive Chairman, and R. Roderick Porter, currently Vice Chairman and President of Southern  National, as Executive Vice Chairman.  All three executives will enter into new employment agreements upon the closing of the transaction and will work together towards a seamless integration while continuing the operational success each organization has enjoyed in recent years.  The board of directors of the combined company will be fixed at eleven directors, consisting of six members of the current Southern National board of directors, including Ms. Derrico and Mr. Porter, and five members of the current Eastern Virginia board of directors, including Mr. Shearin.   
Georgia S. Derrico, Chairman and CEO of Southern National, said, "We believe this is a unique opportunity to combine two very different organizations in order to become an even stronger Virginia based organization with a diverse retail franchise and a dynamic lending based platform. We have known Joe Shearin for over nine years.  Through our mutual investment in Southern Trust Mortgage, which has been a tremendous success, we have developed a strong confidence in one another's judgement and banking capabilities. We look forward to operating a much larger organization in a cost effective way to increase profitability and shareholder value."
Joe A. Shearin, President and CEO of Eastern Virginia added, "The combined company offers a unique and highly attractive branch franchise. With locations stretching from Frederick, Maryland down through the greater Washington, D.C. and Richmond areas, Interstate I-81 in the Shenandoah Valley, Charlottesville, Northern Neck, Middle Peninsula and on towards Hampton Roads, we will be the only Virginia based bank that provides this geographic diversification. We will have a presence in Virginia's most attractive markets.  We are truly excited to lead this new company together with our respective teams and look forward to maximizing the potential of this combined franchise."
R. Roderick Porter, Vice Chairman and President of Southern National, stated, "This is the opportunity of a career to combine the best elements of two successful, distinctive but complementary banks into a single strong institution. In the coming months, we will continue to put together the best processes and the best people of the two institutions to create a streamlined bank with the strongest risk controls which adds to efficiency without sacrificing customer service."
The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2017 and is subject to the approval of both companies' shareholders along with regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, EVB will merge with and into Sonabank immediately after the merger of Eastern Virginia with and into Southern National.
Southern National was advised in the transaction by FIG Partners LLC as financial advisor, and Alston & Bird LLP, as legal counsel.  Eastern Virginia was advised by Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. as financial advisor, and Troutman Sanders LLP, as legal counsel.

Southern National Bancorp Of Virginia Inc. Reports Earnings For The First Quarter Of 2017 Of $2.1 Million After Pre-tax Deal Costs Of $323 Thousand And Declares A Dividend Of $.08






GlobeNewswire



Apr 27, 2017 4:30 PM EDT













 


















































 MCLEAN, Va., April 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Southern National Bancorp of Virginia Inc. (NASDAQ:SONA), the holding company for Sonabank, announced today that net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $2.1 million compared to $2.6 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Excluding tax effected costs related to the pending merger with Eastern Virginia Bankshares (EVBS) net income would have been $2.4 million (Non-GAAP). Two other factors depressed earnings in the first quarter: First, our 44% ownership in Southern Trust Mortgage (STM), our mortgage affiliate, resulted in a loss of $479 thousand during the first quarter of 2017 compared to a positive contribution of $80 thousand during the same quarter last year.  STM's loss resulted from investments in a new delivery system, new branches and onboarding costs of new loan officers. Second, the cost of servicing the subordinated debt issued January 20, 2017 by Southern National was $329 thousand during the first quarter of 2017. We will ultimately grow into the subordinated debt and its cost should be more than offset by increased revenues. The Board of Directors declared a dividend of $.08 per share payable on May 26, 2017 to shareholders of record on May 15, 2017. This is our twenty-second consecutive quarterly dividend.   Overview   Southern National's merger with EVBS is proceeding as expected. Federal Reserve and Virginia State Corporation Commission approvals have been received. Subject to shareholder approvals we should be on track for a closing in late second quarter or early in the third quarter of 2017. System conversion is expected in September 2017. In the meantime we are continuing to work on structuring the combined institution to streamline processes using the best of each institution.   Loans, net of unearned income, increased to $974 million at March 31, 2017 from $930 million at year end. Total loan originations were $70.4 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 including purchases of residential portfolio product from STM in the amount of $36.8 million. Southern National's efficiency ratio was 57.83% during the first quarter of 2017 compared to 57.94% during the first quarter of 2016. Southern National's return on average assets was 0.73% during the first quarter of 2017 compared to 1.00% in the same quarter last year.  If we exclude the tax effected merger expenses during the first quarter of 2017, the return on average assets would have been 0.84% (Non-GAAP) compared to 0.79% during the fourth quarter of 2016 and 1.00% during the first quarter of 2016. The return on average equity was 6.57% in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 8.56% in the first quarter of 2016. If we exclude the tax effected merger expenses during the first quarter of 2017, the return on average equity would have been 7.57% (Non-GAAP) compared to 6.92% during the fourth quarter of 2016 and 8.56% during the first quarter of 2016. On January 20, 2017, Southern National completed the sale of $27 million of its fixed-to-floating rate Subordinated Notes due 2027 (the "Notes"). The Notes will initially bear interest at 5.875% per annum until January 31, 2022; thereafter, the Notes will be payable at an annual floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 3.95% until maturity or early redemption.    Net Interest Income  During the first quarter of 2017, net interest income before the provision for loan losses was $9.9 million, up from $9.7 million during the first quarter of 2016. Average loans during the first quarter of 2017 were $957.5 million compared to $843.2 million during the same period last year. The loan discount accretions on our three acquisitions were $447 thousand in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $551 thousand in the same quarter last year.  The interest expense on the subordinated note issued in January 2017 was $329 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 which reduced the net interest margin by 12 basis points. The net interest margin was 3.75% in the first quarter of 2017, down from 4.06% in the first quarter of 2016.  Absent interest expense on the subordinated debt during the first quarter of 2017, net interest margin would have been comparable to the fourth quarter of 2016.
