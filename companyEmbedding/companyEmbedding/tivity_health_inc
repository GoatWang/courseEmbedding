Healthways, Inc. Is Now Tivity Health, Inc.






GlobeNewswire



Jan 10, 2017 7:45 AM EST













 




























































 NASHVILLE, Tenn., Jan. 10, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Healthways, Inc., (NASDAQ:HWAY) today announced that the company is rebranding and changing its name to Tivity Health, Inc., to better align with its portfolio of fitness and health improvement programs and to position the company for future growth. The company is unveiling the new brand at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, today at 8 a.m. PST, and will begin trading under its new ticker symbol TVTY on the NASDAQ exchange on Wednesday, January 11, 2017. The Tivity Health presentation will be webcast live at  http://jpmorgan.metameetings.com/confbook/healthcare17/directlink.php?p=22528 . Tivity Health is a leading provider of fitness and health improvement programs, with strong capabilities in developing and managing networks of fitness centers and complementary and alternative practitioners and managing specialty health benefits through its three networks: SilverSneakers®, Prime® Fitness and WholeHealth Living TM. With a focus on enabling healthy aging, both in place and in the community, Tivity Health will continue to deliver the products and services its health plan and employer customers and its consumers have come to expect.   The name Tivity Health represents the company's commitment to helping people thrive, no matter their age or stage, and helping customers to provide access to cost effective solutions that keep their members and employees healthy. "Our name evokes the tangible benefits that our products deliver - a focus on physical activity, improved productivity, strong connectivity and spirited creativity, all with a sense of positivity," said Donato Tramuto, Tivity Health CEO. "After numerous conversations with many of our customers, participating fitness center locations, consumers and analysts, it was abundantly clear that the Healthways brand was largely associated with total population health and the company's deep roots in disease management," said Tramuto. "Following our divestiture last July of our total population health services business to Sharecare, we set out to develop a strong corporate brand that resonates with our stakeholders and aligns with our long and short-term growth strategy. The Tivity Health brand allows us to strengthen our focus on customer and member needs and improve our consumer experience."

New Brand Reinforces Commitment to Fitness and Health Improvement Programs, Including Flagship Product SilverSneakers



















January 10, 2017 07:45 ET

 | Source: Healthways, Inc






NASHVILLE, Tenn., Jan.  10, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Healthways, Inc., (NASDAQ:HWAY) today announced that the company is rebranding and changing its name to Tivity Health, Inc., to better align with its portfolio of fitness and health improvement programs and to position the company for future growth. The company is unveiling the new brand at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, today at 8 a.m. PST, and will begin trading under its new ticker symbol TVTY on the NASDAQ exchange on Wednesday, January 11, 2017. The Tivity Health presentation will be webcast live at http://jpmorgan.metameetings.com/confbook/healthcare17/directlink.php?p=22528. Tivity Health is a leading provider of fitness and health improvement programs, with strong capabilities in developing and managing networks of fitness centers and complementary and alternative practitioners and managing specialty health benefits through its three networks: SilverSneakers®, Prime® Fitness and WholeHealth LivingTM. With a focus on enabling healthy aging, both in place and in the community, Tivity Health will continue to deliver the products and services its health plan and employer customers and its consumers have come to expect.   The name Tivity Health represents the company’s commitment to helping people thrive, no matter their age or stage, and helping customers to provide access to cost effective solutions that keep their members and employees healthy. “Our name evokes the tangible benefits that our products deliver - a focus on physical activity, improved productivity, strong connectivity and spirited creativity, all with a sense of positivity,” said Donato Tramuto, Tivity Health CEO. “After numerous conversations with many of our customers, participating fitness center locations, consumers and analysts, it was abundantly clear that the Healthways brand was largely associated with total population health and the company’s deep roots in disease management,” said Tramuto. “Following our divestiture last July of our total population health services business to Sharecare, we set out to develop a strong corporate brand that resonates with our stakeholders and aligns with our long and short-term growth strategy. The Tivity Health brand allows us to strengthen our focus on customer and member needs and improve our consumer experience.” Tivity Health will continue to focus on its SilverSneakers, Prime and WholeHealth Living networks with targeted approaches to increase engagement and to develop new programming. Longer term, there is additional opportunity to help transform the aging process. The senior population is experiencing explosive growth, and older adults are seeking ways to live with vitality and purpose. Tivity Health has the expert resources to innovate and create programs that drive engagement and results for its customers and consumers. Tivityhealth.com, the company’s new website, will go live tomorrow, January 11. Tivity Health can also be found on Twitter, under the handle @TivityHealth, and on YouTube.

 “We are pleased with our first-quarter financial results,” said Donato Tramuto, Tivity Health’s Chief Executive Officer. “Due to the strength of this performance and the visibility it gives us for the rest of 2017, we have increased our financial guidance for the full year. “We are also pleased to announce a three-year renewal of our SilverSneakers® contract with UnitedHealth Group, continuing a 20-year relationship with a partner who shares our commitment to active lifestyles. This renewal and many other renewals we have achieved to date are a clear indication of the value of both our brand and the services provided to our customers and their members through the SilverSneakers program.”  Glenn Hargreaves, Tivity Health’s Interim Chief Financial Officer, added, “During the first quarter, we essentially completed our restructuring and business separation initiatives and realized cost savings that annualize to approximately $15 million from the restructuring, which contributed to expanding our adjusted EBITDA margin. “Tivity Health’s cash flow from operations for the first quarter of 2017 totaled $3.0 million. First-quarter cash flow reflects our expected seasonality due to the payment of the 2016 colleague bonus and the full-year 2016 401(k) Plan matching contributions. Cash flow for the first quarter was also reduced due to the timing of payments from two long-term customers, which have since been paid. Our guidance for free cash flow for the full year remains unchanged.”    Completes Refinancing of Credit Facilities On April 21, 2017, Tivity Health completed the refinancing of its senior credit facilities. The new facilities include a $100 million revolving credit facility, a $70 million term loan A facility, a $150 million delayed draw term loan facility and an uncommitted incremental accordion facility of $100 million. Proceeds of the revolving loans and delayed draw term loans may be used to repay outstanding indebtedness, including amounts payable upon any conversion of the Company’s $150 million cash convertible senior notes due 2018. As previously disclosed, the stock trading price threshold requirement for convertibility of the senior notes was met in the first quarter of 2017. Consequently, the senior notes are convertible into cash at the option of the holder during the period of April 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017. As a result, and even if holders do not elect to convert, applicable accounting rules require Tivity Health to reclassify the senior notes as a current rather than long-term liability at March 31, 2017. Increases 2017 Financial Guidance Tivity Health announced today that, based on first-quarter results and the Company’s outlook for the remainder of 2017, financial guidance for 2017 has been modified as follows: 
revenues in a range of $550 million to $558 million, compared with the previous range of $540 million to $550 million;
adjusted EBITDA in a range of $119 million to $123 million, compared with the previous range of $116 million to $120 million; and
adjusted earnings per diluted share in a range of $1.50 to $1.58, compared with the previous range of $1.44 to $1.52.
 The guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects the exclusion of pre-tax restructuring and business separation expenses totaling $2.4 million that were incurred in the first quarter of 2017.  See page 12 for a reconciliation of adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to earnings per diluted share guidance.  The Company does not provide a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance because certain information required for such reconciliation is not determinable with reasonable certainty.   This guidance for 2017 includes: 
depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $3 million;
a federal income tax rate for the remainder of the year of approximately 39%;
weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 41 million for the full year;
free cash flow of $90 million to $95 million; and
capital expenditures of $8 million to $10 million.
 Summary Tramuto concluded, “Our first-quarter performance provides further evidence of our ability to fiercely execute on our plan, to produce profitable growth serving markets that have compelling long-term growth dynamics, and to deliver value to our customers and shareholders. Through our A-B-C-D strategy, the goals of which are to (A) add new members in our three existing networks - SilverSneakers®, Prime® Fitness and WholeHealth LivingTM; (B) build engagement and participation among our current eligible members; (C) collaborate with partners to add new products and services that will leverage the value of our brand; and (D) deepen relationships with our partners and their instructors within our national network, we believe we are well positioned to strengthen our market leadership position in serving the age 50-plus market. We are actively developing and testing a variety of innovative initiatives designed to increase the number of active members and the frequency of their participation. With SilverSneakers as the leading, trusted brand in the market, Tivity Health intends to help our eligible members live their best lives with vitality, dignity, and purpose.” Conference Call Tivity Health will hold a conference call to discuss this release today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

 (1) Adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations per share are non-GAAP financial measures.  The Company excludes net loss attributable to business separation expenses and restructuring charges from these measures because of their comparability to the Company's historical operating results.  The Company believes it is useful to investors to provide disclosures of its operating results on the same basis as that used by management.  You should not consider adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations per share in isolation or as a substitute for net income from continuing operations or net income from continuing operations per share determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. (2) Net loss attributable to business separation costs consists of pre-tax charges of $1,639,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 related to the separation of the Network Solutions business from the disposed total population health business.  The tax rate applied to these costs was 39.55%, which represented the combined estimated U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate. (3) Net loss attributable to restructuring charges consists of pre-tax charges of $737,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 associated with the 2016 restructuring of corporate support infrastructure and pre-tax charges of $39,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 associated with a reorganization and cost rationalization plan.  The tax rate applied to these restructuring charges was 39.55%, which represented the combined estimated U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate.
