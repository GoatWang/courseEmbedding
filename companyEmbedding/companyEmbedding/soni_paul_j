Sony Radio, December 15, 2009


By Paul J. Winstead


Verified Purchase(What's this?)


This review is from: Sony WXGT77UI Double Din CD Player with USB 1-wire for iPod and other USB Devices (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer) (Wireless Phone Accessory)

This is by far the greatest radio I have ever purchased. I replaced my factory radio in a 06 ford focus with this radio and I wish I would have done it the first day I bought this car. All I did was go buy a mounting kit and the radio practically installed it self it was so easy. The only prblem I ran into was the wiring. I had about 15 factory wires and only about 12 aftermarket wires. I simply got on the internet and found a wiring diagram for my car and it was all down hill from there. This radio looks like it came from the factory in the dash, that is how well it fit. No trimming away of anything on my car. It worked great. I think the coolest thing is that when I use the usb port and plug in my ipod or an MP3 player you can control albums and songs through the remote which is a handy little gadget. I would totally recommend this radio to anyone. And the things you can adjust on this thing seems endless. GREAT JOB SONY!!!!!!!
