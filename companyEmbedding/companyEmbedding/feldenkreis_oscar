I would now like to turn the call over to George Feldenkreis.
George Feldenkreis
Good morning. We're glad to report another good quarter for Perry Ellis International. While numerous macroeconomic issues are affecting the apparel industry in the United States and worldwide, we are pleased to report that this was a quarter where we were able to improve analyst estimates and build the guidance for Perry.
We are fully focused on growing our core global brands. Through our excellent inventory management coupled with our strong product performance, we delivered an adjusted gross margin of 37.6%, a full 90 basis point ahead of last year. We will continue focusing on our growth to drive our gross margin to 40% over the next few years.
We managed SG&A very well despite of rising cost and overhead and trends, allowing us to report an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.2 for the quarter, compared to 6.6 at the end of fiscal year. With this backdrop, we're confident to project an increase in revenues for this year to a range of 870 million to 880 million in revenue. We are confirming our earning guidance for the year in the range of adjusted earnings per share of 2.07 to 2.17. This represents an increase over adjusted EPS last year.
Despite that, consumer behavior is changing so much, so rapidly, which approached great question as to the future of the apparel business. We feel that we have been building the right infrastructure to be successful in this new environment. We're concentrated with a focus approach to various growth global core brand and businesses, which are Perry Ellis, Original Penguin, Golf Lifestyle, Savane, Cubavera on the women brands as well as Farah in Europe.
Oscar will inform you about the performance of each of those brands. We're very proud that through the years we have developed a very-very diversified and balanced customer base that can achieve solid results despite the fact that some of our business partners are experiencing sales decline. We all know that the department store brick-and-mortar business has been heavily impacted by the growth of e-commerce, especially on the women's side by the advent of the vertical European retailers like Zara, H&M, Primark and Japanese Uniqlo.
The department store business represents approximately 29% of our business. We think that retailers have taken the right step to reduce their store base and close underperforming store. As they diminish in size, the lower inventory niche will allow them to increase their cash flow and increase the cash availability, which will help them improve the performance in the years ahead. We're also applauding the changes that retailers are making to receive flows, ensuring that goods are hitting selling floor and customers are shopping thereby driving faster turns or reduced markdowns for them and for us.. This will provide a more level flow for our quarterly reporting as well as on our quarter by quarter basis.

Generally speaking, we believe that the new reduce retail space in America is a very positive development in the long run. It provides retailer with more flexibility to maneuver the tremendous demographic implication of generation D and Y, versus generation X and baby boomers. The generational moves are creating a new paradigm which brands and retailers better learn to navigate, if they want to succeed. From a working capital perspective, we're able to reduce our inventory to 140 million compared to 151 million at the end of last quarter. This is our lowest inventory in many years.
The strategic reduction in inventory allows to drive more profitable top line and allows your company to enter the new fiscal year in a very healthy condition. Needless to say, we're extremely proud of the progress we continue to make towards our near and long-term objectives. On the international side, we continue to be very bullish in the United Kingdom and Europe as well as Mexico and Canada. Business in the UK is already improving considerably while at the same time we continue to increase our business in the continent.
The first quarter was a good indication that our business is strengthening in the continent and the UK. The consumer will always expect in the higher prices consequence of the evaluation of the costs. We've seen that by the second half of the year, our foreign exchange losses which have reduced our earnings for the last eight quarters will improve considerably. As a matter fact, we're reviewing the possibilities of establishing on operation in the Netherland to be able to better serve the continental cost.
We continue to execute against our strategic initiative to grow our international business. In the first quarter, international revenues grew 4.7% and accounted for 11.1% of total revenue up from last year 9.8%. For the full-year, we expect international growth would to grow nearly to $80 million, 20% of our year-over-year to generate 13% of our revenue up from last year 11%. We remain quite bullish about our business in Europe. Our launch of Nike Swim across Europe is exceeding expectations.
Our latest Farah Brand continues its strong growth 20% year-over-year and is expanding to non-UK business into European market behind Urban Outfitter ASOS, Zalando and specialty accounts are opted due to business in the continent grew over 40% this year as we expand this reduction in Germany and open new markets such as Greece, Israel and soon South Africa. And Callaway, which is today the best and most popular golf line in the world is increasing its footprint and penetration in profitable big box or in goods and golf specialty retailer to compliment our core green grass and independent accounts.
We are managing now six brands in Europe, Original Penguin, Farah Vintage, Farah Classic, Callaway, Ben Hogan and most recently Nike Swim. This gives us a lot of leverage to open totally different channel of this reduction which are critical for the future of our growth, ideas and projections for Europe. We expect that our business in Canada will grow over 20% year-over-year led by strong Perry Ellis performance [indiscernible] accounts in Canada, then Europe and Mexico, we benefit from our diverse portfolio brands excluding Nike and other fashion in Swim brand and golf led by Callaway and PGA Tour.
Finally, Mexico despite currently another challenge we continue to record double digit growth as we optimize our direct Nike Swim and others swim business with Marty, Liverpool and other important accounts. For the quarter, international grew by 14% versus last year. On the retail and direct-to-consumer front, we experienced sales decline more notably in our full price stores and shoe outlets. Launching 10 stores for last year cost us $4.7 million in revenues and this quarter costs us above another $1.5 million. However, our retail sales were much more profitable this quarter than we have had in the number of years. The store that we were depriving this year will reduce sales by about 1.6 million, but again we will have improved our revenues per share.

By the end of the year, we project to have 59 stores in the United States. We will continue opening store book with a more selective approach and in areas where rental in line with the potential revenue that these stores could generate in such sense. On the licensing front, during this quarter we terminated the relationship with the major licensee and gave that product license to our current licensee that will now have better opportunities to self product that relate with other was a onetime hit. As we called out in November, quarter-over-quarter comparisons are distorted by some extraordinary transition in any one year.
And while our licensing partners are not immune from retail another challenge, we continue to see organic growth which complements our expansion in new categories and market. We have been especially encouraged by growth in Perry Ellis luggage and footwear with revenue increasing 52% over prior year, our successful launch of our Original Penguin Home Fashion with few partners such as Deluxe and Bed Bath and Beyond by our triple digit success and leverage in the brand equity and momentum of Farah in Europe.
As well as our traction, we got another brands in your portfolio to ultimately generate meaningful licensee income. We expect four no agreements in this quarter, three of which are in international market and we have a robust pipeline of new licensees, we expect to conclude over the next several quarter. We remain on track to achieve our targets of 20% to 25% no agreement to 20% to 25% no agreement across our portfolio brands. We're projecting approximately 180 licenses by year end. We continue to focus shopper in the digital world.
We have always been forward thinking on technology and we've seen throughout the years, how different disruptions have influenced to date market in the United State. The original disruptors were really the off-price challenge plus and lower price share. This brought commoditization of product that helps their growth as prices kept declining. Our department stores unfortunately did not see that coming. Furthermore, vertical foreign companies with superior speed to market innovation and fast delivery like Zara, H&M, Primark and Uniqlo strong affected the women's side of the business again striking many brick-and-mortar retails very hard.
E-commerce was a major disruptor. Everybody knew that e-commerce was going to grow, but some retailers did not see that way and came in with very late. Amazon successfully operated a non-profitable organization which allowed to build an amazing tech company and now it controlled 43% of searches and keep growing worldwide. The next disruptor in the years ahead and a very well be artificial intelligence, AI, which will continue to disrupt the all retail models. And on top of all that the increase in real estate values brought super high rents which many retailers could not effort to pay.
All of the above five have contributed to the presence state of the first in the retail business, so the question is what are we going to do? At Perry Ellis, we indentified many of these trends early and because of this we have been able to transition our company to our successful model for the present and for the future. We're always concerned of our long-term profitability even if it has shortened profit. We see the changes in demographic increase in sales via smartphone apps, making it easier and easier to shop on your phone. This will continue to have a big influence in sales and apparel and almost every other category.
We have adopted and implemented several digital initiatives using new state-of-the-art software in order to lower our cost of design and production. We're working to reduce our distribution cost by the end of the year. We have also acquired data mining software and joined our software partners to help us grow substantially our onsite sales as well as our retail customer digital sales. Fit to market is an extremely important initiative it's obvious in the fact that Adidas has through their ability to replenish sold their products in just 45 days. Nike has also announced that they plan to double their supply and change speed.

The investment in the last two years in new plants and equipment in Asia to be able to make apparel better, faster and cheaper are really mindboggling. You have to go to Asia and visit some of these super modern factories to realize how much money has been invested in the future. Our strategy has worked very well and it has allowed us to establish a strong foothold in different channels, in different geographies and in different areas Perry Ellis and product lines.
We're very proud that our financial condition is the strongest in 20 years. For this quarter, the Company performance and working capital discipline has resulted in a lower net debt to capitalization of 24.3%. We have a very strong balance sheet ready for growth in both the United States as well as international. Your company is in great shape.
Thank you. I will now turn over the call to Oscar.
Oscar Feldenkreis
Thank you, George, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking to you today on our first quarter call. The quarter marked a solid start to the year as we delivered sales and earnings above our guidance. As expected, sales rose in our core global brand with earlier shipments of spring merchandize driving the outperformance versus guidance. In total, revenues declined as a planned versus the prior year as we remain laser focused on positioning our brands and the higher productive doors while reducing inventory to improve churns and margins.
Importantly, the execution of this strategy is elevating our powerful core brand with consumers through the continuous introduction of innovative fabrics and our trend apparel and accessories, through the expansions of our marketing to intensify our digital reach and through our actions to make it even easier to shop our brands whenever and wherever consumers choose shop on mobile, online and in store.
During the quarter, we also continued to make progress on our speed to market initiative, which are expected to reduce lead times so that we bring product to stores faster and meet the demands of the retailers today, which are as you know are looking for product closer to the needs of selling. And we maintained our relentless discipline on expenses and inventory management, all of this served us well and positions our company to achieve our core sales and growth for the year across our divisions Golf, Nike, Rafealla contributed to our better than expected sales and earnings performance.
As expected, laundry sales declined as we work on the re-launch of the brand. As we mentioned during our third quarter call last year, we welcome back Veronica Davis to laundry. Veronica led the laundry teams since we acquired it in 2009 and was instrumental in driving the brands growth which more than doubled under our leadership. We have no doubt that she will be equally successful and will ensure that the D&A of the brand matches its customers profile with product execution and marketing.
Turning to reviewing our business beginning with Golf, we are very pleased about our positive performance in golf, which demonstrated our continuous dominance in the Golf apparel business. During the quarter, we saw strength in bottoms as we introduce new pants and shorts with a comfort waistband which have exceeded sales expectations. We also add new fabrics with new motion technology in the manufacturing of the garments. This has lead to a fantastic beginning of the golf seasons for us across all distribution channel and brands in the United States, Canada and Europe.
As we move into the most important quarters for golf, we are very optimistic that these new products will continue to outperform. The importance of stretch is gaining momentum across retailers. We are pleased to be one of the early movers in offering stretch product and expect to capitalize on our proven expertise in this area. The retailers seek us out for. With all these new products in our golf brands which incorporated performance fabrics and stretch offerings, we are ahead of the competition.

Looking ahead, we are very excited about our new fabrics that we will be introducing as well as our pipeline of new initiatives in golf that will continue to drive our performance. We are also very excited about the Jack Nicklaus launch into a large mass retailer with an introduction to 1,650 doors. We are very excited about the new opportunities with this relationship, as it sets the stage for a multitier brand approach. Our golf, Callaway golf business also had a strong quarter with a notable strength in the UK, which I saw as 30% increase in sales.
We're looking to capitalize on the continued success of Callaway's brand performance as recently announced on the earnings call. We renewed our Callaway license agreement through 2022, which has opened the doors for us to pursue new opportunities for growth across the authentic green grass channel, our off-course specialty and better department store channels. We introduced map pricing in Callaway, which has resulted in a positive response from the authentic channel.
During the quarter, we expand the Callaway into Golf Galaxy, PGA Tour Superstore, Academy and Golfhound in Canada just to name a few. We continue to expect golf to continue to grow in high single-digits this year. The first quarter is a largest shipping quarter for the year for Nike Swim and we are pleased with its performance of retail across men's and women's and young athletes and swim gear. Our Nike business continues to perform extremely well in the U.S. and we've seen significant opportunities ahead to expand international.
In fact, we expect to be shipping product into about 30 countries by year end, giving our expanded relationships. As it relates to the product, the expansion of Hydroguard UV protection swim tops continues to perform well, and we expect to build upon the positive momentum with the upcoming deliveries. The introduction of extended sizes in men and women's also has been a success across retail, which is leading to additional growth as additional retailers add this category going forward.
Entering to Q2, we believe that we are well prepared to meet the needs of our customers as well as our e-commerce accounts which are benefitting from a year around demand online. Receptive to the new 2018 Nike spring season product, the preview has been very strong and we're very excited about the introduction into new geography. Overall, we expect to maintain our dominance in the swim market where we're taking share domestically with the expectations of transferring this success on a global scale.
Perry Ellis continues to perform well while the quarter started slow as noted across retail generally, early spring product sold well with particularly strength in linen sportswear. We're very excited about the continuing expansions of Perry Ellis 360 at leisure functional sportswear product. We plan to expand the 360 collection further within the specialty accounts in the second half of the year. Pants under Perry Ellis portfolio performed extremely strong with positive sell through rates across all customers driven by the introduction of the performance, fabrics and new models.
On the e-com side, e-commerce continues to do well both internally and third-party. We're focused on ensuring the experience with the consumer with product in store to online as the same and we will continue investing on ensuring that we’re positioned for strong growth in e-commerce digital going forward. We will continue to manage inventories very tightly to maintain a strong sell-through and fast return. We feel good about the Perry Ellis prospects Q2, given strong early reads on the newness we delivered ahead of Father's Day.
We're also excited to announce that we have retained a new PR, an ad agency that will help us get our messaging across to the end consumer with an increased emphasis on digital, and we're also looking forward to the August launch of our new Perry Ellis fragrance. As we mentioned in our Q4 call, we named the new President for the Original Penguin brands and are pleased with the early results.

While we saw a fine revenue reduction in Original Penguin as we took a concentrated effort to reduce unproductive retail stores and channels and reduce use, this effort enable us to drive quality sales of full price selling and expand our penetration in productive stores. As a result, we experienced higher internal margins and increase products sell-through at higher AURs across most of our classification with less promotional activities. Early spring leads on swim and tees have been the strong product performance categories.
We will continue to apply this strategy while driving top line growth as well as Original Penguin as a full collection in tops and bottoms there by guarding our penetration and adding higher productive stores. At the same time, we're focusing our marketing on digital and feel that this effort will enable us to align with the Original Penguin consumer that spends an increasing amount of time connected to this end.
Turning to the women's and beginning with laundry. During the quarter, we consciously lowered our in-store inventory to give us a fast return this along with our customer focus on fashion newness versus price and a shift to online assisted us to improve margins. We just completed our fall 17 market and we're very excited about the plans we've received from our core retail partners and have a confidence that the new managements we have in laundry is on track for growth in the second half of the year. 
Rafaella performed above our expectation mainly driven by the early timing of shipments reflecting retailer supporting the new product initiatives. At retail, we saw a sales trend in the April driven by our new initiatives including the introduction of weekend getaway collection products, a traditional company product for Rafaella consumer. In fact all of Rafaella department stores supported this initiative with the weekend getaway launch into 200 stores at Belk, Bon-Ton Dillard's, Boscov and Lord & Taylor.
We will begin delivering monthly capitals of the weekend getaway going forward giving customers something new to browse and buy each time SheShops. Overall, we expect the retail environment to remain challenging with the possibility of additional store closures and retail bankruptcies expected in the USA. Even with this backdrop, we remain confident in our ability to deliver core sales growth as we have aligned our brand and our businesses with higher productive door and the expansion internationally and t direct to consumer.
It is also important to note that we have a diversified brand portfolio, diversified channel and we offer niche lifestyle to service the mass change, stores, department stores and special markets as a company we are very disciplined and focused on managing inventory tightly and delivering product closer to the time of the need while providing a continuous flow of new innovative products to market to deliver our growth and profitability goals.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David to review our financial guidance.
David Rattner
Good morning, everyone. In the first quarter as we noted in our press release, we recorded revenues and earnings per share that exceeded our guidance. Consolidated revenues for the quarter totaled 242 million, which was ahead of our guidance, reflecting strength in our core businesses with the earlier shipment of spring merchandize Oscar just spoke about. As compared to the prior year, revenues declined driven by retailers' preference to receive products closer to need to increase their churn which we spoke about on our Q4 call in March, as well as negative foreign exchange and the reduction in owned stores which benefited profitability.
By segment, revenue in our men's sportswear and swim segment totaled 186 million as compared to 198 million in prior year. Increases were noted in our core Golf apparel, Nike Swim and other brands. Revenue in our women's sportswear segment totaled 30 million as compared to 32 million in the year ago period. Increases in our Rafaella business were offset by planned reductions in laundry as discussed by Oscar. Direct-to-consumer revenue totaled 18.2 million as compared to 20.5 million in the prior year mostly due to the closing of 10 stores last year that resulted in a much more profitable store base. Store comp was down 2% in the quarter but comp traffic was down 9% for the quarter as we focused on the customer experience by door.

Also our store comp margins were up nearly 3% for the quarter reflecting the strong consumer response to our product assortment. Total DTC comp sales were down 4% yet comp margin dollars were flat reflecting higher AUR based on a twofold approach. One, being internal pricing strategy, and two, moving away from highly promotional events, overall we were very pleased with our performance in a tough environment. Licensing revenues totaled 8.3 million as compared to 10.4 million in the prior year. As discussed last year we transitioned from two of our license partners, one brought in-house and one a new partnership. As George has commented, this was part of our strategy to elevate our brands globally. As we expected this transition reduce revenues in this segment of our business versus last year. 
Moving on to total company results beginning with gross margin. We continue to be very pleased with our gross margin expansion as margins expanded by 90 basis points versus prior year's adjusted basis. Continued solid performance in our men's collection Golf apparel and Nike Swim businesses were additionally assisted by improved margins in our direct-to-consumer business. We also continue to benefit from efficiencies in our supply-chain infrastructure. 
SG&A totaled $71 million for the quarter as compared to an adjusted amount of approximately $70 million in the prior year. SG&A in our current fiscal quarter included $1 million of anticipated cost that are not expected to continue. Excluding this SG&A was in line with prior year, we are pleased with our cost discipline to effectively manage increases in wages and other inflationary cost that are closer to 3% to 4% per year. 
Turning to the balance sheet, inventories continue to be managed extremely tight and believe our in great shape to support our forward sales forecast. Our inventory discipline enabled us to pose a net debt to total capitalization of 24.3% as compared to 30.5% in the year-ago period. This places us in a very comfortable position to support the expansion of our businesses. Looking to quarter two, we expect revenues in the range of 202 million to 205 million compared to 202 million in the year-ago period. We expect revenue growth in our men's collection and Golf apparel businesses and also expect to benefit from the continued roll out of Nike Swim in Europe and Latin America and further expansion in global golf brands.
We see gross margin approximately 36.4% for the quarter, which reflects higher margin shipments in Q1 due to customer risk. SG&A is expected to be relatively consistent with adjusted prior year levels reflecting our ability to offset inflationary cost pressures. Due to the plans shift, our pretax earnings are tax rate is expected to be higher in Q2 versus last year which is expected to negatively impact the quarter by $0.06 to $0.07 per share compared to prior year. For the above reasons, we expect earnings per share to be approximately $0.07 to $0.10 for the second quarter as compared to an adjusted $0.15 in the prior year. 
As we look at the remainder of the year, we see continued headwinds from lack of consumer traffic and macroeconomic issues. We feel that we are positioned well in terms of our product focus and our execution and performance. Accordingly, we are maintaining are guidance for revenues of $870 million to $880 million and adjusted earnings per share for the year of $2.07 to $2.17. This continues to reflect the gross margin rate between 37.3% to 37.5%. Despite the challenges in the global market, we continue to focus on controlling those items within our control, elevating our brand and improving our profitability. 
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Ronald Bookbinder with Coker & Palmer.
Ronald Bookbinder
Looking now at the environment, you talked a lot about the shift to e-com, but is that really picking up all the merchandize or do you think industry-wide there is just too much product out there also, not just too many stores, but just too much product?
Oscar Feldenkreis
I think it’s a blend of both. I think that definitely e-commerce is growing. I think the challenge that we’re seeing and the improvement that we're seeing as we experience with some other channels and distributions that we're actually seeing a shift of one the product is actually being delivered which in retailers are starting to operate on less inventory in the store and focusing more on the turn and delivering product quicker, which is similar to what some of the vertical retailers have been successful doing, offering more deliveries more frequently. 
Ronald Bookbinder
And you guys talked a lot about Europe and your focus on building up the infrastructure there. But do you think the channel shift that we’re seeing in U.S. to e-commerce? Do you see the hitting Europe sometime in the next year or two?
George Feldenkreis
Thank you, Ron, for your comments. We don’t see that happening that quickly. Number one, there are really no major department store Europe outside of [indiscernible] Spain and I'm taking about continental Europe. In the UK, of course, there are large department stores on which very similar business with the U.S. or in Europe it's only Spain and to some degree Germany not as important as in United States, so it's harder to substitute the small time [indiscernible] prevalent in all of Europe when it comes to Amazon et cetera, et cetera.
So, we don’t -- we see the same -- there is no question that the European e-commerce as a matter of fact in many cases and some countries has a higher percentage of the market than in the United States. But it’s a different situation, brands are still more important in Europe than in the United States, although other total they represented total smaller percent of the total market.
And there is no question that we have some brands that have a lot of appeal to the Europeans like Callaway, Nike and even Penguin and Perry is a good brand there from before. So, we see Europe as a very fertile market for us to grow. And when I mean Europe, I mean all the countries in Europe including the Middle East et cetera, et cetera.
Ronald Bookbinder
And on the Jack Nicklaus to that mass merchant, how much of a revenue benefit do you think that will be for Q2, opening up over 1600 stores?
Oscar Feldenkreis
Well, it's already included in our numbers, revenue numbers for this year and we hope that that will perform well. Early performance has been very strong and hopefully that will continue. That momentum will continue and hopefully for next year and possibly Q4 as we start again the spring season we'll be able to gain further market share. So, we're very excited with the Jack Nicklaus launch and we'll have more updates in Q2 in terms of what other additional opportunities that we see with the golf segment.
Ronald Bookbinder
Okay, and lastly, I think you had some notes that recallable in April. How are you guys looking at that given how strong your balance sheet is with cash being generated?
George Feldenkreis
We're not -- at this moment, we don't have plans to call it. Frankly, we are waiting for -- hopefully, one day we'll have a change in the tax situation and we have funds in Europe that through our European corporation that there we can use for growth in Europe. So, depending on how we see our -- the needs of our growth in Europe initiatives, we can bring in enough money to pay down the debt. So, that is -- that is really what we're waiting for. We're waiting for a few months.

This stage of the market, we feel it's more prudent to be on a very strong cash position for anything that might happen for good or bad. There are going to be big opportunities on M&A I feel because many of the players, we talk about the smaller wholesale business general, we're talking about the number of companies that are not going to make it, they're going to be looking to be acquired. So, there should be some up on that at prices that we have not seen in years.
Operator
And we'll go next to Eric Beder with Wunderlich.
Eric Beder
You guys have done a great job of being very innovative with the product. When you look out, how do you keep that competitive edge in having just being like kind of the leader with these active brands and some of these brands here in terms of product offerings?
Oscar Feldenkreis
Well, Eric, that's a very good question. We have a strong organization overseas, we have a strong merchandizing team and we also have a development team in Asia that is very focused on helping us create innovative product, and we constantly-- our merchandizing team, oversea, is constantly reviewing what all new possibilities are out there to incorporate within our sportswear brands and our where best selling product today, as I've mentioned in just alone in golf and some of the introduction in performance fabrics into even Perry Ellis, which we just introduced a four-way stretch pant under Perry Ellis' performing extremely well. And that for us has, you know I've always believed product is king. You have product, consumers will buy regardless.
Eric Beder
Great. And when you look at Amazon and your own online e-commerce, how is that going and where do you think it should go over going longer-term?
George Feldenkreis
Well, e-commerce of us has been very strong. E-commerce even if you look at just this first quarter alone third-party e-commerce was up plus 10% and just alone in golf alone e-commerce was plus 15% this quarter. So, we're very excited with the opportunities as you know we mentioned last year that we invested heavily into photography studio in-house as well as now we are going to be adding videography, which will allows us to create more videos for our third-party and as well as our online e-commerce sites, which will allow us to have more -- the consumers have more knowledge about the product and as well as well as we are upping our game when it comes to social marketing and market digital marketing as well.
But we feel that there still a lot of run room for us to begin to open up additional e-commerce sites of our own within our portfolio of brands. We are planning on launching a laundry e-commerce side in the second half of the year, which we are very excited as you know was a dress market today, almost 50% of the dress market is done online. And we feel that this could be a great opportunity for us, and we are in the process now of looking at other golf brands that we launch online as well. We feel that DTC online definitely has a potential to be a $100 million business for us over the next three to five years.
Eric Beder
Question for David. In terms of inventories, you've done an outstanding job, in terms of reducing inventories around. How much more can you go?
David Rattner
Well, as George mentioned, our inventories are in excellent shape right now. We ended at a 140 million for the current quarter compared to running 150 million prior quarter. We our turns -- our approaching are right at four times at this point, and given where we are at we're comfortable with our inventory levels throughout the remainder of the year and we see inventories ending flat year-over-year from $150 million to $160 million.
Eric Beder
Okay. And different kind of question, you talked about -- we obviously know there's a lot of disruption right now in the retail environment. How aggressively and what are you guys doing to make sure that you are paid and that you have a deal with some of this retail bankruptcies or these companies loosing financial ability to pay debt?

David Rattner
We on the accounting -- on the AR side, we whatever -- I would say, we're pretty well funded with either a factoring or an insurance or we're carrying our own paper. But I would feel that our account receivables outstanding are in a pretty good shape.
Oscar Feldenkreis
Our receivables are -- we're very current, right now. We are in really excellent state with our receivables and we do monitor some of the riskier accounts very closely, making sure that we are not over extending ourselves from a credit perspective. So, we have a very diligent eye on receivables and certain customers.
Operator
We will go next to Greg Pendy with Sidoti.
Greg Pendy
My question I guess as you guys were early to see the downturn in the store base and took the pain awhile ago, but now on the call you mentioned the possibility of opening of new stores where they make economic sense. Can you just give us a sense of how you see in this environment? What is economic sense in the new store opening? Do you look on cash on cash returns? Or how are you viewing a potential new store? And what are the hurdles you're thinking about?
Oscar Feldenkreis
We're opening up more -- we're looking at doors very, very cautiously based upon the analysis that we're doing. They have to profitable I would within the first year. We're looking pop ups versus signing long-term leases. There is more pop opportunities. We just opened up a pop up in Aspen, Colorado, which we're very excited. It's about a six month opportunity and if we're successful, we will stay in that location, it's small, it's a 900 square foot store, so it's substantially smaller than the 800 or 2000 square feet that we've had before.
So, we're looking up pop ups, we're making sure that we're in the right location as we know in real estate location, location is very important and that’s the approach we're taking. We’re not going to be crazy opening up stores. We've opened up some new stores in the airport here in Miami, with Original Penguin and it's been extremely successful, generating over a $1000 a square foot. And we see that airport stores as a great opportunity as you know more there is more and more travelers today than ever before and we feel that could be a good opportunity for us in the long run.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will go next to Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst
This is Mac on Ed. Obviously, department stores have been challenged, we're wondering how you're feeling about orders moving forward. Specifically, are you seeing your partners become even more conservative or is it more so just status quo? And similarly for sporting goods, lot of consolidation and disruption in this channel, how do you feel about your product there, what’s working and what's not? And finally, can you give us an update on your swim business in the channel? Thank you.
Oscar Feldenkreis
Okay, we will take question number one, regarding department stores. Department stores have been planned flat. They started -- we plan the business since last year, almost six to seven months in advance, and we're planning our business with them in certain categories flat in other areas up. But of course that goes by geography, we've seen sales in the south east, south west let say United States continuing to do well, so that’s where the emphasis is going versus the mid tier of the -- the mid zone of the states geographically have been probably most challenged by because of weather et cetera that many have reported.
But we’re planning our business flat to a slight increase, but it's all depends on the brand and the actual retailer. When it comes to the sporting goods channel, golf is growing as I mentioned and we continue to see opportunities in the sporting good side. The retailers that have exited or gone out of business in the sporting good side, we were never selling them much except Sports Authority and Nike Swimwear where a lot of that market share has been picked up by the other retailers that are strong out there today either via e-commerce or via brick and mortar so we feel positive about the consolidation and less stores.

Nike is an extreme, is very extreme powerful brand and I would say that we are the leader when it comes to swimwear for all genders within the sporting goods channel and our business is up and we're trending up, we're having a great season. We've introduced a lot of innovative products like stretch and swimwear which has been brand new and that’s been very disruptive from the non-stretch product that has been out there and we're seeing basically it's all about innovation and servicing the customer both from a mobile digital perspective to brick-and-mortar.
Our swim business has been excellent as I mentioned first quarter was very strong, we delivered a lot more swimwear in Q4 and Q1 this year and last year, which has, we're fueling the sales of our growth both from sporting goods to the traditional department stores to chain stores to e-commerce sites. Our swim business continues to be extremely strong and very dominant and the same applies to our international business, our partners like with ASOS and in Mexico, Canada our business with Nike swimwear has been very-very strong.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you, and so for the men's business, are you seeing any new trends, I know you said linen was strong, but I believe that was also the case last year? Is there anything new you're seeing this year fashion wise?
Oscar Feldenkreis
Well, I think the disruption this year in the newness and men's wear has really been print, both the knits and wovens as well as stretch and bottoms has caused the consumer to go out there and replenish their bottoms wardrobe once they try a pair of stretch comfortable pant, maybe a pant or a short, that's what creating the replenishment needs for a consumer to go out there and buy something that they don't have in their wardrobe today. So, our bottoms business as I mentioned both in Golf and Perry Ellis are extremely strong, and we see that momentum very positive going forward, and we're applying the same technology by the way to our women's Rafaella bottoms business which has been very strong because we adapted some of the technology in our men's side to our Rafaella bottoms side.
Operator
And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the conference back over to George Feldenkreis for any additional or closing remarks.
George Feldenkreis
Thank you, I would like to thank all of our stockholder for your support and also to all our analysts who are in support of our efforts. We look forward to updating you on our start to fiscal 2018 after the first quarter. Have a great day. Thank you.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Perry Ellis International's Fiscal Year 2017 Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Results Conference. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on the call, either as part of the prepared remarks or in response to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such information is subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and in documents that we have filed with the SEC.
Joining us today for this call from Perry Ellis are George Feldenkreis, Executive Chairman of the company; Oscar Feldenkreis, Chief Executive Officer and President; and David Brettner, Chief Financial Officer; and Anita Britt who is assisting with the transition of the CFO office and is an additional resource to answer any questions.
It is my pleasure to now turn the call over to Mr. George Feldenkreis. Please go ahead, sir.
George Feldenkreis
Good morning. We've got to report on a good year for Perry Ellis International. We completed the rationalization of our brand portfolio and we are now fully focused on our core global branch. With numerous microeconomic issues affecting the apparel industry in the United States and worldwide, we are pleased to report that our core wholesale business increased by 1.6% or 3.2% on a constant currency basis.
Through our management of payment coupled with a strong product performance, we delivered an adjusted growth margin of 37.2%, a 440 basis points ahead of last year. We will continue focusing on our goal to drive our gross margin to 40% over the next few years. We've managed SG&A very well despite rising cost and overhead and trends, allowing us to report on adjusted EBITDA margin of 6.6% for the fiscal year and 8.4% for our fourth quarter.
With this back drop, we are confident to project an increase in revenues for fiscal 2018 to a range of $870 million to $880 million in revenues. We are projecting our revenue guidance for the year in the range of adjusted earnings per share of $2.07 to $2.17, which represent an increase over adjusted last year EPS.
It is why we think this is very achievable. We are concentrated, we focus approach to our various global core brand and businesses which are Perry Ellis, Original Penguin, [indiscernible] and the women brand. Oscar will inform you about the performance future of those businesses.
We have developed a very diversified customer base that can achieve solid results despite the fact that some of our business partners have experienced their decline. We all know that the department store business have been challenged. While department store business represent approach in nearly 25% of our business, we think that the tailored have taken the right step to rationalize their store base and clothes on the performing door.
We are also upholding the changes that the tailored are making to receive flaws ensuring that goods are in the selling floor when customers are shopping -- thereby driving fast returns and reduced markdowns. This will provide a more level flow for our quarterly reporting, as well on a quarter-by-quarter basis. At the same time we are intensifying our distribution through other third party ecommerce partners, specially the distribution, as well as through our international network which remains very underdeveloped.

Generally speaking, we believe that the new reduced retail space in America is a positive development in the long run, especially in light of the way which retail is moving these days and the demographic implication of generation Z, generation Y versus generation X. This alphabets of generations are really creating a no-paradigm which manufactures [indiscernible] have to learn to navigate if they want to succeed.
From a working capital perspective, we were able to reduce our inventory to $151 million compared to $103 million on the end of last year. This is our lowest inventory in the last six years. Strategic reduction on inventory allows to drive more profitable top line and allow your company to enter the new fiscal year in a very healthy condition.
Needless to say, we're extremely proud of the progress we continue to make toward our near and long term objective. The national business will continue to be very bullish in the United Kingdom as well as in Europe, Mexico and Canada. We feel that once we get a better idea of how Brexit will develop, business in the UK will increase considerably, while at the same time will continue to increase our business in the continent.
As strategic decreases of our multi-brand distribution in the Europe and the UK is paying out, we are now managing six brands which gives us a lot of runway to grow. Brands are Original Penguin, Farah Vintage, Farah Classic, Callaway, Ben Hogan and most recently Nike Swim. Nike Swim has had a very strong sales through in the few channels where we delivered this year. We expect this to be a great growth opportunity for the company in the future. We feel that in the next few years, our Nike Swim will be $100 million-business and have the potential to grow further as Nike Corporation extends our distribution territories.
On the retail of direct-to-consumer front which bidding [ph] sales declined more notably in our full price stores and some market. You'll recall two years ago we announced that we will be closing stores that are no longer profitable. Much of that profitability was lost because of rent increases by small operators. We're happy to report that last year, we closed 10 stores, six Penguin stores and four Perry outlets. These closed stores have revenue of $4.7 million last year.
Of that store contribution was a minus $1.2 million. We are now planning on closing five additional store that had revenues of $2.7 million last year and lost $700,000. After this five closing, we have 10 stores remaining that generate a negative furor [ph] of those will be closed in the next two years and consequently will return our retail businesses' strong profitability if not before then.
By the end of the year, we project to have 65 stores in the United States and we intend to continue opening stores with a more selective approach in an area where rents are commensurate with the potential revenue that these stores could generate in such sense. On the licensing front, we've completed another successful year, adding 22 new licensees to our seven of our branch. Organic revenue increased by 6.2% and is steadily growing. Licensing continues to make a strong contribution to our operating performance.
Our licensing team remains focused on new markets and categories for our programs as well as targeted opportunities for our license-only brand in addition to the strong pipeline of new project. We fully expect that the strategic growth of our direct business international will generate a national expansion of lives in business as we leverage the brand equity of our portfolio of brands.
We will continue to focus on what we do best among other things, global sourcing. We have great overseas organization that we just initiated in the production to engineering project or ERP. This project will allow us to reduce considerably time from product conception to store delivery. Process also involved working together with our business partners to achieve those results. Retailored are realizing of the currencies [indiscernible] in advance is no longer working and design will be done much closer to the delivery dates.

Very good competitor like Zara, H&M, et cetera have succeeded in this strategy of real-stint to market. American retailer most adapt such methodology or it will be impossible for them to compete with worthy competitors. We're investing in a new warehouse management system and reengineering and distribution centered to drive better efficiencies and to reduce our SGIA. We'll also continue to lower our sourcing cost by consolidating some of our overseas offices.
We believe that we are a very strong company. Unfortunately, some brand and some players in the industry have experienced major difficulties. Some of it the consequence of over-paying for brands have product equity group over-paying for business in the last few years while not having the proper management in place. By 2020, it is estimated that generation Y, those born in the 1990s or early 1990s will represent 30% of the retail business.
We continue to look at the future with confidence while we continue to build our brand that resonate with the younger generation of consumers, such as Original Penguin, Cubavera, Gione [ph], and especially Nike at the same time through our increased marketing activity, we keep our current followings happy while we work to bring in new customers. Our strategies have worked very well in the last couple of years and it has allowed us to establish a strong foothold in different channel, different geographies and different products.
We're very proud of our financial condition, it is strongest in 20 years. For fiscal 2017, the company performance and working capital discipline generated $42 million in operating cash flow or $2.78 per share, resulting in a historical low net debt to capitalization of 17.2%. We have a very strong balance sheet ready for future growth in both the United States as well as international. Your company is in great shape.
I will now turn the call over to Oscar.
Oscar Feldenkreis
Thanks, George. Good morning, to all in joining us on the call. First, I'd like to welcome David Rattner to the management team. He comes with a wealth of consumer product experience spending over 20 years at Elizabeth Arden. I look forward to his contribution to the company.
The fourth quarter marks our 13th quarter executed under our 5-point growth in profitability plan. We have made solid progress towards the objectives of focusing on our core lifestyle brands, which generated solid expansions in growth margin, EBITDA margins for the quarter and full year.
As it relates to revenues, our core brands performed well in total. Our revenues for the quarter trailed the prior year has increased conversions on our retail stores was offset by traffic declines driven by softness in the overall environment and we had a $12 million-shift in shipments to week-1 of fiscal 2018 due to retailers request. We completed the exit of over 30 brands and $100 million in revenues over the last three years, positioning us well to focus on our core global brands in the years ahead.
We continue to focus on the international expansion which is a 5% on a constant currency basis representing 14% of the total revenues. Our balance sheet ended the year in a very solid position with the strongest credit metrics we have seen in the company's history. Fiscal 2017 capped the year of outstanding inventory management with levels turning just about 4x per year and down 17% over prior year end. This will continue to be a key focal point for us for the years ahead.
The year included solid progress towards implementing initiatives that we believe positioned us possibly for the dynamic shifts in how consumers are shopping today. Focus on differentiated brand with a strong heritage and innovative qualities and accelerating their shift online. On both fronts, we believe we are set up to win.

We have positioned ourselves very well for the increase in focus on digital and ecommerce growth. While making the right investments over the last three years, we now serviced direct in third party ecommerce from design through fulfillment internally and have grown to represent 8% of our total revenue base.
Investments in cutting edge marketing technology platforms such as dynamic personalization, CRM driven segmentations and omni-channel attribution equips us to better drive our direct as well as our customer ecommerce business. Using CRM to build new prospecting segments throughout our digital marketing activities coupled with our customer-based loyalty programs have driven increased results across [indiscernible] in our target audience.
Another critical factor to our success has been an unwavering focus on evolving new products to meet the lifestyle needs of the consumer today. We have combined this focus with a steadfast discipline in our supply chain. We continue to make in-roads in forwarding our R&D capabilities into product coupled with providing a faster process and turn to that we can be proactive in design innovations and convert to the on-floor product. We are implementing new technologies in 3D design which will produce our process time as well as sampling cost.
With that said, we are operating in a global world where change is constant, consumers are demanding brands and product excellence and companies need to be both proactive adapters and agile in their execution. I'd like to touch on some of our key performance statistics for the quarter and I hope to leave you as excited as I am with our business initiatives.
Perry Ellis, we have heard from many of our retail partners that men's apparel was one of the top performing areas for the quarter. Our third party ecommerce continue to be the star of all distribution zones. We implement a new marketing initiative with many of our partners to increase the focus and investments around digital. This will ensure that we drive brand awareness through social media outlets which we believe will broaden the appeal.
From a product perspective, the units we delivered performed well. Driven by innovative technical fabrics with performance enhancing stretch, wicking [ph] properties as well as stain resistance in easy-care features. We also continue to benefit from our increase in wearing our fabrications which our consumers are looking for.
As we move through fiscal '18, we see performance attributes being a strong theme from a washable suit to our performance pants. We are not only maintaining our strong innovation flow, but also ensuring our enhancements, our top of mind with consumers through marketing campaigns and point of sale communications. And our expectations from the positive performance in men's to continue our support by a positive initial response to our transitional spring deliveries.
Most impactful is the consumers buying new units that he can wear immediately. This is driving a shift in our flow of goods to customers, ranging up to three weeks later to target the selling through our versus last year. We're excited by the change as we will provide a more even flow of shipments by quarters, making Q2 and Q3 more impactful. We also believe this will result in faster turn over on lower mark downs as our good reside on the selling floor for less time.
Original Penguin. Our fourth quarter for Original Penguin was solid. Our retail despite a lower shipments overall given our focus on reducing access inventory to alleviate the prominence of the brand. The strategy continues to be a successful one as evidenced by Original Penguin driving the largest percentage of our licensing gain for the year with five new agreements across the U.S., Europe, Canada and South Africa. We believe this brand is one of the largest opportunities for the future growth. Our priorities for OPG in fiscal 2018 are to increase specialties to our distribution, as well as ecommerce and as we look to partner with retailers that we believe enhances the cool factor of the Original Penguin brand. We are energized by the strength of the brand's direction and positioning.

Our leadership position in Golf apparel continues to be driven by product innovation and technology. During the quarter end year, this led to a solid increase in our core golf brands at wholesale and retail. Our technology-infused product assortments help ensure our customers be well-prepared to handle the temperature ranges in Q4 from cold to warm. This new innovative product led to strong performances in our lightweight layering programs, elements and weather series as well as in our optitherm series which has a thermal insulation, stretch, water and wind resistance.
Warm weather climatic zones benefited from our Motion Flow 360 stretch, mitts coupled with new expandable wait band bottoms and lightweight water repelling shorts which also drove solid sales. In fiscal 2018, our core golf business will continue to expand in distribution with key specialty retailers. The Callaway brand has taken on a more focused approach to grow our revenues and market share within the authentic golf channel. We will expand our growth to include Golf Galaxy, PGA Tour, super stores, Academy and Golfhound, just to name a few, as well as other fine golf courses.
As we see Europe as a continued growth opportunity for the Callaway brand today, we service all of Europe in more than 2,500 to 3,000 doors in the authentic channel. We're also excited about our Jack Nicklaus brand launch with Target set for second quarter. We feel that this is an excellent opportunity for Target to showcase a world-class brand with top-notch lifestyle products. We plan to launch in 1,650 doors, as well as an online for the summer of 2017.
AS you know, fourth quarter is a key period for the swim season. Our Nike Swim business return to a solid performance. We were very pleased not only with North America, but the initial early reads in our new markets of latter America and Europe. We are pleased with our international expansion and see more growth to come. In fact, at year end, approximately 13% of our business was represented outside of the USA.
As we look to spring, we believe we are positioned well as early indicators across all genders have been positive both online and in-store. Encouraging trend shows solid interest in women's, which is a major growth category to complement our men's business. Our product initiatives and stretch, swim fronts, UV protection and tops, dry fit and hydro tees are off to a strong start for the season. Equally exciting is our launch into key retailers in Europe including ASOS, Next, El Corte Inglés, JD Sports as well as swim specialty stores.
Turning to women's sportswear. While women's sportswear was a very challenging zone in the fourth quarter, we believe the Rafaella performed better than most branded businesses. Newness in our new fashion deliveries, coupled with our new denim which benefits launch in the third quarter were key drivers. Performance attributes including stretch and textured fabrication resonated well. As we are transitioning into spring products, we are pleased with our initial selling, which incorporates collections that bridge consumers' needs for the career into casual and we're also taking advantage of the undeserved plus size consumers which expanded our product offering.
Laundry saw success in the fourth quarter driven by holiday occasion dressings. As we look to fiscal 2018, we are expanding doors with key upscale retailers which is critical to the success of the brand. We are equally pleased by the strengthening of laundry online and are driving digital investments to continue the upward momentum.
We believe we have the key elements to support our business platforms. To continue our successful growth domestically and internationally and to further drive profitability gains, we have a more focused business pattern, we have solid momentum in many of our core brands and businesses at the start of the year and are particularly excited about the core strength of our men's wear business the new roll outs within Nike International and the golf lifestyle expansions into target with a highly talented team, strong lifestyle brands and initiatives in place to generate domestic and international sales growth at increased margins rate, we feel we are very well-positioned to achieve our guidance and move towards our longer term profitability goals.

I'd like to turn over the call to David Rattner.
David Rattner
Thank you, Oscar. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking Anita for the strong leadership she has provided to this organization. The company have benefited from her expertise and she has inspired people all across the organization with our passion for the business. I am truly excited to join the Perry Ellis team.
In the six weeks I have been with the company, I have met with the majority of our operating area and I'm delighted to be working with the company that not only has powerful brands, but also a strong infrastructure and an abundance of great talent across the organization. I am keenly focused on adding value in guiding the business from a finance perspective, but also keeping a very diligent eye on infrastructure discipline, as well as a very healthy balance sheet in support of our future growth plans.
Turning to the quarter, as outlined in the release, we discussed the challenges that we saw in the quarter which hindered our fourth quarter top line growth. Certainly, the team has been prevalent across the industry in the consumer space. With that said, we did perform very well on our core businesses as evidence by our healthy gross margin and tight inventory levels. I believe it's important to point out that for the year, we realized a solid 1.6% increase or 3.2% in constant currency in our core men's businesses.
Detracting from this growth were our planned exits in reductions in the challenging traffic at retail during the second half of December and January which we could not control. While we solidly converted more customers once they were in our stores, the traffic delta of mid-single digit declines in the first few quarters of the year to a 15% decline in Q4 was a huge obstacle to overcome.
The traffic trends also impacted our flow at year end with retailers once again looking to receipt later in their warehouse than the original plan. With that shift, we ended up shipping $12 million of goods in the first week of February from the original plan of January. Let me run you through our segments for the year. Revenue in our men's sportswear and swim segment totaled $625 million as compared to $641 million in prior year. Increases were noted in our Perry Ellis, Golf Lifestyle apparel and Nike Swim businesses. This growth was offset by business exit and the negative impact of foreign currency translation.
Revenue in our women's sportswear segment totaled $108 million, as compared to $127 million in the year ago period. Solid shipment growth within the department store channel was offset by reduction in special markets in [indiscernible] shipment, driven by a higher level of available goods in the marketplace.
Direct-to-consumer revenue totaled $92 million as compared to $97 million in the prior year. Comparable sales decreased by 1.7% for the year and 6.2% for the fourth quarter. Bump traffic was down 9.5% for the year and 15% for the fourth quarter. On a positive note, we converted stronger 50 basis points for the year and 125 basis points for the fourth quarter. By managing a sharper assortment in store, we kept comp margin through the year at plus 1% and down 3.8% for the fourth quarter.
Licensing revenues total $36 million, up $1.3 million as compared to $34.7 million in the prior year. This area of our business benefited from new agreements with the remainder driven by the strength of our core licenses for Perry Ellis and Original Penguin.
Moving on to total company results beginning with the adjusted gross margin, gross margin exceeded expectations as outlined in our release with fourth quarter gross margin expanding 150 basis points and full year 2017 gross margin expanding 140 basis points. The critical drivers for the quarter and for the year had been diligent inventory management, coupled with strong product focus which has driven stronger merchandising margins and solid retail performance.

Somewhat offsetting this expansion, foreign exchange negatively impacted gross margin by 40 basis points for the year and 50 basis points for the quarter. We have countered by taking strategic price increases where appropriate. We have also seen currencies moderate against the dollar and expect to see less pressure on gross margin from currency in the second half of fiscal 2018.
Adjusted SG&A totaled $62 million for the quarter as compared to $67 million in the prior year period. Full year SG&A totaled $263 million as compared to $267 million in fiscal 2016. During the year, we realized $6 million in SG&A savings, driven by reductions across our corporate structure and well as in more strategic sample productivity in numerous other areas.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventories ended the year in-line with our guidance of $151 million, down 17% from $183 million reported in prior year. Not only our inventory very tight, but aged goods are the lowest they have been as the percentage of inventory in five years. Turns expanded to just under four times for the year as well. Our operating performance coupled with inventory discipline enabled us to generate $42 million in operating cash flow for the year and continue to improve our coverage ratios. Our strong balance sheet puts us in great position to continue our global expansion in our key businesses.
Turning to fiscal 2018, the landscape continues to evolve. Retailers are becoming more focused on driving profitable sales in closing for core performing real estate. As seen during the recent holiday season, consumer focus on digital is gaining serious traction with not only the millennials, but with other generations including the baby boomers. Price is important to most consumers, but must be accompanied by quality and great fashion.
Our company is positioned exceptionally well to address these changing dynamics. We are leaders with our retail partners maximizing productivity of our ongoing stores by focusing on product, merchandise assortment and investing in digital asset.
As fiscal year 2018 is under way, we are excited about the future year. We entered the year with our retail partners having very clean stock levels. We have completed the heavy lifting of our brand and business exits executed over the last three years and our core businesses are performing well. Our forward revenue guidance for the year of $870 million to $880 million incorporates the carryover of $12 million in retailer shipments from Q4 and core growth of almost 2% or $15 million.
Our revenue guidance also incorporates a $7 million negative impact from foreign exchange principally in first half of the year as we anniversary the Brexit impact to the pound in July. We are planning direct-to-consumer even for the year as store exits are expected to offset healthy growth in ecommerce.
Driving our $15 million revenue growth expectation are the new introduction of Jack Nicolas Golf Apparel into Target, Nike Golf introductions into Europe and Latin America, as well as new introductions in Canada for Original Penguin, Golf and Perry Ellis. While we expect to see further growth, we believe it is prudent to remain curious with our guidance given the back drop of stored closures that continued to be announced.
Gross margins are expected to expand to approximate 37.3% to 37.5%. We continue to expect the same drivers of inventory management and product performance to position us to achieve this improvement. While not factored into our guidance, we do see opportunity for gross margin expansion in our international business in Europe as we take price increases beginning in fall 2017 to offset currency.
SG&A is expected to decrease to 30.3% to 30.5% of revenue from 30.6% of revenue in fiscal 2017. We expect EBITDA margin to increase in the range of 6.7% to 7%; depreciation and amortization should range $14.7 million to $14.9 million and interest ranging from $7.6 million to $8 million. Interest assumes the fed will step in another two to three times before year end. Our tax rate is expected to approximate 15% and shares are expected to increase slightly to a range of $15.3 million to $15.4 million. We see earnings per share ranging from $2.07 to $2.17 for the year. Finally, operating cash flow is expected to approximate $2 per share with capital expenditures approximating $15 million to $16 million.

As we look at the quarterly flow, Oscar has mentioned the reflow of goods by our retail partners to rebalance Q2, Q3 and Q4. We see approximately a three-week reflow which will decrease Q1 revenues by $41 million, but increase Q2 by $10 million, Q3 by $20 million and Q4 by $10 million. Therefore we expect Q1 revenues to range from $230 million to $235 million. We expect Q1 EPS in a range of $0.70 to $0.75 per share. Obviously with the reflow to the remaining quarters, we expect to see most quarters expanding in revenues and EPS.
In closing, while I'm new to the company, my goal over the next 100 days is to enhance our strategy with a focus on growth, optimal resource allocation, expense management and value creation. There is a lot of energy in the teams under George and Oscar and I am focused on identifying and implementing initiatives to make it even more efficient in the near future.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Eric Beder from Wunderlich. Please go ahead.
Eric Beder
Good morning. Congratulations on a great end of the year.
David Rattner
Thank you.
Oscar Feldenkreis
Thank you, Eric.
Eric Beder
When you look at some of the new issues here, for Target, what products are you offering there in terms of categories and is this your first time significant in Target?
Oscar Feldenkreis
We tested with them in Q3 -- some product that was this small golf collection under the Nicklaus brand and it was very, very successful and going into the Q2, we'll be shipping them a full collection that will include shorts and tops. It's our first entry into the store side. We have been doing swim wear with them -- ladies swimwear online only for the last couple of years and this is a new introduction in being able to develop a branded business with Target stores both in stores and online. But we're very excited about the opportunities going forward.
Eric Beder
In terms of the debt, you have that $50 million high yield piece of paper. I believe after April, you can call that at par. What are you assuming in your projections with that and what should longer term the debt levels be for you?
David Rattner
I'll take that one. This is David. As you know, we've done a solid job of generating strong operating cash flow, approximately $128 million over the last three years. Approximately $46 million was redeployed into capital including brand shops that have driven stronger gross margins across our businesses. We expect to generate another $2 per share in operating cash flow this year. Our immediate focus is to invest in our international businesses as well as our core menswear brands. We have also been opportunistic with share repurchases and have $9 million remaining under the authorized plan. We will continue to evaluate and purchase where appropriate. Last and very important, we have spoken about calling the remainder of our $50 million senior notes which mature in April 2019. We are taking a hard look at this which seems like an easy decision, but with much uncertainty around global, economic and political decisions coming down the road, we want to be prudent and we'll make the determination after the first half of fiscal 2018. So, stay tuned on this one.
Eric Beder
I get that your answer is you're not assuming anything in the estimates being changed in the capital structure?
David Rattner
It's not in the guidance.
Eric Beder
Okay. All right, guys, congrats and good luck on 2017 year.
Oscar Feldenkreis
Thank you, Eric. Thank you for everything.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ronald Bookbinder from Coker & Palmer. Please go ahead.
Ronald Bookbinder
Ah. Good morning and congratulations also on a very nice quarter.

Oscar Feldenkreis
Thanks, Ron.
Ronald Bookbinder
On Target, you guys entered Wal-Mart a number of years ago with the Ben Hogan brand. What kind of revenues were you doing with Wal-Mart in golf beforehand and what kind of revenues does Ben Hogan do today? Such that we can sort of see the opportunity with Target.
Oscar Feldenkreis
Wal-Mart is currently today worldwide, about a $50 million business.
Ronald Bookbinder
And it was basically a zero beforehand?
Oscar Feldenkreis
It was zero when we opened the brand. Basically we built it up with them and it's Canada, Europe and the United States and it's a full collection of product.
Ronald Bookbinder
And on golf, you guys have done a terrific job of building out your golf business. It's primarily shirts though and historically, your company has a very strong men's bottoms business. Is there an opportunity to build out a golf pant business? Not just shorts, but a golf pant business with the new fabric technologies that are out there?
Oscar Feldenkreis
Yes. Just to clarify, paying golf, we do men's and ladies and 30% of our business today is ups to bottoms ratio. So 70% to 65% tops, to 30% to 35% bottoms. That includes shorts and pants as well and we also do wind wear and fleece. So it's a full lifestyle collection that is available 12 months out of the year. And there's a lot of excitement going on in bottoms today because the bottoms business has been reengineered with expandable waist bands, new technologies. Also, stretch has played such an important role for the consumer to go out and replenish their wardrobe by buying stretch in their garments.
Ronald Bookbinder
On the stores, you were going to close more stores than you have. You sort of reset that after the landlords became more realistic. Do you regret now as we look at these comp figures from Q4 and the traffic trends? Are some of those stores that ended up being able to renegotiate the leases? Do you somewhat regret having those stores or how should we think about the store growth going forward?
George Feldenkreis
We identified the necessity to close stores before a lot of much bigger people announced it last year. In that sense, whatever would be negotiated, it was on the basis that the stores will be profitable. But we closed 10 stores last year and there's already one that we closed the year before. That's a big number when you're thinking that sale of 12% of our store. We're going to be closing the one-third -- decided when we close this year. We have another group and this has expired in '18 and '19 and those were big stores, too. If they don't improve, obviously, the traffic improved on our retail knowledge of the business improved, we're using all kind of system, et cetera, et cetera, to try to build traffic also in the marketing side. But in the final analysis, depending on what is the traffic in the center as some of the centers also are closing the big anchored tenant, it will act like everybody in that center. We have to be very careful now in omitting in retail, especially with some of the -- the trend is now that A&B super centers are going to be open and the CMDs are not. If you happen to be in a center that's not A&B, you have a very large percentage of probability that you will not be making money and if you're in A&B, the more developers are trying to balance their loss of income by increasing their rents on the A&B. That's why so many specialty store business are going out of business.
Ronald Bookbinder
Okay. The inventory is so tight right now and a nice [indiscernible] doing great. But how should we think about yearend inventory for fiscal '18?
David Rattner
Yes, this is David. I'll take that one. Our discipline on inventory management will be driven and focus throughout this year. Our inventory should be even at $150 million to $160 million range at year end. So it will be relatively stable year-on-year.

Ronald Bookbinder
Okay, great. Thank you very much and good luck in the new year.
David Rattner
Thank you.
Oscar Feldenkreis
Thank you, Rob.
Operator
And we'll go next to Greg Pendy from Sidoti. Please go ahead.
Greg Pendy
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call and congratulations on a good quarter. Just wanted to touch on the top line guidance and just how do you guys were thinking about coming up with that number and just given the fact that a lot of your competitors have a much larger store flick print. How they've pulled back on what they're shipping into that channel and whether that could create any wide space opportunities for you?
Oscar Feldenkreis
Can you repeat your question, please?
Greg Pendy
Yes. Just going into your guidance on the top line revenue for the year and just whether you've been seeing any pockets where a lot of the competitors have pulled back what they're shipping into that channel and whether that could create any opportunities.
Oscar Feldenkreis
We're always looking for opportunities in wide space and the great thing is that we're very focused today in our brand portfolio, but there is opportunity still today out there of course in-store and online. Our authoritative position within our brands portfolios today with Original Penguin, Perry Ellis and our golf business allows us to take market share as other brands either change their channel distribution or reduce their channel distribution. And the great thing is that we have a very diversified portfolio of customer base. As you heard from George, department stores are only a segment of our retail and then we also do business with the mid-tiers where they change stores and mass as well as authentic golf channel. So we feel that there is definitely still white space opportunity and remember that we also have the growth of many of the new initiatives as we discussed on the call.
Greg Pendy
Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then I guess just thinking about inventory turns. You said products moving -- I guess is hitting the shelves faster at retail. Just what your thoughts are about as the landscape for retail now, we're starting to see closures. Have you guys experienced any of those slower-moving store closures out there in the environment also aiding inventory turns at all, or is it too early to tell?
Oscar Feldenkreis
Well, we over the years -- retailers have been saying that their main focus is to make sure that they have the right assortment in their A&B doors and as well as the increase of online business has allowed us to ensure that the A&B doors are the doors that have the right assortment and the right level of inventory. Because other than the stores, really that turn inventory much more quicker than a CD et cetera level. So we're constantly analyzing our inventory in the actual stores and our weeks of supply to ensure that we're very fluid and be able to turn and reduce markdowns in the stores -- which at the end of the day, the higher your returns, the higher your sellthroughs, the less dilutions you have and the more productivity you can create in the stores.
Greg Pendy
Okay. Thanks. That's helpful.
George Feldenkreis
I also wanted to add, Oscar, that the retail, that our closing store are closing the worse stores and many of our products are not in those stores. Even when they are, those are the store that sell slowly the product and take big markdowns. In a way it might hit us in a 1% or 2% less sales, makes a penny or something like that. In reality, the markdowns probably will be less than what we lose on the revenue side.
Greg Pendy
Got it. Thanks.
Operator
And lastly, we'll go to Ed Yruma from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Ed Yruma
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Anita, if you're listening, best of luck going forward. Just a couple of quick things, I think first on this revenue shift, I guess what disability do you have particularly to the back half revenue? Do you have orders in hand or I guess what percent of the book at this state is complete to give us confidence that this revenue will actually just shift towards to disappear?

Oscar Feldenkreis
We're in the process. I would say that the first half of the year has already been booked and we're in the process now of finalizing Q3. So we have definitely confidence that this would materialize and we also planned our revenue numbers for this year based on the expectations that the holiday season again will be dismal as it has been for the last couple of years has been the track record. If we have the ability to do better, we will have the inventory available to be able to do more but it's -- we're very conservative, we're very cautious and as interest rates go up, retail is a very concern and also making sure that their inventories are part to when the actual trends are needed.
Ed Yruma
Got it. And George, you mentioned kind of agility and speed of supply chain, I know you decided obviously the successes that some of the vertically oriented retailers are enjoying. I guess as you think about kind of speeding up the supply chain in the way you go to market, could you contextualize kind of how many days or weeks you could take out of the existing supply chain and how you can be maybe more responsive to this rapidly shifting order patterns? Thank you.
George Feldenkreis
Look, the partner stores, especially and some of the other retailers and system having sample of products before they play, therefore, they -- you see what Amazon is doing by not showing a sample of anything they sell, the consumer is now getting more and more used but on a digital way. We have now introduced totally new software that you can look at the garment and see how it moves around the body under 60 degree. So that will avoid the necessity in many, many cases, especially in the mens business of fits and making sure that it fits etcetera; because you see it on the screen, the designer sees it on the screen but they can make adjustment on the screen, this is number one. Number two is if the buyers would be able to buy from the digital presentation we had a number of our class win, such a presentation with one of our major customers and it was a trivially successful. Buyers come by from digital whereas I'm asking for sample. You can cut the production process by 1.5 to 2 months because in that sense other than the product that we make for our own stores etcetera, etcetera, not lies where we take the -- but we are actually taking the risk of the product.
Other than that when we do a business with -- I mean actually majority of our business, it's all done by showing example before if you got that process, you will be able to cut a 1.5 to 2 months of deliveries. So you will be able to -- for example, normally on the swim business, you study March designing and show samples in July [indiscernible]. Then the buyers ask you -- they come to a shore in July and then they ask you to place orders in September. September to be delivered in December/January. Now if you can design in June, you will actually know what sold this year in December. So when you're this time for next year, you will have a much better idea that you have in the month of March before this year season even happens. So those things are really delaying the process of making product in a fast way and making it to the consumers in a fast way.
Ed Yruma
Great, thanks so much.
Operator
With no further questions in the queue, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. George Feldenkreis for any additional comments or closing remarks.
George Feldenkreis
Thank you. First of all, I want to take this opportunity to thank and interpret [ph] for a very important contribution to the growth and stability of this company. We are indebted to you Anita -- I'm sorry, for the great job you have done and we should be very best in your now future activities. I would like to thank all of our stockholders and annual shareholder and look forward to updating you on our start to fiscal 2018 after the first quarter. Have a great day.

Giving Back: A Family Tradition

Oscar Feldenkreis, president and chief operating officer of Perry Ellis International, is on a mission that extends far beyond continuing to increase company profits. That is almost a fait accompli for this talented entrepreneur with a strong vision, a creative edge and a passion for his work. Since joining his father, George Feldenkreis, founder of this leading company in men’s apparel, Oscar has taken the company to new heights, expanding product categories, acquiring trademarks, growing the customer base and, in 1993, taking the company public, soaring profits to an unprecedented level.







HERITAGE: Oscar Feldenkreis, CEO of Perry Ellis International, contributes to a number of Jewish causes.Share


For your average Joe, that would be quite a feat. But Feldenkreis is not average by any means, nor is he one to rest on his laurels. Instead, he works tirelessly to give back to the Jewish community, the State of Israel and various medical institutions committed to research.
After all, that is his family’s heritage. Fleeing communist Cuba when the young Oscar was only 1 year old, his parents found refuge, and later fortune, on the shores of Miami Beach, Fla. His father became very active in the Latin division of the area’s Jewish federation and soon became its president, holding meetings at the family home. Today, the younger Feldenkreis, sitting in his house overlooking Biscayne Bay in Miami, recounts listening to his father at the meetings and participating in the federation dinners as a young boy. He now holds a Cabinet position at the Greater Miami Jewish Federation. And each year he tries to donate more money than the year before.

“Being successful, you have to be able to share, and our family is very big on that — on being able to give back as much as possible,” Feldenkreis said. “We’re very much involved in Jewish causes, where I would say we give a big percentage of our donations.”
Each year, Feldenkreis donates tens of thousands of dollars to Miami’s Jewish federation. He also purchases vast amounts of Israel bonds to help bolster Israel’s economy, and he is contributing to the funding of the expansion of Temple Menorah in Miami Beach. His non-Jewish philanthropic efforts include donations to the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital.

Feldenkreis contributes to these organizations as a private individual and not on behalf of Perry Ellis, though he is driven to expand the business not so much for his own personal benefit but rather to increase his ability to give. With his philanthropic goals in mind, failure has never been an option for Feldenkreis. In fact, it’s failure that he fears. “I think that businessmen that have that type of fear will always be successful, because they are going to try as hard as possible to make sure that they do not fail,” Feldenkreis said.
Perry Ellis International achieved a great measure of success and expansion under his leadership. When Feldenkreis joined his father’s apparel business in 1979, he started a pants line that he called Feldini, an Italian spin-off of his last name, and he started developing what he calls “the bottom business.” With the same levelheaded practicality that he exuded during our interview, Feldenkreis recognized that the average American consumer did not want to pay $90 to $125 for pants made in Italy. He then realized that there was an opportunity to develop pants manufactured in Korea that made of 100% wool or woolen blends, would sell for only $50 to $70. It was this move that put the company in a relationship with Federated Department Stores, which in its day comprised the large department stores that dominated the apparel industry.
The momentum grew from there. Feldenkreis was responsible for the company’s tremendous growth spurt during the 1990s, with profits rising to $33 million in 1993 from $18 million only a year earlier. He and his father decided to take the company public on the Nasdaq exchange, turning the company’s fortunes, then $33 million, to an astonishing $54 million in one year’s time.
“We started to grow almost 100% every single year,” Feldenkreis said.
In 1996, the company acquired its first true brands, and today it boasts a composite of such familiar labels as Perry Ellis, Manhattan, John Henry, Mundo del Marco, Axis and Treaco St. Rafael, to name a few. Perry Ellis International is also the licensee for PGA Tour Golf and holds the license for all categories of Nike swimwear.
Feldenkreis is always on the move, seeking out new opportunities for his Miami-headquartered company with multiple offices in Asia and on both American coasts. “Our culture is very entrepreneurial. We’re about growth,” he said.
No one can say that Feldenkreis is all work and no play. To the contrary, he can be spotted each Hanukkah in Aspen, Colo., with his wife of 25 years and their three daughters, ranging in age from 19 to 24. “We light Hanukkah candles in Aspen,” he said. The five family members also enjoy boating, and they travel to Europe together during the summers. When at home, they enjoy traditional Sabbath dinners and keep kosher, Feldenkreis said with pride. Having attended Hebrew Academy of Miami Beach, Feldenkreis is a strong believer in passing down Jewish values to his children, who attended Jewish day schools. In fact, he begins each day by donning tefillin.
Feldenkreis is very active at Temple Menorah, a large, well-established Conservative synagogue in Miami Beach. As a board member, he serves on a committee charged with building an updated synagogue and a new social hall. “For the last 20 years, I have been doing the Israel Bonds campaign drive at Temple Menorah,” he said.
Feldenkreis recently ascended the podium as the honored guest of the 2007 Israel Bonds dinner, where he spoke about the complex issues facing Israel today and in the future. “It’s a very troublesome situation,” Feldenkreis said, describing the challenges that Israel faces and the breadth of Israel’s enemies, which, he said, reach far beyond the Palestinians.
His commitment to Israel is well evidenced. From 1989 through 1991, Feldenkreis served as chairman of Miami’s Israel-America Chamber of Commerce, helping businesspeople look for opportunities to import and export products between the United States and Israel.
“I think the biggest issue we have within the Israel-America Chamber of Commerce is that we need more people involved,” he said. “The local Israelis that have been very successful here should be much more involved.”
One of his personal goals is to take a more active role in federation activities.
“I believe as an American Jew that I have to give a big percentage of our commitments to the Jewish federation and support for the State of Israel,” Feldenkreis explained. He urges others to do the same. “The U.S. will continue to support the State of Israel… as long as [it sees] a strong Zionist-American movement for the support of Israel on a philanthropic basis. I think that there is a lot of need for American Jews that are not involved and have the power and the wherewithal to be able to give back to the State of Israel,” he asserted. “I believe that that’s something that we need to work on.”

Perry Ellis settles explosive lawsuit alleging racism, homophobia




A new lawsuit claims the ​COO of Perry Ellis ​International ​is a racist homophobe who told underlings to make sure there are “no blacks in my ads” or “anyone who looked too gay​.”
Oscar Feldenkreis, the son of Perry Ellis International ​founder, ​George Feldenkreis, allegedly ​made the hateful remarks to a gay senior executive, Joseph Cook, 49, who filed the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court Wednesday.
“Mr. Cook has been forced to endure highly offensive homophobic, racial, and ethnic slurs by Mr. Feldenkreis,” the suit ​claims, adding that Feldenkreis is slated to succeed his father as CEO next year despite his blatently discriminatory beliefs.
“These include, but are not limited to, admonishing Mr. Cook and his team to make sure there are ‘no blacks in my ads’ or ‘anyone who looked too gay’ and telling Mr. Cook he could easily avoid jury service by ‘telling them you hate n—–s and f–s.’”
​​Cooks also says in the suit that the racism came up when he was working to approve a Lord & Taylor print ad, with an underling comparing a model’s skin tone to a black Crayola crayon, according to the suit.
Cook claims that when he complained about the discrimination, the company retaliated against him with a campaign designed to isolate and exclude him.
​​“I am deeply saddened as a gay man and someone who has always been proud of who I am no matter my color or sexual orientation that a company executive could be so intolerant of others,” Cook said in a statement provided by his lawyer, Douglas Wigdor.
“I hope this lawsuit will change the views of leadership at Perry Ellis and bring them into the 21st Century.”
​​The suit names both Feldenkreis and Perry Ellis ​International ​as defendants and seeks unspecified damages.
​Perry Ellis denied Cook’s claims in a statement.
“Perry Ellis is a company that promotes equal opportunity and a positive working environment. The company is proud of the fact that it is probably one of the most diverse companies in the apparel business following its multi-cultural roots, stemming from Puerto Rico and Cuba,” the statement read.
“Perry Ellis categorically denies any allegations to the contrary. The claims that have been asserted will be vigorously defended against.”

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Even as a young child, Mr. Feldenkreis said, he spent quite a bit of money on clothing.Today, fashion plays a central role in Mr. Feldenkreis’s life as chief executive officer of Perry Ellis International. In 1980, he joined his father, George Feldenkreis, founder of the company, who now serves as executive chairman.Over the years, Oscar Feldenkreis has been involved in all aspects of the apparel retailer’s operations: he was named president and chief operating officer in February 1993 and was elected vice chairman in March 2005.In April, he became chief executive officer as part of the publicly traded apparel company’s succession plan. Mr. Feldenkreis said he shifted his focus to strategy and taking the company to the next level, which is building Perry Ellis into a global brand.To be successful today, he said, you have to be global, because people are increasingly shopping online as well as strongly identifying with the brand they want to buy. To meet customers’ changing tastes and shopping habits, Mr. Feldenkreis said, Perry Ellis International is adding more brands, growing its e-commerce platform and opening up more retail stores.In fact, the Original Penguin store at Miami International Airport is to open today (6/30) in Concourse D. At the end of the day, though, Mr. Feldenkreis said his biggest accomplishment is identifying with the others working at Perry Ellis International, who include each one of the company’s 2,400 associates. He said his instincts and vision can be good, but the company would not be where it is today without its “good team.” Mr. Feldenkreis said it’s much like the legacy of any great sport franchise, which he describes as all about the culture, passion and execution. In particular, Mr. Feldenkreis said he attributes his achievement to having his father next to him from the day he started working for the company. He sat in his father’s office, listening to him and how he conducted business, which he said was the greatest education he could have received.Miami Today reporter Susan Danseyar interviewed Mr. Feldenkreis in his office at Perry Ellis International headquarters.To read the full article and the rest of the Miami Today issue, subscribe to e-MIAMI TODAY, an exact replica of the printed edition.Share This PostTweet  AdvertisementRelated ArticlesRobert Rodriguez: Guiding NatCom to produce 1,500…Juan Acosta: Consolidates Viacom productions in new…Rene Ruiz: Fashion designer targets Hialeah…Profile: Stuart ChaseIra Coleman: To run international law firm McDermott…Eric Mendelson: Oversees high-flying aerospace…Ana-Marie Codina Barlick: Creating 120-acre Downtown…Martin Mendez: Spearheads IT change in health care,…Profile: Serge ElkinerRamona Messore: Develops a very different Saks for…Most Popular  92-story downtown tower OK’d for Miami’s skyline   Transportation planners factoring in autonomous vehicles   36-story tower replacing City Hall (the restaurant)   Hyatt lease tied to Brickell tunnel staging area   Miami to get a free fire station in Brickell   Restoration of Miami Marine Stadium a $40 million ticket   Professionals learn of plans to grow Miami International Airport   Mayor’s about-face on transit modes is compelling logic   Brightline rail will start with deeply discounted fares   Site pinpointed for new civil courthouse in Miami   Advertisement  Advertisement AdvertisementBreaking NewsArts & CultureBusiness & FinanceCommunitiesEducationFilmingFilming in MiamiFYI MiamiGovernmentHealthcareProfileReal EstateTransportationFront PageNewsBreaking NewsArts & CultureBusiness & FinanceCommunitiesEducationFilmingFilming in MiamiFYI MiamiGovernmentHealthcareProfileReal EstateTransportationOpinionCalendarArchives © 2017 Miami Today.
