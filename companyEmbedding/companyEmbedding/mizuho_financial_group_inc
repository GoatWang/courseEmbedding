Divisions and brands[edit]
Mizuho splits its business into four distinct divisions, on a global basis:
Retail Group[edit]
Mizuho is active in retail banking with 515 branches and over 11,000 automated teller machines (ATMs). Mizuho Bank is the only bank, other than Japan Post Bank, to have branches in every prefecture in Japan. It serves over 26 million Japanese households, 90,000 SME customers, and retail brokerage clients under the name Mizuho Investors Securities nationwide.

Mizuho Investors Securities
Mizuho Capital

Global Corporate Group[edit]
Mizuho predecessors, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), the Fuji Bank (Fuji) and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), had great control over many Japanese companies through keiretsu system. The three banks led the DKB Group, Fuyo Group and the IBJ Group respectively. The Fuyo Group traces its history as far back as the old Yasuda zaibatsu. Even now, seven out of ten companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have dealings with Mizuho.[5]

History[edit]
Mizuho was established originally as Mizuho Holdings, Inc. by the merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan in 2000.
Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. was established in January 2003 to become the parent company to Mizuho Holdings, Inc. in preparation for its restructuring of businesses. Subsequently, through a share exchange on March 12, 2003, Mizuho Financial Group became the sole shareholder of Mizuho Holdings, which in turn served as the holding company of all of the group's banking and securities units.
On October 1, 2005, all subsidiaries of Mizuho Holdings were transferred to the direct control of Mizuho Financial Group. Mizuho Holdings, no longer a bank holding company, was then renamed Mizuho Financial Strategy, which now focuses on providing advisory services.
Mizuho, through its operations in New York, became involved in the subprime mortgage crisis and lost 7 billion dollars on the sale of collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgages. Its entry was late, in December 2006; it did not participate in gains; only suffered losses. It is the Asian bank which suffered the most losses due to the crisis. The venture into this field has been traced to the employment of Alexander Rekeda, a specialist in this field hired away from Calyon, a unit of Crédit Agricole. Rekeda was made "head of structured credit in the Americas" where he floated several deals that turned toxic. He was later fired and Mizuho shut down its US CDO business. Examples of these included the Aardvark, Tigris, and Delphinius CDOs.[7] The latter two involved the Magnetar hedge fund.[8] Ironically, Calyon had sued Mizuho for hiring away Rekeda and other CDO experts in 2007.[9]

Divisions and brands[edit]
Mizuho splits its business into four distinct divisions, on a global basis:
Retail Group[edit]
Mizuho is active in retail banking with 515 branches and over 11,000 automated teller machines (ATMs). Mizuho Bank is the only bank, other than Japan Post Bank, to have branches in every prefecture in Japan. It serves over 26 million Japanese households, 90,000 SME customers, and retail brokerage clients under the name Mizuho Investors Securities nationwide.

Mizuho Investors Securities
Mizuho Capital

Global Corporate Group[edit]
Mizuho predecessors, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), the Fuji Bank (Fuji) and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), had great control over many Japanese companies through keiretsu system. The three banks led the DKB Group, Fuyo Group and the IBJ Group respectively. The Fuyo Group traces its history as far back as the old Yasuda zaibatsu. Even now, seven out of ten companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have dealings with Mizuho.[5]

History[edit]
Mizuho was established originally as Mizuho Holdings, Inc. by the merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan in 2000.
Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. was established in January 2003 to become the parent company to Mizuho Holdings, Inc. in preparation for its restructuring of businesses. Subsequently, through a share exchange on March 12, 2003, Mizuho Financial Group became the sole shareholder of Mizuho Holdings, which in turn served as the holding company of all of the group's banking and securities units.
On October 1, 2005, all subsidiaries of Mizuho Holdings were transferred to the direct control of Mizuho Financial Group. Mizuho Holdings, no longer a bank holding company, was then renamed Mizuho Financial Strategy, which now focuses on providing advisory services.
Mizuho, through its operations in New York, became involved in the subprime mortgage crisis and lost 7 billion dollars on the sale of collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgages. Its entry was late, in December 2006; it did not participate in gains; only suffered losses. It is the Asian bank which suffered the most losses due to the crisis. The venture into this field has been traced to the employment of Alexander Rekeda, a specialist in this field hired away from Calyon, a unit of Crédit Agricole. Rekeda was made "head of structured credit in the Americas" where he floated several deals that turned toxic. He was later fired and Mizuho shut down its US CDO business. Examples of these included the Aardvark, Tigris, and Delphinius CDOs.[7] The latter two involved the Magnetar hedge fund.[8] Ironically, Calyon had sued Mizuho for hiring away Rekeda and other CDO experts in 2007.[9]

Subsequently, through a share exchange on March 12, 2003, Mizuho Financial Group became the sole shareholder of Mizuho Holdings, which in turn served as the holding company of all of the group's banking and securities units.
On October 1, 2005, all subsidiaries of Mizuho Holdings were transferred to the direct control of Mizuho Financial Group. Mizuho Holdings, no longer a bank holding company, was then renamed Mizuho Financial Strategy, which now focuses on providing advisory services.
Mizuho, through its operations in New York, became involved in the subprime mortgage crisis and lost 7 billion dollars on the sale of collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgages. Its entry was late, in December 2006; it did not participate in gains; only suffered losses. It is the Asian bank which suffered the most losses due to the crisis. The venture into this field has been traced to the employment of Alexander Rekeda, a specialist in this field hired away from Calyon, a unit of Crédit Agricole. Rekeda was made "head of structured credit in the Americas" where he floated several deals that turned toxic. He was later fired and Mizuho shut down its US CDO business. Examples of these included the Aardvark, Tigris, and Delphinius CDOs.[7] The latter two involved the Magnetar hedge fund.[8] Ironically, Calyon had sued Mizuho for hiring away Rekeda and other CDO experts in 2007.[9]

Mizuho Investors Securities
Mizuho Capital

Global Corporate Group[edit]
Mizuho predecessors, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), the Fuji Bank (Fuji) and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), had great control over many Japanese companies through keiretsu system. The three banks led the DKB Group, Fuyo Group and the IBJ Group respectively. The Fuyo Group traces its history as far back as the old Yasuda zaibatsu. Even now, seven out of ten companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have dealings with Mizuho.[5]

Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. (株式会社みずほフィナンシャルグループ, Kabushiki-gaisha Mizuho Finansharu Gurūpu), abbreviated as MHFG, or simply called Mizuho, is a banking holding company headquartered in the Ōtemachi district of Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. The name "mizuho (瑞穂)" literally means "abundant rice" in Japanese and "harvest" in the figurative sense.
It holds assets in excess of $1.6 trillion US dollars through its control of Mizuho Bank, Mizuho Corporate Bank, and other operating subsidiaries.[1] The company's combined holdings form the second largest financial services group in Japan. Its banking businesses rank the third in Japan after Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, and the 13th in the world by total assets as of June 2016.[2] It is the 106th largest company in the world according to Forbes rankings [3] Its shares have a primary listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Mizuho offers a range of financial services, including banking, securities, trust and asset management services, employing more than 56,000 people in 900 offices.[4]

Divisions and brands[edit]
Mizuho splits its business into four distinct divisions, on a global basis:
Retail Group[edit]
Mizuho is active in retail banking with 515 branches and over 11,000 automated teller machines (ATMs). Mizuho Bank is the only bank, other than Japan Post Bank, to have branches in every prefecture in Japan. It serves over 26 million Japanese households, 90,000 SME customers, and retail brokerage clients under the name Mizuho Investors Securities nationwide.

Mizuho Bank
Mizuho Investors Securities
Mizuho Capital

Global Corporate Group[edit]
Mizuho predecessors, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), the Fuji Bank (Fuji) and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), had great control over many Japanese companies through keiretsu system. The three banks led the DKB Group, Fuyo Group and the IBJ Group respectively. The Fuyo Group traces its history as far back as the old Yasuda zaibatsu. Even now, seven out of ten companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have dealings with Mizuho.[5]

History[edit]
Mizuho was established originally as Mizuho Holdings, Inc. by the merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan in 2000.
Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. was established in January 2003 to become the parent company to Mizuho Holdings, Inc. in preparation for its restructuring of businesses. Subsequently, through a share exchange on March 12, 2003, Mizuho Financial Group became the sole shareholder of Mizuho Holdings, which in turn served as the holding company of all of the group's banking and securities units.
On October 1, 2005, all subsidiaries of Mizuho Holdings were transferred to the direct control of Mizuho Financial Group. Mizuho Holdings, no longer a bank holding company, was then renamed Mizuho Financial Strategy, which now focuses on providing advisory services.
Mizuho, through its operations in New York, became involved in the subprime mortgage crisis and lost 7 billion dollars on the sale of collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgages. Its entry was late, in December 2006; it did not participate in gains; only suffered losses. It is the Asian bank which suffered the most losses due to the crisis. The venture into this field has been traced to the employment of Alexander Rekeda, a specialist in this field hired away from Calyon, a unit of Crédit Agricole. Rekeda was made "head of structured credit in the Americas" where he floated several deals that turned toxic. He was later fired and Mizuho shut down its US CDO business. Examples of these included the Aardvark, Tigris, and Delphinius CDOs.[7] The latter two involved the Magnetar hedge fund.[8] Ironically, Calyon had sued Mizuho for hiring away Rekeda and other CDO experts in 2007.[9]

Its banking businesses rank the third in Japan after Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, and the 13th in the world by total assets as of June 2016.[2] It is the 106th largest company in the world according to Forbes rankings [3] Its shares have a primary listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Divisions and brands[edit]
Mizuho splits its business into four distinct divisions, on a global basis:
Retail Group[edit]
Mizuho is active in retail banking with 515 branches and over 11,000 automated teller machines (ATMs). Mizuho Bank is the only bank, other than Japan Post Bank, to have branches in every prefecture in Japan. It serves over 26 million Japanese households, 90,000 SME customers, and retail brokerage clients under the name Mizuho Investors Securities nationwide.

Mizuho Capital

Global Corporate Group[edit]
Mizuho predecessors, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), the Fuji Bank (Fuji) and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), had great control over many Japanese companies through keiretsu system. The three banks led the DKB Group, Fuyo Group and the IBJ Group respectively. The Fuyo Group traces its history as far back as the old Yasuda zaibatsu. Even now, seven out of ten companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have dealings with Mizuho.[5]

History[edit]
Mizuho was established originally as Mizuho Holdings, Inc. by the merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan in 2000.
Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. was established in January 2003 to become the parent company to Mizuho Holdings, Inc. in preparation for its restructuring of businesses. Subsequently, through a share exchange on March 12, 2003, Mizuho Financial Group became the sole shareholder of Mizuho Holdings, which in turn served as the holding company of all of the group's banking and securities units.
On October 1, 2005, all subsidiaries of Mizuho Holdings were transferred to the direct control of Mizuho Financial Group. Mizuho Holdings, no longer a bank holding company, was then renamed Mizuho Financial Strategy, which now focuses on providing advisory services.
Mizuho, through its operations in New York, became involved in the subprime mortgage crisis and lost 7 billion dollars on the sale of collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgages. Its entry was late, in December 2006; it did not participate in gains; only suffered losses. It is the Asian bank which suffered the most losses due to the crisis. The venture into this field has been traced to the employment of Alexander Rekeda, a specialist in this field hired away from Calyon, a unit of Crédit Agricole. Rekeda was made "head of structured credit in the Americas" where he floated several deals that turned toxic. He was later fired and Mizuho shut down its US CDO business. Examples of these included the Aardvark, Tigris, and Delphinius CDOs.[7] The latter two involved the Magnetar hedge fund.[8] Ironically, Calyon had sued Mizuho for hiring away Rekeda and other CDO experts in 2007.[9]

Divisions and brands[edit]
Mizuho splits its business into four distinct divisions, on a global basis:
Retail Group[edit]
Mizuho is active in retail banking with 515 branches and over 11,000 automated teller machines (ATMs). Mizuho Bank is the only bank, other than Japan Post Bank, to have branches in every prefecture in Japan. It serves over 26 million Japanese households, 90,000 SME customers, and retail brokerage clients under the name Mizuho Investors Securities nationwide.

Mizuho Investors Securities
Mizuho Capital

Global Corporate Group[edit]
Mizuho predecessors, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), the Fuji Bank (Fuji) and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), had great control over many Japanese companies through keiretsu system. The three banks led the DKB Group, Fuyo Group and the IBJ Group respectively. The Fuyo Group traces its history as far back as the old Yasuda zaibatsu. Even now, seven out of ten companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have dealings with Mizuho.[5]

History[edit]
Mizuho was established originally as Mizuho Holdings, Inc. by the merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan in 2000.
Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. was established in January 2003 to become the parent company to Mizuho Holdings, Inc. in preparation for its restructuring of businesses. Subsequently, through a share exchange on March 12, 2003, Mizuho Financial Group became the sole shareholder of Mizuho Holdings, which in turn served as the holding company of all of the group's banking and securities units.
On October 1, 2005, all subsidiaries of Mizuho Holdings were transferred to the direct control of Mizuho Financial Group. Mizuho Holdings, no longer a bank holding company, was then renamed Mizuho Financial Strategy, which now focuses on providing advisory services.
Mizuho, through its operations in New York, became involved in the subprime mortgage crisis and lost 7 billion dollars on the sale of collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgages. Its entry was late, in December 2006; it did not participate in gains; only suffered losses. It is the Asian bank which suffered the most losses due to the crisis. The venture into this field has been traced to the employment of Alexander Rekeda, a specialist in this field hired away from Calyon, a unit of Crédit Agricole. Rekeda was made "head of structured credit in the Americas" where he floated several deals that turned toxic. He was later fired and Mizuho shut down its US CDO business. Examples of these included the Aardvark, Tigris, and Delphinius CDOs.[7] The latter two involved the Magnetar hedge fund.[8] Ironically, Calyon had sued Mizuho for hiring away Rekeda and other CDO experts in 2007.[9]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
