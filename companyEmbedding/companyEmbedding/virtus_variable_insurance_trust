Virtus to Become Advisor to Phoenix Edge Series Fund Under Agreement with Phoenix Companies



HARTFORD, Conn., July 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Phoenix Companies, Inc. (NYSE: PNX) and Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRTS) today announced they have reached an agreement for Virtus to become the advisor and distributor to the Phoenix Edge Series Fund, a variable insurance trust.  Virtus will rename the trust the Virtus Variable Insurance Trust and market the current and new investment strategies to other insurance and annuity companies.
(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090105/NEM020LOGO )
(Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20090105/NEM020LOGO )
On July 26, the Edge Series board of trustees approved the appointment of Virtus as advisor and distributor of the trust and several fund mergers that, if approved by fund shareholders, should improve the scale and marketability of the trust.
The trust comprises 17 funds and $1.6 billion in assets (at June 30, 2010) that are investment options in Phoenix's variable life and annuity products.  Virtus currently serves as administrator to the trust and subadvisor to $300 million of fund assets, and will assume subadvisory responsibilities for an additional $500 million of fund assets.  Goodwin Capital Advisers, an affiliate of Phoenix, and Aberdeen Asset Management will continue to manage $700 million of assets under subadvisory agreements with Virtus.
Four of the funds, with approximately $100 million of assets, will not be part of the transaction and will be merged into a third-party variable insurance trust at a later date.  Phoenix has an additional $2.2 billion of variable product assets managed by external advisors.
Philip K. Polkinghorn, Phoenix's senior executive vice president, business development, and president of the Phoenix Edge Series Fund, said the transaction is consistent with the company's recent history of strategic partnerships with organizations that can provide particular expertise and benefit Phoenix customers.
"We believe Virtus is best suited to the roles of advisor and distributor because of its track record in adopting funds and solid historical investment performance.  These two attributes will help it attract more assets and allow fund shareholders to benefit from economies of scale, in addition to a refreshed portfolio with a wide range of investment options.  Given Virtus' existing roles, we believe this transition will be seamless and efficient," Polkinghorn said.
George R. Aylward, president and chief executive officer of Virtus, said the transaction offers several benefits to Virtus as well.  In addition to preserving the current economics from its roles as fund administrator and subadvisor, the transaction provides Virtus with an opportunity to improve scale in its business by managing the additional funds and by creating new product and distribution opportunities.
"This is an important step in Virtus' growth strategy because it increases our assets under management by $1.2 billion and gives us a new product line that we can offer to other insurance companies as we expand our distribution reach into the variable insurance trust marketplace," Aylward said.  "We look forward to building on our relationship with Phoenix customers and offering our investment management and administration expertise to other insurance companies."
Financial terms of the agreement, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, were not disclosed, but the economics of the transaction will be based on assets under management going forward.

Performance data quoted represents past results. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative total returns.
The investments for the Series are managed by the same portfolio manager(s) who manage one or more other funds that have similar names, investment objectives and investment styles as the Series. You should be aware that the Series is likely to differ from the other mutual funds in size, cash flow pattern and tax matters. Accordingly, the holdings and performance of the Series can be expected to vary from those of the other mutual funds. Shares of the separate Series of Virtus Variable Insurance Trust are sold only through the currently effective prospectuses and are not available to the general public. Shares of the VIT Series may be purchased only by life insurance companies to be used with their separate accounts which fund variable annuity and variable life insurance policies or qualified retirement plans and are also available as an underlying investment fund for certain qualified retirement plans. The performance information for the Series does not reflect fees and expenses of the insurance companies. If such fees and expenses were deducted, performance would be lower.
Morningstar Disclosures:The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accouts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Performance data quoted represents past results. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative total returns.
The investments for the Series are managed by the same portfolio manager(s) who manage one or more other funds that have similar names, investment objectives and investment styles as the Series. You should be aware that the Series is likely to differ from the other mutual funds in size, cash flow pattern and tax matters. Accordingly, the holdings and performance of the Series can be expected to vary from those of the other mutual funds. Shares of the separate Series of Virtus Variable Insurance Trust are sold only through the currently effective prospectuses and are not available to the general public. Shares of the VIT Series may be purchased only by life insurance companies to be used with their separate accounts which fund variable annuity and variable life insurance policies or qualified retirement plans and are also available as an underlying investment fund for certain qualified retirement plans. The performance information for the Series does not reflect fees and expenses of the insurance companies. If such fees and expenses were deducted, performance would be lower.
Morningstar Disclosures:The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accouts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
