FRANK LUCENTE


Obituary
Condolences


































 LUCENTE Frank P. Lucente, 92, passed peacefully in his Jacksonville, Florida home on February 24, 2013. Frank was born in San Jose, California and attended San Jose State College (University), where he studied business and lettered in baseball and football. Frank entered the U.S. Army in 1942 and served proudly in the Pacific Theater of Operations during WWII. He was commissioned and promoted to First Lieutenant in the 82nd Infantry Division, serving as an infantry officer with the first occupation force in post-war Japan. Honorably discharged from active duty in 1946, Frank remained in the Army reserves until retiring in 1960 with the rank of Captain. Following the war, the native Californian began a long and successful career as a real estate title insurance executive in Florida. He joined Title & Trust Company of Florida in 1966 and later became its Executive Vice President, a role he held for more than 30 years. Highly respected in his profession, Frank was elected president of the Florida Land Title Association and chairman of the Florida Title Underwriters Bureau. He was active in many professional and civic organizations, including the University Club, Ye Mystic Revelers, the Elks Club, and the Civitan Club. A lifelong sportsman, Frank particularly cherished the University of Florida Gators and the game of golf, which he played at a high level. He was a past member of Hidden Hills Country Club, Ponte Vedra Club and, most recently, Deerwood Club. Frank joins the love of his life and wife of 27 years, the former Jean Eason, who passed in 2005. He is survived by loving sisters Ann Braze, Mary Sortino, and Emily Harris, brother Louis (Hank) Lucente, sister-in-law Audrey Lucente, brother-in-law Chuck Harris, numerous loving nieces, nephews, and other extended family (in California, Florida, and elsewhere) and a legion of friends in Jacksonville (many of whom became Frank s second family on the East coast). All will miss and fondly remember his ready smile, his Italian salads, and the infectious laughter of a man who worked hard, loved well, and enjoyed life to the fullest. Visitation will be held 6:00-8:00 pm, Sunday, March 3, 2013 at Hardage-Giddens Funeral Home of Mandarin, Graveside services will be 11:00 am, Monday, March 4th at Greenlawn Cemetery, 4300 Beach Blvd, Jacksonville 32207. In lieu of flowers, memorials in Frank s name may be directed to Vitas Innovative Hospice Care, 10151 Deerwood Park Blvd., #250, Jacksonville, FL 32256. Arrangements are under the care and direction of Hardage-Giddens Funeral Home of Mandarin, 11801 San Jose Blvd. Jacksonville, FL 32223. www.hgmandarin.com (904) 288-0025.
