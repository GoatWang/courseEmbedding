Durability
Everything we make starts with high strength 12 GA Steel. It's then precision cut with a laser, formed, welded, steam-cleaned & coated to produce a solid, strong & dependable industrial storage solution.









Safe & Secure
Our three-point locking system is designed for a heavy padlock. This feature, along with our cast handle & 8 GA hinge, compliments the 12 GA welded design. See our other secure locking options.









Fully Assembled
At Strong Hold our products ship completely assembled & ready to use. There is no lost time for assembly, shelving installation, setup or on-site modifications which saves you valuable time and resources.











Custom Solutions
Everything we make can be customized. Strong Holdâs custom design & build capabilities have earned us the reputation for creating innovative solutions to complex storage challenges.









Quick Ship
Stocked items typically ship within 3 days of the order. Made-to-order items vary. See Sales Associate for more information.









Stainless Steel
Every unit we manufacture can be produced in 12 GA #304 stainless steel. We have taken stainless steel storage to another level by producing products that will last forever while maintaining clean-ability. 











99 Year Warranty
Manufactured under the highest standards of quality & workmanship & have been known as best-in-class industrial storage solutions. We stand behind the craftsmanship & the quality of our products.









Low Cost of Ownership
Letâs face it, you get what you pay for. Buy once with Strong Hold. Our cabinets essentially last forever. Why deal with the headache of replacing a failing lighter gauge problem year after year?









Tool and Part Storage
Designed and exclusively built for extreme environments to keep your tools & parts safe & secure on the shop floor, facilities, warehouses, garages, plants, buildings or wherever you intend to put them.






Why Strong Hold?

Made in Louisville, KY U.S.A. our products are not only designed for the customer, but also with the harshest environments in mind.
Our Industrial Cabinets, Workbenches, Shop Tables, Shop Desks and Tool Carts can be found nationwide in heavy duty manufacturing environments.
Everything we make is constructed of top grade 12 GA Steel paired with one piece body design (excluding stainless steel), that minimizes welds and increases strength, making them the strongest industrial cabinets, storage and workspace solutions you can buy.

Most cabinets featuring bins come with our 3-point locking system, padlock hasps, and sturdy 7 GA legs and are designed for rough industrial environments. Plastic bins are constructed of polypropylene and have a hopper front with label holder. They can be removed for easier part selection and restocking. Our metal bin storage units feature moveable dividers and provide additional strength.
Clear View cabinets make visual inspection of shelf and cabinet contents easy while remaining secure behind our 3-point locking system. Locate supplies, parts and other items without having to open the unit. All clear view cabinets are manufactured from 12 GA steel.
Strong Holds industrial computer cabinets are a durable option for protecting valuable computer equipment, monitors and machinery controls. Security and protection of these items from harsh environments is critical to keeping production flowing. Manufactured from 12 GA steel, featuring an all-welded one-piece body, industrial computer cabinets are designed to last a long time. Most computer cabinets are completed with power strips and ventilation fans while all units come equipped with our 3-point locking mechanism, secured by using with a standard padlock.
All Strong Hold flammable liquid storage cabinets have quality construction throughout. These all-welded double-wall cabinets feature 12 GA exterior walls and 16 GA interior walls spaced 1 1/2 apart making them extremely strong. Air vents on each side of the cabinets allow for ventilation. The manual closing double doors include our 3-point locking system. Each cabinet features a catch pan under the floor of the cabinet which contain potential spills. Flammable Storage cabinets are also coated with a high-visibility yellow paint making them easy to locate inside of facilities. 
All welded, extra heavy-duty storage cabinets are the smart way to store equipment.
Industrial uniform cabinets can be found in many different environments and industries. These cabinets are the perfect solution for maintenance and janitorial crews where most include hanger rods for uniforms and apparel while maintaining the functionality and security of a Strong Hold 12 GA steel cabinet.
Options and accessories allow our customers to better fit our products to meet your precise needs. Whether it is adding lighting to a cabinet, power to a workbench, casters on a shop table, Strong Hold can help you get the most from our line of storage products. Dont see the option or accessory you require dont worry, simply note to our sales staff and we will integrate it into a made-to-order build that is right for you.

Designed for the elements, outdoor cabinets have a durable and element resistant powder coat finish, they are constructed with a sloped-top roof and a rain guard to shed water off of the unit and all outdoor cabinets come with gasket-sealed door frames to keep dust, debris and the elements out. All of the industrial ruggedness of our standard industrial cabinets with the weather resistant qualities needed for long term outdoor usage.
Our industrial lockers are ideal for storing personal items, keeping the shop floor clean and free of clutter. Strong Hold offers a variety of multi-tier units with compartments designed to store uniforms, ventilation for breath-ability, and shelving strong enough to hold heavy items. Whether you need a single unit or a bank of 4 tiered lockers we can build it. As always our industrial lockers are constructed of 12 GA steel, making them the strongest and longest lasting industrial lockers you will ever need.
Roll-Up Door cabinets provide ease of access and are designed to provide security where space is limited. Most of our popular
industrial cabinets can also be built with the roll-up door option.

Service carts are ideal for areas around heavy equipment and are perfect for maintenance crews. They ease the process of moving tooling and parts around the shop floor. Most service carts can withstand a 2,000 lb. load. We offer a number of sizes and configurations of service carts. Have specific tooling to match? Let our sales staff know whether you prefer CAT 40 or CAT 50 and we will punch tooling racks to fit your needs.
Strong Hold specializes in industrial storage cabinets and products for the many unique needs industry creates. Did you know we also make a full line of closed shelving units as well? All of the form and function of our standard heavy duty cabinets with industry-leading shelf and drawer capacities.
Industrial Shop Desks are commonly found in assembly areas, maintenance departments, in warehouses, on shipping and receiving docks in commercial buildings. Strong Holds shop desks feature a 3-point lock system, wrap-around one-piece design, 7 GA steel legs (with 6 sweep space) and shelves that are secured by 3/8 carriage bolts. These features, along with an industrial enamel finish, produce a solid, strong and dependable desk for staying organized but most importantly, the unit will last forever and stand up to harsh environments.
Our shop tables meet and exceed weight capacity requirements of todays industrial manufacturing environments. Our tables create the ideal work surface and stand up to rigorous punishment. Some are even designed to support up to 20,000 lbs.! Thats a lot. Our industrial shop tables are also designed to not only be strong, but also fit in the space you need. We offer countless sizing options as well as maple tops, stainless steel tops, ABS plastic, UHMW plastic, blanched steel tops, and ˝ plate steel top options.
Strong Hold's site storage cabinets and tool boxes are always on the job. They are also extremely durable and rigid. Our heavy-duty job site boxes secure valuable tools and equipment when not in use. As with all products we make, items ship fully assembled and are ready for use.
Every industrial storage product we manufacture can be produced in 12 GA #304 stainless steel. We have taken stainless steel storage to another level by producing products that will last forever while maintaining the clean-ability of stainless steel surfaces. These items are corrosion-resistant, acid-resistant, and will take the everyday abuse of an industrial environment. This includes stainless steel tool carts, stainless steel workbenches, stainless steel desks, stainless steel tables, and stainless steel cabinets.
These are not your everyday light gauge tool carts; these are Strong Hold tool carts. What is the difference? 12 GA steel flat sheets are bent to form solid one-piece bodies, heavy-duty casters are used to provide mobility and drawers with up to 400 lb. capacities are used on ball-bearing slides. Most tool carts we manufacture can support at a minimum, 2,000 lbs. Dont see an option that meets your needs? Not to worry, Strong Hold manufactures custom tool carts as well.
Ventilated cabinets are available in various widths and heights. They are ideal for industry, health clubs or any facility where personal belongings need to be securely store but vented. The 12 GA steel doors are perforated with a diamond shape for easy visibility and ventilation.
This may sound like a broken record but it is true; Strong Hold Products manufactures the strongest and most durable industrial storage products. Our industrial strength workbenches dont hold back. We use 12 GA steel to form the bodies, paired with 7 GA steel plate tops or optional maple butcher block tops, stainless steel, ABS, UHMW or ˝ inch steel plate tops, then add 7 GA steel legs or heavy-duty casters to support the loads. The rest is up to you. We offer pegboard, lighting, electrical, drawers, shelving, locking compartments, casters, bins, etc.  Dont see exactly what you need? Let us build it for you.

Successful products supported by strong pipeline


HAL Allergy scientists focus on the development of allergen specific immunotherapies for the worldwide treatment of patients suffering from airway, bee- and wasp venoms and food allergies.
The product portfolio consists of a number of registered products (i.e., PURETHAL® Grasses, PURETHAL® Trees, VENOMENHAL® Bee, and VENOMENHAL® Wasp) and a pipeline of various clinical stage products:
  PURETHAL® Mites: An allergoid preparation of house dust mites extract for subcutaneous injection   SUBLIVAC® FIX Grasses: A liquid preparation containing grass pollen extract for sublingual use   SUBLIVAC® FIX Trees: A liquid preparation containing tree pollen extract for sublingual use   SUBLIVAC® FIX Mites: A liquid preparation containing house dust mites extract for sublingual use   A hypoallergenic peanut extract for subcutaneous administration.  ... PURETHAL® Mites, SUBLIVAC® FIX Trees, SUBLIVAC® FIX Grasses, and SUBLIVAC® FIX Mites are available in several European countries as named patient products. The clinical program for these products described above is conducted under the Therapieallergene-Verordnung (TAV), the regulatory process under which immunotherapies that were on the German market when the regulation came into effect (Nov 14, 2008) will be licensed. 
Next to the allergen specific immunotherapies, HAL Allergy has a portfolio of registered allergen preparations for diagnostic use.
