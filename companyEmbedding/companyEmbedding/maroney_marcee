Rapid-gelling biocompatible polymer composition and associated methods of preparation and use



Patent number:  6624245
                                            

Abstract:  A method is provided for the rapid formation of a biocompatible gel, and may be carried out in situ, i.e., at a selected site within a patient's body. The method involves admixing a biocompatible crosslinking component A having m sulfhydryl groups wherein m&gE;2 and a biocompatible crosslinking component B having n sulfhydryl-reactive groups wherein n&gE;2 and m&plus;n>4, wherein the sulfhydryl-reactive groups are capable of covalent reaction with the sulfhydryl groups upon admixture of the components under effective crosslinking conditions to form a gel in less than one minute. Suitable reaction conditions for carrying out the crosslinking reaction will depend on the particular components and the type of reaction involved; that is, the “effective crosslinking conditions” may involve reaction in bulk or in a solvent, addition of a base, and/or irradiation of the admixture in the presence of a free radical initiator.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant

Rapid gelling biocompatible polymer composition



Patent number:  6312725
                                            

Abstract:  This invention relates generally to two-part polymer compositions that rapidly form covalent linkages when mixed together. Such compositions are particularly well suited for use in a variety of tissue related applications when rapid adhesion to the tissue and gel formation is desired. In particular, they are useful as tissue sealants, in promoting hemostasis, for drug delivery, in effecting tissue adhesion, in providing tissue augmentation, and in the prevention of surgical adhesions.

Filed: 
                        April 16, 1999
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        November 6, 2001
                        

Assignee:
