But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Houston, MS professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Houston, MS portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Houston, MS professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in Houston

Welcome to Osborne Wood Products, Inc. Since 1979 we have been providing the professional and non-professional woodworker alike with beautifully crafted table legs, island legs, corbels, bun feet, and mouldings. We would like to welcome you to our site, where you will find every product we offer. Feel free to browse our paper catalog here, or view our current specials here.




										Decorative Corbels
Also known as wood brackets,  wood corbels have been a staple of interior and exterior architecture since the Victorian Era. 

Incorporating a host of designs, unfinished wood corbels are available in Mission-Style or Contemporary Style, Basket Weave or Classic, or even with Acanthus Leaf or Grape carvings. Be assured that our industry leading designs will be suitable for a home of elegance. Custom carved corbels are also available upon request. Our selection of corbels also covers a variety of sizes so that a perfect fit is possible for any application whether it is under a countertop or a cabinet. 

										Kitchen Island Legs
Just as the theme or decor of a given home could have endless possibilities, so we also have myriad options in our kitchen island leg line to meet those varying needs. 

Kitchen Island Legs or Cabinet Legs can give kitchens a look of sophistication and elegance along with be function components. Island Legs are used many times as countertop supports or can be split in half and applied to the face of a cabinet. We are confident that our selection of island legs will fit any kitchen. Styles including traditional, reeded, twisted, contemporary, and mission are all hand crafted, emphasizing the detail of design. With most of our posts available at 34 ½ and 35 ½ inches tall, several posts are also available at the 40 ½ inch height to accommodate bar height cabinets and eating areas.
