Jeffrey C. Sprecher (born c. 1955) is an American businessman and is the Founder, Chairman and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.
Early life[edit]
Sprecher was born in Madison, Wisconsin, U.S., where he attended James Madison Memorial High School.[1] He was initiated in Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Wisconsin Alpha Chapter.[2] He received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1978 and an MBA from Pepperdine University in 1984.[3][4]
Career[edit]
Sprecher's first job was at Trane, where he met William Prentice who was developing power plants following deregulation. Prentice offered him a job at Western Power Group in 1983.[5]
Energy Policy Act (1992) passed and deregulation in the electric industry started. Those working in the "electric industry realized the need for real-time, continentwide transactions", made possible by "Continental Power Exchange" technologies whereby "individual businesses and consumers may one day be able to select an energy provider in the same way that individuals shop for long-distance telephone service."[5][6]
In 1996 he bought the Continental Power Exchange in Atlanta, Georgia from MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company for $1 plus the assumption of debt, which became the foundation for IntercontinentalExchangeICE.[5][6]
In the 1990s energy trading was handled manually by "Continental Power Exchange, an electronic energy trading company.[5][6] By 1997 Continental Power Exchange CPEX had "a federated software structure in place, CPEX... ready to expand to more servers as growth demands. CPEX's hardware and server architecture [were] capable of supporting foreseeable changes that may be necessary when the client load arrives. Continental [intended] to stay at least one step ahead of the marketplace."[7]
Sprecher started Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in 2000 as an online marketplace for energy trading in Atlanta—"a sort of eBay for energy." They sold equity stakes to "big hitters like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley." The idea was to be a "competitor to Enron". "Specher's business model was to provide an electronic marketplace where buyers and sellers could trade directly". When Enron imploded, ICE soared."[8]
Shortly after the company approached Enron to be a client, Enron started its own competing electricity trading platform, which dominated the market. Enron's market model was to buy from every seller and sell to every buyer. Wall Street bankers, particularly Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, backed him and he launched ICE in 2000 (giving 80 percent control to the two banks who, in turn, spread out the control among Shell, Total, and British Petroleum. When Enron's exchange collapsed in 2001 in the Enron scandal, ICE's business exploded.[4][5]
Since then the company has expanded including the following acquisitions:

International Petroleum Exchange in 2001[5]
New York Board of Trade in 2006[5]
Creditex in 2008
The Clearing Corporation in 2009
Climate Exchange in 2010
NYSE Euronext in 2013
In November 2013, ICE announced its acquisition of Singapore Mercantile Exchange[9]
SuperDerivatives in 2014

WHEN nearly all else had failed, Jeffrey C. Sprecher flew to New York City and crashed at his sisters’ apartment, a cramped walk-up on the Upper West Side, one flight above a noisy bar.It was January 2000, and Mr. Sprecher had been cold-calling Wall Street for weeks. He was searching desperately for someone to back his small company in Atlanta, a business that was eating up his money and years of his life.That’s when a black limousine pulled up in front of the bar, Jake’s Dilemma. The limo had been sent by the mighty Goldman Sachs to fetch Mr. Sprecher, and as he sank into the back seat that winter day, he set off on an improbable journey that has since taken him to the pinnacle of American finance.Today Mr. Sprecher, a man virtually unknown outside of financial circles, is poised to buy the New York Stock Exchange. Not one of the 2,300 or so stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange (combined value of those shares: about $20.1 trillion). No, Jeff Sprecher is buying the entire New York Stock Exchange.

It sounds preposterous. A businessman from Atlanta blows into New York and walks off with the colonnaded high temple of American capitalism. But if all goes according to plan, his $8.2 billion acquisition, announced a few days before Christmas, will close later this year. And with that, 221 years of Wall Street history will come to an end. No more will New York be the master of the New York Stock Exchange. Instead, from its bland headquarters 750 miles from Wall Street, Mr. Sprecher’s young company, IntercontinentalExchange, will run the largest stock exchange in the nation and the world.

Mr. Sprecher, 57, certainly plays the role of a wily upstart. He may wear power suits and a Patek Philippe watch, but he comes across as unusually casual and self-deprecating for a man in his position. He pokes fun at himself for his shortcomings — “I don’t know how to manage people,” he says — and his love of obscure documentaries.How the New York Stock Exchange fell into Mr. Sprecher’s hands is, at heart, a story of the disruptive power of innovation. ICE, as IntercontinentalExchange is known, did not even exist 13 years ago. It has no cavernous trading floor, no gilded halls, no sweaty brokers braying for money on the financial markets. What it has is technology.Like many young companies that are upending the old order in business, ICE has used computer power to do things faster and cheaper, if not always better, than people can. Its rapid ascent reflects a new Wall Street where high-speed computers now dominate trading, sometimes with alarming consequences. New, electronic trading systems have greatly reduced the cost of buying and selling stocks, thus saving mutual funds — and, by extension, ordinary investors — countless millions. But they have also helped usher in a period of hair-raising volatility.Mr. Sprecher (pronounced SPRECK-er) has probably done more than anyone else to dismantle the trading floors of old and replace human brokers with machines. Along the way, he and ICE have traced an arc through some of the defining business stories of our time — from the rise and fall of Enron, to the transformation of old-school investment banks into vast trading operations, to the Wall Street excesses that not long ago helped derail the entire economy. Now, after a series of bold acquisitions, he is about to become the big boss of the Big Board.Does it really matter who owns the New York Stock Exchange and its parent company, NYSE Euronext? For most people, stock exchanges are probably a bit like plumbing. Most of us don’t think much about them — until something goes wrong. But lately, some things have gone spectacularly wrong.One sign of trouble came in 2010, when an errant trade ricocheted through computer networks and touched off one of the most harrowing moments in stock market history. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 900 points in a matter of minutes, and a new phrase entered the lexicon: flash crash.Since then, flash crashes in individual stocks have been remarkably common, as the centuries-old system of central exchanges has given way to a field of competing electronic systems.

ICE wasn’t involved in any of these problems. In fact, it has been praised as one of the first exchanges to put limits on lightning-quick, high-frequency trading. This points to Mr. Sprecher’s deftness in piloting his company through periods of regulation, deregulation and now re-regulation.While many banking executives have clashed with Washington, Mr. Sprecher has sensed the changing winds and tacked accordingly. He also stays close — some say too close — to the powerful Wall Street firms that are his customers.It is perhaps unsurprising that some of the people who make their living on the Big Board’s floor are a bit nervous about the exchange’s new boss. But Mr. Sprecher says they have nothing to fear. His friends and business associates say he could actually turn out to be the best hope for restoring trust in the stock market. After all, he has beaten the odds before.“There were a number of times when the odds were long, but he wasn’t deterred from stepping in,” says James Newsome, who was Mr. Sprecher’s regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before becoming his competitor as chief executive of the New York Mercantile Exchange. “A lot of people, if they don’t think they will win, they won’t participate. Jeff doesn’t operate like that.”For now, Mr. Sprecher is still spending much of his time at ICE’s headquarters in suburban Atlanta. The contrast with the New York Stock Exchange is striking. Behind its neoclassical face, the Big Board is a sprawling labyrinth of historic oil paintings, gilded leather chairs, stained wood and elegant dining rooms — all set amid crowds of gawking tourists.ICE, meanwhile, occupies a few floors of an anodyne black-glass cube surrounded by trees and parking lots. The employees share their cafeteria with the building’s other tenants. The walls are lined with dry-erase boards.On a recent weekday, the whiteboard in Mr. Sprecher’s modest corner office was filled with columns of scribbled numbers. They were leftovers from the all-night sessions that led to the deal for the Big Board.One column was labeled “Yankees,” ICE’s code name for the New York Stock Exchange. Another was labeled “Braves,” a shorthand for ICE. On the margins was a doodle of a tree with a cat hanging from one of the branches, in a hang-in-there-baby vein. It was done, Mr. Sprecher says, by his wife, Kelly Loeffler, who also happens to be his director of investor relations.

“This negotiation had fits and starts,” Mr. Sprecher says. “There were days when we just wanted to throw each other out of the window.”But Mr. Sprecher didn’t blink, not even at the billions of dollars lined up under the Yankees column.“It’s not about the value of what you paid for, because you are going to change the underlying business to begin with,” he says. “You acquire companies at moments in time when there’s an inflection point and you can change the trajectory of the company and the industry.”THE New York taxi driver asked: “What brings you to this concrete hellhole?”He was talking to Mr. Sprecher, then a young man visiting New York for the first time from his home in Wisconsin.“I was terrified,” Mr. Sprecher recalls of that visit, in the 1970s.At the time, Mr. Sprecher was still a small-town kid, the son of an insurance salesman and a medical technician in Madison, Wis. It was decades before ICE existed, before it owned exchanges on three continents and before it became a venue to trade everything from Midwestern wheat to Brazilian coffee to Scandinavian oil.Back then, he stayed with his sister Jill Sprecher, who had come to New York to study filmmaking. According to her, Mr. Sprecher was the archetype of the older brother: confident, competent and protective, the type whom all the teachers remember and judge younger siblings against. His most distinguishing trait was his knack for taking things apart and putting them back together — and for making money.“Everything he touched always made money, where everything I touched lost money,” says Ms. Sprecher, who writes and directs independent films with their sister, Karen.But not even Jill Sprecher would have guessed that her brother would one day stand atop the New York Stock Exchange.

“What has happened to him since 2000 is beyond my comprehension,” she says.Mr. Sprecher’s first job after college was as a salesman for the industrial company Trane, a job he says he got thanks to good grades and a reputation for being the life of the party at Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He accepted the job because it took him to Southern California.“It was the ticket to the beach and palm trees and girls on roller skates, and I was like, ‘That’s what I want to do in life,’ ” he recalls.While at Trane, he made an early sales pitch to William Prentice, an entrepreneur who was developing power plants. It was 1983, and the nation’s electricity market had just been deregulated, allowing entrepreneurs to start their own power plants, which only utilities had been allowed to do in the past. Mr. Prentice, impressed that Mr. Sprecher recognized the industry was in the middle of big changes, almost immediately offered him a job at his new company, the Western Power Group.“He had already internalized the whole concept of creative destruction,” Mr. Prentice says.Western Power got off to a rocky start. It almost failed when a Canadian company threatened to corner its local energy supply: cow manure. Others at the Western Power Group grew despondent. Mr. Sprecher and Mr. Prentice spent weeks in a motel in California’s Imperial Valley, trying to persuade the suppliers to change their minds.“We called it ‘the manure wars,’ ” Mr. Prentice says. “Neither myself nor Jeff questioned the need to go and fight. There was never any second-guessing — it was just go do it and win.”Win they did. After Mr. Prentice sold his stake in the company a few years later, Mr. Sprecher continued building the Western Power Group until another round of electricity deregulation occurred in 1996. Then he pounced.

Previously, power plant owners who wanted to buy and sell surplus electricity had to call one another and agree on a price. Mr. Sprecher saw opportunity in an Atlanta company that provided an electronic trading network. He bought that company, the Continental Power Exchange, with his own money; he ended up putting $4 million into it.Although Mr. Sprecher kept his company in California and his house in Beverly Hills, he spent every spare hour trying aggressively to sign up utility companies for the Atlanta exchange. His team made many visits to Enron, where they met with top executives like Jeffrey Skilling, who is now serving time in prison. Those meetings ended one day when the Enron executives began asking a number of technical questions about Mr. Sprecher’s system.“We sat there in the meeting and we realized, these guys are building this themselves, and we are educating them,” Mr. Sprecher recalls.

Shortly thereafter, Enron started its own electricity trading platform, which quickly came to dominate the industry. It looked as if the Continental Power Exchange was done. But Enron made one big mistake. Rather than providing a place for buyers and sellers to meet, Enron itself bought from every seller and sold to every buyer.This angered Wall Street banks that were among the biggest traders of energy products. When Mr. Sprecher showed up in New York to stay with his two sisters in 2000, nearly ready to give up on his own system, he didn’t know that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had been looking for someone just like him, who could provide an alternative to Enron.As Mr. Sprecher shuttled between meetings at the two banks, the bankers were trading phone calls and buzzing.“We were all thinking, ‘This is the guy we want,’ ” recalls John A. Shapiro, who was involved in the talks at Morgan Stanley. “We had already talked to a number of people, and the difference was night and day.”The difference wasn’t the Atlanta exchange’s technology, say people who were involved. It was Mr. Sprecher himself.“At some point, you said: ‘O.K., this guy has got something going for him. Maybe it’s hard to put your finger on it. But you know it when you see it,’ ” Mr. Shapiro recalls.On the other side, it was the perfect time to be hooking up with Wall Street, as banks were focusing increasingly on trading. In the negotiations that followed, Mr. Sprecher used what would become a trademark strategy: giving up part of the ownership of his company in exchange for a promise that the recipients would use his platform. In this case, he gave up 80 percent of the ownership to the two banks. The banks soon turned around and gave part of their own stakes to several of the largest power companies, including Shell, Total and British Petroleum, which committed to using what was soon rechristened as IntercontinentalExchange.When Enron collapsed in scandal, the business began pouring in.BY their own account, Mr. Sprecher and his wife, Ms. Loeffler, live for ICE. He has some hobbies, and his sister Jill wonders how he finds the time to watch cooking shows and reality television. But he and his wife have no children. Ms. Loeffler, the more serious of the two, says the thing that brought them together was their willingness, and desire, to do their jobs around the clock.

“We both just work all the time and enjoy work,” Ms. Loeffler says.Both revel in the brinkmanship that has marked ICE’s climb. Two days before Mr. Sprecher and his Wall Street backers announced the creation of ICE in 2000, they offered the New York Mercantile Exchange, or Nymex, a 10 percent stake in the new business if Nymex would share some of its back-office services.While Mr. Sprecher was giving his presentation to the board, a director said, “Who the hell brought this guy into our board meeting?”Mr. Sprecher recalled, “Then the room went silent.” The next thing he knew, a guard was escorting him out of the building.ICE was confronting a trading world that had ossified into an almost ritualistic society. The exchanges were owned by their traders, who made the rules. The traders themselves were rough-and-tumble men who used their fists as computers. From the beginning of ICE, Mr. Sprecher was seen by the old-time traders as a tool of Wall Street banks that wanted to supplant local traders at the exchanges — a reputation he has never managed to shake fully.For his part, Mr. Sprecher rarely showed deference to traditional powers.When Nymex was bidding for the International Petroleum Exchange in London in 2001, ICE doubled Nymex’s offer and won. Within a few years, ICE had shut down the historic trading pits at the London exchange in favor of computerized trading.Next up in 2006 was the New York Board of Trade, where financial contracts tied to agricultural products like sugar and cocoa were bought and sold. Mr. Sprecher says people looked askance at him when he offered a billion dollars for it. “I really believed there was a fundamental change going on in the globalization of commodities,” he says.People involved in the deal say Mr. Sprecher was initially attentive to the concerns of the floor traders.“He had the capability to disarm people — you might even say charm people — into accepting his soft-spoken demeanor,” says Frederick W. Schoenhut, who was the chairman of the New York Board of Trade.

But as soon as the deal went through, Mr. Sprecher was seldom seen. What’s more, he put a manager in his 30s in charge of the New York operations. Mr. Sprecher says that was intentional.“I wanted to show that market that there was a much younger, aggressive guy here who really wanted to fundamentally change that company,” he says.ICE didn’t have to do much to initiate that change. It allowed customers to choose between trading on the floor or on ICE’s electronic system. Within months, most customers had migrated to the screen. The situation caused so much job loss and unhappiness that when ICE made its next takeover bid, for the Chicago Board of Trade, a crew of New York Board of Trade traders took out newspaper ads warning the Chicago traders to “watch their backs.” ICE ultimately lost that battle, but only after almost derailing a rival bid by slipping an offer under a hotel room door.ICE also attracted the ire of a number of Democratic senators, who said it was encouraging speculation that caused fluctuations in the price of essential commodities like oil. But Mr. Sprecher proved adept at defanging his political opponents by bending to their will.“Tell me what the rules are and I’ll figure out how we can make money around them,” is one of his common lines when talking to regulators in Washington.Since the financial crisis, Mr. Sprecher has used that attitude to position himself to take advantage of changes being brought by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. Soon, Wall Street firms will have to move trading in many opaque financial products to exchanges, and ICE is in a perfect position to profit.THE clear attraction of the deal for NYSE Euronext is that it will create a global force in futures trading, an area set to benefit from Dodd-Frank reforms. In the United States, ICE is now the second-most-important futures trading company, after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. NYSE Euronext owns one of the most important futures exchanges in Europe.The future of the New York Stock Exchange, on the other hand, is less clear. For someone who is buying a stock exchange, Mr. Sprecher is very critical of the state of stock markets.

“There are so many places where you say, fundamentally something does not feel good to the average investor on what used to be the greatest capital markets in the world,” he says. But all of this is what makes stock trading an attractive industry for him — it is one that is ripe for change. He is already speaking out about a need to reform the rules governing stock markets.At the exchange itself last Wednesday, the 900-some men and women who work on the Big Board’s floor filed through the doors at 11 Wall Street in trading jackets of blue, red and green. Over the years, their number has dwindled steadily as computerized trading put many out of work.Even before ICE swooped in, some wondered how long the Big Board’s floor, the scene of so many triumphs and failures, could endure.Mr. Sprecher says the floor will survive. The American stock market, and the nation, need it.“The pendulum of electronification of markets went too far in the case of U.S. equities — to the point that people want to know there’s a human being watching over their trades,” he says.But that’s now. And Jeff Sprecher hasn’t gotten to where he is by keeping things as they are.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Jeffrey Sprecher - Wikipedia





















 






Jeffrey Sprecher

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Jeffrey C. Sprecher (born c. 1955) is an American businessman and is the Founder, Chairman and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.
Early life[edit]
Sprecher was born in Madison, Wisconsin, U.S., where he attended James Madison Memorial High School.[1] He was initiated in Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Wisconsin Alpha Chapter.[2] He received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1978 and an MBA from Pepperdine University in 1984.[3][4]
Career[edit]
Sprecher's first job was at Trane, where he met William Prentice who was developing power plants following deregulation. Prentice offered him a job at Western Power Group in 1983.[5]
Energy Policy Act (1992) passed and deregulation in the electric industry started. Those working in the "electric industry realized the need for real-time, continentwide transactions", made possible by "Continental Power Exchange" technologies whereby "individual businesses and consumers may one day be able to select an energy provider in the same way that individuals shop for long-distance telephone service."[5][6]
In 1996 he bought the Continental Power Exchange in Atlanta, Georgia from MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company for $1 plus the assumption of debt, which became the foundation for IntercontinentalExchangeICE.[5][6]
In the 1990s energy trading was handled manually by "Continental Power Exchange, an electronic energy trading company.[5][6] By 1997 Continental Power Exchange CPEX had "a federated software structure in place, CPEX... ready to expand to more servers as growth demands. CPEX's hardware and server architecture [were] capable of supporting foreseeable changes that may be necessary when the client load arrives. Continental [intended] to stay at least one step ahead of the marketplace."[7]
Sprecher started Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in 2000 as an online marketplace for energy trading in Atlanta—"a sort of eBay for energy." They sold equity stakes to "big hitters like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley." The idea was to be a "competitor to Enron". "Specher's business model was to provide an electronic marketplace where buyers and sellers could trade directly". When Enron imploded, ICE soared."[8]
Shortly after the company approached Enron to be a client, Enron started its own competing electricity trading platform, which dominated the market. Enron's market model was to buy from every seller and sell to every buyer. Wall Street bankers, particularly Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, backed him and he launched ICE in 2000 (giving 80 percent control to the two banks who, in turn, spread out the control among Shell, Total, and British Petroleum. When Enron's exchange collapsed in 2001 in the Enron scandal, ICE's business exploded.[4][5]
Since then the company has expanded including the following acquisitions:

International Petroleum Exchange in 2001[5]
New York Board of Trade in 2006[5]
Creditex in 2008
The Clearing Corporation in 2009
Climate Exchange in 2010
NYSE Euronext in 2013
In November 2013, ICE announced its acquisition of Singapore Mercantile Exchange[9]
SuperDerivatives in 2014

Jeffrey Sprecher
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental ExchangeChairman, New York Stock Exchange


Jeff Sprecher is Founder, Chairman and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE) and Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.  Sprecher acquired the predecessor company to ICE for $1, building a company with a market capitalization over $30 billion. Under Sprecher’s leadership, ICE grew from operating an energy swaps market into a network of 12 global exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange, through organic growth and acquisitions. ICE’s exchanges include equity and equity options exchanges, as well as futures exchanges that establish benchmark prices for interest rates, equity indexes, energy, metals and agricultural commodities.  In addition, ICE operates six central clearing houses that provide risk management services.
As a power plant developer, Sprecher recognized the need among energy market participants for an accessible, standardized electronic marketplace for OTC energy contracts. He acquired Continental Power Exchange (CPEX) in 1997 to achieve his vision of an efficient market that would bring transparency to previously opaque and fragmented markets. Intercontinental Exchange was formed in 2000 and the company completed its initial public offering in 2005 on the NYSE.  He has served as the company's Chief Executive Officer since May 2000 and as Chairman of the Board since November 2002.
Sprecher has led numerous strategic initiatives that have enabled ICE to expand from a single asset class — energy — into a broad range of asset classes today. These have included numerous acquisitions, including the International Petroleum Exchange of London (2001), the New York Board of Trade (2007), Creditex (2008), The Clearing Corporation (2009), the Climate Exchange (2010), NYSE Euronext (November 2013), Singapore Mercantile Exchange (2014) and Interactive Data Corporation (2015). 
In addition to expanding through acquisitions, Sprecher has focused ICE's resources on organic growth, including developing the first cleared OTC energy contracts (2002), building the first new major clearing house in the U.K. in over a century (2008), and launching the world's leading clearing houses for credit derivatives (2009). Through ICE Data Services, ICE is one of the world’s foremost providers of financial market information. 
Sprecher's  leadership has been recognized by Businessweek, Institutional Investor and a  number of other industry publications. He was selected as a finalist in Ernst  & Young's Entrepreneur of the Year program in 2002 and by MarketWatch as  one of five finalists in the MarketWatch CEO of the Year program in 2006. Also  in 2006, ICE's stock was named the best 1-year performer by The Wall Street  Journal, and in 2010 the company was named as the fastest growing company in  the Financial Services category by Fortune magazine. In 2017, Sprecher was named  Best CEO for Brokers, Asset Managers and Exchanges in Institutional Investor’s annual  poll.  Since 2014, he has been named one  of Barron’s 30 World’s Best CEOs.
Sprecher is involved in a number of civic initiatives. He is the Chairman of the Metro Atlanta Chamber; is a Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation Trustee; and is on the Board of Directors for the Buckhead Coalition, The Commerce Club and Atlanta Committee for Progress.
Prior to acquiring CPEX, Sprecher served as President of Western Power Group, Inc., a developer, owner and operator of large central-station power plants in California.
Raised in Wisconsin, Sprecher earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin at Madison and a Master of Business Administration from Pepperdine University in Malibu, California.

Jeffrey Sprecher - Wikipedia





















 






Jeffrey Sprecher

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Jeffrey C. Sprecher (born c. 1955) is an American businessman and is the Founder, Chairman and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.
Early life[edit]
Sprecher was born in Madison, Wisconsin, U.S., where he attended James Madison Memorial High School.[1] He was initiated in Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Wisconsin Alpha Chapter.[2] He received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1978 and an MBA from Pepperdine University in 1984.[3][4]
Career[edit]
Sprecher's first job was at Trane, where he met William Prentice who was developing power plants following deregulation. Prentice offered him a job at Western Power Group in 1983.[5]
Energy Policy Act (1992) passed and deregulation in the electric industry started. Those working in the "electric industry realized the need for real-time, continentwide transactions", made possible by "Continental Power Exchange" technologies whereby "individual businesses and consumers may one day be able to select an energy provider in the same way that individuals shop for long-distance telephone service."[5][6]
In 1996 he bought the Continental Power Exchange in Atlanta, Georgia from MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company for $1 plus the assumption of debt, which became the foundation for IntercontinentalExchangeICE.[5][6]
In the 1990s energy trading was handled manually by "Continental Power Exchange, an electronic energy trading company.[5][6] By 1997 Continental Power Exchange CPEX had "a federated software structure in place, CPEX... ready to expand to more servers as growth demands. CPEX's hardware and server architecture [were] capable of supporting foreseeable changes that may be necessary when the client load arrives. Continental [intended] to stay at least one step ahead of the marketplace."[7]
Sprecher started Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in 2000 as an online marketplace for energy trading in Atlanta—"a sort of eBay for energy." They sold equity stakes to "big hitters like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley." The idea was to be a "competitor to Enron". "Specher's business model was to provide an electronic marketplace where buyers and sellers could trade directly". When Enron imploded, ICE soared."[8]
Shortly after the company approached Enron to be a client, Enron started its own competing electricity trading platform, which dominated the market. Enron's market model was to buy from every seller and sell to every buyer. Wall Street bankers, particularly Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, backed him and he launched ICE in 2000 (giving 80 percent control to the two banks who, in turn, spread out the control among Shell, Total, and British Petroleum. When Enron's exchange collapsed in 2001 in the Enron scandal, ICE's business exploded.[4][5]
Since then the company has expanded including the following acquisitions:

International Petroleum Exchange in 2001[5]
New York Board of Trade in 2006[5]
Creditex in 2008
The Clearing Corporation in 2009
Climate Exchange in 2010
NYSE Euronext in 2013
In November 2013, ICE announced its acquisition of Singapore Mercantile Exchange[9]
SuperDerivatives in 2014

Jeffrey Sprecher was named founder and CEO of IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) when the exchange began in May of 2000. He became chairman of the board two and a half years later.
Sprecher serves on the CFTC Global Markets Advisory Committee  and the CFTC Energy Markets Advisory Committee,  He also is a member or the Energy Security Leadership Council.With the markets turning increasingly electronic, Sprecher recognized the potential for building and operating a transparent and efficient marketplace for electronic over-the-counter energy commodities trading and in 1997 purchased Continental Power Exchange (CPEX). 
IntercontinentalExchange was formed in 2000, with CPEX contributing all of its assets, primarily electronic trading technology, as well as its liabilities. He spearheaded the assembly of 13 leading wholesale commodity market participants that became the company's initial shareholders, acquiring equity interests and the commitment to provide order flow to provide liquidity for the new electronic marketplace. 
In June 2001, Sprecher negotiated the acquisition of IPE Holdings Plc, owner of the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), London, a way to combine ICE's electronic platform for OTC products with the exchange-traded energy derivatives market. The acquisition enabled ICE to create the industry's first cleared OTC products through IPE's clearing provider, LCH.Clearnet. 
In turn, the IPE began to develop its futures markets on ICE's trading platform and became the first energy commodity exchange to become fully electronic in April 2005. IPE was re-named ICE Futures in October 2005 and became a publicly traded company on Nov. 16, 2005, with its listing on the New York Stock Exchange. 
In September 2006, Sprecher also negotiated the acquisition of the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT), the world's leading softs commodity exchange with a wholly owned clearing subsidiary. The transaction closed in J

Sprecher, Founder, Chairman and CEO, IntercontinentalExchangeInterviewed by Stephen R. Howe, Jr., EY Americas Managing Partner       Share60RegisterWatch LiveWatch On-Demand 		Session recap 		Jeffrey C. Sprecher, Founder, Chairman and CEO of IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), is well-aware that his 13-year-old company has just acquired one of the world’s best known brands. 		“The further you get away from the US, the more respected the NYSE brand is,” Sprecher said. “To non-US citizens, it represents capitalism at its best.” 		But as someone who describes himself as a technology disruptor, Sprecher is ready to infuse a new culture into an institution founded in 1792. “What’s important to me is that ICE’s culture is the surviving culture. I want us to be customer-focused and outward-facing.” 		Passion will clearly be an important attribute of that culture. Sprecher said that whenever he hires he looks for “anyone who is passionate about the business. I don’t care about their résumé or where they went to school. I just want someone who really wants to work.” 		He carries a similar philosophy for team building. “Great businesses are all collections of great people,” Sprecher said. “Great people come in all flavors and no one is perfectly great. I like to assemble groups where people respect the greatness, but overlook the baggage.” 		Sprecher also admitted to being obsessed with trying to stay ahead of change and the competition: “The pace of innovation is so fast, you have to assume that whatever you’re doing today is already obsolete. You have to start thinking today about version 2.0.”  			  	   			Keynote speaker     Jeffrey C.

Mr. Sprecher acquired Continental Power Exchange (CPEX) in 1997 to achieve his vision of an efficient market that would bring transparency and capital efficiency to previously opaque and fragmented markets. IntercontinentalExchange was formed in 2000 and the company completed its initial public offering in 2005 on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Sprecher has led numerous strategic acquisitions, including the International Petroleum Exchange of London (2001), the New York Board of Trade (2007), Creditex (2008), The Clearing Corporation (2009) and the Climate Exchange (2010). In December of 2012 ICE announced an agreement to acquire NYSE Euronext.

ATLANTA, Feb. 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- PwC US today announced that the Technology Hall of Fame of Georgia members selected Jeffrey C. Sprecher, Founder, Chairman and CEO of publicly-held Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:    ICE) and Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, to be inducted into the Technology Hall of Fame of Georgia at the Technology Association of Georgia (TAG) 2017 Georgia Technology Summit on March 23, 2017. The event will take place at the Cobb Galleria Centre in Atlanta. Intercontinental Exchange is dual-headquartered in Atlanta and New York, and operates the leading network of global futures, equity and equity options exchanges, as well as global clearing and data services across financial and commodity markets. 








"Jeff's innovative leadership has made him a pioneer several times over," said John Nee, Partner in PwC Atlanta's Technology Practice. "Jeff has redefined what it means to help businesses grow in today's technologically-driven world, turning dollars into billions in just a matter of years. He is a problem-solver and strategist guided by a mission to continually create and improve, and it's our privilege to welcome him to the Technology Hall of Fame of Georgia." 
As a power plant developer, Sprecher recognized the need among energy market participants for an accessible and transparent electronic marketplace for over-the-counter energy markets. He acquired Continental Power Exchange (CPEX) for $1 in 1997 to achieve his vision of an efficient market that would bring transparency to a previously opaque market. He launched Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in 2000 and completed its initial public offering in 2005 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), ultimately building it up to a market capitalization of over $30 billion today. He has served as the company's CEO since May 2000 and Chairman of the Board since November 2002.
Under his guidance, ICE grew from operating solely in the energy swaps market, into a broader network of 12 global exchanges, including the NYSE, through organic growth and acquisitions. ICE's exchanges include equity and equity options exchanges, as well as futures exchanges that establish benchmark prices for interest rates, equity indexes, energy, metals and agricultural commodities. In addition, ICE operates six central clearing houses that provide risk management services for global markets. ICE developed the first cleared OTC energy contracts in 2002, built the first new major clearing house in the United Kingdom in over a century in 2008, and launched the world's leading clearing house for credit derivatives in 2009. Through ICE Data Services, ICE is one of the world's foremost providers of financial market information. 
Businessweek, Institutional Investor and other industry publications have recognized Sprecher for his work. He was selected by MarketWatch as one of five finalists in the MarketWatch CEO of the Year program in 2006. Also in 2006, ICE's stock was named the "best 1-year performer" by The Wall Street Journal, and in 2010 the company was named as the fastest growing company in the Financial Services category by Fortune magazine.  Since 2014, Sprecher has been named one of Barron's 30 World's Best CEOs. In 2017, Sprecher was named Best CEO for Brokers, Asset Managers and Exchanges in Institutional Investor's annual poll. 
"Jeff Sprecher and Intercontinental Exchange are reshaping the world's capital markets and how risk is managed," said Larry K. Williams, President/CEO of the Technology Association of Georgia (TAG). "Jeff is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the financial-services industry and TAG is pleased to see him inducted into the Hall of Fame at the 2017 Georgia Technology Summit."
Sprecher is also involved in a number of community and civic initiatives. He is Chairman of the Metro Atlanta Chamber, a trustee of the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, and serves on the Board of Directors for various organizations, including the Buckhead Coalition, The Commerce Club and Atlanta Committee for Progress.
Sprecher holds a Bachelor's Degree in chemical engineering from the University of Wisconsin at Madison and a Master of Business Administration from Pepperdine University in Malibu, California.

Jeffrey Sprecher is the founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange Group and chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.[1]  He began as CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) when the exchange started up in May of 2000. He became chairman of the board two and a half years later.
ICE acquired NYSE Euronext in November of 2013 in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $8.2 billion. The deal called for $11.27 in cash and 0.1703 shares of ICE for each NYSE Euronext share. [2] [3]
Sprecher serves on the CFTC Global Markets Advisory Committee [4] [5] and the CFTC Energy Markets Advisory Committee, [6] He also is a member or the Energy Security Leadership Council.[7]
He is married to Kelly Loeffler, senior vice president of corporate affairs at ICE.

Background
As the markets were turning increasingly electronic, Sprecher recognized the potential for building and operating a transparent and efficient marketplace for electronic over-the-counter energy commodities trading and in 1997 purchased Continental Power Exchange (CPEX), the predecessor company that was renamed ICE, for $1.[8]
He formed Intercontinental Exchange in 2000, with CPEX contributing all of its assets, primarily electronic trading technology, as well as its liabilities. He spearheaded the assembly of 13 leading wholesale commodity market participants that became the company's initial shareholders, acquiring equity interests and the commitment to provide order flow to provide liquidity for the new electronic marketplace. 
In June 2001, Sprecher negotiated the acquisition of IPE Holdings Plc, owner of the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), London, a way to combine ICE's electronic platform for OTC products with the exchange-traded energy derivatives market. The acquisition enabled ICE to create the industry's first cleared OTC products through IPE's clearing provider, LCH.Clearnet. 
In turn, the IPE began to develop its futures markets on ICE's trading platform and became the first energy commodity exchange to become fully electronic in April 2005. IPE was re-named ICE Futures in October 2005 and became a publicly traded company on Nov. 16, 2005, with its listing on the New York Stock Exchange. 
In September 2006, Sprecher also negotiated the acquisition of the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT), the world's leading softs commodity exchange with a wholly owned clearing subsidiary. The transaction closed in January 2007, with NYBOT becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE. 
Politically in 2007, Sprecher donated to Collins for Senator, Price For Congress, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Chambliss for Senate, David Scott for Congress, Hillary Clinton for President, National Republican Senatorial Committee, Bob Etheridge for Congress Committee and McConnell Senate Committee '08.[9]
In November 2008, Sprecher was an honorary committee member of the FIA Futures Cares Charity Dinner where over $300K was raised in support of the Greater Chicago Food Depository.[10]

Early Career
Before acquiring CPEX, Sprecher held a number of positions, primarily in the power industry. For 14 years, he served as president of Western Power Group, Inc., a developer, owner and operator of large central-station power plants in California.

ICE Challenges CME
One of the events that stands out in Sprecher's career at ICE was a David-and-Goliath move in which ICE challenged the futures market giant Chicago Mercantile Exchange in its bid to acquire the Chicago Board of Trade. While ICE ultimately was unsuccessful in its efforts, the price of the acquisition for CME grew substantially in the "bid/ask war" as major CBOT shareholders demanded a higher ante from CME.[11][12] This high-profile news event, along with an aggressive marketing effort in the energy space and other new acquisitions, put ICE's brand in the spotlight very shortly after its inception. Then in August 2007, ICE acquired the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange.

Recognition
Sprecher in 2006 was selected by MarketWatch (Dow Jones' online site for news, market data, portfolios, mutual funds, personal finance, and discussions) as one of five finalists for the "MarketWatch CEO of the Year,[13]" based on a track record that included stock price performance, customer service, treatment of employees and corporate-governance initiatives. In 2002, he was chosen by Business Week magazine as one of seven "Top Entrepreneurs of the Year.[14] He also was a finalist in Ernst & Young's "Entrepreneur of the Year Program".[15]

Education
A native of Wisconsin, Sprecher earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin and an MBA from Pepperdine University.[16]

In the News
On July 1, 2008, Sprecher responded to a BusinessWeek column on oil speculation, saying that ICE's markets are neither dark nor unregulated.[17]
InterContinental Exchange acquired the Chicago Climate Exchange in 2010 for $600 million. [18]
