furnish, and will cause the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries to furnish, to Purchaser,
its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and
operating data and other information relating to the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries
as such Persons may reasonably request; provided

-27-


 

that such access shall not, and the requirement to provide information under this Section
5.3 shall not, (a) unreasonably disrupt the operations of Seller, the Partnership or the
Partnership Subsidiaries, (b) require that any of Seller, the Partnership or the Partnership
Subsidiaries disclose any information that in Sellers reasonable judgment would result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets or violate any of Sellers, the Partnerships or the Partnership
Subsidiaries obligations with respect to confidentiality, (c) require that any of Seller, the
Partnership or the Partnership Subsidiaries disclose any privileged information of any of Seller,
the Partnership or the Partnership Subsidiaries, or any information which is subject to an
agreement of confidentiality, or (d) require Seller or its Affiliates (including the Partnership
and the Partnership Subsidiaries) to disclose any financial or proprietary information of or
regarding Seller or its Affiliates (excluding the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries) or
otherwise disclose information regarding Seller or its Affiliates (excluding the Partnership and
the Partnership Subsidiaries) which Seller deems commercially sensitive; and (iii) provide to
Purchaser unaudited quarterly consolidated balance sheets of the Partnership (together with the
related statements of operations and cash flows) promptly following the end of each fiscal quarter,
which financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods presented thereby and shall present fairly the consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Partnership as of, and for the periods ended
on, the respective dates thereof, subject to normal recurring year-end adjustments. All
information, data and copies of documents obtained by Purchaser thereby shall be subject to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, except that disclosure of the Financial Statements shall be
permitted to the extent contemplated by Section 5.10. Purchaser agrees to enter into
customary agreements relating to access to work papers to the extent requested by the auditors and
accountants of the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries in connection with the foregoing.

               Section 5.4 Publicity. No press release or public announcement related to this Agreement,
or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made without the approval of Seller and
Purchaser, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by either
Party, unless required by applicable Law (in the reasonable opinion of counsel), in which case
Seller and Purchaser shall have the right to review such press release or announcement prior to
publication.

               Section 5.5 Transfer Taxes and Tax Elections. (a) Subject to Section 2.2(d), Purchaser
agrees to be fully responsible for the payment of all Transfer Taxes (if any) that may be due and
payable under the Stamp Act of The Bahamas in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, without limitation, any Transfer Taxes that may be due and payable under the
Stamp Act of The Bahamas as a result of any acquisition financing activities of Purchaser or its
Affiliates (the Financing Related Stamp Duty) and as a result of the repayment of
existing indebtedness in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant
to Section 5.9, including the release of collateral) (such amount of all such Transfer
Taxes, exclusive of the Financing Related Stamp Duty, but including, for the avoidance of doubt,
all such Transfer Taxes that may be due and payable with respect to the issuance, if any, of the
Consideration Units, the Acquisition Related Stamp Duty), whether before, at, or after
Closing. Purchaser agrees to cooperate with Seller in the making of satisfactory arrangements with
the Bahamian Governmental Authorities with respect to all Transfer Taxes (if any) that may be
payable in connection with the transactions

-28-


 

contemplated by this Agreement (other than the Financing Related Stamp Duty), including allowing
Seller to lead and conduct all meetings and discussions with the relevant representatives of the
Bahamian Governmental Authorities to the extent such meetings and discussions relate to the
Acquisition Related Stamp Duty, and, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall not enter into any
definitive arrangements with the Bahamian Governmental Authorities in respect of the Acquisition
Related Stamp Duty without obtaining the prior written consent of Seller. Purchasers obligations
under this Section 5.5(a) to pay any Transfer Taxes (other than Financing Related Stamp
Duty) shall not exceed the Escrow Amount and, if paid following the Closing, shall be satisfied
from the Escrow Amount; provided, however, that Seller shall be responsible for any
Shortfall, payable in accordance with Section 2.2(d). For the sake of clarity, in the event
Vopak exercises its rights under Section 2.6 of the Unitholders Agreement (such transaction, the
Vopak Tag-Along), any Transfer Taxes due and payable in connection with the Vopak
Tag-Along will be payable to the applicable Governmental Authorities by Vopak and/or Purchaser in
the same manner as contemplated by this Section 5.5(a).

          (b) If a Party receives any notice, demand, determination or assessment from any Governmental
Authority that any such Transfer Taxes are due and payable or that the amount of such Transfer
Taxes owed by such Party are different than the amounts paid, such Party shall promptly notify the
other in writing of the relevant facts. The Parties shall cooperate in responding to any such
notice, demand, determination or assessment and give the other Party all such information,
documentation and assistance, including access to premises and personnel, as such other Party may
reasonably request for the purposes of investigating or responding to any such notice, demand,
determination or assessment.

          (c) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall (or in the event that such elections are to
be made on the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly) cause elections to be made to
cause FR Borco Acquisition Holdings B.V., FR Borco Acquisition B.V and FR Borco Management Services
LLC to each be classified for United States federal income tax purposes as entities that are
disregarded as being separate from their owners effective on or before the Closing Date,
provided that such elections shall be made in such order as directed by Seller, so long as
such elections are effective no later than the Closing Date, and shall provide the Purchaser with
evidence of such elections.

          (d) It is expressly understood and agreed that Purchaser may not make (or cause to be made)
any elections under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 with respect to the Partnership or any
of its Subsidiaries that would have an effective date prior to the Closing.

               Section 5.6 Further Assurances. Seller and Purchaser each agree that from time to time
after the Closing they will execute and deliver, and will cause their respective Affiliates to
execute and deliver, such further instruments, and take, and cause their respective Affiliates to
take, such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of
this Agreement.

               Section 5.7 Post-Closing Access. In connection with any matter relating to any period
prior to, or any period ending on, the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, upon the request and at the
expense of Seller, permit Seller and its representatives reasonable access at all reasonable times
to the Books and Records transferred to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall execute

-29-


 

and shall cause the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries to execute such documents as
Seller may reasonably request to enable Seller to prepare and/or file any reports or Tax returns
required of Seller and/or any of Sellers Affiliates, if any, relating to the Partnership or any of
the Partnership Subsidiaries, or for Seller to fulfill any post-Closing Obligations hereunder.
Purchaser shall not dispose of such Books and Records during the seven (7)-year period beginning
with the Closing Date without Sellers consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

               Section 5.8 Retained Obligations. From and after the Closing, FR XI shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Purchaser, the Purchasers Affiliates (including the Partnership and
the Partnership Subsidiaries from and after the Closing) (collectively, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties) from, against and in respect of any and all costs (including reasonable
attorneys fees), liabilities and Taxes that arise out of, relate to or result from any of the
following described matters: (i) any breach of Sellers obligations under Section 2.2(d)
or Section 5.12, (ii) any breach of Section 3.6(d) and (iii) the Proportionate
Share of any Seller Transaction Expenses that are not paid at the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the indemnification obligations set forth in this
Section 5.8 shall not be subject to any dollar limitation and no claim shall be made under
this Section 5.8 later than the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date. For Tax purposes and
except as otherwise required by applicable Law, the Parties agree to treat (and to cause their
respective Affiliates to treat) any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 5.8 as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

               Section 5.9 Certain Indebtedness. Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement when consummated will constitute a Change of Control under the
Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of April 29, 2008, among FR Borco Acquisition Holdings
B.V., FR Borco Acquisition B.V., certain subsidiaries of the Borrower, the Lenders party thereto,
ABN Amro Bank N.V. and DnB NOR Bank ASA (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified
from time to time, the Credit Agreement). In conjunction with the Closing, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause FRBCH and the other Partnership Subsidiaries to, take all necessary actions
to (i) pay in full all Obligations (including in respect of any Hedge Agreements) and terminate all
Letters of Credit and Commitments as of the Closing or (ii) otherwise obtain a consent, waiver or
other amendment from the Required Lenders under the Credit Agreement permitting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser agrees that, to the extent clause (i) of the preceding
sentence is applicable and available cash of FRBCH and the other Partnership Subsidiaries is not
sufficient to pay in full all such Obligations, then Purchaser shall cause the Partnership to fund
FRBCH with cash (through the purchase of additional LP Units at the same price per unit implied by
the Purchase Price) in an amount necessary to pay in full all such Obligations, subject to
permitting Vopak to exercise its rights under Section 4.1 of the Unitholders Agreement. Each
capitalized term used in this Section 5.9 and not otherwise defined in this Agreement is
used as defined in the Credit Agreement; provided that the term Obligations solely for
purposes of this Section 5.9 is used as defined in the Credit Agreement and not this
Agreement. Seller shall, and shall cause the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser in connection with its obligations
under this Section 5.9, including in connection with obtaining payoff letters in advance of
the Closing and Lien releases.

-30-


 

               Section 5.10 Financial Statements. (a) (i) Prior to Closing, the Partnership shall on an
ongoing basis and as may be requested by Buckeye Parent from time to time, consent to the
inclusion or incorporation by reference of the Financial Statements in Buckeye Parents existing
registration statements and any other registration statement, report or other document of Buckeye
Parent or any of its Affiliates filed or to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) in which Buckeye Parent or such Affiliate reasonably determines that the
Financial Statements are required to be included or incorporated by reference to satisfy any rule
or regulation of the SEC or to satisfy relevant disclosure obligations under the U.S. Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), or the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), (ii) until such time as Buckeye Parent has filed its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2012, FR XI shall reasonably
cooperate with Buckeye Parent (with respect to matters within FR XIs control) in seeking to obtain
the consent of the independent auditors of the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries (the
Audit Firm) to the inclusion or incorporation by reference in any such registration
statement, report or other document of its audit opinion(s) with respect to the Financial
Statements that it has audited and to obtain from the Audit Firm unqualified opinions, consents or
customary comfort letters with respect to such Financial Statements in connection with any offering
pursuant to a registration statement that includes or incorporates by reference such Financial
Statements, and (iii) prior to Closing, the Partnership shall execute and deliver or cause to be
executed and delivered to the Audit Firm such representation letters of the Partnership and the
Partnership Subsidiaries, in form and substance customary for representation letters provided to
external audit firms by management of the company whose financial statements are the subject of an
audit, as may be reasonably requested by the Audit Firm, with respect to the Financial Statements
that it has audited.

          (b) FR XI shall (i) reasonably cooperate with Buckeye Parent and its Subsidiaries to
facilitate the completion and delivery (with respect to matters within FR XIs control), within 70
days after the Closing Date, of a balance sheet and statement of income and cash flows of the
Partnership as of and for the period ending December 31, 2010 (the 2010 Financial
Statements), prepared in accordance with GAAP, in a manner consistent with that applied to the
Financial Statements, which shall be audited by, and accompanied by an unqualified report of, the
Audit Firm, and (ii) take the actions specified in Section 5.10(a)(ii) with respect to the
2010 Financial Statements and, prior to Closing, cause the Partnership to take the actions
specified in Section 5.10(a)(i) and (iii) with respect to the 2010 Financial
Statements.

          (c) FR XI shall (with respect to matters within FR XIs control) (i) reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser in the preparation of any financial statements that are required to be included under
Item 2.01 of Form 8-K filed by Buckeye Parent or any of its Affiliates under the Exchange Act as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) reasonably cooperate
with Buckeye Parent and its Subsidiaries to procure that the Audit Firm audit any such financial
statements required to be audited under any rule or regulation of the SEC or to satisfy relevant
disclosure obligations under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

          (d) Seller shall, as promptly as practicable after the Execution Date, deliver to Purchaser
the unaudited consolidated balance sheet and statements of income and cash flows of the Partnership
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, prepared in accordance

-31-


 

with GAAP, which
financial statements shall have been reviewed by the Audit Firm in
accordance with Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) 100, Interim Financial Information,
issued by the Auditing Standards Board (the SAS 100 Reviewed Financials). To the extent
that the SAS 100 Reviewed Financials are delivered after December 24, 2010, the Initial Date shall
be extended by a number of days equal to the number of days elapsed from and after December 24,
2010 to and including the date the SAS 100 Reviewed Financial Statements are delivered to Purchaser
(it being understood that if the date calculated in accordance with the foregoing does not fall on
a Business Day, the Initial Date shall be the Business Day next following such date). The SAS 100
Reviewed Financials shall not be different in any material adverse respect from the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet and statements of income and cash flows of the Partnership for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 delivered to Purchaser on or prior to the Execution
Date. If the SAS 100 Reviewed Financials are not delivered on or before December 31, 2010,
Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, which right must be exercised, if at
all, prior to January 12, 2011.

               Section 5.11 Termination of Affiliate Contracts. Prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall have cancelled or caused to be cancelled all Affiliate Contracts other than the
Affiliate Contract set forth on Section 2.3(a)(vi) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules and all
liabilities of the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries to Seller and/or its other
Affiliates or their respective assigns that are related to any Affiliate Contract, in each case,
without the transfer, payment or delivery of cash or other value by the Partnership or any of the
Partnership Subsidiaries to the Seller or its other Affiliates.

               Section 5.12 Payment of Certain Incentive Fees. Following the Closing, FR XI agrees
(a) to pay Vopak the Proportionate Share of any Incentive Fee (as defined in the Unitholders
Agreement) or other fee if and when payable pursuant to the terms of Section 8.6(a) or 8.6(b) of
the Unitholders Agreement as in effect on the date of this Agreement (provided that, for
the avoidance of doubt, Sellers obligation hereunder shall not lapse if any adjustments to
relevant components pursuant to the last sentence of Section 8.6(a) are made or the greenfield or
Brownfield expansion plans are modified in accordance with the Unitholders Agreement) and (b) to
make payment of the Proportionate Share of the Applicable Vopak Payment payable pursuant to Section
4.5 or Section 8.9(a) of the Unitholders Agreement as in effect on the date of this Agreement if
and to the extent such amounts exceed the deduction from the Base Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.2(b) hereof.

               Section 5.13 Marketing Cooperation. In order to assist Purchasers bank financing in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, prior to Closing, Seller shall cause the
Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries to provide such assistance and cooperation as
Purchaser and its Affiliates from time to time may reasonably request, including the participation
of senior management in a reasonable number of meetings with prospective lenders, due diligence
sessions, rating agency presentations and assisting with the drafting of marketing materials and
loan documentation and the provision of financial and other information regarding the Partnership
and the Partnership Subsidiaries; provided that such requested assistance and cooperation
does not materially interfere with the ongoing operations of the Partnership or the Partnership
Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall promptly, upon the request of Seller, reimburse Seller for all
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Partnership
and its Affiliates in connection with the cooperation contemplated by this Section

-32-


 

5.13. In addition, Purchaser shall (including following Closing) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any and all costs and liabilities actually
suffered or incurred by any of such Persons, to the extent arising from any action taken by such
Persons at the request of Purchaser and/or its Affiliates in connection with this Section
5.13. Notwithstanding this Section 5.13, Purchaser affirms that it is not a condition
to the Closing or to any of its other obligations under this Agreement that Purchaser obtain
financing for or related to any of the transactions contemplated hereby. It is understood and
agreed that this Section 5.13 does not apply to, and Seller is not making any covenant or
agreement with respect to, the provision of any assistance or cooperation by Vopak or its
representatives.

               Section 5.14 Dutch Matters. Prior to Closing, (a) Seller shall cause the Partnership
and the Partnership Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Dutch
Restructuring, as contemplated by Section 5.14(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, to be
effective no later than immediately prior to the Closing; provided, that such Dutch
Restructuring does not adversely affect in any material respect Seller, the Partnership and the
Partnership Subsidiaries or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (b)
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Dutch Ruling; provided,
however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, if the Dutch Ruling is obtained prior to the
Dutch Restructuring having been completed and the satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions to
Closing, Seller shall continue its obligations under Section 5.14(a) until the Closing.

ARTICLE 6
Employees

               Section 6.1 Employee Benefits. From and after the Closing and for at least two (2) years
thereafter, Purchaser shall cause the Partnership or one or more of the Partnership Subsidiaries to
continue to provide employees with salary or wage levels and bonus opportunities (other than the
Topco Bonus Plan or any other bonuses payable out of the Applicable Vopak Payment, which shall only
be payable in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
to the extent applicable, and with employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, comparable to
those provided to the current Employees at the Closing Date, and Purchaser agrees to fully
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from any and all costs and liabilities which
any of them may incur as a result of Purchasers failure to satisfy the covenants in this
Section 6.1; provided, however, that neither the Partnership nor any of the
Partnership Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to keep any Employee employed for any period
after the Closing (unless required by Law) and it is expressly agreed that no Employee is a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 6.1 shall amend or be
construed as amending any Plan set forth on Section 3.15(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules.

               Section 6.2 Obligations to Employees. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
following Closing Purchaser will cause the Partnership, or one or more of the Partnership
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to honor, pay, perform and satisfy all liabilities and commitments
under each Plan set forth in Section 3.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules in effect
on the Closing Date that provides any Employee with compensation or benefits while employed by the
Partnership or any of the Partnership Subsidiaries in connection with the termination of such
Employees employment in accordance with the terms of such Plan as of

-33-


 


such termination. Nothing in
this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Partnership or the Partnership
Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable
Law.

ARTICLE 7

               Section 9.2 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be exclusively governed by, and construed

               Section 9.3 Consent to Jurisdiction. (a) Each of the Parties (i) consents to submit
itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of any Federal court located in the State

RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the parties

law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving any of the Lender Related
Parties arising out of or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, the transactions

               Section 9.4 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages would not
be an adequate remedy for any such breach. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce

to which such Party is entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any action should be

Party hereto hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings,
oral or written, express or implied, between the Parties hereto and their respective Affiliates,
representatives and agents in respect of the subject matter hereof, except that this Agreement does
not supersede the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms and conditions of which the Parties hereto
expressly reaffirm. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof,
Purchaser acknowledges that none of Seller, the Partnership, the Partnership Subsidiaries or any
other Person has made or makes, and Purchaser has not relied
upon and shall have no remedy with respect to, any other express or implied representation,

-38-


 

warranty, agreement or understanding, whether written or oral, other than those expressly set forth
in this Agreement.

               Section 9.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is found to be,
by competent authority with jurisdiction, invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end
that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

the benefit of each Party hereto and its successors and permitted assigns and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; provided,

9.13.

               Section 9.10 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver. No failure or delay on the part of any
Party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a
waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further
exercise thereof, or of any other right.

               Section 9.11 Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made as follows: (i) if sent by

provision hereof. The disclosure of any matter in the Schedules hereto shall be deemed to be a
