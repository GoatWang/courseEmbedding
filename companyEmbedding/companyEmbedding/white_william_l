Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1953 edition. Language: fre. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Ottawa : Ministère de l'agriculture 46 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 457678117

William L White2 months agoI have the Collectors Edition now and this will probably be the last upgrade I will ever do. The cost is going to be extremely expensive for me to handle from now on. I have been a customer for 15+ year and will only buy what I need from now on, which will not be much. When one has 9842 books in the library, that is more books than one could ever read in a lifetime. Thank you Logos for a wonderful product!
