	Example



	This example is intended to help you compare the
	cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. It assumes that you invest $10,000 in each share class of the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The
	example also assumes that your investment earns a 5% return each year and that the Funds operating expenses are exactly as described in the preceding table. If separate account or variable life insurance or variable annuity contract expenses
	were included, overall expenses would be higher. Although your actual




	costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

	Portfolio Turnover



	The
	Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual
	fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Funds portfolio turnover rate was 313% of the average value of its portfolio.





	INVESTMENTS, RISKS, AND PERFORMANCE







	Principal Investment Strategies



	Under normal
	circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in investment grade fixed income securities (rated Baa or higher by Moodys or BBB or higher by Standard & Poors or, if unrated, determined to be of comparable
	quality by the subadviser). These typically include U.S. dollar-denominated corporate obligations, securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies or instrumentalities, U.S. and foreign issuer dollar-denominated bonds
	including, but not limited to, corporate obligations, government and agency issues, private placement bonds, securities subject to resale pursuant to Rule 144A, mortgage-backed, and other asset-backed securities.


	The Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets in below investment grade debt securities (junk or high yield bonds), including
	securities in default, and including bank loans. In the event that a security is downgraded after its purchase by the Fund, the Fund may continue to hold the security if the Funds subadviser,

	Babson Capital Management LLC

	(Babson
	Capital), considers that doing so would be consistent with the Funds investment objective.



	 


	 


	S-1






	The Fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets in securities that are not denominated in U.S. dollars
	including, but not limited to, corporate obligations, government and agency issues, private placement bonds, mortgage-backed, and other asset-backed securities. The Fund may also invest in

	non-dollar

	denominated high yield bonds, including bank loans, and may invest in securities subject to legal restrictions on resale, some of which may be subject to resale pursuant to Rule 144A.


	The Fund may but will not necessarily engage in foreign currency forward contracts to attempt to protect against adverse changes in currency exchange rates.
	In pursuing its investment objective, the Fund may (but is not obligated to) use a wide variety of exchange-traded and


	over-the-counter


	derivatives, including futures
	contracts (for hedging purposes, to adjust various portfolio characteristics, including the duration (interest rate volatility) of the Funds portfolio, or as a substitute for direct investments); interest rate swaps (for hedging purposes or as
	a substitute for direct investments); total return swaps (for hedging purposes or to gain exposure to securities or markets in which it might not be able to invest directly); and credit default swaps (for hedging purposes, to adjust various
	portfolio characteristics, including the duration (interest rate volatility) of the Funds portfolio, or as a substitute for direct investments). Use of derivatives by the Fund may create investment leverage.


	The Fund may also invest in money market securities, including commercial paper. The Fund may enter into repurchase agreement transactions. The Fund may hold
	a portion of its assets in cash or cash equivalents. The Fund may enter into dollar roll or reverse repurchase agreement transactions.


	Babson Capital
	intends for the Funds portfolio dollar-weighted average duration generally to match (within 10%) the average duration of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (as of February 28, 2014, the average duration of the Index was 5.59 years).
	Duration measures the price sensitivity of a bond to changes in interest rates. Duration is the dollar weighted average time to maturity of a bond utilizing the present value of all future cash flows.


	Babson Capital selects the Funds investments based on its analysis of opportunities and risks of various fixed income securities and market sectors.
	Currently, Babson Capital may consider the following factors (which may change over time and in particular cases): the perceived potential for high income offered by different types of corporate and government obligations (including mortgage-backed




	and other asset-backed securities); diversification among industries and issuers, credit ratings, and sectors; and the relative values offered by different securities. Babson Capital may choose
	to sell securities with deteriorating credit or limited upside potential compared to other securities.


	The Fund expects that it will engage in active and
	frequent trading and so will typically have a relatively high portfolio turnover rate.





	Principal Risks



	The following are the Principal Risks of the Fund. You have the potential to make money by investing in the Fund, but you can also lose money.




	Bank Loans Risk


	Bank loans in which the Fund may invest have similar risks to below investment grade fixed income securities. Changes in the
	financial condition of the borrower or economic conditions or other circumstances may reduce the capacity of the borrower to make principal and interest payments on such instruments and may lead to defaults. Senior secured bank loans are supported
	by collateral; however the value of the collateral may be insufficient to cover the amount owed to the Fund. If the Fund relies on a third party to administer a loan, the Fund is subject to the risk that the third party will fail to perform its
	obligations. In addition, if the Fund holds only a participation interest in a loan made by a third party, the Funds receipt of payments on the loan will be dependent on the third partys willingness and ability to make those payments to
	the Fund.




	Below Investment Grade Fixed Income Securities Risk


	Below investment grade securities, commonly known as junk or
	high yield bonds, have speculative characteristics and involve greater volatility of price and yield, greater risk of loss of principal and interest, and generally reflect a greater possibility of an adverse change in financial condition
	that could affect an issuers ability to honor its obligations.




	Cash Position Risk


	The ability of the Fund to meet its objective may
	be limited to the extent that it holds assets in cash or otherwise uninvested.




	Credit Risk


	 The Fund is subject to the risk that the
	issuer of an investment held by the Fund or the counterparty to a transaction entered into by the Fund will be unable or unwilling to honor its obligations.




	Derivatives Risk


	Derivatives involve risks different from, and potentially greater than, direct investments, including risks of imperfect
	correlation between the value of derivatives and underlying assets,



	 


	 


	S-2






	counterparty default, potential losses that partially or completely offset gains, and illiquidity. Derivatives can create investment leverage and be highly volatile. Derivatives may result in
	losses greater than the amount invested. If the value of a derivative does not correlate well with the particular market or asset class the derivative is designed to provide exposure to, the derivative may not have the effect anticipated. Many
	derivatives are traded in the over-the-counter market and not on exchanges.




	Dollar Roll and Reverse Repurchase Agreement Transaction Risk


	These transactions may create leverage and subject the Fund to the credit risk of the counterparty.




	Fixed Income Securities Risk


	The values of fixed income securities typically will decline during periods of rising interest rates, and can also decline in response to changes in the financial condition of the issuer, borrower, counterparty, or underlying collateral
	assets, or changes in market, economic, industry, political, and regulatory conditions affecting a particular type of security or issuer or fixed income securities generally. Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk (the risk that
	the value of a fixed income security will fall when interest rates rise), extension risk (the risk that the average life of a security will be extended through a slowing of principal payments), prepayment risk (the risk that a security will be
	prepaid and the Fund will be required to reinvest at a less favorable rate), and credit risk.




	Foreign Investment Risk; Emerging Markets Risk;
	Currency Risk


	Foreign securities, including ADRs, are subject to additional risks compared to securities of U.S. issuers, including international trade, currency, political, regulatory, and diplomatic risks. Foreign investments may be
	subject to the risks of seizure by a foreign government, direct or indirect impact of sovereign debt default, impositions of economic sanctions or restrictions on the exchange or export of foreign currency, volatility due to political, social or
	economic instability, and tax increases. In addition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect the values of foreign securities and the price of the Funds shares. These factors can make foreign investments, especially those
	in emerging markets, more volatile and less liquid than U.S. investments. Emerging markets securities are subject to greater risks than securities issued in developed foreign markets, including less liquidity, greater price volatility, higher
	relative rates of inflation, greater political, economic, and social instability, greater custody and operational risks, and greater volatility in currency exchange rates.




	Investments in foreign currencies themselves (directly or through derivatives transactions) may be highly volatile and may create investment leverage.




	Frequent Trading/Portfolio Turnover Risk


	Portfolio turnover generally involves some expense to the Fund. The trading costs and tax effects
	associated with portfolio turnover may adversely affect the Funds performance.




	Inflation Risk


	The value of assets or income from the
	Funds investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the value of the Funds assets can decline as can the value of the Funds distributions.




	Leveraging Risk


	 Instruments and transactions, including derivatives and reverse repurchase agreement transactions, that create leverage may
	cause the value of an investment in the Fund to be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded.




	Liquidity
	Risk


	 Certain securities may be difficult (or impossible) to sell or positions difficult to close out at a desirable time and price, and the Fund may be required to hold an investment that is declining in value.




	Management Risk


	The Fund relies on the managers ability to achieve its investment objective. There can be no assurance that the Fund will
	achieve the desired results and the Fund may incur significant losses.




	Market Risk


	The value of the Funds portfolio securities may
	decline, at times sharply and unpredictably, as a result of unfavorable market-induced changes affecting particular industries, sectors, or issuers. The Fund is subject to risks affecting issuers, such as management performance, financial leverage,
	industry problems, and reduced demand for goods or services.




	Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risk


	Investments in

	mortgage-

	and asset-backed securities subject the Fund to credit risk, interest rate risk, extension risk, and prepayment risk, among other risks. Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities not issued by a
	government agency generally involve greater credit risk than securities issued by government agencies. The types of mortgages (for example, residential or commercial mortgages) underlying securities held by the Fund may differ and be affected
	differently by market factors. Investments that receive only the interest portion or the principal portion of payments on the underlying assets may be more volatile than other investments. The market for mortgage- and asset-backed securities has
	recently experienced high volatility and a lack of liquidity. As



	 


	 


	S-3






	a result, the value of many of these securities has significantly declined.




	Repurchase
	Agreement Risk


	These transactions must be fully collateralized at all times, but involve some risk to a Fund if the other party should default on its obligation and the Fund is delayed or prevented from recovering the collateral.








	U.S. Government Securities Risk


	Obligations of certain U.S. Government agencies and instrumentalities are not backed by the full
	faith and credit of the U.S. Government, and there can be no assurance that the U.S. Government would provide financial support to such agencies and instrumentalities.




	Valuation Risk


	The Fund is subject to the risk of mispricing or improper valuation of its investments, in particular to the extent that its
	securities are fair valued.




	When-Issued, Delayed Delivery, TBA, and Forward Commitment Transaction Risk


	These transactions may create
	leverage and involve a risk of loss if the value of the securities declines prior to settlement.





	Performance Information



	The following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows changes in the Funds performance
	from year to year for Initial Class shares. The table shows how the Funds average annual returns for 1, 5, and 10 years compare with those of a broad measure of market performance. Initial Class performance for periods prior to May 2, 2005 is
	that of the corresponding series of MML Series Investment Fund, the predecessor to the Fund. Performance for Service Class shares of the Fund for periods prior to its inception date (08/15/08) is based on the performance of Initial Class shares,
	adjusted to reflect Service Class expenses. Performance shown does not reflect the fees and expenses deducted under the variable life insurance or variable annuity contract through which you invest in the Fund. If these amounts were reflected,
	returns would be less than those shown. Past performance is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.

	Douglas M. Trevallion, II

	is a Managing Director and member of Babson
	Capitals Fixed Income Team. He has managed the Fund since October 2008.



	PURCHASE AND SALE OF FUND SHARES



	Shares of the Fund are generally available to separate investment accounts of variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts offered by companies such
	as MassMutual. An investor should consult the company issuing the investors variable life insurance or variable annuity contract to determine how to make redemptions.



	TAX INFORMATION



	Dividends and capital gain distributions
	are paid to the insurance company separate accounts. Variable life insurance and variable annuity contract owners should refer to the variable life insurance or variable




	annuity product prospectus or consult with their own tax adviser for information regarding the tax consequences of their investment.



	PAYMENTS TO INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THEIR AFFILIATES



	The
	Fund is not sold directly to the general public but instead is offered as an underlying investment option for variable insurance contracts. The Fund and its related companies may make payments to the sponsoring insurance company (or its affiliates)
	for distribution and/or other services. These payments may be a factor that the insurance company considers in including the Fund as an underlying investment option in the variable insurance contract or may create a conflict of interest by
	influencing the insurance company or other intermediary to recommend the variable insurance contract over another investment. The prospectus (or other offering document) for your variable insurance contract may contain additional information about
	these payments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549 ((202) 551-8090). 
Applicants' Representations
1. MML Trust was organized as a Massachusetts business trust on December 19, 1984. MML Trust is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company (File No. 811-02224). MML Trust is a series investment company as defined by Rule 18f-2 under the Act and is currently comprised of twenty-seven series.
2. Shares of the series of the MML Trust are offered solely to separate investment accounts established by MassMutual and its life insurance company subsidiaries. The MML Trust has filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) on Form N-1A (File No. 2-39334) to register such shares. The Trust may establish additional series in the future and additional classes of shares for such series. Shares of MML Trust are not offered to the general public.
3. MML II Trust was formed as a Massachusetts business trust on February 8, 2005. MML II Trust is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company (File No. 811-21714). MML II Trust is a series investment company as defined by Rule 18f-2 under the Act and is currently comprised of ten series.
4. Shares of the series of the MML II Trust are offered solely to separate investment accounts established by MassMutual and its life insurance company subsidiaries. The MML II Trust has filed a registration statement under the 1933 Act on Form N-1A (File No. 333-122804) to register such shares. The Trust may establish additional series in the future and additional classes of shares for such series. Shares of MML II Trust are not offered to the general public.
5. MassMutual is the investment adviser to the MML Trust and the MML II Trust and is responsible for providing all necessary investment management and administrative services. MassMutual is paid an investment management fee from each Fund's Start Printed Page 43730average daily net assets. MassMutual contracts with subadvisers to help manage the Funds.
6. The Existing Funds and Future Funds may offer their shares to VLI and VA Accounts of various life insurance companies (“Participating Insurance Companies”) to serve as an investment medium to support variable life insurance contracts and variable annuity contracts (together, “Variable Contracts”) issued through such accounts. Each VLI Account and VA Account is or will be established as a segregated asset account by a Participating Insurance Company pursuant to the insurance law of the insurance company's State of domicile. As such, the assets of each will be the property of the Participating Insurance Company, and that portion of the assets of such an Account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to the Account will not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business that the insurance company may conduct. The income, gains and losses, realized or unrealized from such an Account's assets will be credited to or charged against the Account without regard to other income, gains or losses of the Participating Insurance Company. If a VLI Account or VA Account is registered as an investment company, it will be a “separate account” as defined by Rule 0-1(e) (or any successor rule) under the 1940 Act and will be registered as a unit investment trust. For purposes of the Act, the Participating Insurance Company that establishes such a registered VLI Account or VA Account is the depositor and sponsor of the Account as those terms have been interpreted by the Commission with respect to variable life insurance and variable annuity separate accounts.
7. The Participating Insurance Companies are currently MassMutual and MassMutual's affiliated life insurance companies: C. M. Life Insurance Company, and MML Bay State Life Insurance Company. Various other life insurance companies that are not affiliated persons of MassMutual may be Participating Insurance Companies in the future. MassMutual is an affiliated person of the MML Trust and MML II Trust.
8. As described more fully below, the Funds will sell their shares to registered VLI and VA Accounts only if each Participating Insurance Company sponsoring such a VLI or VA Account enters into a participation agreement with the Fund. The participation agreements define or will define the relationship between each Fund and each Participating Insurance Company and memorialize or will memorialize, among other matters, the fact that, except where the agreement specifically provides otherwise, the Participating Insurance Company will remain responsible for establishing and maintaining any VLI or VA Account covered by the agreement and for complying with all applicable requirements of State and Federal law pertaining to such accounts and to the sale and distribution of variable contracts issued through such accounts. The participation agreements also memorialize or will memorialize, among other matters, the fact that, with regard to compliance with Federal securities laws, unless the agreement specifically states otherwise, the Funds' obligations relate solely to offering and selling their shares to VLI and VA Accounts covered.
9. The use of a common management investment company (or investment portfolio thereof) as an investment medium for both VLI Accounts and VA Accounts of the same Participating Insurance Company, or of two or more insurance companies that are affiliated persons of each other, is referred to herein as “mixed funding.” The use of a common management investment company (or investment portfolio thereof) as an investment medium for VLI Accounts and/or VA Accounts of two or more Participating Insurance Companies that are not affiliated persons of each other, is referred to herein as “shared funding.”
10. Applicants propose that each Existing Fund and any Future Fund may offer and sell its shares directly to a qualified group pension or group retirement plan (a “Plan” or “Qualified Plan”) outside the separate account context. Federal tax law permits investment companies such as the Funds to increase their net assets by selling shares to Plans.
11. Plans may invest in shares of an investment company as the sole investment under the Plan, or as one of several investments. Plan participants may or may not be given an investment choice depending on the terms of the Plan itself. The trustees or other fiduciaries of a Plan may vote investment company shares held by the Plan in their own discretion or, if the applicable Plan so provides, vote such shares in accordance with instructions from participants in such Plans. Applicants have no control over whether trustees or other fiduciaries of Plans, rather than participants in the Plans, have the right to vote under any particular Plan. Each Plan must be administered in accordance with the terms of the Plan and as determined by its trustee or trustees.
12. Applicants propose that any Fund may also sell shares to its investment adviser. The Treasury Regulations permit such sales as long as the return on shares held by the adviser is computed in the same manner as shares held by VLI Accounts and VA Accounts, the adviser does not intend to sell the shares to the public, and sales to an investment adviser are only made in connection with the creation or management of the Fund for the purpose of providing seed money for the Fund.
13. The promulgation of Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) preceded the issuance of the Treasury Regulations permitting the shares of Funds to be held by a Qualified Plan or an adviser for the Fund without adversely affecting the ability of the VLI Account to also hold shares. The use of a common management investment company (or investment portfolio thereof) as an investment medium for VLI Accounts, VA Accounts, investment advisers, and Qualified Plans is referred to herein as “extended mixed funding.”
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 9(a)(2) of the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for any company to serve as an investment adviser or principal underwriter of any investment company, including a unit investment trust, if an affiliated person of that company is subject to disqualification enumerated in Section 9(a)(1) or (2) of the Act. Sections 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the Act have been deemed by the Commission to require “pass-through” voting with respect to an underlying investment company's shares.
2. Rule 6e-2(b)(15) under the 1940 Act provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the Act to VLI Accounts supporting scheduled premium VLI Contracts and to their life insurance company depositors. The exemptions granted by the Rule are available, however, only where a Fund offers its shares exclusively to VLI Accounts of the same Participating Insurance Company and/or of Participating Insurance Companies that are affiliated persons of the same Participating Insurance Company and then, only where scheduled premium VLI Contracts are issued through such VLI Accounts. Therefore, VLI Accounts, their depositors and their principal underwriters may not rely on the exemptions provided by Rule 6e-2(b)(15) if shares of the Fund are held by a VLI Account through which flexible premium VLI Contracts are issued, a VLI Account of an unaffiliated Participating Insurance Company, an unaffiliated investment adviser, any VA Start Printed Page 43731Account or a Qualified Plan. In other words, Rule 6e-2(b)(15) does not provide exemptions when a scheduled premium VLI Account invests in shares of a management investment company that serves as a vehicle for mixed funding, extended mixed funding or shared funding.
3. Accordingly, Applicants request an order of the Commission granting exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act, and Rule 6e-2(b)(15) thereunder, in cases where a scheduled premium VLI Account holds shares of Funds and one or more of the following types of investors also hold shares of such Funds: (1) VA Accounts, (2) VLI Accounts, (3) a Fund's investment adviser (or an affiliated person of the investment adviser), and/or (4) a Qualified Plan.
4. Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) under the 1940 Act provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the Act to VLI Accounts supporting flexible premium variable life insurance contracts and their life insurance company depositors. The exemptions granted by the Rule are available, however, only where a Fund offers its shares exclusively to VLI Accounts (through which either scheduled premium or flexible premium VLI Contracts are issued) of the same Participating Insurance Company and/or of Participating Insurance Companies that are affiliated persons of the same Participating Insurance Company, VA Accounts of the same Participating Insurance Company or of affiliated Participating Insurance Companies, or the general account of the same Participating Insurance Company or of affiliated Participating Insurance Companies. Therefore, VLI Accounts, their depositors and their principal underwriters may not rely on the exemptions provided by Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) if shares of the Fund are held by a VLI Account of an unaffiliated Participating Insurance Company, a VA Account of an unaffiliated Participating Insurance Company, an unaffiliated investment adviser, or a Qualified Plan. In other words, Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) provides exemptions when a VLI Account supporting flexible premium VLI Contracts invests in shares of a management investment company that serves as a vehicle for mixed funding but does not provide exemptions when such a VLI Account invests in shares of a management investment company that serves as a vehicle for extended mixed funding or shared funding.
5. Accordingly, Applicants request an order of the Commission granting exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act and Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) thereunder, in cases where a flexible premium VLI Account holds shares of Funds and one or more of the following types of investors also hold shares of such Funds: (1) VA Accounts, (2) VLI Accounts, (3) a Fund's investment adviser (or an affiliated person of the investment adviser), and/or (4) a Qualified Plan.
6. As explained below, Applicants maintain that there is no policy reason for the sale of Fund shares to Qualified Plans to prohibit or otherwise limit a Participating Insurance Company from relying on the relief provided by Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15). Notwithstanding, Rule 6e-2 and Rule 6e-3(T) each specifically provide that the relief granted thereunder is available only where shares of the underlying fund are offered exclusively to insurance company separate accounts. In this regard, Applicants request exemptive relief in cases where VLI Accounts hold shares of the Funds when shares of the Funds are also sold to Qualified Plans.
7. Applicants are not aware of any reason for excluding separate accounts and investment companies engaged in shared funding from the exemptive relief provided under Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15), or for excluding separate accounts and investment companies engaged in mixed funding from the exemptive relief provided under Rule 6e-2(b)(15). Similarly, Applicants are not aware of any reason for excluding Participating Insurance Companies from the exemptive relief requested because the Funds may also sell their shares to qualified pension and retirement plans. Rather, Applicants assert that the proposed sale of shares of the Funds to Qualified Plans, in fact, may allow for the development of larger pools of assets resulting in the potential for greater investment and diversification opportunities, and for decreased expenses at higher asset levels resulting in greater cost efficiencies.
8. For the reasons explained below, Applicants have concluded that investment by Qualified Plans in the Funds should not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts between owners of VLI Contracts and other types of investors or between owners of VLI Contracts issued by unaffiliated Participating Insurance Companies.
9. Consistent with the Commission's authority under Section 6(c) of the Act to grant exemptive orders to a class or classes of persons and transactions, Applicants request exemptions for a class consisting of Participating Insurance Companies and their VLI Accounts investing in the Existing Funds and Future Funds, as well as their principal underwriters, that currently invest or in the future will invest in the Funds.
10. There is ample precedent, in a variety of contexts, for granting exemptive relief not only to the applicants in a given case, but also to members of the class not currently identified that may be similarly situated in the future. Such class relief has been granted in various contexts and from a wide variety of the 1940 Act's provisions, including class exemptions in the context of mixed funding, extended mixed funding, and shared funding. Such class exemptions have included, among other things, exemptions permitting the sale of shares by unnamed underlying funds to VLI and VA Accounts of Participating Insurance Companies and Qualified Plans.
11. Applicants note that the Commission has previously granted exemptive orders in cases where open-end management investment companies offer their shares directly to Qualified Plans in addition to offering their shares to separate accounts of affiliated or unaffiliated insurance companies which issue either or both variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance contracts. Applicants State that the order sought in their application is largely identical to these precedents with respect to the scope of the exemptions and the conditions proposed by the Applicants.
12. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in part, that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision or provisions of the Act, or any rule or regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants submit that the exemptions requested are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
13. Section 9(a)(3) of the 1940 Act provides, among other things, that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a Start Printed Page 43732disqualification enumerated in Sections 9(a)(1) or (2). Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(i) and (ii) and Rules 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(i) and (ii) under the Act provide exemptions from Section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to the limitations discussed above on mixed funding, extended mixed funding and shared funding. These exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in management of the underlying investment company.
14. The relief provided by Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(i) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(i) permits a person that is disqualified under Sections 9(a)(1) or (2) of the 1940 Act to serve as an officer, director, or employee of the life insurance company, or any of its affiliates, as long as that person does not participate directly in the management or administration of the underlying investment company. The relief provided by Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(ii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(ii) under the Act permits the life insurance company to serve as the underlying investment company's investment adviser or principal underwriter, provided that none of the insurer's personnel who are ineligible pursuant to Section 9(a) participates in the management or administration of the investment company.
15. In effect, the partial relief granted in Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) under the Act from the requirements of Section 9 of the Act limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with Section 9 to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of Section 9. Those rules recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act to apply the provisions of Section 9(a) to all individuals in a large insurance complex, most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in that organization. Applicants assert that it is also unnecessary to apply Section 9(a) of the Act to the many individuals in various unaffiliated insurance companies (or affiliated companies of Participating Insurance Companies) that may utilize the Funds as investment vehicles for VLI Accounts and VA Accounts. There is no regulatory purpose served in extending the monitoring requirements to embrace a full application of Section 9(a)'s eligibility restrictions because of mixed funding, extended mixed funding or shared funding. The Participating Insurance Companies and Qualified Plans are not expected to play any role in the management of the Funds. Those individuals who participate in the management of the Funds will remain the same regardless of which VA Accounts, VLI Accounts, insurance companies, investment advisers, or Qualified Plans use such Funds. Applying the monitoring requirements of Section 9(a) of the Act because of investment by VLI Accounts and Qualified Plans would be unjustified and would not serve any regulatory purpose. Furthermore, the increased monitoring costs could reduce the net rates of return realized by owners of VLI Contracts and Plan participants. Moreover, in the case of Qualified Plans, the Plans, unlike separate accounts, are not themselves investment companies, and therefore are not subject to Section 9 of the Act. Furthermore, it is not anticipated that a Qualified Plan would be an affiliated person of the Funds except by virtue of its holding 5% or more of a Fund's shares.
16. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii) under the Act provide exemptions from pass-through voting requirements with respect to several significant matters, assuming the limitations on mixed funding, extended mixed funding and shared funding are observed. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(A) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A) provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its variable life insurance contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying investment company, or any contract between such an investment company and its investment adviser, when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority (subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(7)(ii)(A) of Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T)).
17. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(B) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)(2) provide that an insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of owners of its variable life insurance contracts if such owners initiate any change in an underlying investment company's investment policies, principal underwriter or any investment adviser (provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii), (b)(7)(ii)(B) and (b)(7)(ii)(C) of Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T)).
18. In the case of a change in the investment policies of the underlying investment company, the insurance company, in order to disregard contract owner voting instructions, must make a good faith determination that such a change either would: (1) Violate State law, or (2) result in investments that either (a) would not be consistent with the investment objectives of its separate account, or (b) would vary from the general quality and nature of investments and investment techniques used by other separate accounts of the company, or of an affiliated life insurance company with similar investment objectives.
19. Both Rule 6e-2 and Rule 6e-3(T) generally recognize that a variable life insurance contract is primarily a life insurance contract containing many important elements unique to life insurance contracts and subject to extensive State insurance regulation. In adopting subparagraph (b)(15)(iii) of these Rules, the Commission implicitly recognized that State insurance regulators have authority, pursuant to State insurance laws or regulations, to disapprove or require changes in investment policies, investment advisers, or principal underwriters.
20. The sale of Fund shares to Qualified Plans or investment advisers will not have any impact on the exemptions requested herein regarding the disregard of pass-through voting rights. Shares sold to Qualified Plans will be held by such Plans. The exercise of voting rights by Plans, whether by trustees, participants, beneficiaries, or investment managers engaged by the Plans, does not raise the type of issues respecting disregard of voting rights that are raised by VLI Accounts. With respect to Plans, which are not registered as investment companies under the Act, there is no requirement to pass through voting rights to Plan participants. Indeed, to the contrary, applicable law expressly reserves voting rights associated with Plan assets to certain specified persons. For example, for many Plans, under Section 403(a) of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), shares of a portfolio of an investment company sold to a Plan must be held by the trust(s) funding the Plan. Section 403(a) also provides that the trustee(s) of such trusts must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the Plan, with two exceptions: (1) When the Plan expressly provides that the trustee(s) are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee, in which case the trustee(s) are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the Plan and not contrary to ERISA, and (2) when the authority to manage, acquire, or dispose of assets of the Plan is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to Section 402(c)(3) of ERISA. For such Plans, unless one of the above two exceptions stated in Section 403(a) applies, Plan trustees have the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting Start Printed Page 43733investment company shares (or related proxies) held by their Plan.
21. If a named fiduciary to a Plan appoints an investment manager, the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held, unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustee(s) or another named fiduciary. The Plans may have their trustee(s) or other fiduciaries exercise voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the Plans in their discretion. Some Plans, however, may provide for the trustee(s), an investment adviser (or advisers), or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from Plan participants.
22. Where a Qualified Plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions, Applicants do not see any potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among the Variable Contract owners and Plan participants with respect to voting of the respective Fund shares. Accordingly, unlike the circumstances surrounding VLI Accounts and VA Accounts, because Plans are not required to pass through voting rights to participants, the issue of resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts of interest should not arise with respect to voting Fund shares.
23. In addition, if a Qualified Plan were to hold a controlling interest in a Fund, Applicants do not believe that such control would disadvantage other investors in such Fund to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the shares of any open-end management investment company. In this regard, Applicants submit that investment in a Fund by a Plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by VLI Account investments in the Fund. Unlike VLI Account investments, Plan voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of Participating Insurance Companies or State insurance regulators.
24. Where a Qualified Plan provides participants with the right to instruct the trustee(s) as to how to vote Fund shares, Applicants see no reason why such participants generally or those in a particular Plan, either as a single group or in combination with participants in other Plans, would vote in a manner that would disadvantage VLI Contract owners. The purchase of shares by Plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed or shared funding.
25. Similarly, the sale of Fund shares to an investment adviser will not have any impact on the exemptions requested herein regarding the disregard of pass-through voting rights. The exercise of voting rights by investment advisers does not raise the type of issues respecting disregard of voting rights that are raised by VLI Accounts. With respect to investment advisers, which are not registered as investment companies under the Act, there is no requirement to pass through voting rights.
26. Applicants recognize that the prohibitions on mixed and shared funding might reflect concern regarding possible different investment motivations among investors. When Rule 6e-2 was first adopted, variable annuity separate accounts could invest in mutual funds whose shares were also offered to the general public. Therefore, the Commission staff may have been concerned with the potentially different investment motivations of public shareholders and owners of variable life insurance contracts. There also may have been some concern with respect to the problems of permitting a State insurance regulatory authority to affect the operations of a publicly available mutual fund and the investment decisions of public shareholders.
27. For reasons unrelated to the Act, however, Revenue Ruling 81-225 (Sept. 25, 1981) effectively deprived variable annuity contracts funded by publicly available mutual funds of their tax-benefited status. The Tax Reform Act of 1984 codified the prohibition against the use of publicly available mutual funds as an investment vehicle for both variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance contracts. In particular, Section 817(h) of the Code, in effect, requires that the investments made by both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts be “adequately diversified.” If such a separate account is organized as part of a “two-tiered” arrangement where the account invests in shares of an underlying open-end investment company (i.e., an underlying fund), the diversification test will be applied to the underlying fund (or to each of several underlying funds), rather than to the separate account itself, but only if “all of the beneficial interests” in the underlying fund “are held by one or more insurance companies (or affiliated companies) in their general account or in segregated asset accounts.” Accordingly, a separate account that invests in a publicly available mutual fund will not be adequately diversified for these purposes. As a result, any underlying fund, including the Funds, that sells shares to VA Accounts or VLI Accounts, would, in effect, be precluded from also selling its shares to the public. Consequently, the Funds may not sell their shares to the public.
28. Applicants assert that the rights of an insurance company or a State insurance regulator to disregard the voting instructions of owners of Variable Contracts is not inconsistent with either mixed funding or shared funding. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners Variable Life Insurance Model Regulation (the “NAIC Model Regulation”) suggests that it is unlikely that insurance regulators would find an underlying fund's investment policy, investment adviser or principal underwriter objectionable for one type of Variable Contract but not another type. The NAIC Model Regulation has long permitted the use of a single underlying fund for different separate accounts. Moreover, Article VI, Section 3 of the NAIC Model Regulation has been amended to remove a previous prohibition on one separate account investing in another separate account. Lastly, the NAIC Model Regulation does not distinguish between scheduled premium and flexible premium variable life insurance contracts. The NAIC Model Regulation, therefore, reflects the NAIC's apparent confidence that such combined funding is appropriate and that State insurance regulators can adequately protect the interests of owners of all variable contracts.
29. Applicants assert that shared funding by unaffiliated insurance companies does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several or all States. A particular State insurance regulator could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other States in which the insurance company offers its contracts. However, the fact that different insurers may be domiciled in different States does not create a significantly different or enlarged problem.
30. Shared funding by unaffiliated insurers, in this respect, is no different than the use of the same investment company as the funding vehicle for affiliated insurers, which Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) permit. Affiliated insurers may be domiciled in different States and be subject to differing State law requirements. Affiliation does not reduce the potential, if any exists, for differences in State regulatory requirements. In any event, the conditions set forth below are designed to safeguard against, and provide procedures for resolving, any adverse effects that differences among State regulatory requirements may produce. If a particular State insurance regulator's decision conflicts with the Start Printed Page 43734majority of other State regulators, then the affected Participating Insurance Company will be required to withdraw its separate account investments in the relevant Fund. This requirement will be provided for in the participation agreement that will be entered into by Participating Insurance Companies with the relevant Fund.
31. Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) give Participating Insurance Companies the right to disregard the voting instructions of VLI Contract owners in certain circumstances. This right derives from the authority of State insurance regulators over VLI Accounts and VA Accounts. Under Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15), a Participating Insurance Company may disregard VLI Contract owner voting instructions only with respect to certain specified items. Affiliation does not eliminate the potential, if any exists, for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies, principal underwriter or investment adviser initiated by such Contract owners. The potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements in Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) that the Participating Insurance Company's disregard of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific good faith determinations.
32. A particular Participating Insurance Company's disregard of voting instructions, nevertheless, could conflict with the voting instructions of a majority of VLI Contract owners. The Participating Insurance Company's action possibly could be different than the determination of all or some of the other Participating Insurance Companies (including affiliated insurers) that the voting instructions of VLI Contract owners should prevail, and either could preclude a majority vote approving the change or could represent a minority view. If the Participating Insurance Company's judgment represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, then the Participating Insurance Company may be required, at the relevant Fund's election, to withdraw its VLI Accounts' and VA Accounts' investments in the relevant Fund. No charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. This requirement will be provided for in the participation agreement entered into by the Participating Insurance Companies with the relevant Fund.
33. Applicants assert that there is no reason why the investment policies of an Fund would or should be materially different from what these policies would or should be if the Fund supported only VA Accounts or VLI Accounts, whether flexible premium or scheduled premium VLI Contrasts. Each type of insurance contract is designed as a long-term investment program.
34. Each Fund will be managed to attempt to achieve its specified investment objective, and not favor or disfavor any particular Participating Insurance Company or type of insurance contract. There is no reason to believe that different features of various types of Variable Contracts will lead to different investment policies for each or for different VLI Accounts and VA Accounts. The sale of Variable Contracts and ultimate success of all VA Accounts and VLI Accounts depends, at least in part, on satisfactory investment performance, which provides an incentive for each Participating Insurance Company to seek optimal investment performance.
35. Furthermore, no single investment strategy can be identified as appropriate to a particular Variable Contract. Each “pool” of VLI Contract and VA Contract owners is composed of individuals of diverse financial status, age, insurance needs and investment goals. A Fund supporting even one type of Variable Contract must accommodate these diverse factors in order to attract and retain purchasers. Permitting mixed and shared funding will provide economic support for the continuation of the Funds. Mixed and shared funding will broaden the base of potential Variable Contract owner investors, which may facilitate the establishment of additional Funds serving diverse goals.
36. Applicants do not believe that the sale of the shares to Plans will increase the potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among different types of investors. In particular, Applicants see very little potential for such conflicts beyond those that would otherwise exist between owners of VLI Contracts and VA Contracts. Applicants submit that either there are no conflicts of interest or that there exists the ability by the affected parties to resolve such conflicts consistent with the best interests of VLI Contract owners, VA Contract owners and Plan participants.
37. Applicants considered whether there are any issues raised under the Code, Treasury Regulations, or Revenue Rulings thereunder, if Qualified Plans, VA Accounts, and VLI Accounts all invest in the same Fund. Applicants have concluded that neither the Code, nor the Treasury Regulations nor Revenue Rulings thereunder, present any inherent conflicts of interest if Plans, VLI Accounts, and VA Accounts all invest in the same Fund.
38. Applicants note that, while there are differences in the manner in which distributions from VLI Accounts and Qualified Plans are taxed, these differences have no impact on the Funds. When distributions are to be made, and a VLI Account or Plan is unable to net purchase payments to make distributions, the VLI Account or Plan will redeem shares of the relevant Fund at its net asset values in conformity with Rule 22c-1 under the Act (without the imposition of any sales charge) to provide proceeds to meet distribution needs. A Participating Insurance Company will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of its VLI Contract and a Plan will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
39. Applicants considered whether it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving voting rights to VLI Contract owners and Plans. In connection with any meeting of Fund shareholders, the Fund's transfer agent will inform each Participating Insurance Company, investment adviser, and Qualified Plan of their share holdings and provide other information necessary for such shareholders to participate in the meeting (e.g., proxy materials). Each Participating Insurance Company then will solicit voting instructions from owners of VLI Contracts and VA Contracts as required by either Rules 6e-2 or 6e-3(T), or Section 12(d)(1)(E)(iii)(aa) of the Act, as applicable, and its participation agreement with the relevant Fund. Shares held by Plans will be voted in accordance with applicable law. The voting rights provided to Plans with respect to the shares would be no different from the voting rights that are provided to Plans with respect to shares of mutual funds sold to the general public. Furthermore, if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a Plan's decision to disregard Plan participant voting instructions, if applicable, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, the Plan may be required, at the election of the relevant Fund, to withdraw its investment in the Fund, and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal.
40. Applicants do not believe that the ability of a Fund to sell its shares to its investment adviser or Qualified Plans gives rise to a senior security. “Senior Security” is defined in Section 18(g) of the Act to include “any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends.” As noted above, regardless of the rights and benefits of participants under Plans and owners of VLI Start Printed Page 43735Contracts, VLI Accounts, VA Accounts, Participating Insurance Companies, and Plans, only have, or will only have, rights with respect to their respective shares of a Fund. These parties can only redeem such shares at net asset value. No shareholder of a Fund has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends.
41. Applicants do not believe that the veto power of State insurance commissioners over certain potential changes to Fund investment objectives approved by owners of VLI Contracts creates conflicts between the interests of such owners and the interests of Plan participants. Applicants note that a basic premise of corporate democracy and shareholder voting is that not all shareholders may agree with a particular proposal. Their interests and opinions may differ, but this does not mean that inherent conflicts of interest exist between or among such shareholders or that occasional conflicts of interest that do occur between or among them are likely to be irreconcilable.
42. Although Participating Insurance Companies may have to overcome regulatory impediments in redeeming shares of a Fund held by their VLI Accounts, the Plans and the participants in participant-directed Plans can make decisions quickly and redeem their shares in a Fund and reinvest in another investment company or other funding vehicle without impediments, or as is the case with most Plans, hold cash pending suitable investment. As a result, conflicts between the interests of VLI Contract owners and the interests of Plans and Plan participants can usually be resolved quickly since the Plans can, on their own, redeem their Fund shares.
43. Finally, Applicants considered whether there is a potential for future conflicts of interest between Participating Insurance Companies and Qualified Plans created by future changes in the tax laws. Applicants do not see any greater potential for material irreconcilable conflicts arising between the interests of VLI Contract owners (or, for that matter, VA Contract owners) and Plan participants from future changes in the Federal tax laws than that which already exists between VLI Contract owners and VA Contract owners.
44. Applicants recognize that the foregoing is not an all-inclusive list, but rather is representative of issues that they believe are relevant to their application. Applicants believe that the discussion contained therein demonstrates that the sale of Fund shares to Qualified Plans would not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts between the interests of Plan participants and VLI Contract owners or other investors. Further, Applicants submit that the use of the Funds with respect to Plans is not substantially dissimilar from each Fund's current and anticipated use, in that Plans, like VLI Accounts, are generally long-term investors.
45. Applicants assert that permitting a Fund to sell its shares to its investment adviser (or the adviser's affiliates) for the purpose of obtaining seed money will enhance management of each Fund without raising significant concerns regarding material irreconcilable conflicts among different types of investors. A potential source of initial capital is a Fund's investment adviser. However, provision of seed capital or the purchase of shares in connection with the management of a Fund by its investment adviser may be deemed to violate the exclusivity requirement of Rule 6e-2(b)(15) and/or Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15). Given the conditions of Treasury Regulation 1.817-5(f)(3) and the harmony of interest between a Fund, on the one hand, and its investment adviser (or affiliates), on the other, Applicants assert that little incentive for overreaching exists. Furthermore, such investment should not implicate the concerns discussed above regarding the creation of material irreconcilable conflicts. Instead, investments by an investment adviser (or its affiliates), will permit the orderly and efficient creation and operation of a Fund, and reduce the expense and uncertainty of using outside parties at the early stages of the Fund's operations.
46. Various factors have limited the number of insurance companies that offer Variable Contracts. These factors include the costs of organizing and operating a funding vehicle, certain insurers' lack of experience with respect to investment management, and the lack of name recognition by the public of certain insurance companies as investment experts. In particular, some smaller life insurance companies may not find it economically feasible, or within their investment or administrative expertise, to enter the Variable Contract business on their own. Use of the Funds as a common investment vehicle for VLI Accounts would reduce or eliminate these concerns. Mixed and shared funding should also provide several benefits to owners of VLI Contracts by eliminating a significant portion of the costs of establishing and administering separate underlying funds.
47. Participating Insurance Companies will benefit not only from the investment and administrative expertise of the Funds' investment advisers and subadvisers, but also from the potential cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by larger pools of funds. Mixed and shared funding also would permit a greater amount of assets available for investment by a Fund, thereby promoting economies of scale, by permitting increased safety through greater diversification, or by making the addition of new Funds more feasible. Therefore, mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer VLI Accounts. This should result in increased competition with respect to both VLI Account design and pricing, which can in turn be expected to result in more product variety. Applicants also assert that sale of shares in a Fund to Qualified Plans, in addition to VLI Accounts and VA Accounts, will result in an increased amount of assets available for investment in a Fund. This may benefit VLI Account owners by promoting economies of scale, permitting increased safety of investments through greater diversification, and making the addition of new Funds more feasible.
48. Applicants also submit that, regardless of the type of shareholder in a Fund, its investment adviser (and the adviser's affiliates) are or would be contractually and otherwise obligated to manage the Fund solely and exclusively in accordance with that Fund's investment objectives, policies and restrictions, as well as any guidelines established by its board of trustees (a “Board”). Thus, each Fund will be managed in the same manner as any other mutual fund.
49. Applicants note that VLI Accounts historically have been employed to accumulate shares of mutual funds that are not affiliated with the depositor or sponsor of the VLI Account. In particular, Applicants assert that sales of Fund shares, as described above, will not have any adverse Federal income tax consequences to other investors in such a Fund.
50. In addition, Applicants assert that granting the exemptions requested herein is in the public interest and, as discussed above, will not compromise the regulatory purposes of Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), or 15(b) of the Act or Rules 6e-2 or 6e-3(T) thereunder.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions which shall apply to the Funds as well as any Future Fund that relies on the order:Start Printed Page 43736

1. A majority of the Board of each Fund will consist of persons who are not “interested persons” of the Fund, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, and as modified by any applicable orders of the Commission, except that if this condition is not met by reason of death, disqualification or bona fide resignation of any trustee or trustees, then the operation of this condition will be suspended: (a) For a period of 90 days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the Board, (b) for a period of 150 days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies, or (c) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by order upon application, or by future rule.
2. Each Board will monitor its respective Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between and among the interests of the owners of all VLI Contracts and VA Contracts and participants of all Plans investing in the Fund, and determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to such conflicts. A material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons, including: (a) An action by any State insurance regulatory authority, (b) a change in applicable Federal or State insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action or interpretive letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax or securities regulatory authorities, (c) an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding, (d) the manner in which the investments of the Fund are being managed, (e) a difference in voting instructions given by VA Contract owners, VLI Contract owners, and Plans or Plan participants, (f) a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard the voting instructions of contract owners; or (g) if applicable, a decision by a Plan to disregard the voting instructions of Plan participants.
3. Participating Insurance Companies (on their own behalf, as well as by virtue of any investment of general account assets in a Fund), any investment adviser to a Fund, and any Plan that executes a participation agreement upon its becoming an owner of 10% or more of the net assets of a Fund (collectively, “Participants”) will report any potential or existing conflicts to the relevant Board. Each Participant will be responsible for assisting the Board in carrying out the Board's responsibilities under these conditions by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for the Board to consider any issues raised. This responsibility includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by each Participating Insurance Company to inform the Board whenever Variable Contract owner voting instructions are disregarded, and, if pass-through voting is applicable, an obligation by each Plan to inform the Board whenever it has determined to disregard Plan participant voting instructions. The responsibility to report such information and conflicts, and to assist the Board, will be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their participation agreement with a Fund, and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the Variable Contract owners. The responsibility to report such information and conflicts, and to assist the Board, also will be contractual obligations of all Plans under their participation agreement with a Fund, and such agreements will provide that these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of Plan participants.
4. If it is determined by a majority of a Board, or a majority of the disinterested directors/trustees of such Board, that a material irreconcilable conflict exists, then the relevant Participant will, at its expense and to the extent reasonably practicable (as determined by a majority of the disinterested directors/trustees), take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict, up to and including: (a) Withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of their VLI Accounts or VA Accounts from the Fund and reinvesting such assets in a different investment vehicle including another Fund, (b) in the case of a Participating Insurance Company, submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected Variable Contract owners and, as appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group (i.e., VA Contract owners or VLI Contact owners of one or more Participating Insurance Companies) that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to the affected Contract owners the option of making such a change, (c) withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the Plans from the affected Fund and reinvesting them in a different investment medium, and (d) establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard Variable Contract owner voting instructions, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, then the Participating Insurance Company may be required, at the election of the Fund, to withdraw such Participating Insurance Company's VA Account and VLI Account investments in the Fund, and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a Plan's decision to disregard Plan participant voting instructions, if applicable, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, the Plan may be required, at the election of the Fund, to withdraw its investment in the Fund, and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a Board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action will be a contractual obligation of all Participants under their participation agreement with a Fund, and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of Variable Contract owners or, as applicable, Plan participants.
For purposes of this Condition 4, a majority of the disinterested directors/trustees of the Board of each Fund will determine whether or not any proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict, but, in no event, will the Fund or its investment adviser be required to establish a new funding vehicle for any Variable Contract or Plan. No Participating Insurance Company will be required by this Condition 4 to establish a new funding vehicle for any Variable Contract if any offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the Contract owners materially and adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict. Further, no Plan will be required by this Condition 4 to establish a new funding vehicle for the Plan if: (a) A majority of the Plan participants materially and adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict vote to decline such offer, or (b) pursuant to documents governing the Plan, the Plan trustee makes such decision without a Plan participant vote.
5. A Board's determination of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and its implications will be made known in writing promptly to all Participants.
6. Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all Variable Contract owners whose Contracts are issued through registered VLI Accounts or registered VA Accounts for as long as required by the Act as interpreted by the Commission. However, as to Variable Contracts issued through VA Accounts Start Printed Page 43737or VLI Accounts not registered as investment companies under the Act, pass-through voting privileges will be extended to owners of such Contracts to the extent granted by the Participating Insurance Company. Accordingly, such Participating Insurance Companies, where applicable, will vote the shares of each Fund held in their VLI Accounts and VA Accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely received from Variable Contract owners. Participating Insurance Companies will be responsible for assuring that each of their VLI and VA Accounts investing in a Fund calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other Participating Insurance Companies investing in that Fund.
The obligation to calculate voting privileges as provided in this Application shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their participation agreement with the Fund. Each Participating Insurance Company will vote shares of each Fund held in its VLI or VA Accounts for which no timely voting instructions are received, as well as shares attributed to it, in the same proportion as those shares for which voting instructions are received. Each Plan will vote as required by applicable law, governing Plan documents and as provided in this application.
7. As long as the Act requires pass-through voting privileges to be provided to Variable Contract owners or the Commission interprets the Act to require the same, a Fund investment adviser (or its affiliates) will vote their shares of the Fund in the same proportion as all votes cast on behalf of all Variable Contract owners having voting rights; provided, however, that such an investment adviser (or affiliates) shall vote its shares in such other manner as may be required by the Commission or its staff.
8. Each Fund will comply with all provisions of the Act requiring voting by shareholders (which, for these purposes, shall be the persons having a voting interest in its shares), and, in particular, the Fund will either provide for annual meetings (except to the extent that the Commission may interpret Section 16 of the Act not to require such meetings) or comply with Section 16(c) of the Act (although each Fund is not, or will not be, one of those trusts of the type described in Section 16(c) of the Act), as well as with Section 16(a) of the Act and, if and when applicable, Section 16(b) of the Act. Further, each Fund will act in accordance with the Commission's interpretations of the requirements of Section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of directors/trustees and with whatever rules the Commission may promulgate thereto.
9. A Fund will make its shares available to the VLI Accounts, VA Accounts, and Plans at or about the time it accepts any seed capital from its investment adviser (or affiliates) or from a general account of a Participating Insurance Company.
10. Each Fund has notified, or will notify, all Participants that disclosure regarding potential risks of mixed and shared funding may be appropriate in VLI Account and VA Account prospectuses or Plan documents. Each Fund will disclose, in its prospectus that: (a) Shares of the Fund may be offered to both VA Accounts and VLI Accounts and, if applicable, to Plans, (b) due to differences in tax treatment and other considerations, the interests of various Variable Contract owners participating in the Fund and the interests of Plan participants investing in the Fund, if applicable, may conflict, and (c) the Fund's Board will monitor events in order to identify the existence of any material irreconcilable conflicts and to determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to any such conflicts.
11. If and to the extent Rule 6e-2 and Rule 6e-3(T) under the Act are amended, or Rule 6e-3 under the Act is adopted, to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the Act, or the rules thereunder, with respect to mixed or shared funding, on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested in this Application, then each Fund and/or Participating Insurance Companies, as appropriate, shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with Rules 6e-2 or 6e-3(T), as amended, or Rule 6e-3, to the extent such rules are applicable.
12. Each Participant, at least annually, shall submit to the Board of each Fund such reports, materials or data as the Board reasonably may request so that the directors/trustees of the Board may fully carry out the obligations imposed upon the Board by the conditions contained in this Application. Such reports, materials and data shall be submitted more frequently if deemed appropriate by the Board of a Fund. The obligations of the Participants to provide these reports, materials and data to the Board, when it so reasonably requests, shall be a contractual obligation of all Participants under their participation agreement with the Fund.
13. All reports of potential or existing conflicts received by a Board, and all Board action with regard to determining the existence of a conflict, notifying Participants of a conflict and determining whether any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board or other appropriate records, and such minutes or other records shall be made available to the Commission upon request.
14. Each Fund will not accept a purchase order from a Qualified Plan if such purchase would make the Plan an owner of 10 percent or more of the net assets of the Fund unless the Plan executes an agreement with the Fund governing participation in the Fund that includes the conditions set forth herein to the extent applicable. A Plan will execute an application containing an acknowledgement of this condition at the time of its initial purchase of shares.

Applicants submit, for all the reasons explained above, that the exemptions requested are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.
