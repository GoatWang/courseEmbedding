Newswise — Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE: CCE), the world’s largest marketer, distributor, and producer of Coca-Cola products, today announced the establishment of The Vicki R. Palmer Scholarship Program, created in honor of Spelman College trustee and retired Coca-Cola Enterprises executive Vicki R. Palmer. CCE will fund $25,000 in annual scholarships to the College in support of the program. Given to students with academic promise, a demonstrated financial need, and a proven commitment to community service, The Vicki R. Palmer Scholarship will also provide Spelman students an opportunity to complete a summer internship at CCE. “The Vicki R. Palmer Scholarship honors Vicki’s invaluable contributions to our company, while representing CCE’s ongoing commitment to attract and retain a diverse, inclusive, and highly talented workforce,” said John F. Brock, chairman and chief executive officer, Coca-Cola Enterprises. “This program recognizes her dedication to community service, diversity, inclusion, and the empowerment of women, which are all trademarks of her leadership style.”Throughout her 25-year tenure in the Coca-Cola system, Mrs. Palmer was committed to helping fulfill the Company’s diversity and inclusion goals of recruiting, retaining and promoting minorities and women, and providing opportunities for women and minority-owned businesses.“I am honored by CCE’s generosity in establishing this scholarship program, which will serve as a lasting legacy,” said Mrs. Palmer. “This tribute underscores the missions of CCE and Spelman, both of which are committed to preparing young leaders for a competitive, global business environment while making a positive social impact.”An avid supporter of Spelman College, Mrs. Palmer was elected to the school’s board of trustees in 1995. Currently, she serves as chair of the Investment Committee and is a member of the Audit, Finance and Budget Committee; Audit Sub-Committee; and Executive Committee.“As a board member for more than 14 years, Vicki has demonstrated her passion for student development and mentorship by actively engaging business and community leaders in support of Spelman’s vision,” said Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum, president, Spelman College. “The Palmer Scholarship celebrates this passion by providing financial support and career training to help Spelman women become leaders in a 21st century global economy.”Mrs. Palmer made lasting leadership contributions to both CCE and the Atlanta community over her distinguished career. She was initially hired by The Coca-Cola Company in 1983 before joining CCE’s initial leadership team as Assistant Treasurer when the company formed in 1986. She was then elected Corporate Vice President and Treasurer in 1992; Senior Vice President and Special Assistant to the CEO in 2000; and served as Executive Vice President, Financial Services and Administration from 2004 until her retirement earlier this year. Spelman CollegeFounded in 1881, Spelman College is a prestigious, highly selective, liberal arts college that prepares women to change the world.  Located in Atlanta, Ga., this historically black college boasts a 79 percent graduation rate, and outstanding alumnae such as Children's Defense Fund Founder Marian Wright Edelman; former U.S. Foreign Service Director General Ruth Davis, authors Tina McElroy Ansa and Pearl Cleage; and actress LaTanya Richardson.  More than 83 percent of the full-time faculty members have Ph.D.s or other terminal degrees, and the average faculty to student ratio is 12:1.  More than 2,100 students attend Spelman. For more information, visit www.spelman.edu.Coca-Cola EnterprisesCoca-Cola Enterprises is the world’s largest marketer, producer, and distributor of bottle and can liquid nonalcoholic refreshment.

                                Report abuseTranscript of Mentor PresentationBlack Woman Leader ProjectBlack Women, Status, Achievement & Impact. Vicki R. Palmer Why Mrs. Palmer? Mrs. Palmer as a Change Agent In Her Own Words I chose to shadow Vicki R. Palmer for my Black Woman Leader Project. I became acquainted with Mrs. Palmer after being awarded the Palmer Scholarship through an internship with Coca Cola Refreshments. The corporation established the scholarship program in honor of Mrs. Palmer, a twenty year veteran of the Spelman College Board of Trustees, during her tenure as the Executive Vice President of Financial Services and Administration for Coca-Cola Enterprises. The award is presented to five students who exhibit academic promise and a commitment to service following the completion a paid summer internship at CCR. After our first meeting, it was clear to me that Mrs. Palmer was an extraordinary and uncommonly gifted African American woman . Professional Accomplishments After a prosperous twenty two year career with Coca Cola, Mrs. Palmer established The Palmer Group LLC, a general consulting firm. She serves on the Board of Directors for Haverty Furniture Companies and the First Horizon National Corporation. Mrs. Palmer has been recognized by Black Enterprise magazine as one of the nation’s “20 Women of Power and Influence” and as one of the “Top 75 Blacks in Corporate America.” The Atlanta Business League saluted her with its prestigious Millennium Pacesetter Award. She was named an Outstanding Georgia Citizen by Georgia’s Secretary of State and Women Looking Ahead magazine named her one of “Georgia’s 100 Most Powerful Women.”  In her own words "One of the most pivotal moments of my career was when I was named Vice-President and Treasurer of Coca-Cola Enterprises at the age of 39. The year was 1992 and it was virtually unheard of for a Black female to be Treasurer of a Fortune 200 company. I would say that the second most pivotal moment was when I was named to my first corporate board. In my case it was an extraordinary story. The very first place I worked was a bank in Memphis, TN where I became the first African American and the first female to complete their corporate training program. I only worked for the bank for two years as I was recruited away by Federal Express which is headquartered in Memphis. Roll the clock forward almost 20 years later when I became the first woman and the only African American to sit on the Board of that bank. On October 30 of this year, Mrs. Palmer held a luncheon at Phipps Plaza to raise money for Spelman College scholarships. Attendees included Dr. Beverly Tatum, Rosalind Brewer, the President and CEO of Sam's Club, Mrs. Carolyn Young (wife of Andrew Young), Latanya Richardson (wife of Samuel L, Jakson), philanthropist Millie Smith, and Keshia Knight Pulliam who served as the Mistress of Ceremony for the occasion. Mrs. Palmer was gracious enough to include the Palmer Scholars and the Spelman College Glee Club in the event. The fundraiser raised $1,000,000 for Spelman College Scholarships. "My mother instilled in me a tremendous work ethic, a great sense of responsibility and an enormous amount of faith. She told me that my faith in God would sustain me all the days of my life if I held on to even the smallest measure of that faith. She suffered so much during her short life yet she never complained. I was always clear that any obstacles that came my way would pale by comparison to what she endured. By the time she died, her dreams for me had become my dreams. I was determined not to let her down. Thus began my journey for excellence." Personal Achievements Despite her exceptional corporate career, Mrs. Palmer’s greatest accomplishments rest in the manner in which she’s been able to help others succeed. “Young people are the joy of my life,” she’s said. “It’s all about giving back and what better way to give back than to spend time with young people. My life is richly blessed by many exceptional young people,” Palmer continues. “I hope all of us reach out to the phenomenal youth in our community.” Aside from Spelman College, Mrs. Palmer is on the Board of Governors for Woodward Academy here in Atlanta as well the Board of Trustees for Rhodes College, her alma mater. As my career began to blossom, I always pursued excellence and I always believed in hard work. What I came to realize is that the combination of these two things is incredibly powerful. I began to see that the possibilities for my career were exceptional if I continued to work harder than anyone else and was patient. The more I accomplished, the more motivated I became. I truly wanted to reach a place in the corporate world where I could make a difference to the bottom line success of the company but also make a difference in the lives of the employees who looked like me. I like to think I accomplished both. Mrs. Palmer on Motivation There certainly have been moments where I felt marginalized as a result of my race or gender. What I learned over the years was that each person has to decide for him or herself how to handle these situations. Even in 2012, they still occur although one hopes with less frequency. The great news is more people who look like you and me are beginning to hold that book. Excellence and hard work remain the best way to the top. Add exceptional communications skills, a willingness to be a team player and a super mentor to the mix and you just might get close to breaking that glass ceiling!!
