Using resources judiciously






        By-product sales
      



Using the by-products generated during the steelmaking process makes good business sense, as well as reducing the environmental impact


We try to use all the materials produced during the process of steelmaking, whether they are prime steel products or materials commonly seen as waste. ArcelorMittal’s shared services team coordinates sales of by-products from the steelmaking process, with the aim of generating revenue from these products.
As well as making good business sense, making the most of the by-products of steelmaking is the right thing to do in terms of material stewardship, by recycling as much as possible and minimising the impact of steelmaking on the environment. Through their work on by-products, the shared services team drives collaboration between ArcelorMittal’s mills and customers.
By-products include all forms of slag from both integrated and mini mills in granulated or ground form, tar and tar distillates, benzole, ammonium sulphate, mill scales and sludges, coke breeze and various dusts collected throughout the various steel production stages.
We also operate a number of slag dumps, which were accumulated before ArcelorMittal owned various steel plants. These may be rich in iron and carbon-bearing materials and can be re-used in our steelmaking facilities. This lowers the need to buy materials, reducing the company’s external material and supply chain footprint.

                Steel products
              

In 2015, ArcelorMittal produced nearly 15 million tons of raw steel in the United States. Our principal products include a broad range of flat, long and tubular products to serve the automotive, construction, energy, appliance, container and machinery markets. More than 95 percent of ArcelorMittal’s raw steel production in the U.S. is from flat operations, which are primarily integrated facilities. All of our products are available in standard carbon grades as well as high-strength, low-alloy grades for more demanding applications.




                                Flat products
                              

Hot-rolled
All coiled flat-rolled steel is initially hot-rolled by passing a slab through a multi-stand rolling mill to reduce its thickness to less than 5⁄8 inch. Hot-rolled steel destined for the sheet market can be either shipped as black band or cleaned in an acid bath and sold as pickled band. These products are used in non-critical surface applications such as automotive frames and wheels, construction products, pipe, off-highway equipment and guardrails.
Cold-rolled
Cold-rolled sheet is hot-rolled coil that has been further processed through a pickler and then passed through a rolling mill without reheating until the desired gauge, or thickness, and other physical properties have been achieved. Cold-rolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel. Further processing through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves ductility and formability. Cold-rolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures. Cold-rolled sheet is used in, among other things, steel applications that demand higher surface quality, such as exposed automobile and appliance panels. Cold-rolled sheet prices are usually higher than hot-rolled steel prices. For certain applications, cold-rolled sheet is coated or painted.
Coated
Either hot-rolled or cold-rolled coil may be coated with zinc, aluminum or a combination thereof to render it corrosion resistant. Hot-dip galvanized, galvannealed, Galvalume, electrogalvanized and aluminized products are types of coated steel. These are also among the highest value-added sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and usually have the strictest quality requirements. Coated steel products are generally used in applications such as automobiles, household appliances, roofing and siding, heating and air conditioning equipment, air ducts, switch boxes, chimney flues, awnings and grain bins.
Plate
Plate is steel that is generally more than 3⁄16 inch thick. It can be made on either a coiled plate mill, up to one-inch thick, or a discrete plate mill. The coiled plate, or discrete plate, is then cut into sections for specific end uses. Commodity steel plate is used in a variety of applications, such as storage tanks, ships and railcars, large diameter pipe and machinery parts. More specialized steel plate, such as high-strength, low-alloy, heat-treated or alloy plate, can have superior strength and performance characteristics for particular applications such as the manufacture of construction, mining and logging equipment; pressure vessels and oil and gas transmission lines; and the fabrication of bridges and buildings. Quenched and tempered plate is harder and stronger and can be used in products, such as military armor and hard rock mining equipment.
Tin
Tin mill sheet steel is used to produce food packaging and other containers. It is available as black plate, tin plate and tin-free steel. Black plate is an uncoated thin gauge cold-rolled steel; tin plate is black plate, electrolytically plated with metallic tin; and tin-free steel is black plate that has been electrolytically plated with metallic chromium and chromium oxides. Both tin plate and tin-free steel undergo a plating process whereby the molecules from the positively charged tin or chromium anode attach to the negatively charged sheet steel. The thickness of the coating is readily controlled through regulation of the voltage and speed of the sheet through the plating area.

Rail

Billets and blooms are fed through rollers that form rail. Rail is produced in a number of sections determined by their weight per yard and relative strengths. Rail is sold to railroad companies and regional transit authorities for new track projects and for the repair of existing track.




                                Tubular products
                              

Specialty steel tubing
Apart from welded and seamless steel tubes, available in a wide spectrum of carbon and alloy grades, tubular product solutions can also be tailored to meet the specific needs of customers through an extensive range of services, including cutting, end finishing, heat treating and steel slitting. There are also drawn-over-mandrel (DOM) and cold drawing capabilities available for the most demanding applications. Tubular products serve a variety of markets including automotive, industrial and construction equipment, hydraulic cylinders, agricultural equipment and mineral mining equipment.




                                Welded products
                              

Tailor blanks
Tailored blanks play a significant role in providing “tailor made” solutions to automotive customers. A tailored blank, which can be a straight line or curvilinear product, is created by laser welding together steels of various grades, thicknesses and/or different coatings. Tailored blanks help improve the performance of car parts in a vehicle while reducing weight and enhancing safety.

Education and Early Career[edit]
Mittal received a bachelor’s degree in engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and a Master of Business Administration from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. He began his career in the engineering and automotive industry serving at Larsen & Toubro, Escorts and Denso from 1975 to 1989. During this time period he set up green field manufacturing facilities imbibing Japanese technology and practices.
Career in IT[edit]
After a successful stint in the automotive industry, Mittal began working for the IT services and consulting services company Wipro as Chief Executive. He was responsible for building the peripherals business in collaboration with Seiko Epson and later led the integrated PC and Server business unit. He remained with Wipro through 1994.
Mittal spent the following 14 years in various leadership roles at Digital/HP/Compaq. He has been credited with the successful turnaround of Digital and very effective integration of successive mergers with Compaq and HP. He held many Global roles and finally was the senior vice president of services for HP in Asia Pacific and Japan. Through these positions Mittal learned to extract the most value from mergers and successfully manage joint ventures and creating green field businesses.
Most recently Mittal served as President of the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), a position held since 2008. As such, he has worked tirelessly to advance the interests of IT and Business Process Outsourcing companies with headquarters in India. Under his tenure, the industry has grown from $60 billion in 2008 to $108 billon in 2013 during the most turbulent economic environment. He also set up the Data Security Council of India which promotes data protection and develops best practices for security and privacy.[2]
In addition to fostering the financial success of this sector, Mittal has liaised with government representatives worldwide. Recently this has meant educating American policymakers about the competitive edge Indian IT companies bring to their economy. The Financial Express called Mittal’s term leading NASSCOM “unarguably successful.”
Throughout his career, Mittal has worked with a wide range of organizations. He served as a member of the Indian Prime Minister’s Committee on National e-Governance, as board member Institutes of Technology and the Global Advisory Council of the World Information Technology and Services Alliance, among other roles. He is a frequent speaker at International and National conferences and is currently on several Boards and associated with several NGOs.
Awards and Recognition[edit]
Collectively these experiences have made Mittal a business executive who knows how to build and create institutions. He has worked closely with top Indian officials to help make India an attractive place for foreign investment and been active in several free trade agreements. Recently the World Information Technology and Services Alliance (WITSA) recognized him with a lifetime achievement award for outstanding dedication to the growth of the Global ICT industry.[3] Other achievements include Business Leader of the Year by Rotary International and a distinguished alumni award from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.
