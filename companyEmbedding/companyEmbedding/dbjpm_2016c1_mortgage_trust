      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 85.3% of the properties by balance and 
      asset summary reviews and cash flow analysis of 92.6% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Low Fitch Leverage: This transaction has lower leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated transactions. The Fitch DSCR for the trust is 1.25x, 
      while the YTD 2016 and 2015 averages are 1.14x and 1.18x, respectively. 
      The Fitch LTV for the trust is 98.7%, which is lower than both the YTD 
      2016 and 2015 averages of 108.7% and 109.3%, respectively. Excluding the 
      credit-opinion loans (14.7% of the pool), the Fitch DSCR and LTV are 
      1.21x and 105.7%, respectively.
    

      High Pool Concentration: The pool is more concentrated than other recent 
      Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. The top 10 loans comprise 56.8% 
      of the pool, which is in-line with the recent averages of 56.2% for YTD 
      2016 and above the 2015 average of 49.3%. Additionally, the loan 
      concentration index (LCI) and sponsor concentration index (SCI) are 472 
      and 555, respectively, above the respective 2015 averages of 367 and 410.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: The transaction has two credit 
      opinion loans, totaling 14.7% of the pool. 787 Seventh Avenue (9.8% of 
      the pool) is the largest loan in the transaction and has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB+sf' on a stand-alone basis. 225 
      Liberty Street (5% of the pool) is the fifth largest loan in the 
      transaction and has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBBsf' on a 
      stand-alone basis. Excluding these loans, the conduit has a Fitch 
      stressed DSCR and LTV of 1.21x and 105.7%, respectively.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 11.5% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to DBJPM 2016-C1 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young, LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 33 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
