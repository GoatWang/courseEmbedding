NAVISTAR APPOINTS VINCENT J.
INTRIERI AND MARK H. RACHESKY

TO BOARD OF
DIRECTORS

Company to Add a Third Director
Designated and Mutually Agreed Upon by Icahn Partners and MHR Fund
Management, Pursuant to Settlement Agreement
 


 


LISLE, Ill., October 8,
2012 – Navistar
International Corporation (NYSE: NAV) today announced that Vincent
J. Intrieri and Mark H. Rachesky have been appointed to the
company’s Board of Directors. The company also agreed to add
a third director to the Navistar Board, who will be designated and
mutually agreed upon by Icahn Partners and its affiliated entities
(“Icahn”) and MHR Fund Management LLC and its
affiliated entities (“MHR”).

Mr. Intrieri and
Dr. Rachesky will replace Mr. Eugenio Clariond and
Mr. Steven J. Klinger, who have agreed to retire from the
Navistar Board of Directors. The mutually agreed upon third
director will also replace an existing Navistar director. The three
new directors will stand for election at the company’s 2013
Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Board will remain at ten
members so long as either Icahn or MHR continues to have a designee
on the Board.

“We are pleased to have
reached an agreement with Icahn and MHR as we believe it is in the
best interest of the company and all of its shareholders,”
said Michael N. Hammes, Navistar’s independent lead
director.

Lewis B. Campbell, Navistar’s
chairman and chief executive officer, said, “Vince and Mark
will provide meaningful shareholder representation on the Board,
and we welcome their insights and look forward to working with them
constructively as we continue to execute on our plan to drive
long-term profitability and deliver shareholder value. On behalf of
the Board, I would also like to thank Eugenio and Steven for their
contributions and service to Navistar during their time as
directors.”

Mr. Icahn stated, “I am
glad to have reached an agreement that provides strong shareholder
representation on the Board and look forward to working diligently
with the Board to enhance value at Navistar.”

Dr. Rachesky stated, “I
am pleased with the favorable outcome of the process which resulted
in giving shareholders meaningful board representation. I look
forward to working closely with management and other members of the
Board of Directors of Navistar to effect the changes necessary to
drive value for all shareholders.”



The appointment of the new directors
is pursuant to an agreement the company has entered into with each
of Icahn and MHR. In the agreements, Icahn and MHR have agreed that
they will not run a proxy contest at the 2013 annual meeting and
will support the Board’s nominees, as well as certain other
provisions. The full agreements will be filed in a Form 8-K with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Vincent J. Intrieri has been
employed by entities related to Carl C. Icahn since October 1998 in
various investment related capacities. Since January 1, 2008,
he has served as Senior Managing Director of Icahn Capital L.P.,
the entity through which Carl C. Icahn manages investment

Navistar International Corporation announced that Vincent J. Intrieri and Mark H. Rachesky have been appointed to the company's Board of Directors. The company also agreed to add a third director to the Navistar Board, who will be designated and mutually agreed upon by Icahn Partners and its affiliated entities ("Icahn") and MHR Fund Management LLC and its affiliated entities ("MHR").
Mr. Intrieri and Dr. Rachesky will replace Mr. Eugenio Clariond and Mr. Steven J. Klinger, who have agreed to retire from the Navistar Board of Directors. The mutually agreed upon third director will also replace an existing Navistar director. The three new directors will stand for election at the company's 2013 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Board will remain at ten members so long as either Icahn or MHR continues to have a designee on the Board.
"We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Icahn and MHR as we believe it is in the best interest of the company and all of its shareholders," said Michael N. Hammes, Navistar's independent lead director.
Lewis B. Campbell, Navistar's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Vince and Mark will provide meaningful shareholder representation on the Board, and we welcome their insights and look forward to working with them constructively as we continue to execute on our plan to drive long-term profitability and deliver shareholder value. On behalf of the Board, I would also like to thank Eugenio and Steven for their contributions and service to Navistar during their time as directors."
Mr. Icahn stated, "I am glad to have reached an agreement that provides strong shareholder representation on the Board and look forward to working diligently with the Board to enhance value at Navistar."
Dr. Rachesky stated, "I am pleased with the favorable outcome of the process which resulted in giving shareholders meaningful board representation. I look forward to working closely with management and other members of the Board of Directors of Navistar to effect the changes necessary to drive value for all shareholders."
The appointment of the new directors is pursuant to an agreement the company has entered into with each of Icahn and MHR. In the agreements, Icahn and MHR have agreed that they will not run a proxy contest at the 2013 annual meeting and will support the Board's nominees, as well as certain other provisions. The full agreements will be filed in a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

When an agreement is made without adjudication during an impending lawsuit, a settlement agreement lays out the terms of agreement between the parties. The parties (''Plaintiff'') and (''Defendant'') will come to an agreement on how they will cease the actions of the lawsuit.Settlement agreements enable opposing parties to bypass a lengthy court process by agreeing to specific terms and conditions which may include relief to plaintiff, method of payment (if any), attorney fees and other incurred costs.These agreements almost always contain confidentiality agreements, wherein the plaintiff of the lawsuit agrees to not disclose any details concerning the nature of the settlement to the press or other individuals.  A settlement agreement may be used in a divorce case or civil lawsuit.
