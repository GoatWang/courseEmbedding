1Forbes rates funds separately in both up and down market cycles. Funds are rated against their peers and are awarded letter grades (A+ to F) based on peformance in bull and bear markets. Market cycles are defined by an index or blend of indices. Stock funds, for example, are rated and benchmarked over four bullish and bearish cycles using the S&P 500 as a benchmark. The peformance benchmark for Balanced funds is a 50/50 blended index of the S&P 500 and the Merrill Lynch corporate/government bond index. Most bond funds are rated for five years, with each month treated as either a bullish or bearish month. Exception: taxable junk bond funds, which are presently rated over a 12-year period corresponding to the three most recent market cycles of the Merrill Lynch high yield bond index. 2Annual expense ratio plus brokerage commissions paid by the fund for buying and selling securities. p: Prior year.

J. P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc.


                  JPMorgan Investment Management's (JPMIM) investment approach is based on the premise that building an information advantage and capitalizing on it through active management is the key to investment success. The firm employs global fundamental research, quantitative valuation tools and bottom-up portfolio construction methods. Investment decisions are based on micro-valuation insights.JPMIM's investment approach focuses on identifying opportunities through in-house research that seeks to assess the fundamental value of securities. Active investment management, supported by JPMIM's research capabilities, is the driving force behind every portfolio. Research analysts evaluate the US market by sector, while globally-based portfolio managers and analysts cover the international capital markets. JPMIM integrates the skills of their research analysts with those of experienced portfolio managers and economists to leverage information and choose the most fundamentally attractive investments.Investments are managed by teams, with portfolio managers working closely with research analysts. Portfolio managers typically purchase first and second quintile stocks while underweighting third, fourth and fifth quintile stocks. Holdings are diversified with broad exposure without regard to industry sector or geographic region. JPMIM looks for the stocks and ADRs of US and non-US companies with leadership positions in specialty niches, long-life product cycles, competitive cost structures, diversified client bases and significant insider ownership.
