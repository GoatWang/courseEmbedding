Private Equity
Putting Capital to Work, Making Companies Stronger.





Overview Our investments span a wide range of industries around the world in established and growth-oriented businesses alike. Playing a vital role in helping companies realize their growth potential, we uncover value by identifying great companies and enhancing their performance by providing patient capital and operating support to strong management teams. Our approach helps our portfolio companies grow core businesses, launch new initiatives, make transformative acquisitions and upgrade technologies and systems to support their long-term strategy.   
We provide more than just capital. We seek to make the companies we invest in stronger through a bottoms-up strategy of transformation. Crucially, we bring the expertise of our Portfolio Operations Group to provide strategic guidance on a variety of operational improvements, including revenue growth, procurement, leadership development, lean process and IT optimization, energy sustainability, and employee health care.
  







				A Message from Joe Baratta, Global Head of Private Equity
			










DRIVING
Transformative Impact  We strive to create value by investing in great businesses where our capital, strategic insight, global relationships and operational support can drive transformation that unlocks the company’s potential. In addition to benefiting our investors, the improvements in growth and global competitiveness benefit workers, communities and other stakeholders. 
We are patient investors who practice the art of the long view, and are committed to achieving the best long-term outcomes for our businesses and our investors. 
 


DISCIPLINED
Due Diligence  Our investment approach is based on a disciplined due diligence process that measures risk while identifying the catalysts for increased value. We purposefully engage only in friendly transactions and work with talented management teams to achieve transformative results. Our specialized Portfolio Operations Group helps to maximize value by improving processes across varied elements of a business’s operations.    
The returns that these investments earn for our investors – pension funds, academic and charitable institutions, governments and other institutions, as well as retail investors – help to secure and grow the assets needed to support retirees and fund essential programs.

Blackstone is a global leader in private equity, with $100 billion in assets under management through our opportunistic and private equity segments.

 $37.5billion
Available Capital to Invest




“ “We are constantly looking for situations where we see something, or we are able to add value in a way that our competitors don't. Our people feel the obligation to go out there and find special situations where we can intervene to drive change.”  - Joseph Baratta Global Head of Private Equity   











   
Pro-active, targeted sourcing  Sector-based, theme-driven deal sourcing is the primary responsibility and mandate of our investment professionals. We aim to source high-quality and proprietary investment opportunities by proactively developing and leveraging strong relationships with companies and key deal intermediaries. At regular pipeline meetings with sector teams, we review potential opportunities and determine what resources – both internal and external – are best suited to pursue those opportunities.  




   
Value-oriented discipline In determining value for new investments, we focus on a business’s current outlook and judge the predictability of that outlook over time, while also factoring in what we can do for the business to drive even better outcomes after our acquisition. 
  




   
Transformational operating improvements 
We actively target companies in which significant value can be created through clear strategic and operational change, and created our Portfolio Operations Group to provide hands-on support to help our portfolio companies become more productive, efficient and valuable. Once a company joins the portfolio, we help management craft a plan to reach their full potential over the long term, and provide assistance as they put this plan into practice.  




Our Portfolio


We are proud of Blackstone’s role as a positive economic catalyst for the companies in our Corporate Private Equity portfolio. We work to identify, invest in and enhance the value of great businesses.


Global in scope, our Corporate Private Equity group has offices in Toronto, New York, London, Dusseldorf, Mumbai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Sydney. As of June 30, 2017, our Corporate Private Equity funds held interests in 82 companies.

Traditional Leveraged Buyouts 












Traditional Leveraged Buyouts 

We pursue control leveraged buyouts of both large and mid-cap companies globally

                Our large buyouts tend to be in companies of global scale with strong brands and high relative market shares, where we can still drive growth and operating improvements.  Our mid-cap buyouts tend to be of companies that are differentiated vs. larger competitors and have protected market niches and multiple avenues of growth and operating improvements.

Buy and Build Platforms

Smaller companies, scalable platforms, backable management teams

                In our “buy-and-build” transactions we tend to invest in smaller companies that have scalable platforms and backable management teams in large, fragmented industries, where we believe there are substantial revenue and margin benefits from sector consolidation.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with The Blackstone Group L.P.'s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Our Business  Blackstone is one of the largest independent managers of private capital in the world. Our business is organized into four segments:   Private Equity. We are a world leader in private equity investing, having managed six general private equity funds, as well as three sector focused funds, since we established this business in 1987. We will also begin investing from our seventh general private equity fund in the second quarter of 2016. We refer to these managed corporate private equity funds collectively as our Blackstone Capital Partners ("BCP") funds. Our Private Equity segment also includes Blackstone Tactical Opportunities ("Tactical Opportunities"), our opportunistic investment platform that invests globally across asset classes, industries and geographies, Strategic Partners Fund Solutions ("Strategic Partners"), a secondary private fund of funds business, Blackstone Total Alternatives Solution ("BTAS"), a multi-asset investment program for eligible high net worth investors offering exposure to certain of Blackstone's key illiquid investment strategies through a single commitment, and our capital markets services business ("BXCM"). During the first quarter of 2016, we held the first closing for Blackstone Core Equity Partners ("BCEP"), which targets control-oriented investments in high-quality companies with durable businesses and seeks to offer a lower level of risk and a longer hold period than traditional private equity.  Our corporate private equity business pursues transactions throughout the world across a variety of transaction types, including large buyouts, mid-cap buyouts, buy and build platforms (which involve multiple acquisitions behind a single management team and platform) and growth equity/development projects (which involve significant minority investments in mature companies and greenfield development projects in energy and power). Tactical Opportunities seeks to capitalize on complex and dislocated market situations across asset classes, industries and geographies in a broad range of investments, including private and public securities, and instruments, where the underlying exposure may be to equity, debt, and/or real assets. Strategic Partners focuses on delivering access to a range of opportunities, leveraging its proprietary database to acquire single fund interests or complex portfolios in an efficient and timely manner.   Real Estate. Since our start in 1991, we have become a world leader in real estate investing. We have managed or continue to manage a number of global, European and Asian focused opportunistic real estate funds, several real estate debt investment vehicles, a NYSE publicly traded real estate investment trust ("BXMT") and several core+ real estate funds. We refer to our opportunistic real estate funds as our Blackstone Real Estate Partners ("BREP") funds, our real estate debt investment vehicles as our Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies ("BREDS") funds and our core+ real estate funds as our Blackstone Property Partners ("BPP") funds.  Our BREP funds are geographically diversified and target a broad range of "opportunistic" real estate and real estate related investments that are generally undermanaged assets with higher potential for equity appreciation. BREP has made significant investments in lodging, office buildings, shopping centers, residential and a variety of real estate operating companies.  Our BREDS vehicles target real estate debt-related investment opportunities in the public and private markets, primarily in the United States and Europe.  Our BPP funds are geographically diversified and target substantially stabilized assets generating relatively stable cash flow with a focus on office, multifamily, industrial and retail assets in gateway markets.  Table of Contents   Credit. Our Credit segment consists principally of GSO Capital Partners LP ("GSO"), a global leader in managing credit-focused products within private and public debt market strategies. GSO's products include senior credit-focused funds, mezzanine funds, distressed debt funds, general credit-focused funds, registered investment companies, separately managed accounts and collateralized loan obligation ("CLO") vehicles.  We generate revenue from fees earned pursuant to contractual arrangements with funds, fund investors and fund portfolio companies (including management, transaction and monitoring fees), and from capital markets services. We invest in the funds we manage and, in most cases, receive a preferred allocation of income (i.e., a Carried Interest) or an incentive fee from an investment fund in the event that specified cumulative investment returns are achieved (generally collectively referred to as "Performance Fees"). The composition of our revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of the different businesses in which we operate. Net investment gains and investment income generated by the Blackstone Funds, principally private equity and real estate funds, are driven by value created by our operating and strategic initiatives as well as overall market conditions. Fair values are affected by changes in the fundamentals of the portfolio company, the portfolio company's industry, the overall economy and other market conditions.  Business Environment  Blackstone's businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, Asia and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world.  The first quarter of 2016 was marked by high volatility across global equity and debt markets amid continued concerns over the pace of economic growth and the course and effect of monetary policy of the world's central banks, with the CBOE volatility index averaging over 20 in a single quarter for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. The CBOE volatility index rose to a closing high of 28.14 as the market bottomed in mid-February, and declined as the market recovered to end the quarter at 13.95. Despite plunging over 11% in the first six weeks of the year and experiencing significant volatility during most of the quarter, the S&P 500 index ended the first quarter roughly flat. Global equity indices, however, mostly ended the quarter in negative territory, with the FTSE 100 down 1%, the Hang Seng down 5%, the Euro Stoxx down 8%, the Nikkei 225 down 12% and the MSCI World Index flat at 0%.  U.S. non-investment grade debt markets also saw significant volatility in the quarter, with high yield spreads gapping out at 900 basis points in early February, their highest level since 2009, before recovering with the equity market rally in March. The Credit Suisse High Yield Index was up 3.1% for the quarter. The first quarter also represented the fifth highest quarterly high yield default total on record, with approximately $31 billion in debt defaults. Energy and metals/mining credits represented 84% of these defaults, as the depressed commodity price environment continued to impact leveraged issuers.  The overall economic outlook for 2016 remains moderate, with current forecasts calling for global economic growth of 3.2% and U.S. economic growth of 2.4%. However, investor sentiment improved late in the first quarter of 2016 as fears of a U.S. recession and a significant slowdown in China appear to have abated in part. GDP in China expanded by 6.7% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2016, its slowest pace in the past seven years, but slightly above the 6.6% growth expected by economists. While momentum in China has continued to slow, positive surprises from trade, inflation, output and credit have buoyed the outlook for 2016. Additionally, increased European Central Bank stimulus and a more dovish Fed have helped to restore a degree of confidence. The equity  Table of Contents  market rebound at the end of the first quarter, coupled with increased employment opportunities, has improved consumer optimism, although consumer spending continues to languish due to ongoing economic concerns.  After reaching a 13-year low of $26.21 a barrel in February, the price of oil rallied sharply, with WTI Crude Oil reaching $40.20 a barrel on March 17, and ending the first quarter at $38.34 a barrel, following signs of willingness by major oil producing countries to cut production. Despite rebounding in the first quarter of 2016, oil prices remain well below the $80 - $100 a barrel range characterized by the past decade. Natural gas prices fell 35% from the beginning of the year, bottoming at $1.49 during the quarter, before rebounding to end the quarter at $1.94. Gasoline prices across the U.S. averaged $1.86 a gallon during the first quarter, the lowest three-month period for gasoline prices since the beginning of 2004.  Capital markets volumes were depressed in the first quarter, with only 11 U.S. initial public offerings ("IPOs") and the slowest opening period for global debt capital markets activity since 2009. After a record 2015, global M&A activity dropped 11% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015.  Although January and February of 2016 were characterized by continued volatility, risk aversion and limited liquidity, March showed a strong rebound in activity. Mutual fund net inflows turned positive, and a resurgence in high-yield debt issuances led to the most active month since November 2015.  Organizational Structure  The simplified diagram below depicts our current organizational structure. The diagram does not depict all of our subsidiaries, including intermediate holding companies through which certain of the subsidiaries depicted are held.  [[Image Removed: LOGO]]  Key Financial Measures and Indicators  We manage our business using traditional financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our investment activities. Our key financial measures and indicators are discussed below.  Table of Contents  Revenues  Revenues primarily consist of management and advisory fees, performance fees, investment income, interest and dividend revenue and other. Please refer to "Part I. Item 1. Business - Incentive Arrangements / Fee Structure" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and "Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition" for additional information regarding the manner in which Base Management Fees and Performance Fees are generated.  Management and Advisory Fees, Net - Management and Advisory Fees, Net are comprised of management fees, including base management fees, transaction and other fees and advisory fees net of management fee reductions and offsets.  The Partnership earns base management fees from limited partners of funds in each of its managed funds, at a fixed percentage of assets under management, net asset value, total assets, committed capital or invested capital, or in some cases, a fixed fee. Base management fees are recognized based on contractual terms specified in the underlying investment advisory agreements.  Transaction and other fees (including monitoring fees) are fees charged directly to managed funds and portfolio companies. The investment advisory agreements generally require that the investment adviser reduce the amount of management fees payable by the limited partners to the Partnership by an amount equal to a portion of the transaction and other fees directly paid to the Partnership by the portfolio companies. We refer to these amounts as management fee reductions. The amount of the reduction varies by fund, the type of fee paid by the portfolio company and the previously incurred expenses of the fund.  Management fee offsets are reductions to management fees payable by the limited partners of the Blackstone Funds, which are granted based on the amount such limited partners reimburse the Blackstone Funds for placement fees.  Advisory fees consist of advisory retainer and transaction-based fee arrangements related to capital markets services. Advisory retainer fees are recognized when services for the transactions are complete, in accordance with terms set forth in individual agreements. Transaction-based fees are recognized when (a) there is evidence of an arrangement with a client, (b) agreed upon services have been provided, (c) fees are fixed or determinable, and  Accrued but unpaid Management and Advisory Fees, net of management fee reductions and management fee offsets, as of the reporting date are included in Accounts Receivable or Due from Affiliates in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Management fees paid by limited partners to the Blackstone Funds and passed on to Blackstone are not considered affiliate revenues.  Performance Fees - Performance Fees earned on the performance of Blackstone's hedge fund structures ("Incentive Fees") are recognized based on fund performance during the period, subject to the achievement of minimum return levels, or high water marks, in accordance with the respective terms set out in each hedge fund's governing agreements. Accrued but unpaid Incentive Fees charged directly to investors in Blackstone's offshore hedge funds as of the reporting date are recorded within Due from Affiliates in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Accrued but unpaid Incentive Fees on onshore funds as of the reporting date are reflected in Investments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Incentive Fees are realized at the end of a measurement period, typically annually. Once realized, such fees are not subject to clawback or reversal.  In certain fund structures, specifically in private equity, real estate and certain hedge fund solutions and credit-focused funds ("Carry Funds"), performance fees (Carried Interest) are allocated to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners. At the end of each reporting period, the Partnership calculates the Carried Interest that would be due to the Partnership for each fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of  Table of Contents  whether such amounts have been realized. As the fair value of underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to amounts recorded as Carried Interest to reflect either  Carried Interest is realized when an underlying investment is profitably disposed of and the fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return or, in limited instances, after certain thresholds for return of capital are met. Carried Interest is subject to clawback to the extent that the Carried Interest received to date exceeds the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results. As such, the accrual for potential repayment of previously received Carried Interest, which is a component of Due to Affiliates, represents all amounts previously distributed to Blackstone Holdings and non-controlling interest holders that would need to be repaid to the Blackstone Funds if the Blackstone Carry Funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds' investments as of the reporting date. The actual clawback liability, however, generally does not become realized until the end of a fund's life except for certain funds, including certain Blackstone real estate funds, multi-asset class investment funds and credit-focused funds, which may have an interim clawback liability.  Investment Income (Loss) - Investment Income (Loss) represents the unrealized and realized gains and losses on the Partnership's principal investments, including its investments in Blackstone Funds that are not consolidated, its equity method investments, and other principal investments. Investment Income  Interest and Dividend Revenue - Interest and Dividend Revenue comprises primarily interest and dividend income earned on principal investments held by Blackstone.  Other Revenue - Other Revenue consists of miscellaneous income and foreign exchange gains and losses arising on transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars.  Expenses  Compensation and Benefits - Compensation - Compensation and Benefits consists of  Compensation and Benefits - Performance Fee - Performance Fee Compensation consists of Carried Interest (which may be distributed in cash or in-kind) and Incentive Fee allocations, and may in future periods also include  Table of Contents  allocations of investment income from Blackstone's firm investments, to employees and senior managing directors participating in certain profit sharing initiatives. Such compensation expense is subject to both positive and negative adjustments. Unlike Carried Interest and Incentive Fees, compensation expense is based on the performance of individual investments held by a fund rather than on a fund by fund basis. Compensation received from advisory clients in the form of securities of such clients may also be allocated to employees and senior managing directors.  Other Operating Expenses - Other Operating Expenses represents general and administrative expenses including interest expense, occupancy and equipment expenses and other expenses, which consist principally of professional fees, public company costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services and depreciation and amortization.  Fund Expenses - The expenses of our consolidated Blackstone Funds consist primarily of interest expense, professional fees and other third party expenses.  Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities  Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities represent the component of Partners' Capital in consolidated Blackstone Funds held by third party investors and employees. The percentage interests held by third parties and employees is adjusted for general partner allocations and by subscriptions and redemptions in funds of hedge funds and certain credit-focused funds which occur during the reporting period. In addition, all non-controlling interests in consolidated Blackstone Funds are attributed a share of income (loss) arising from the respective funds and a share of other comprehensive income, if applicable. Income (Loss) is allocated to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities based on the relative ownership interests of third party investors and employees after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income (loss) such as fees allocable to The Blackstone Group L.P.  Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities  Non-controlling interests related to funds of hedge funds are subject to annual, semi-annual or quarterly redemption by investors in these funds following the expiration of a specified period of time, or may be withdrawn subject to a redemption fee during the period when capital may not be withdrawn. As limited partners in these types of funds have been granted redemption rights, amounts relating to third party interests in such consolidated funds are presented as Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. When redeemable amounts become legally payable to investors, they are classified as a liability and included in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. For all consolidated funds in which redemption rights have not been granted, non-controlling interests are presented within Partners' Capital in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities.  Non-Controlling Interests in Blackstone Holdings  Non-Controlling Interests in Blackstone Holdings represent the component of Partners' Capital in the consolidated Blackstone Holdings Partnerships held by Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships.  Certain costs and expenses are borne directly by the Holdings Partnerships. Income (Loss), excluding those costs directly borne by and attributable to the Holdings Partnerships, is attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Blackstone Holdings. This residual attribution is based on the year to date average percentage of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units held by Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships.  Table of Contents  Income Taxes  The Blackstone Holdings Partnerships and certain of their subsidiaries operate in the U.S. as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and generally as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Accordingly, these entities in some cases are subject to New York City unincorporated business taxes or non-U.S. income taxes. In addition, certain of the wholly owned subsidiaries of the Partnership and the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships will be subject to federal, state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provision attributable to the Partnership's share of this income tax is reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Current and deferred tax liabilities are recorded within Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  Blackstone uses the flow-through method to account for investment tax credits. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense.  Blackstone analyzes its tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. Blackstone records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process: (a) a determination is made whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (b) those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. Blackstone recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in General, Administrative, and Other expenses within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  There remains some uncertainty regarding Blackstone's future taxation levels. Over the past several years, a number of legislative and administrative proposals to change the taxation of Carried Interest have been introduced and, in certain cases, have been passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that would have, in general, treated income and gains, including gain on sale, attributable to an investment services partnership interest, or "ISPI", as income subject to a new blended tax rate that is higher than the capital gains rate applicable to such income under current law, except to the extent such ISPI would have been considered under the legislation to be a qualified capital interest. Our common units and the interests that we hold in entities that are entitled to receive Carried Interest would likely have been classified as ISPIs for purposes of this legislation. It is unclear whether or when the U.S. Congress will pass such legislation or what provisions will be included in any final legislation if enacted.  . . .
