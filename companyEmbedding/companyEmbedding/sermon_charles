Product Highlights


    A unique collection of 19 sermons based on rural themes.
  

    From the prince of preachers Charles Spurgeon
  


Product Details
Along with illustrations, Farm Sermons contains nineteen great sermons which are based upon various things related to farming such as the Sluggard's Farm, the Broken Fence, Frost and Thaw, the Corn of Wheat, the Ploughman, Ploughing the Rock, The Parable of the Sower, The Principle Wheat, Spring in the Heart, Farm Labourers, What the Farm Labourers Can Do and What They Cannot Do, The Sheep before the Shearers, In the Hay-Field, The Joy of Harvest, Spiritual Gleaning, Mealtime in the Cornfields, The Loaded Waggon, Threshing and Wheat in the Barn.
Spurgeon was born and raised in the country, and loved it. While Farm Sermons was dedicated to and designed for reading by farmers, there are spiritual truths for all readers of this volume. 
About the AuthorFew people in history can be known by one name and have it ring true with their audience, and Charles Haddon Spurgeon is one of them.  Over time, Spurgeon has become known and revered as the "Prince of Preachers".  In the last 200 years he has been one of the most influential men for not only Preachers of the Gospel but for those who have not had the opportunity to hear and receive the Gospel message.  He wrote tirelessly over his life, and WORDsearch Bible Software is committed to bring as many of Spurgeon's works as possible to you in electronic form.
The details of Charles  Haddon Spurgeon's life still continue to amaze one and all. He was born in Kelvedon, Essex, England, on June 19, 1834. He accepted Christ in 1850 at the age of 15. By age 16, he preached his first sermon in 1851, and by age 20, Spurgeon had already preached over 600 sermons.  In 1854, Spurgeon was asked to become pastor of the New Park Street Chapel, one of the sixth largest Baptist Churches in London.
The 1200 seat Chapel had previously been pastored by Dr. John Gill among others, and it carried a rich heritage with it.  Although the Church was located in the midst of a filthy industrial district which was hard to reach, by 1855, it was obvious that the Church must start meeting at the Exter Hall while the Church building was expanded.  When the expansion was completed, it still was too small and the congregation was forced to start meeting at the Surey Music Hall.  By 1856, over 10,000 people would crowd the hall just to get a chance to hear Spurgeon preach a sermon.
To accommodate the growing number of people, the church voted to build a new sanctuary and to change the name of the Church to the Metropolitan Tabernacle.  On March 31, 1861, the first service was held in the sanctuary, with a capacity of 5,600 was the largest non-conformist church in the world.
When Spurgeon came to New Park Street in 1854 it had a membership of just 232 members. By the end of 1891, 14,460 souls had been baptized and added to the church with a standing membership of 5311. Spurgeon ministered there for over 30 years. It is estimated that over his lifetime he preached to over 10,000,000 people.

Critical Reviews

  I've always loved Charles Spurgeon for his plainspokenness, his courage, his enthusiasm for the Word of God, his love for the truth, his command of the English language, and his ability to use simple, vivid language to make difficult truths inescapably clear.
  


  Though in a widely different vein, the volume is in every way worthy of the author of John Ploughman's Talk.  The varied phrases of farming life to which reference is made in the sacred word are turned into excellent accounts in conveying deep and important spiritual lessons.  In a word, these sermons are as fresh and fragrant as the newly-ploughed soil or the new-mown hay, and ought to be perused with pleasure and profit by many who know little or nothing of agricultural pursuits.
  


  One day I heard a friend say, "I write my sermons, then I read Spurgeon  to see how he dealt with the text."  The Prince of Preachers is still head of the class.

Product Details
This collection of sermons from Charles Spurgeon not only features the 57 volume set of the Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit, original unabridged, unedited 57-volume sermon series stenographically recorded by his peerless and untiring private secretary, Mr. J. W. Harrald, but it also includes the six volumes of the New Park Street Pulpit. In total, this 63 volume set contains 3563 complete sermons, enough to preach one sermon a week for over 68 years.
In addition, we have created topical indexes to all the sermons, so that you can search also by topic.  The vast sermon illustrations are also indexed by topic for easy access.
About the AuthorFew people in history can be known by one name and have it ring true with their audience, and Charles Haddon Spurgeon is one of them.  Over time, Spurgeon has become known and revered as the "Prince of Preachers".  In the last 200 years he has been one of the most influential men for not only Preachers of the Gospel but for those who have not had the opportunity to hear and receive the Gospel message.  He wrote tirelessly over his life, and WORDsearch Bible Software is committed to bring as many of Spurgeon's works as possible to you in electronic form.
The details of Charles Haddon Spurgeon's life still continue to amaze one and all. He was born in Kelvedon, Essex, England, on June 19, 1834. He accepted Christ in 1850 at the age of 15. By age 16, he preached his first sermon in 1851, and by age 20, Spurgeon had already preached over 600 sermons.  In 1854, Spurgeon was asked to become pastor of the New Park Street Chapel, one of the sixth largest Baptist Churches in London.
The 1200 seat Chapel had previously been pastored by Dr. John Gill among others, and it carried a rich heritage with it.  Although the Church was located in the midst of a filthy industrial district which was hard to reach, by 1855, it was obvious that the Church must start meeting at the Exter Hall while the Church building was expanded.  When the expansion was completed, it still was too small and the congregation was forced to start meeting at the Surey Music Hall.  By 1856, over 10,000 people would crowd the hall just to get a chance to hear Spurgeon preach a sermon.
To accommodate the growing number of people, the church voted to build a new sanctuary and to change the name of the Church to the Metropolitan Tabernacle.  On March 31, 1861, the first service was held in the sanctuary, with a capacity of 5,600 was the largest non-conformist church in the world.
When Spurgeon came to New Park Street in 1854 it had a membership of just 232 members. By the end of 1891, 14,460 souls had been baptized and added to the church with a standing membership of 5311. Spurgeon ministered there for over 30 years. It is estimated that over his lifetime he preached to over 10,000,000 people.

Critical Reviews

  I have turned to Charles Spurgeon in these days for help, and I have not been disappointed. My purpose in this article is to show how Spurgeon's life and ministry can encourage pastors to keep on preaching through adversity.
  


  I've always loved Charles Spurgeon for his plain-spokenness, his courage, his enthusiasm for the Word of God, his love for the truth, his command of the English language, and his ability to use simple, vivid language to make difficult truths inescapably clear.
  


  Never have I read anywhere or in any literature anything that compares to the sermons of C. H. Spurgeon
  


  Constitute a complete body of systematic theology.
  


  I have read everything by Spurgeon I can get my hands on!
  


  Translated as Mr. Spurgeon Sermons have been into nearly all of the languages of the world.  Their popularity at home is a fact that admits no dispute, and needs no enforcement.  The language is as homely, as pungent, and as felicitous in its appeal to the understanding of the people as ever it was.   The subjects of many texts are handled by him in a manner that shows his complete mastery of the highest rhetorical art of exposition.
  


  Charles Haddon Spurgeon, whose name is a household word the world over, is the most remarkable minister of Christ now living
  


  Mr. Spurgeon was absolutely destitute of intellectual benevolence. If men saw as he did they were orthodox; if they saw things in some other way they were heterodox, pestilent and unfit to lead the minds of students or inquirers. Mr. Spurgeon's was a superlative egotism; not the shilly-shallying, timid, half-disguised egotism that cuts off its own head, but the full-grown, over-powering, sublime egotism that takes the chief seat as if by right. The only colors which Mr. Spurgeon recognized were black and white.
  


  There was no one who could preach like my father. In inexhaustible variety, witty wisdom, vigorous proclamation, loving entreaty, and lucid teaching, with a multitude of other qualities, he must, at least in my opinion, ever be regarded as the prince of preachers.
  


  One day I heard a friend say, "I write my sermons, then I read Spurgeon  to see how he dealt with the text."  The Prince of Preachers is still head of the class.

Overview
Benefit from the incredible wisdom of Charles Spurgeon, passage by passage. Spurgeon’s writings on the Bible fill dozens of volumes—his thoughts on particular passages scattered in numerous books and sermons. These volumes collect his thoughts on ten different New Testament letters in a commentary format, with illustrations and applications culled from his sermons and writings.
Use Spurgeon’s application-oriented content in your sermons; in these commentaries, such content is clearly labeled. Find a great illustration with this hand-edited and curated Logos Bible Software edition, which tags illustrations with preaching themes to make them searchable in the Sermon Starter Guide in Logos. Take advantage of our in-depth research of Spurgeon to better understand, apply, and illustrate the Bible.
What This Commentary Offers
The Spurgeon Commentary: New Testament Letters Collection makes Spurgeon’s content accessible—there is no longer a need to comb through many volumes of Spurgeon’s content looking for one nugget of wisdom. Spurgeon’s writings are now curated in a format that is tied to the biblical text.
These commentaries direct you to places where Spurgeon explicitly cites a verse and where he alludes to it—using specialized, technology-based research to offer you the best of Spurgeon. They highlight illustration content—illustrations accompany the commentaries and are tagged with preaching themes, so the preacher looking for an illustration relating to either a topic or a verse will be able to find one easily. It highlights application content—each section of Scripture includes at least one application from Spurgeon based on those verses. It saves time—reading Spurgeon for pleasure is wonderful, but preachers and teachers working under a deadline need ways to streamline their sermon preparation process. These commentaries do all this by trimming the excess out of Spurgeon’s sermon archive and increasing functionality, usability, and readability. Outdated language has even been updated, making Spurgeon’s writing easier than ever to understand.



Key Features

Read Spurgeon’s writings in Bible commentary format
Explore the classifications of Spurgeon’s writing into expositions, illustrations, and applications
Leverage additional theme tagging for illustrations, making them easy to access in the Sermon Starter Guide in Logos Bible Software
Foreword by Phil Johnson, curator of The Spurgeon Archive

About Charles Spurgeon
Charles Haddon Spurgeon was born in Kelvedon, Essex, England on June 19, 1834. He converted to Christianity in 1850 at a small Methodist chapel, to which he detoured during a snowstorm. While there, he heard a sermon on Isaiah 45:22 and was saved—“Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none else.” He began his own ministry of preaching and teaching immediately, and preached more than 500 sermons by the age of 20.
In 1854, at 19 years of age, Spurgeon began preaching at the New Park Street Chapel in London. He was appointed to a six month trial position, which he requested be cut to three months should the congregation dislike his preaching. He gained instant fame, however, and the church grew from 232 members to more than five thousand at the end of his pastorate. Many of his sermons were published each week and regularly sold more than 25,000 copies in 20 languages. Throughout his ministry, Spurgeon estimated that he preached to more than 10,000,000 people. Dwight L. Moody was deeply influenced by Spurgeon’s preaching, and founded the Moody Bible Institute after seeing Spurgeon’s work at the Pastor’s College in London.
Spurgeon read six books per week during his adult life, and read Pilgrim’s Progress more than 100 times. In addition to his studying and preaching, Spurgeon also founded the Pastor’s College (now Spurgeon’s College), various orphanages and schools, mission chapels, and numerous other social institutions.
Charles Spurgeon suffered from poor health throughout his life. He died on January 31, 1892, and was buried in London.
About the Editors
Elliot Ritzema is the editor of 1,500 Quotations for Preachers, 300 Quotations for Preachers, 400 Prayers for Preachers, and the Study, Apply, Share series. He is also a Lexham English Bible editor, a contributor to the Faithlife Study Bible, and a regular contributor to Bible Study Magazine. He holds an MDiv from Regent College.
Carrie Sinclair-Wolcott is a contributing editor for Logos Bible Software and Lexham Press. She has worked extensively on Lexham Bible Dictionary. She holds a Master of Arts in theological studies from Regent College.
Jessi Strong is the senior writer for Bible Study Magazine. She has also developed content for Faithlife Study Bible and Lexham Bible Dictionary.
About Phil Johnson
Phil Johnson is executive director of Grace to You, the media ministry of John MacArthur. He is probably best known for his websites, which include The Spurgeon Archive and The Hall of Church History.

Praise for the Print Edition

I have turned to Charles Spurgeon in these days for help, and I have not been disappointed. . . . I think the word "indefatigable" was created for people like Charles Spurgeon.
—John Piper
. . . The greatest Bible preacher outside of Scripture.
—Mark Driscoll
With whom among men can you compare [Spurgeon]? He combined the preaching power of Jonathan Edwards and Whitefield with the organizing power of Wesley, and the energy, fire, and courage of Luther.
—B. H. Carroll
Some of earth's great ones have no doubt sunk into oblivion, but among those whom history remembers only those are great whom history greatens. Spurgeon is among that number.
—W. Y. Fullerton
There was no voice in the Victorian pulpit as resonant, no preacher as beloved by the people, no orator as prodigious as Charles Haddon Spurgeon.
—Hughes Oliphant Old
Spurgeon combined oratorical prowess and evangelistic fervor with a deep concern for social issues . . . . Despite both his fame and his larger-than-life talent, Spurgeon retained a sense of reverence for the responsibility and act of preaching.
—Richard Lischer
Charles Haddon Spurgeon is one of evangelical Christianity’s immortals.
—Carl F.H. Henry
Mr. Spurgeon laid his foundation in the Bible. His utterances abound with Scriptural text, figure, metaphor, and allusion. Whatever he says sends his hearers to the sacred record. But starting from this basis, he has added to it a stock of reading such as few men can show in their talk or in their writing. He cannot be accused of not being a man of the world, or of not knowing the ways of the world, for he reads the Book and the book of nature too. His style is illustrated with almost pictorial brightness.
—The Times
As sermons they stand alone. Unequalled by any other published sermons, by men now in the pulpit or by those of other generations.
—The Standard
Each setence is a cluster of diamonds, some rough, but all of them real. Each discourse has the genuine gospel ring that proves it to have been coined in the mint of heaven.
—The Christian, London
The Paul of his time.
—The Missionary Review
The impression I shall carry with me to my dying day was that of a man who had found life made real, noble, joyous, by his living faith in a living Christ, and who longed to impart to others the life which Christ had imparted to him.
—Lyman Abbot, Outlook
Translated as Mr. Spurgeon's Sermons have been into nearly all the languages of the world, their popularity at home is a fact that admits no dispute, and needs no enforcement. The subjects of many texts are handled by him in a manner that shows his complete mastery of the highest rhetorical art of exposition.
—The Daily Telegraph

About Charles Spurgeon


Charles Spurgeon was born in Kelvedon, Essex, England on June 19, 1834. He converted to Christianity in 1850 at a small Methodist chapel, to which he detoured during a snowstorm. While there, he heard a sermon on Isaiah 45:22 and was saved—“Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none else.” He began his own ministry of preaching and teaching immediately, and preached more than 500 sermons by the age of twenty.
In 1854, at nineteen years of age, Spurgeon began preaching at the New Park Street Chapel in London. He was appointed to a six month trial position, which he requested be cut to three months should the congregation dislike his preaching. He gained instant fame, however, and the church grew from 232 members to more than five thousand at the end of his pastorate. Many of his sermons were published each week and regularly sold more than 25,000 copies in twenty languages. Throughout his ministry, Spurgeon estimated that he preached to more than 10,000,000 people. Dwight L. Moody was deeply influenced by Spurgeon’s preaching, and founded the Moody Bible Institute after seeing Spurgeon’s work at the Pastor’s College in London.
Spurgeon read six books per week during his adult life, and read Pilgrim’s Progress more than 100 times. In addition to his studying and preaching, Spurgeon also founded the Pastor’s College (now Spurgeon’s College), various orphanages and schools, mission chapels, and numerous other social institutions.
Charles Spurgeon suffered from poor health throughout his life. He died on January 31, 1892, and was buried in London.

            It is classic Spurgeon at it's best. Informative.encouraging and inspirational to all who take the matter of prayer seriously.The sermon "The Raven,s Cry" is well worth the cost of the book.However,without exception,all of these messages will make the throne of God's grace a desire of the heart.Spurgeon was truely blest of God with a unique insight into the Word of God and a unique gift in expounding that insight in a plain and profound manner.

            The passing of time has not diminished the power of these sermons.  This book is not for casual reading!  However, the energy invested in poring over each gem (sermon) reaps great reward.  Highly recommended for anyone who takes prayer seriuosly.

            This is an excellent book. I love the eloquence of this tender-hearted man of God. If you wish to pray more effectively and fervently, (we all should) please do not hesitate to purchase this wonderful, instructive book on prayer! It captured my heart from the very first page.

Overview
Agricultural metaphors permeate Scripture. In Genesis, we learn of Abel tending flocks and Cain working the fields. In the Psalms we read of God’s creation—plants, animals, and the variety of life. Jesus told parables of sowing and harvesting. Today, the church still uses such metaphors—planting the seed of the Gospel in the hearts of others.
Charles Spurgeon, keenly aware of the prominence of agriculture both in the Bible and in his own congregation, wrote and preached sermons specifically for farms. Farm Sermons contains nineteen sermons which draw from texts in the Bible on farming, harvesting, and working in nature. The Logos Bible Software edition of Farm Sermons was originally published in London by Passmore and Alabaster in 1882.

He gained instant fame, however, and the church grew from 232 members to more than five thousand at the end of his pastorate. Many of his sermons were published each week and regularly sold more than 25,000 copies in twenty languages. Throughout his ministry, Spurgeon estimated that he preached to more than 10,000,000 people. Dwight L. Moody was deeply influenced by Spurgeon’s preaching, and founded the Moody Bible Institute after seeing Spurgeon’s work at the Pastor’s College in London.
Spurgeon read six books per week during his adult life, and read Pilgrim’s Progress more than 100 times. In addition to his studying and preaching, Spurgeon also founded the Pastor’s College (now Spurgeon’s College), various orphanages and schools, mission chapels, and numerous other social institutions.
Charles Spurgeon suffered from poor health throughout his life. He died on January 31, 1892, and was buried in London.

Publisher's Description▼▲
In Election, a sermon delivered by the great teacher Rev. Charles Haddon Spurgeon in September 1855, he states, "Election in the Christian should make him very fearless and very bold. No man will be so bold as he who believes that he is elect of God. What cares he for man if he is chosen of his Maker? What will he care for the pitiful chirpings of some tiny sparrows when he knoweth that he is an eagle of a royal race? Will he care when the beggar pointeth at him, when the blood royal of heaven runs in his veins? Will he fear if all the world stand against him?" Here is one of the most gripping and succinct messages on the subject ever delivered

Additional Information



Spurgeon's Pulpit Sermons
Now, you can explore the thinking of one of the greatest preachers of all time!
Often referred to as “The Prince of Preachers” and “England’s greatest preacher,” Charles H. Spurgeon had a legendary ability to hold thousands of people spellbound for hours.  It has been estimated that he preached to upwards of 10 million people during his lifetime. Spurgeon’s sermons have been copied by preachers all over the world for generations.  They have been widely circulated and remain one of the all-time best-selling sets of writings by a single author in publishing history.
This set includes over 3500 of Charles Spurgeon’s sermons, delivered over his entire career preaching at London’s famous Metropolitan Tabernacle some of his earlier sermons from the New Park Street church. They are chronologically compiled. Many print editions are out with different collections of Spurgeon’s sermons, but due to the vast number of articles, only a digital library can efficiently handle a set which covers his entire career.
Biblesoft’s unique study platform allows you to not only read and annotate the sermons, but search by word, scripture reference or by topic. In addition, links to the same scripture and topic run through all of your various libraries on the PC Study Bible.
Notes from our Biblesoft editors on how to access this collection:

 The sermons can be accessed (1) like a commentary, by book, chapter, verse, or (2) by a table of contents (book outline).
The sermons are grouped by volume, with around 50 sermons in each volume, and  arranged largely chronologically, according to the date they were delivered.
Many Sermons (especially in the later volumes) include an "Exposition" section, which contains Spurgeon's notes on the passage which he delivered prior to the sermon.
At the end of the 63 volumes, Biblesoft provides a unique alphabetical index (list) of the sermons (by title).
Biblesoft has also produced a unique index of all the sermons listed in order by Bible passage.

Spurgeon's Expository Notes
Charles Spurgeon would often add extensive critical commentary to his presentations of sermons each week, and would include those expository notes in the published copies of his sermons, which were distributed worldwide.  Many of these were also published in his weekly publication, “The Sword and the Trowel.” 
In recent years they have been pulled out and put into a sort of virtual commentary by the master preacher, covering much (but not all) of the Bible. His New Testament writings are particularly rich and comprise a large body of work.
His comments are very extensive on New Testament books he often preached from, such as Romans. An example from Romans 1:15-16. 

Romans 1:15-16 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ...
Many other people were ashamed of the gospel of Christ. It was too simple; it had not enough of mystery about it; it had not enough of worldly wisdom about it. Paul says, “I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,” and then gives his reason for not being ashamed of it

Biblesoft’s unique study platform allows you not only to read and annotate Spurgeon’s commentary notes, but also to search by word, scripture reference or topic. In addition, links to the same scripture and topic run through all of your various libraries on the PC Study Bible.
