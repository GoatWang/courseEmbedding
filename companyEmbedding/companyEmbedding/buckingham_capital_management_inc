Strategy - Buckingham Capital Management

















 

























 



								Strategy							

Diversified Strategy
The Diversified Strategy is a long/short multi-sector strategy focused on domestic equities across all market capitalizations and industries.  
The Diversified Strategy utilizes a fundamental bottom-up process whose objective is to develop independent and thematic investment ideas.  The strategy often employs a contrarian stance in an effort to uncover investment opportunities with a potential for significant appreciation (or depreciation). 
The Strategy invests primarily in US equities but may have exposure to international equities, options on US equities, and index options.
BCM strives to make money on both sides of the ledger, even in difficult markets.  Short investments are pursued to generate absolute returns as well as to hedge.


RAF Strategy
The RAF Strategy is a long/short consumer-focused strategy.  It has an emphasis on the Retail, Apparel, and Footwear industries but may invest in other industries in the consumer sectors, and companies in other sectors that are retail-oriented.
RAF seeks to generate superior risk-adjusted returns by leveraging our collective experience and knowledge through a rigorous bottom-up research and risk management process.  
The Strategy invests primarily in US equities but may have exposure to international equities, options on US equities, and index options.  
BCM strives to make money on both sides of the ledger, even in difficult markets.  Short investments are pursued to generate absolute returns as well as to hedge.
