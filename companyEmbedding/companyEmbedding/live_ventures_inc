Live Ventures























Live Ventures Incorporated
Live Ventures Incorporated is a Diversified Holding Company with a strategic focus
                                    on acquiring U.S.-based middle market growth companies.
ABOUT US










· About Us ·
Live Ventures Incorporated is a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ Capital Market.
                                    Formerly known as LiveDeal, Inc., our company was originally incorporated in 1968
                                    as Nuclear Corporation of New Mexico.
In late 2011, our CEO and activist investor Jon Isaac rescued LiveDeal from near
                                    bankruptcy, days before NASDAQ was due to delist it. We immediately brought in an
                                    aggressive new management team—with Isaac at the head—and a life-saving healthy
                                    flush of new capital. Together, our team began to rebuild LiveDeal into a highly
                                    successful competitor against mobile marketing heavyweights like Groupon and
                                    Living Social.
But that success was only step one in our vision for LiveDeal. Today, the former
                                    LiveDeal proudly wears the name Live Ventures. We have become a diversified holding
                                    company with the sole mission of delivering shareholder value by acquiring
                                    profitable, stable and growing companies.
Unlke the early days of LiveDeal Inc., Live Ventures is a thriving enterprise today,
                                    with nearly $18 Million in net profit in 2016, total assets of over $120 million,
                                    and approximately 1,200 employees across the United States.
Acquisitions are commonplace in corporate America, but we have a commitment that
                                    sets us apart. From the moment we take ownership, we invest millions into growth
                                    and capital improvements, creating new jobs along the way. Live Ventures is not a
                                    trader, turnover machine, or private equity firm. We have never sold a single
                                    company we have acquired.
At Live Ventures, we don’t exploit weak businesses, we make them strong again.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Live Ventures
Reports First Profitable Quarter in 
27 Quarters
on Record Sales Volume
 
LAS VEGAS, December 10, 2015 – Live Ventures Incorporated
(NASDAQ:LIVE) (“Live Ventures” or the “Company”), a diversified growth holding company, today announced
that its fourth quarter of its 2015 fiscal year was its first profitable quarter in the last 27 quarters (approximately 3.5 years
since current management took over), which is attributed in part to the Company’s record sales of $18.1M for the quarter.
 
The Company realized approximately $2.0M in Adjusted EBITDA
earnings (unaudited) or approximately $0.12 per share during the quarter, compared to a reported loss in the same period during
fiscal year 2014*. Further, revenues for the quarter were a record $18.1M, representing an increase of approximately 450% over
the same period last year. Management expects further, continuing improved financial performance in the coming quarters.
 
“We are now seeing the result of our work and dedication
over the last two years with regard to acquisitions and honing our strategic approach as illustrated by record revenues and Adjusted
EBITDA for the first time since we assumed management of the company,” said Jon Isaac, CEO of Live Ventures Incorporated. 
“We believe Live Ventures is now on track, and with the recent completion of the remaining 20% of our stake in Marquis Industries
Inc., we expect to see continued top-line and bottom-line increases in the coming quarters.  We appreciate the loyalty of
our stockholders who have continued to believe in our vision for a profitable company.”
 
* The Adjusted EBTIDA figure is defined as earnings before interest
($286,000), taxes ($645,000), depreciation and amortization ($547,000), and non-recurring charges related to the closing of our
most recent acquisition, Marquis Industries Inc. ($794,000). The Company’s full-year financial statements will be reported
in its Annual Report on Form 10-K and will be subject to standard, year-end audit adjustments..
