Lynn M. Utter Resigns as President and COO of Knoll Office

                    By Murrye Bernard • January 26, 2015

Lynn M. Utter has resigned from her position as president and chief operating officer (COO) of Knoll Office, effective April 10, 2015. Effective immediately, Andrew Cogan, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), will take over the day-to-day operations of the company and serve as acting president during the transition.
Utter joined Knoll in 2007 and led the Knoll Office division through the difficult period of the Great Recession. Prior, she was a chief strategy officer at Coors Brewing Company and had previously served as vice president, sales operations, at Frito-Lay company.
In his letter to all Knoll associates and dealers announcing Utter’s resignation, Cogan wrote: “Lynn joined Knoll in 2007 and helped us take a fresh look at our Knoll Office sales, marketing, and supply chain activities. She managed our business during a challenging period and thanks to her leadership, Knoll has developed new initiatives that support our commercial, government, healthcare and education clients. Lynn set us on the path to our ongoing profitable growth, and she has made important contributions during a period of rapid change in our industry. In addition, thanks to Lynn, we have built a talented cross-functional team that is committed to our success, and we have a solid foundation for growth in the years ahead. Please join me in offering thanks to Lynn for her many contributions to Knoll, and wishing her well in the future. I, and know many of you, enjoyed the opportunity to work with Lynn.”
