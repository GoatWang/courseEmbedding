Bronze








                            At a minimum, companies must pass their credit and legal background checks, and have minimal customer complaints.
                            
                            This is the reason why no businesses on our site have a rating less than A-!
                        






Silver








                            If a company is also BBB accredited with a good standing
                            OR
                            If a company has a valid business insurance, business license, and WCB/WSIB, they will receive an A rating.
                        






Gold








                            If a company is also BBB accredited with a good standing
                            AND
                            they have a valid business insurance, business license, and WCB/WSIB, they will also receive an A+ rating.
                        





RenovationFind has developed a stringent process of screening the vendors to ensure only the most reliable and trusted
                companies are listed on our website. By eliminating companies who have had extensive legal problems and numerous customer complaints, we hope to provide consumers with home renovation companies who rise above their competitors in quality service, products, workmanship and business practices.

  The Shop  John Jenkins Designs 





The company is perhaps best known for its stunning recreations of World War I aircraft and the daring pilots who were known as Aces. In addition to the Knights of the Sky, John Jenkins Designs creates toy soldiers and tanks from The Great War at a level of detail not seen anywhere else in the industry. British, French, and German vehicles all have the weathering and a level of dirt or mud that seemed to accumulate after only just a few days at the front. Joining the German, French, and British toy soldiers are the Americans; late to the war but providing the vital push that finally broke through the static lines of grindingly slow trench warfare.
The Great War
Farther back in history, the French and Indian War has provided John Jenkins Designs with fertile ground for toy soldier production. The Raid on Saint Francis, the 1759 Battle of Ticonderoga, and many others are all brought to life by the dynamic action poses and unique regiments that fought at each. The colonies were responsible for raising regiments to fight their battles against the encroaching French and their Native allies, and John Jenkins Designs produces New Jersey, Pennsylvanian, South Carolina, Connecticut, and the 60th Royal American Provincials as toy soldiers to represent the variety of those regiments.
Other unique ranges produced by John Jenkins Designs are The Jacobite Rebellion, The Seven Years War, The War of 1812, The Wars of the Roses, and The Town of Old Yangshuo among others. Perhaps one of the most unique of them all is the Speedbirds Collection, representing a period of time between WWI and WWII when aircraft design advanced by leaps and bounds as inventors attempted to capture the prestigious Schneider Trophy, awarded from 1913-1931. These fully painted and assembled airplane models are of a smaller scale than the normal 1:30th scale toy soldiers and accessories produced by JJD, so no pilots or other items are planned to accompany them at this time.
John Jenkins is a noted artist in his own right and his commitment to detail and to historical accuracy is unparalleled. Each and every figure has John’s personal touch and sculpt.
