Similar jobs
2017 Financial Product Sales & Analytics Representative (English/Indonesian Speaker)SingaporePosted Jul 24, 2017 - Requisition No. 58115
You’re the first of your friends to know about a major economic event. You have an appetite not only to see the world but to learn what makes it tick. You build relationships quickly and effortlessly and have a real desire for a career in a client-facing role. You're professional and personable, intelligent and analytical. You're a solution-provider, with a real passion for providing platinum customer service.

Our team
Analytics:
On the Analytics Help Desk, our clients always come first. We provide round-the-clock support for Bloomberg Terminal users all over the world and across multiple industries. We interact directly with clients via our 'Instant Bloomberg' chat system, answering their questions and conducting training.

We’re a calm voice in a busy, volatile market. Our clients rely on us to help them make better, faster decisions using the power of the Bloomberg Terminal. On any given day we respond to over 12,000 queries in more than 15 languages. The variety of the problems we solve is incredible. One moment, we could be working with a Portfolio Manager who’s worried about risk. We show him how to use the Risk Analytics platform to find the most volatile securities in his holdings. The next - we may be chatting to a trader who needs help understanding the liquidity profile of two potential investments. We teach her how to size them up against each other.

Sales:
In Sales, we‘re the face of Bloomberg for our clients. Equally consultative and entrepreneurial, we’re relied upon to manage existing client relationships, whilst being given the responsibility and autonomy to identify new business opportunities throughout the APAC region.

We make regular visits to our clients to support and train them, discovering new business leads by making prospecting calls and networking. We work in a fast-paced, rapidly changing market and to be successful, it’s crucial we stay one step ahead, pre-empting our clients’ needs and presenting them with ground breaking solutions, before they even know they need them.

Colleagues across the company depend on us to communicate new functionality and Bloomberg offerings to the market. We demonstrate how Bloomberg solutions will help our clients make the best investment/trading/business decisions, making their day to day business smoother and more profitable.

What’s in it for you?
It’s rare to find an opportunity that gives you such early exposure to clients. You’ll begin your career in the Analytics department, where you’ll be responsible for providing the best possible user experience for our Bloomberg Terminal clients.
It’s here also where you’ll join a comprehensive training programme, covering all aspects of the financial markets - economic principles, market players and asset classes - while teaching you all there is to know about the functionality and analytical tools the Bloomberg Terminal has to offer.

You’ll join our team of experienced relationship managers, helping to grow our business and to service our existing client base across APAC, focusing on a particular region or market sector.

You need to have:
 Business fluency in English and Indonesian

 A Bachelor’s degree or relevant work experience

2017 Financial Product Sales & Analytics Representative (English/Indonesian Speaker)SingaporePosted Jul 24, 2017 - Requisition No. 58115
You’re the first of your friends to know about a major economic event. You have an appetite not only to see the world but to learn what makes it tick. You build relationships quickly and effortlessly and have a real desire for a career in a client-facing role. You're professional and personable, intelligent and analytical. You're a solution-provider, with a real passion for providing platinum customer service.

Our team
Analytics:
On the Analytics Help Desk, our clients always come first. We provide round-the-clock support for Bloomberg Terminal users all over the world and across multiple industries. We interact directly with clients via our 'Instant Bloomberg' chat system, answering their questions and conducting training.

We’re a calm voice in a busy, volatile market. Our clients rely on us to help them make better, faster decisions using the power of the Bloomberg Terminal. On any given day we respond to over 12,000 queries in more than 15 languages. The variety of the problems we solve is incredible. One moment, we could be working with a Portfolio Manager who’s worried about risk. We show him how to use the Risk Analytics platform to find the most volatile securities in his holdings. The next - we may be chatting to a trader who needs help understanding the liquidity profile of two potential investments. We teach her how to size them up against each other.

Sales:
In Sales, we‘re the face of Bloomberg for our clients. Equally consultative and entrepreneurial, we’re relied upon to manage existing client relationships, whilst being given the responsibility and autonomy to identify new business opportunities throughout the APAC region.

We make regular visits to our clients to support and train them, discovering new business leads by making prospecting calls and networking. We work in a fast-paced, rapidly changing market and to be successful, it’s crucial we stay one step ahead, pre-empting our clients’ needs and presenting them with ground breaking solutions, before they even know they need them.

Colleagues across the company depend on us to communicate new functionality and Bloomberg offerings to the market. We demonstrate how Bloomberg solutions will help our clients make the best investment/trading/business decisions, making their day to day business smoother and more profitable.

What’s in it for you?
It’s rare to find an opportunity that gives you such early exposure to clients. You’ll begin your career in the Analytics department, where you’ll be responsible for providing the best possible user experience for our Bloomberg Terminal clients.
It’s here also where you’ll join a comprehensive training programme, covering all aspects of the financial markets - economic principles, market players and asset classes - while teaching you all there is to know about the functionality and analytical tools the Bloomberg Terminal has to offer.

Venture Funds I & II























KB Partners, LLC is a suburban Chicago based investment firm established in 1996 to make investments in a variety of angel funded and venture capital opportunities.
KB's objective is to build dominant new enterprises by working in partnership with talented entrepreneurs and experienced managers. 






 
































PatchPump® is the most size efficient and scalable delivery product for injectable drugs because:
One single ECell design acts as both the power source and the driving mechanism for the whole range of drug volumes and viscosities; The volume of the drug container is easily changed without fundamental changes to the technology. 

















 
[ Current Angel Investment ] 
























KB Partners got its start in 1996 by making a series of angel investments in order to establish a track record and name for itself. It has since raised two early stage technology oriented traditional venture capital funds, KB Partners Venture Fund I and KB Partners Venture Fund II, from a group of high net worth individuals and institutional investors. Both funds have been fully invested and company Founder Keith Bank is now investing personal capital in individual deals in combination with a variety of co-investors, in lieu of raising any additional institutional venture funds. KB is also actively involved in Versatile Sports Partners, a Chicago based firm created to pursue select investment opportunities in the sports and golf industries, along with select real estate situations.
At our core, we are entrepreneurs with a passion for building great companies. We've been in the operating trenches before and recognize that building and growing early stage companies is as much art as science. No business plan or financial forecast can prepare an entrepreneur for the myriad of situations that will be faced when starting and building a company. However, experience can be the difference between exponential growth and severe growing pains.
KB Partners has a proven track record of helping young companies transform themselves into market leaders. We have faced many of the issues confronted regularly by the entrepreneurs we back. Accordingly, our ability to apply our own operating experiences to these challenges enables us to provide hands-on assistance with all aspects of an organization.
