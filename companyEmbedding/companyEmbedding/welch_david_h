After adopting Agile last year, as a team we had many hurdles that we needed to overcome. David took the change in stride, and did an excellent job representing the business and maintaining a clear vision of the product. He routinely prioritized requirements, did market analysis, and generally helped our team blast through sprints, while experimenting with ways we could provide maximum value to our customers. He helped our development team make crucial decisions on the definition of done, the type of testing necessary, and defined the critical functionality needed. Extremely organized and an excellent communicator, David continuously helped our team identify needed features that would deliver the maximum value to the business. David is a unique talent that can wear many hats; I would enjoy working with him again, and would recommend him to any company that can put his skills to good use!See moreSee lessDavid is fantastic to work with. Not only does he really put an amazing effort into working towards the best interest of the company, he also takes an interest in colleagues as individuals.
