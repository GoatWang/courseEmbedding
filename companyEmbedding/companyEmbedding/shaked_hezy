Why Use Shaklee Vivix Resveratrol?

This resveratrol supplement was created by a science team with a unique profile of polyphenols that are shown in laboratory studies to help fight against cellular aging. In addition to ellagic acid,Shaklee Vivix Resveratrol Vivix supplement also supplies polyphenols such as phenolic acids, ellagitannins, anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins. It contains the purest and most potent natural resveratrol and ingredients that have been laboratory tested to address the four key mechanisms of cellular aging.

Why is Shaklee Vivix Resveratrol Supplement Unique?
One teaspoon of this Shaklee Vivix Resveratrol Vivix Supplement supplies the equivalent amount of resveratrol found in 100 glasses of red wine. A 30-day supply of it delivers the equivalent amount of resveratrol found in 3,000 glasses of red wine. In laboratory studies, the ingredients in Shaklee Vivix resveratrol tonic have been shown to be 10X more powerful than resveratrol alone.  Shaklee Vivix is made from muscadine grapes that have a higher source of antioxidants and resveratrol than the common table grape.
Scientific research focused on a super grape known as Vitis rotundifolia. This is the only grape with an extra chromosome, which scientists believe greatly enhances its polyphenol profile and potential health benefits.

How Hezy Shaked overcame challenge after challenge to build Tilly’s Inc.

By: No Author |  12:00am EDT July 1, 2013 





Hezy Shaked, founder, chairman and chief strategy officer, Tilly’s Inc.
Retail & Consumer Products
WINNER
Hezy Shaked has faced many different challenges throughout his life. So when he and his wife, Tilly, realized that $3,000 was not going to be enough to complete their cross-country journey of the United States, Shaked was not shaken a bit.
He was committed to being the provider his family needed, so this young man who had been born and raised in Israel took his first U.S. job at a garage. His living accommodations were under a staircase, but Shaked remained positive about his future.
He took inventory of what he could do and focused on the idea that all humans need clothing. So he took a few retail items and a strong work ethic and traveled to an Orange County swap meet.
Things began to come together and Shaked evolved from a few items at a swap meet to a truck full of new clothing and apparel to the opening of his first retail store in Los Alamitos, Calif.
As the founder, chairman and chief strategy officer of Tilly’s Inc., Shaked continued to focus on providing value and working hard to get his customers what they wanted. He was willing to make investments to build the infrastructure he needed to keep his company growing.
This high level of commitment is also evident in the way Shaked goes about hiring employees and building a strong culture. He understands how much his employees depend on him for their livelihood and makes sure they see it every day. He is willing to spend money to make things happen, but is careful about those decisions so that he doesn’t put the future of the organization at risk.
It’s a spirit that allows the company to succeed and allows Shaked to help those outside Tilly’s who really need it. The company has consistently supported a number of charitable causes through both its time and monetary donations.

Earnings per Share (EPS) denotes the portion of a company's earnings  that is allocated to each share of common stock. To calculate Earnings per Share investors will need to take a company's net income, subtract any dividends for preferred stock, and divide it by the number of average outstanding shares. EPS is usually presented in two different ways: basic and diluted. Fully diluted Earnings per Share takes into account effects of warrants, options, and convertible securities and is generally viewed by analysts as a more accurate measure.More...PeersYour Trending Equities
