Welters Named New Chair of Trustees
Printer Friendly Version
Just three decades after becoming the first person in his family to graduate from college and pursue an advanced degree, Anthony Welters ’77 will become the new chair of the Law School’s Board of Trustees at its first meeting of the new academic year on October 3.
“I am honored to take the helm of this remarkable institution,” said Welters, who is currently vice chair and has been a board member since 1997. “I greatly appreciate the lessons that I have learned in leadership and philanthropy from Lester Pollack. I see this as a defining moment in the history of the Law School.” Moving forward, he said, NYU Law needs to make sure that financial barriers are not a factor in students’ attendance of or participation in the school.
Dean Richard Revesz said he is “thrilled” that Welters will assume the chairmanship. “Tony is one of our nation’s leading entrepreneurs and an inspirational philanthropist,” said Revesz, noting that Welters’s “extraordinary generosity and vision” are responsible for the AnBryce Scholarship, a 10-year-old NYU Law program that offers full scholarships and support to exceptional J.D. students who were severely economically disadvantaged and are the first in their families to pursue graduate studies. “Tony’s bold leadership of the Law School’s capital campaign will allow us to continue to set ambitious goals,” Revesz added.
Welters is executive vice president of UnitedHealth Group (UHG) in Washington, D.C., and president of UHG’s Public and Senior Markets Group, which includes the Ovations and AmeriChoice business units. Ovations is the largest U.S. company dedicated to meeting the health and well-being of people age 50 and older. Welters previously was president and chief executive officer of AmeriChoice Corporation, which he founded as Healthcare Management Alternatives in 1989 with $200,000 in seed money. Under his leadership, the company became a thriving enterprise and was acquired in 2002 by United Healthcare.
After graduating from NYU Law, Welters worked at the Securities and Exchange Commission, spent two years as the executive assistant to Senator Jacob Javits ’26 and then held various positions at the U.S. Department of Transportation.
In 1995, Welters, who grew up with three brothers in a one-room tenement in Harlem, and his wife, Beatrice, launched the AnBryce Foundation. The goal: to cultivate young minds from under-resourced and challenging environments for lives of personal and professional success. They first launched Camp Dogwood Summer Academy, a residential and educational program for needy youths. The AnBryce Scholarship followed in 1998. The Welters have contributed major gifts to the Law School of $11.5 million; this year, they committed an additional $7.5 million as a matching gift to complete the needed endowment of the AnBryce Scholarship. They also funded a chaired law professorship for a faculty mentor to oversee the academic components of the program, which reached its target of 10 students per J.D. class in 2007. Additionally, they have donated another $10 million to the NYU Partners Fund.
A vice chair of NYU Law’s trustee budget and finance committee, Welters also chairs the campaign steering committee and has been instrumental in helping NYU meet its goal of $400 million. In 2004, he received the Vanderbilt Award, the highest honor bestowed upon an NYU Law graduate.
A dedicated philanthropist, Welters is vice chair of the Morehouse School of Medicine’s board of directors. He serves on the boards of the Smithsonian Institution, the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans and the Healthcare Leadership Council. He has received the National Medical Fellowships Humanitarian Award, the Horatio Alger Award and the African American Chamber of Commerce Chairman’s Award.

Anthony Welters and Ambassador Beatrice Wilkinson Welters


"Image Ownership: Public Domain" 


On March 10, 2010, Beatrice Wilkinson Welters was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as Ambassador to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, having been named to that post by President Barack Obama.  Prior to that, she was a philanthropist and senior employee of IBM, where she worked from 1977 to 1991, holding several positions, including systems engineer.



Welters was seven when her mother died.  Five years later, her father also passed leaving her to be raised in foster care in Brooklyn, New York. Setting her sights on academic excellence, she earned an A.A. from Ulster County Community College in New York State, a B.A. from Manhattanville College in New York City, and an M.A. from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at City University of New York. 


Her experience in foster care later spurred Welters, along with her husband, Anthony, an attorney and executive with United Healthcare, to found the AnBryce Foundation in 1995 to provide opportunities for underprivileged children. The Foundation acquired land in Virginia, where they hold an annual summer academy teaching life skills to disadvantaged young people.  The couple later founded the Vincent Wilkinson Foundation (2004), also to provide opportunities for underserved youth.

As Chairman and President of the AnBryce Foundation, Welters met then Illinois Senator Barack Obama in 2007.  Senator Obama, hearing of their work, invited her and her husband to have breakfast with him on Capitol Hill.  That meeting would later persuade President Obama to select Welters as the diplomat to represent the United States in the island republic of Trinidad and Tobago. 

After her confirmation by the U.S. Senate, Welters and her husband arrived in Port-of-Spain, the capital. Soon afterwards she became actively involved in the social and educational life of the country, notably bringing the National Symphony Orchestra from Washington, D.C. to Port-of-Spain to help that country celebrate its 50th anniversary of independence in August of 2012.  She also supported the effort to create “The Merikens,” a documentary film which described the runaway slaves in the U.S. who fought with the British during the War of 1812, on a promise to be permanently freed and relocated after the war.  Many were settled in southern Trinidad, creating a distinct cultural community that continues to this day. Welters also produced a grade school book based on “The Merikens.”


Welters also personally claimed Caribbean roots. Her paternal grandmother was born in Barbados and her maternal grandmother was born in Jamaica.  Both women migrated to New York City in 1920.

Ambassador Welters involved herself in regional issues and major U.S. policy priorities including the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA), and the U.S. Partnership Framework on HIV/AIDS. 

Welters had already crafted a record of distinguished service before her ambassadorship appointment.  Her board memberships have included the Aspen Institute, the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C., the Brookings Institution, and the Washington Jesuit Academy.  She serves on the board of the Library of Congress and was appointed to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Board of Trustees in 1992.  She also holds an honorary doctorate degree from Livingston College in Salisbury, North Carolina.

In October 2008, Beatrice and Anthony Welters received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service for their longstanding commitment to philanthropy at a special event hosted by the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars in Washington, D.C. 


In November 2012, Ambassador Welters resigned her post and returned to the United States. Beatrice and Anthony Welters have two sons, Bryant and Andrew.

Key Figure at UnitedHealth Group Was Major Obama Donor


 by Brandon Conradis on October 28, 2013 











Late last week, the Obama administration named Quality Software Services Inc. (QSSI) to be the new general contractor in charge of the emergency operation to fix the glitches plaguing the government’s healthcare website. QSSI is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Inc, the health insurance giant that has lobbied extensively on issues relating to the federal healthcare overhaul — and also happens to employ a key donor to President Obama.
Anthony Welters, executive vice president of UnitedHealth Group, and his family has gone all out for Obama. During the 2008 election cycle, his wife Beatrice bundled donations totaling between $200,000 and $500,000 for Obama’s campaign. In 2009, the two were among the president’s top inaugural donors, contributing a total of $100,000, as well as bundling an additional $300,000 for the festivities.
Soon thereafter, the Obama administration nominated Beatrice Welters to serve as the ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago. 
Anthony and Beatrice Welters and their sons, Andrew and Bryant, have  contributed more than $258,000 to various candidates and committees —  almost all of them Democratic — since 2007. That includes $30,800  donations by Anthony, Andrew and Bryant to the Democratic National  Committee in 2012 — the maximum amount an individual can give to a  party committee. 
UnitedHealth Group’s purchase of QSSI in 2012 triggered some controversy  on Capitol Hill. Republican lawmakers expressed concern that awarding a  subsidiary of one of the largest health insurance companies a contract  to work on the federal government’s healthcare website was a conflict of  interest. Nonetheless, QSSI was allowed to go forward with building the  website’s data-transferring hub, one of its more successful components.  
UnitedHealth Group has lobbied extensively on the  implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2013. The company has spent  more than $2.5 million on lobbying overall so far this year.

by Sheila Krumholz | July 19, 2017 3 days ago


Testimony by Sheila Krumholz, Executive Director of the Center for Responsive Politics before the Senate Democratic Policy And Communications Committee July 19, 2017   Chairwoman Stabenow, Senator Whitehouse and other Senators: Thank you for this opportunity to submit testimony for today’s hearing regarding politically active nondisclosing nonprofits (“dark money organizations”) and the possibility of foreign…			Continue Reading 












Amid antitrust talk, Amazon and Google flex lobbying muscle
by Kennett Werner | July 7, 2017


In May, at a conference for investors in New York, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya raised eyebrows by calling Amazon a “multi-trillion dollar monopoly hiding in plain sight.” Amazon’s current market cap is $461 billion; getting to a market cap of $3 trillion, as Palihapitiya suggested it would, will require a nearly seven-fold increase in value. Just…

Healthcare lobbyists are no strangers on the Hill
by Sarah Bryner | July 7, 2017


267 former aides who worked for four congressional committees pivotal in approving new healthcare legislation are registered lobbyists for clients from the health sector or health insurance industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics’ analysis of Senate lobbying data. (See all the data here) In addition, 18 former lawmakers also swung through the revolving…

The politics behind your Fourth of July celebrations
by Sara Swann | July 6, 2017


Fourth of July weekend is all about the red, white and blue. But some of the industries behind the festivities for America’s birthday show more loyalty toward red than blue. Hamburgers and hotdogs are the go-to food choices for many Americans on the Fourth of July. It’s a big day for the livestock industry, which last year…

GOP senators opposing the BCRA don’t have many friends in the health care industry
by Sara Swann | June 30, 2017


The list of GOP senators unhappy with the initial draft of the Republican health care bill continues to grow. Before Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) decided to postpone the vote, six GOP senators announced they would vote against it. Since then, that number has doubled. Due to McConnell’s pushback, the Senate will not vote on…








Despite its controversies, Uber was more popular than taxis during the 2016 election
by Sara Swann | June 23, 2017


Travis Kalanick officially announced his resignation as Uber CEO Wednesday morning after taking a leave of absence from the company the week before. Now the ride-hailing service is looking to recover from criticism surrounding sexual harassment and workplace discrimination within the company. Johan Chu, an assistant professor of organizations and strategy at the University of…








Fearing border tax, retailers boost lobbying 31 percent
by Kennett Werner | June 23, 2017


It’s been a remarkably tough year for the retail sector. So far in 2017, retailers have set a record pace for bankruptcies and store closings. Household names are faring no better than small shops: J.C. Penney said it would shutter 138 locations in July; Macy’s expects 68 locations to close this year; and Sears Holdings will turn off the…








Outside groups kick into high gear post-primary in Georgia, South Carolina
by Sara Swann | June 19, 2017


On Tuesday, voters in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District will vote in the most expensive House election ever. A staggering $56.7 million (at least) has been spent on the special election, including $51.9 million on the two candidates left standing after the primary. The race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel is the most expensive House race…








Trump earned at least $1.3 billion in the last two and a half years
by Alex Baumgart | June 16, 2017


The Trump presidency is less than five months old, but has been a quick study at one longstanding D.C. tradition: the Friday-night dump. Administrations often release promised documents once journalists have left the office for the weekend, hoping that any damaging info would get lost in the news cycle turnover. Today, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics has followed suit and released a…








Some lawmakers owe their dads a big thank you this Father’s Day
by Ashley Balcerzak | June 15, 2017


There isn’t much that fathers wouldn’t do for their kids, especially in politics. Take this famous quote from former President John F. Kennedy: “I just received the following wire from my generous Daddy; ‘Dear Jack, Don’t buy a single vote more than is necessary. I’ll be damned if I’m going to pay for a landslide.’”…








Among NBA owners, Betsy DeVos’s father-in-law tops donors
by Kennett Werner | June 8, 2017


There’s big money to be made—for players, agents, and networks—in the NBA Finals currently underway. But while the Golden State Warriors battle the Cleveland Cavaliers on the court, off court, NBA team owners have been making some sizable political contributions. In fact, the generous and deep-pocketed NBA owners gave just under $12 million in 2016,…








Your summer vacation: Democratic or Republican?
by Sara Swann | June 8, 2017


The Trump International Hotel in Washington may have raked in the profits during the inauguration festivities — and ever since, come to think of it. But for most in the lodging and tourism industry, high season is just gearing up. It’s a set of interests that was exceptionally involved in politics during the past two…








Turkey lobbying Texas legislature to go after Gulen-connected schools
by Ashley Balcerzak | June 6, 2017


There isn’t much Turkey wouldn’t do to go after Fethullah Gulen, the controversial cleric Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames for a failed coup in 2016. Last fall, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Turkish officials reportedly considered going beyond trying to convince the U.S. to extradite Gulen, who lives in exile in Pennsylvania:…
