Press Release / Acuity Brands names Nagel as next CEO







































 





























































 


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Acuity Brands names Nagel as next CEO

ATLANTA, January 21, 2004 – Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today
  announced that effective January 20, 2004, Vernon J. Nagel, age 46, was
  elected to the Board of Directors and appointed Vice Chairman in addition to his
  current position of Chief Financial Officer. Nagel will succeed James S. Balloun,
  age 65, as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer upon Balloun’s retirement
  effective September 1, 2004, which is the beginning of Acuity Brands’ 2005 fiscal
  year. John K. Morgan was appointed President and Chief Development Officer
  and will report to Nagel, as will Kenneth W. Honeycutt, Jr., President and Chief
  Executive Officer of Acuity Brands Lighting, and James H. Heagle, President and
  Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Specialty Products, effective immediately. The
  Company expects to name a Chief Financial Officer to replace Nagel in that
  position prior to September 1.
“This succession decision is the result of a thorough assessment process carried
  out over the past six months, and I’m delighted to make this announcement,” said
  Balloun. “Vern Nagel is highly qualified to lead Acuity Brands. He joined us as
  Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at our formation two years
ago after a successful career, most recently with the Kuhlman Corporation. He
  has led efforts to pay down our debt, provided leadership in shaping our vision,
  and developed an insightful understanding of our people and businesses in his
  tenure with Acuity Brands. We are also fortunate that John Morgan, in his new
  role, will be focused on enhancing our branding, marketing, and business
  development capabilities, with particular emphasis on strategic customers and
  key channels of distribution. Vern, John, and our operating presidents, Jim
  Heagle and Ken Honeycutt, form a highly qualified operating team which I
  believe is capable of leading Acuity Brands to new levels of performance and
  growth.”
“I am very excited about this opportunity,” said Nagel. “Acuity Brands is a terrific
  company with a bright future and a great leadership team. I believe that we have
  a solid foundation, our strategy is sound, and we are accelerating execution on
  key initiatives to improve our performance and better serve our customer base. I
  look forward to working with the Board and the more than 11,000 employees of
  Acuity Brands in building a high performance organization for all stakeholders.”

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.
