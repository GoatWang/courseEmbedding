This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Bill Redman Joins Lake City Bank to Lead Indianapolis Commercial Banking Team

Lake City Bank is pleased to announce that Bill Redman has joined its Indianapolis team as Senior Vice President and Regional Commercial Banking Manager. 
Redman joins the bank from National Bank of Indianapolis, where he was a vice president and manager in the Commercial Banking Group. He has extensive experience in commercial banking in the Indianapolis market, having started his career with National City Bank in 1987.
“Our progress in the Indianapolis market has established a strong reputation for Lake City Bank and we’ve been very pleased with our successful growth in the market.  Clearly, the Lake City Bank strategy has been well received by our commercial and retail clients in the market and we’re very pleased to have a commercial banker with Bill’s experience and reputation join our team,” said David M. Findlay, President and Chief Executive Officer.  “Bill has been actively engaged in the Indianapolis community for nearly 30 years and will be a great leader for our commercial banking team in the market.”
Lake City Bank began service to commercial customers in Indianapolis in 2006. The bank’s regional headquarters office opened at 96th Street and Meridian Street in 2011. The bank added offices at State Road 37 and 131st Street and on 82nd Street in Clearwater Crossing in 2013 and 2014, respectively. A fourth site is expected to open in late 2015 or early 2016 at 96th Street and Michigan Road, and a fifth location is in the site selection process.
“We’ve assembled a strong commercial banking team in the Indianapolis market under the leadership of Clint Pletcher and are extremely grateful for Clint’s 22-year career at Lake City Bank and wish him well upon his retirement. Working with Sara Hill, our Indianapolis Retail Banking Regional Manager, Bill will continue to grow our presence and reputation in the Indianapolis area,” Findlay said. “We’re very excited about our future in Indianapolis and Bill’s addition to our team ensures that we will remain committed to bringing client-driven financial services to the market.”
Redman has a bachelor’s degree from Ball State University and a master’s in business administration from Butler University. He is a director of the Carmel Chamber of Commerce. His past affiliations include board and committee service for Janus Developmental Services, Ivy Tech Community College and the City of Carmel. He is a graduate of the Hamilton County Leadership Academy.
“Bill will be a great addition to our experienced Indianapolis team.
