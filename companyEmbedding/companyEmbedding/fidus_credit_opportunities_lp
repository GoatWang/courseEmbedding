Strategy | Fidus





























Fidus




 




Value-focused investing.
Our investment strategy is based on the premise that lower middle market companies require flexible and creative financing solutions from value-added partners. We fully understand that our success depends on that of our portfolio companies. To that end, we invest the time, human resources, and capital necessary to create value for all our constituents, including our portfolio companies, management teams, co-investors, and shareholders.
We intend to invest primarily in mezzanine debt, senior secured debt, and equity securities of lower middle market companies, which we define as companies with revenues of $10 to $150 million. When the right opportunity presents itself, we may occasionally make investments in larger or smaller companies.
Our approach is to invest in lower middle market companies with proven business models, leading market positions, high free cash flow, and strong management teams. In addition, we focus on opportunities in industries where we have prior investment experience. We believe that by continuing to adhere to this philosophy, we can generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and minimize capital losses.
Our investment strategy also includes taking a proactive stance towards risk management. This includes conducting intensive due diligence prior to investing, utilizing our flexible mandate to structure our investments so as to withstand both positive and negative events, and ongoing and active portfolio management, including board observation rights in conjunction with almost all of our investments. We believe this strategy enhances our ability to be a value-added partner for our portfolio companies.

Applicants' Representations
1. The Company, a Maryland corporation, is organized as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC.[2] 
           The Company is managed by a board of directors (“Board”), currently comprised of five directors; three of these directors are not, and a majority of the directors at all times will not be, “interested persons” within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act (the “Non-Interested Directors”).
2. The Private Fund, a limited partnership under Delaware law, is managed by Fidus Advisors. Applicants state that the Private Fund would be an investment company but for the exclusion from the definition of investment company provided by section 3(c)(7) of the Act. Applicants state that the Private Fund's investment objectives and policies are substantially similar to the Objectives and Strategies of the Company.[3] 
           To the extent there is an investment that falls within the Objectives and Strategies of one or more Regulated Funds (as defined below) and the investment strategies of one or more other Affiliated Funds (as defined below), the Advisers would expect such Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds to co-invest with each other.
3. Fidus SBIC and Fidus SBIC II, Delaware limited partnerships, are SBIC Start Printed Page 90027Subsidiaries of the Company.[4] 
           Fidus SBIC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Act.[5] 
           Fidus SBIC II is a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub of the Company.[6] 
           Fidus SBIC II is not registered under the Act, and would be an investment company but for section 3(c)(7) of the Act. The Company may form other SBIC Subsidiaries in the future.
4. Fidus Advisors, a Delaware limited liability company, is registered with the Commission as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). Fidus Advisors serves as investment adviser to the Company (including the assets of Fidus SBIC, Fidus SBIC II and the Private Fund).
5. Applicants seek an order (“Order”) to permit one or more Regulated Funds [7] 
           and/or one or more Affiliated Funds [8] 
           to participate in the same investment opportunities through a proposed co-investment program (the “Co-Investment Program”) where such participation would otherwise be prohibited under section 57(a)(4) and rule 17d-1 by (a) co-investing with each other in securities issued by issuers in private placement transactions in which an Adviser negotiates terms in addition to price; [9] 
           and (b) making additional investments in securities of such issuers, including through the exercise of warrants, conversion privileges, and other rights to purchase securities of the issuers (“Follow-On Investments”). “Co-Investment Transaction” means any transaction in which a Regulated Fund (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Sub) participated together with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds in reliance on the requested Order. “Potential Co-Investment Transaction” means any investment opportunity in which a Regulated Fund (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Sub) could not participate together with one or more Affiliated Funds and/or one or more other Regulated Funds without obtaining and relying on the Order.[10] 

6. Applicants state that a Regulated Fund may, from time to time, form one or more Wholly-Owned Investment Subs. Such a subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a Co-Investment Transaction with any Affiliated Fund or Regulated Fund because it would be a company controlled by its parent Regulated Fund for purposes of Section 57(a)(4) and rule 17d-1. Applicants request that each Wholly-Owned Investment Sub be permitted to participate in Co-Investment Transactions in lieu of its parent Regulated Fund and that the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub's participation in any such transaction be treated, for purposes of the requested order, as though the parent Regulated Fund were participating directly. Applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the Regulated Fund's investments and, therefore, no conflicts of interest could arise between the Regulated Fund and the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub. The Regulated Fund's Board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub's participation in a Co-Investment Transaction, and the Regulated Fund's Board would be informed of, and take into consideration, any proposed use of a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub in the Regulated Fund's place. If the Regulated Fund proposes to participate in the same Co-Investment Transaction with any of its Wholly-Owned Investment Subs, the Board will also be informed of, and take into consideration, the relative participation of the Regulated Fund and the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub.
7. When considering Potential Co-Investment Transactions for any Regulated Fund, the applicable Adviser will consider only the Objectives and Strategies, investment policies, investment positions, capital available for investment (“Available Capital”), and other pertinent factors applicable to that Regulated Fund.[11] 
           The Board of each Regulated Fund, including the Non-Interested Directors has (or will have prior to relying on the requested Order) determined that it is in the best interests of the Regulated Fund to participate in the Co-Investment Transaction.[12] 

8. Other than pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as provided in conditions 7 and 8, and after making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the Adviser will present each Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation to the directors of the Board eligible to vote under section 57(o) of the Act (“Eligible Directors”), and the “required majority,” as defined in section 57(o) of Start Printed Page 90028the Act (“Required Majority”) [13] 
           will approve each Co-Investment Transaction prior to any investment by the participating Regulated Fund.
9. With respect to the pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments provided in conditions 7 and 8, a Regulated Fund may participate in a pro rata disposition or Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if, among other things: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or Follow-On Investment, as the case may be; and (ii) the Board of the Regulated Fund has approved that Regulated Fund's participation in pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund. If the Board does not so approve, any such disposition or Follow-On Investment will be submitted to the Regulated Fund's Eligible Directors. The Board of any Regulated Fund may at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments with the result that all dispositions and/or Follow-On Investments must be submitted to the Eligible Directors.
10. No Non-Interested Director of a Regulated Fund will have a financial interest in any Co-Investment Transaction, other than through share ownership in one of the Regulated Funds.
11. If an Adviser or its principals, or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with an Adviser or its principals, and the Affiliated Funds (collectively, the “Holders”) own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the outstanding voting shares of a Regulated Fund (other than Fidus SBIC) (“Shares”), then the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on (1) the election of directors; (2) the removal of one or more directors; or (3) any other matter under either the Act or applicable State law affecting the Board's composition, size, or manner of election. Applicants believe that this will ensure that the Non-Interested Directors will act independently in evaluating the Co-Investment Program, because the ability of an Adviser or its principals to influence the Non-Interested Directors by a suggestion, explicit or implied, that the Non-Interested Directors can be removed will be limited significantly. The Non-Interested Directors shall evaluate and approve any such independent third party, taking into account its qualifications, reputation for independence, cost to the shareholders, and other factors that they deem relevant.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 57(a)(4) of the Act prohibits certain affiliated persons of a BDC from participating in joint transactions with the BDC or a company controlled by a BDC in contravention of rules as prescribed by the Commission. Under section 57(b)(2) of the Act, any person who is directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a BDC is subject to section 57(a)(4). Applicants submit that each of the Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds could be deemed to be a person related to each Regulated Fund in a manner described by section 57(b) by virtue of being under common control. Section 57(i) of the Act provides that, until the Commission prescribes rules under section 57(a)(4), the Commission's rules under section 17(d) of the Act applicable to registered closed-end investment companies will be deemed to apply to transactions subject to section 57(a)(4). Because the Commission has not adopted any rules under section 57(a)(4), rule 17d-1 also applies to joint transactions with Regulated Funds that are BDCs. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act are applicable to Regulated Funds that are registered closed-end investment companies.
2. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit affiliated persons of a registered investment company from participating in joint transactions with the company unless the Commission has granted an order permitting such transactions. In passing upon applications under rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the company's participation in the joint transaction is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
3. Applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief, the Regulated Funds would be, in some circumstances, limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities. Applicants believe that the proposed terms and conditions will ensure that the Co-Investment Transactions are consistent with the protection of each Regulated Fund's shareholders and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that the Regulated Funds' participation in the Co-Investment Transactions will be consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and on a basis that is not different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that the Order will be subject to the following conditions:
1. Each time an Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment Transaction for an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Fund that falls within a Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies, the Regulated Fund's Adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for such Regulated Fund in light of the Regulated Fund's then-current circumstances.
2. (a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated Fund's participation in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for the Regulated Fund, it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for the Regulated Fund.
(b) If the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser to be invested by the applicable Regulated Fund in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, together with the amount proposed to be invested by the other participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity, the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participant's Available Capital, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each. The applicable Adviser will provide the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Fund with information concerning each participating party's Available Capital to assist the Eligible Directors with their review of the Regulated Fund's investments for compliance with these allocation procedures.
(c) After making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the applicable Adviser will distribute written information concerning the Potential Co-Investment Transaction (including the amount proposed to be invested by each participating Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Fund for their consideration. A Regulated Fund will co-invest with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds only if, prior to the Regulated Fund's participation in the Potential Co-Start Printed Page 90029Investment Transaction, a Required Majority concludes that:
(i) The terms of the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Regulated Fund and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Regulated Fund or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned;
(ii) the Potential Co-Investment Transaction is consistent with:
(A) The interests of the shareholders of the Regulated Fund; and
(B) the Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies;
(iii) the investment by any other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds would not disadvantage the Regulated Fund, and participation by the Regulated Fund would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds; provided that, if any other Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund, but not the Regulated Fund itself, gains the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company's board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company, such event shall not be interpreted to prohibit the Required Majority from reaching the conclusions required by this condition (2)(c)(iii), if:
(A) The Eligible Directors will have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer, if any;
(B) the applicable Adviser agrees to, and does, provide periodic reports to the Regulated Fund's Board with respect to the actions of such director or the information received by such board observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company; and
(C) any fees or other compensation that any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund or any affiliated person of any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund receives in connection with the right of an Affiliated Fund or a Regulated Fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the participating Affiliated Funds (who each may, in turn, share its portion with its affiliated persons) and the participating Regulated Funds in accordance with the amount of each party's investment; and
(iv) the proposed investment by the Regulated Fund will not benefit the Advisers, the Affiliated Funds or the other Regulated Funds or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction), except (A) to the extent permitted by condition 13, (B) to the extent permitted by Section 17(e) or 57(k) of the Act, as applicable, (C) indirectly, as a result of an interest in the securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction, or (D) in the case of fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).
3. Each Regulated Fund has the right to decline to participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the amount proposed.
4. The applicable Adviser will present to the Board of each Regulated Fund, on a quarterly basis, a record of all investments in Potential Co-Investment Transactions made by any of the other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds during the preceding quarter that fell within the Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies that were not made available to the Regulated Fund, and an explanation of why the investment opportunities were not offered to the Regulated Fund. All information presented to the Board pursuant to this condition will be kept for the life of the Regulated Fund and at least two years thereafter, and will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.
5. Except for Follow-On Investments made in accordance with condition 8,[14] 
           a Regulated Fund will not invest in reliance on the Order in any issuer in which another Regulated Fund, Affiliated Fund, or any affiliated person of another Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund is an existing investor.
6. A Regulated Fund will not participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class of securities to be purchased, settlement date, and registration rights will be the same for each participating Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund. The grant to an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Fund, but not the Regulated Fund, of the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company's board of directors, the right to have an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will not be interpreted so as to violate this condition 6, if conditions 2(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) are met.
7. (a) If any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund elects to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security that was acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Advisers will:
(i) Notify each Regulated Fund that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to participation by each Regulated Fund in the disposition.
(b) Each Regulated Fund will have the right to participate in such disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the participating Affiliated Funds and Regulated Funds.
(c) A Regulated Fund may participate in such disposition without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and each Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board of the Regulated Fund has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund the ability to participate in such dispositions on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in the application); and (iii) the Board of the Regulated Fund is provided on a quarterly basis with a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this condition. In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Fund's participation to the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Fund will participate in such disposition solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Fund's best interests.
(d) Each Affiliated Fund and each Regulated Fund will bear its own expenses in connection with any such disposition.
8. (a) If any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund desires to make a Follow-On Investment in a portfolio company whose securities were acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Advisers will:
(i) Notify each Regulated Fund that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed transaction at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to the proposed participation, including the amount of the proposed Follow-On Investment, by each Regulated Fund.
(b) A Regulated Fund may participate in such Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Start Printed Page 90030Majority if: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and each Affiliated Fund in such investment is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and (ii) the Board of the Regulated Fund has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund the ability to participate in Follow-On Investments on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in the application). In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Fund's participation to the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Fund will participate in such Follow-On Investment solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Fund's best interests.
(c) If, with respect to any Follow-On Investment:
(i) the amount of the opportunity is not based on the Regulated Funds' and the Affiliated Funds' outstanding investments immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and
(ii) the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser to be invested by the applicable Regulated Fund in the Follow-On Investment, together with the amount proposed to be invested by the other participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity; then the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participant's Available Capital, up to the maximum amount proposed to be invested by each.
(d) The acquisition of Follow-On Investments as permitted by this condition will be considered a Co-Investment Transaction for all purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in this application.
9. The Non-Interested Directors of each Regulated Fund will be provided quarterly for review all information concerning Potential Co-Investment Transactions and Co-Investment Transactions, including investments made by other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds that the Regulated Fund considered but declined to participate in, so that the Non-Interested Directors may determine whether all investments made during the preceding quarter, including those investments that the Regulated Fund considered but declined to participate in, comply with the conditions of the Order. In addition, the Non-Interested Directors will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for the Regulated Fund of participating in new and existing Co-Investment Transactions.
10. Each Regulated Fund will maintain the records required by Section 57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of the Regulated Funds were a BDC and each of the investments permitted under these conditions were approved by the Required Majority under Section 57(f) of the Act.
11. No Non-Interested Director of a Regulated Fund will also be a director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise an “affiliated person” (as defined in the Act) of an Affiliated Fund.
12. The expenses, if any, associated with acquiring, holding or disposing of any securities acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction (including, without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any such securities registered for sale under the Securities Act) will, to the extent not payable by the Advisers under their respective investment advisory agreements with Affiliated Funds and the Regulated Funds, be shared by the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds in proportion to the relative amounts of the securities held or to be acquired or disposed of, as the case may be.
13. Any transaction fee [15] 
           (including break-up or commitment fees but excluding broker's fees contemplated by Section 17(e) or 57(k) of the Act, as applicable), received in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction will be distributed to the participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they invested or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment Transaction. If any transaction fee is to be held by an Adviser pending consummation of the transaction, the fee will be deposited into an account maintained by such Adviser at a bank or banks having the qualifications prescribed in Section 26(a)(1) of the Act, and the account will earn a competitive rate of interest that will also be divided pro rata among the participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds based on the amounts they invest in such Co-Investment Transaction. None of the Affiliated Funds, the Advisers, the other Regulated Funds or any affiliated person of the Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds will receive additional compensation or remuneration of any kind as a result of or in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction (other than (a) in the case of the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds, the pro rata transaction fees described above and fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C); and (b) in the case of an Adviser, investment advisory fees paid in accordance with the agreement between the Adviser and the Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund.
14. If the Holders own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Shares of a Regulated Fund (other than Fidus SBIC), then the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on (1) the election of directors;
(2) the removal of one or more directors; or (3) any other matter under either the Act or applicable State law affecting the Board's composition, size or manner of election.

to have been formed for the purpose of investing

Board has the sole authority to make all
determinations with respect to the entity’s
participation under the conditions of the

and/or one or more Affiliated Funds 8 to
participate in the same investment
opportunities through a proposed coinvestment program (the ‘‘CoInvestment Program’’) where such
participation would otherwise be
prohibited under section 57(a)(4) and
rule 17d–1 by (a) co-investing with each
other in securities issued by issuers in
private placement transactions in which
an Adviser negotiates terms in addition
to price; 9 and (b) making additional
investments in securities of such
issuers, including through the exercise
of warrants, conversion privileges, and
other rights to purchase securities of the
issuers (‘‘Follow-On Investments’’). ‘‘CoInvestment Transaction’’ means any
transaction in which a Regulated Fund
(or its Wholly-Owned Investment Sub)
participated together with one or more
other Regulated Funds and/or one or
more Affiliated Funds in reliance on the
requested Order. ‘‘Potential CoInvestment Transaction’’ means any
investment opportunity in which a
Regulated Fund (or its Wholly-Owned
Investment Sub) could not participate
together with one or more Affiliated
Funds and/or one or more other
Regulated Funds without obtaining and
relying on the Order.10
6. Applicants state that a Regulated
Fund may, from time to time, form one
or more Wholly-Owned Investment
Subs. Such a subsidiary would be
prohibited from investing in a CoInvestment Transaction with any
Affiliated Fund or Regulated Fund
because it would be a company
controlled by its parent Regulated Fund
for purposes of Section 57(a)(4) and rule
17d–1. Applicants request that each
Wholly-Owned Investment Sub be
permitted to participate in CoInvestment Transactions in lieu of its
parent Regulated Fund and that the
Wholly-Owned Investment Sub’s
participation in any such transaction be
treated, for purposes of the requested
order, as though the parent Regulated
Fund were participating directly.
Applicants represent that this treatment
is justified because a Wholly-Owned
Investment Sub would have no purpose
8 ‘‘Affiliated Fund’’ means the Private Fund and
any Future Affiliated Fund. ‘‘Future Affiliated
Fund’’ means any entity (a) whose investment
adviser is an Adviser, (b) that would be an
investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or
3(c)(7) of the Act, and (c) that intends to participate
in the Co-Investment Program.
9 The term ‘‘private placement transactions’’
means transactions in which the offer and sale of
securities by the issuer are exempt from registration
under the Securities Act.
10 All existing entities that currently intend to
rely upon the requested Order have been named as
applicants. Any other existing or future entity that
subsequently relies on the Order will comply with
the terms and conditions of the application.

other than serving as a holding vehicle
for the Regulated Fund’s investments
and, therefore, no conflicts of interest
could arise between the Regulated Fund
and the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub.
The Regulated Fund’s Board would
make all relevant determinations under
the conditions with regard to a WhollyOwned Investment Sub’s participation
in a Co-Investment Transaction, and the
Regulated Fund’s Board would be
informed of, and take into
consideration, any proposed use of a
Wholly-Owned Investment Sub in the
Regulated Fund’s place. If the Regulated
Fund proposes to participate in the
same Co-Investment Transaction with
any of its Wholly-Owned Investment
Subs, the Board will also be informed
of, and take into consideration, the
relative participation of the Regulated
Fund and the Wholly-Owned
Investment Sub.
7. When considering Potential CoInvestment Transactions for any
Regulated Fund, the applicable Adviser
will consider only the Objectives and
Strategies, investment policies,
investment positions, capital available
for investment (‘‘Available Capital’’),
and other pertinent factors applicable to
that Regulated Fund.11 The Board of
each Regulated Fund, including the
Non-Interested Directors has (or will
have prior to relying on the requested
Order) determined that it is in the best
interests of the Regulated Fund to
participate in the Co-Investment
Transaction.12
8. Other than pro rata dispositions
and Follow-On Investments as provided
in conditions 7 and 8, and after making
the determinations required in
conditions 1 and 2(a), the Adviser will
present each Potential Co-Investment
Transaction and the proposed allocation
to the directors of the Board eligible to
vote under section 57(o) of the Act
(‘‘Eligible Directors’’), and the ‘‘required
majority,’’ as defined in section 57(o) of
11 The amount of each Regulated Fund’s
Available Capital will be determined based on the
amount of cash on hand, existing commitments and
reserves, if any, the targeted leverage level, targeted
asset mix and other investment policies and
restrictions set from time to time by the Board of
the applicable Regulated Fund or imposed by
applicable laws, rules, regulations or
interpretations. An Affiliated Fund’s capital
available for investment will be determined based
on the amount of cash on hand, existing
commitments and reserves, if any, the targeted
leverage level, targeted asset mix and other
investment policies and restrictions set by the
Affiliated Fund’s directors, general partners or
adviser, or imposed by applicable laws, rules,
regulations or interpretations.
12 The Regulated Funds, however, will not be
obligated to invest, or co-invest, when investment
opportunities are referred to them.

the Act (‘‘Required Majority’’) 13 will
approve each Co-Investment
Transaction prior to any investment by
the participating Regulated Fund.
9. With respect to the pro rata
dispositions and Follow-On Investments
provided in conditions 7 and 8, a
Regulated Fund may participate in a pro
rata disposition or Follow-On
Investment without obtaining prior
approval of the Required Majority if,
among other things: (i) The proposed
participation of each Regulated Fund
and Affiliated Fund in such disposition
is proportionate to its outstanding
investments in the issuer immediately
preceding the disposition or Follow-On
Investment, as the case may be; and (ii)
the Board of the Regulated Fund has
approved that Regulated Fund’s
participation in pro rata dispositions
and Follow-On Investments as being in
the best interests of the Regulated Fund.
If the Board does not so approve, any
such disposition or Follow-On
Investment will be submitted to the
Regulated Fund’s Eligible Directors. The
Board of any Regulated Fund may at any
time rescind, suspend or qualify its
approval of pro rata dispositions and
Follow-On Investments with the result
that all dispositions and/or Follow-On
Investments must be submitted to the
Eligible Directors.
10. No Non-Interested Director of a
Regulated Fund will have a financial
interest in any Co-Investment
Transaction, other than through share
ownership in one of the Regulated
Funds.
11. If an Adviser or its principals, or
any person controlling, controlled by, or
under common control with an Adviser
or its principals, and the Affiliated
Funds (collectively, the ‘‘Holders’’) own
in the aggregate more than 25 percent of
the outstanding voting shares of a
Regulated Fund (other than Fidus SBIC)
(‘‘Shares’’), then the Holders will vote
such Shares as directed by an
independent third party when voting on
(1) the election of directors; (2) the
removal of one or more directors; or (3)
any other matter under either the Act or
applicable State law affecting the
Board’s composition, size, or manner of
election. Applicants believe that this
will ensure that the Non-Interested
Directors will act independently in
evaluating the Co-Investment Program,
because the ability of an Adviser or its
principals to influence the NonInterested Directors by a suggestion,
explicit or implied, that the Non13 In the case of a Regulated Fund that is a
registered closed-end fund, the Board members that
make up the Required Majority will be determined

Interested Directors can be removed will
be limited significantly. The NonInterested Directors shall evaluate and
approve any such independent third
party, taking into account its
qualifications, reputation for
independence, cost to the shareholders,
and other factors that they deem
relevant.
Applicants’ Legal Analysis
1. Section 57(a)(4) of the Act prohibits
certain affiliated persons of a BDC from
participating in joint transactions with
the BDC or a company controlled by a
BDC in contravention of rules as
prescribed by the Commission. Under
section 57(b)(2) of the Act, any person
who is directly or indirectly controlling,
controlled by, or under common control
with a BDC is subject to section 57(a)(4).
Applicants submit that each of the
Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds
could be deemed to be a person related
to each Regulated Fund in a manner
described by section 57(b) by virtue of
being under common control. Section
57(i) of the Act provides that, until the
Commission prescribes rules under
section 57(a)(4), the Commission’s rules
under section 17(d) of the Act
applicable to registered closed-end
investment companies will be deemed
to apply to transactions subject to
section 57(a)(4). Because the
Commission has not adopted any rules
under section 57(a)(4), rule 17d–1 also
applies to joint transactions with
Regulated Funds that are BDCs. Section
17(d) of the Act and rule 17d–1 under
the Act are applicable to Regulated
Funds that are registered closed-end
investment companies.
2. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule
17d–1 under the Act prohibit affiliated
persons of a registered investment
company from participating in joint
transactions with the company unless
the Commission has granted an order
permitting such transactions. In passing
upon applications under rule 17d–1, the
Commission considers whether the
company’s participation in the joint
transaction is consistent with the
provisions, policies, and purposes of the
Act and the extent to which such
participation is on a basis different from
or less advantageous than that of other
participants.
3. Applicants state that in the absence
of the requested relief, the Regulated
Funds would be, in some
circumstances, limited in their ability to
participate in attractive and appropriate
investment opportunities. Applicants
believe that the proposed terms and
conditions will ensure that the CoInvestment Transactions are consistent
with the protection of each Regulated

PO 00000

Sfmt 4703

Fund’s shareholders and with the
purposes intended by the policies and
provisions of the Act. Applicants state
that the Regulated Funds’ participation
in the Co-Investment Transactions will
be consistent with the provisions,
policies, and purposes of the Act and on
a basis that is not different from or less
advantageous than that of other
participants.
Applicants’ Conditions
Applicants agree that the Order will
be subject to the following conditions:
1. Each time an Adviser considers a
Potential Co-Investment Transaction for
an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated
Fund that falls within a Regulated
Fund’s then-current Objectives and
Strategies, the Regulated Fund’s Adviser
will make an independent
determination of the appropriateness of
the investment for such Regulated Fund
in light of the Regulated Fund’s thencurrent circumstances.
2. (a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated
Fund’s participation in any Potential
Co-Investment Transaction to be
appropriate for the Regulated Fund, it
will then determine an appropriate level
of investment for the Regulated Fund.
(b) If the aggregate amount
recommended by the applicable Adviser
to be invested by the applicable
Regulated Fund in the Potential CoInvestment Transaction, together with
the amount proposed to be invested by
the other participating Regulated Funds
and Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the
same transaction, exceeds the amount of
the investment opportunity, the
investment opportunity will be
allocated among them pro rata based on
each participant’s Available Capital, up
to the amount proposed to be invested
by each. The applicable Adviser will
provide the Eligible Directors of each
participating Regulated Fund with
information concerning each
participating party’s Available Capital to
assist the Eligible Directors with their
review of the Regulated Fund’s
investments for compliance with these
allocation procedures.
(c) After making the determinations
required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the
applicable Adviser will distribute
written information concerning the
Potential Co-Investment Transaction
(including the amount proposed to be
invested by each participating Regulated
Fund and Affiliated Fund) to the
Eligible Directors of each participating
Regulated Fund for their consideration.
A Regulated Fund will co-invest with
one or more other Regulated Funds and/
or one or more Affiliated Funds only if,
prior to the Regulated Fund’s
participation in the Potential Co-

Investment Transaction, a Required
Majority concludes that:
(i) The terms of the Potential CoInvestment Transaction, including the
consideration to be paid, are reasonable
and fair to the Regulated Fund and its
shareholders and do not involve
overreaching in respect of the Regulated
Fund or its shareholders on the part of
any person concerned;
(ii) the Potential Co-Investment
Transaction is consistent with:
(A) The interests of the shareholders
of the Regulated Fund; and
(B) the Regulated Fund’s then-current
Objectives and Strategies;
(iii) the investment by any other
Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds
would not disadvantage the Regulated
Fund, and participation by the
Regulated Fund would not be on a basis
different from or less advantageous than
that of other Regulated Funds or
Affiliated Funds; provided that, if any
other Regulated Fund or Affiliated
Fund, but not the Regulated Fund itself,
gains the right to nominate a director for
election to a portfolio company’s board
of directors or the right to have a board
observer or any similar right to
participate in the governance or
management of the portfolio company,
such event shall not be interpreted to
prohibit the Required Majority from
reaching the conclusions required by
this condition (2)(c)(iii), if:
(A) The Eligible Directors will have
the right to ratify the selection of such
director or board observer, if any;
(B) the applicable Adviser agrees to,
and does, provide periodic reports to
the Regulated Fund’s Board with respect
to the actions of such director or the
information received by such board
observer or obtained through the
exercise of any similar right to
participate in the governance or
management of the portfolio company;
and
(C) any fees or other compensation
that any Affiliated Fund or any
Regulated Fund or any affiliated person
of any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated
Fund receives in connection with the
right of an Affiliated Fund or a
Regulated Fund to nominate a director
or appoint a board observer or otherwise
to participate in the governance or
management of the portfolio company
will be shared proportionately among
the participating Affiliated Funds (who
each may, in turn, share its portion with
its affiliated persons) and the
participating Regulated Funds in
accordance with the amount of each
party’s investment; and
(iv) the proposed investment by the
Regulated Fund will not benefit the
Advisers, the Affiliated Funds or the

Jkt 241001

other Regulated Funds or any affiliated
person of any of them (other than the
parties to the Co-Investment
Transaction), except (A) to the extent
permitted by condition 13, (B) to the
extent permitted by Section 17(e) or
57(k) of the Act, as applicable, (C)
indirectly, as a result of an interest in
the securities issued by one of the
parties to the Co-Investment
Transaction, or (D) in the case of fees or
other compensation described in
condition 2(c)(iii)(C).
3. Each Regulated Fund has the right
to decline to participate in any Potential
Co-Investment Transaction or to invest
less than the amount proposed.
4. The applicable Adviser will present
to the Board of each Regulated Fund, on
a quarterly basis, a record of all
investments in Potential Co-Investment
Transactions made by any of the other
Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds
during the preceding quarter that fell
within the Regulated Fund’s thencurrent Objectives and Strategies that
were not made available to the
Regulated Fund, and an explanation of
why the investment opportunities were
not offered to the Regulated Fund. All
information presented to the Board
pursuant to this condition will be kept
for the life of the Regulated Fund and
at least two years thereafter, and will be
subject to examination by the
Commission and its staff.
5. Except for Follow-On Investments
made in accordance with condition 8,14
a Regulated Fund will not invest in
reliance on the Order in any issuer in
which another Regulated Fund,
Affiliated Fund, or any affiliated person
of another Regulated Fund or Affiliated
Fund is an existing investor.
6. A Regulated Fund will not
participate in any Potential CoInvestment Transaction unless the
terms, conditions, price, class of
securities to be purchased, settlement
date, and registration rights will be the
same for each participating Regulated
Fund and Affiliated Fund. The grant to
an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated
Fund, but not the Regulated Fund, of
the right to nominate a director for
election to a portfolio company’s board
of directors, the right to have an
observer on the board of directors or
similar rights to participate in the
governance or management of the
portfolio company will not be
interpreted so as to violate this
condition 6, if conditions 2(c)(iii)(A), (B)
and (C) are met.
14 This exception applies only to Follow-On
Investments by a Regulated Fund in issuers in
which that Regulated Fund already holds
investments.

7. (a) If any Affiliated Fund or any
Regulated Fund elects to sell, exchange
or otherwise dispose of an interest in a
security that was acquired in a CoInvestment Transaction, the applicable
Advisers will:
(i) Notify each Regulated Fund that
participated in the Co-Investment
Transaction of the proposed disposition
at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to
participation by each Regulated Fund in
the disposition.
(b) Each Regulated Fund will have the
right to participate in such disposition
on a proportionate basis, at the same
price and on the same terms and
conditions as those applicable to the
participating Affiliated Funds and
Regulated Funds.
(c) A Regulated Fund may participate
in such disposition without obtaining
prior approval of the Required Majority
if: (i) The proposed participation of each
Regulated Fund and each Affiliated
Fund in such disposition is
proportionate to its outstanding
investments in the issuer immediately
preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board
of the Regulated Fund has approved as
being in the best interests of the
Regulated Fund the ability to participate
in such dispositions on a pro rata basis
(as described in greater detail in the
application); and (iii) the Board of the
Regulated Fund is provided on a
quarterly basis with a list of all
dispositions made in accordance with
this condition. In all other cases, the
Adviser will provide its written
recommendation as to the Regulated
Fund’s participation to the Eligible
Directors, and the Regulated Fund will
participate in such disposition solely to
the extent that a Required Majority
determines that it is in the Regulated
Fund’s best interests.
(d) Each Affiliated Fund and each
Regulated Fund will bear its own
expenses in connection with any such
disposition.
8. (a) If any Affiliated Fund or any
Regulated Fund desires to make a
Follow-On Investment in a portfolio
company whose securities were
acquired in a Co-Investment
Transaction, the applicable Advisers
will:
(i) Notify each Regulated Fund that
participated in the Co-Investment
Transaction of the proposed transaction
at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to
the proposed participation, including
the amount of the proposed Follow-On
Investment, by each Regulated Fund.
(b) A Regulated Fund may participate
in such Follow-On Investment without
obtaining prior approval of the Required

Majority if: (i) The proposed
participation of each Regulated Fund
and each Affiliated Fund in such
investment is proportionate to its
outstanding investments in the issuer
immediately preceding the Follow-On
Investment; and (ii) the Board of the
Regulated Fund has approved as being
in the best interests of the Regulated
Fund the ability to participate in
Follow-On Investments on a pro rata
basis (as described in greater detail in
the application). In all other cases, the
Adviser will provide its written
recommendation as to the Regulated
Fund’s participation to the Eligible
Directors, and the Regulated Fund will
participate in such Follow-On
Investment solely to the extent that a
Required Majority determines that it is
in the Regulated Fund’s best interests.
(c) If, with respect to any Follow-On
Investment:
(i) the amount of the opportunity is
not based on the Regulated Funds’ and
the Affiliated Funds’ outstanding
investments immediately preceding the
Follow-On Investment; and
(ii) the aggregate amount
recommended by the applicable Adviser
to be invested by the applicable
Regulated Fund in the Follow-On
Investment, together with the amount
proposed to be invested by the other
participating Regulated Funds and
Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the
same transaction, exceeds the amount of
the investment opportunity; then the
investment opportunity will be
allocated among them pro rata based on
each participant’s Available Capital, up
to the maximum amount proposed to be
invested by each.
(d) The acquisition of Follow-On
Investments as permitted by this
condition will be considered a CoInvestment Transaction for all purposes
and subject to the other conditions set
forth in this application.
9. The Non-Interested Directors of
each Regulated Fund will be provided
quarterly for review all information
concerning Potential Co-Investment
Transactions and Co-Investment
Transactions, including investments
made by other Regulated Funds or
Affiliated Funds that the Regulated
Fund considered but declined to
participate in, so that the Non-Interested
Directors may determine whether all
investments made during the preceding
quarter, including those investments
that the Regulated Fund considered but
declined to participate in, comply with
the conditions of the Order. In addition,
the Non-Interested Directors will
consider at least annually the continued
appropriateness for the Regulated Fund

VerDate Sep<11>2014

Jkt 241001

of participating in new and existing CoInvestment Transactions.
10. Each Regulated Fund will
maintain the records required by
Section 57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of
the Regulated Funds were a BDC and
each of the investments permitted under
these conditions were approved by the
Required Majority under Section 57(f) of
the Act.
11. No Non-Interested Director of a
Regulated Fund will also be a director,
general partner, managing member or
principal, or otherwise an ‘‘affiliated
person’’ (as defined in the Act) of an
Affiliated Fund.
12. The expenses, if any, associated
with acquiring, holding or disposing of
any securities acquired in a CoInvestment Transaction (including,
without limitation, the expenses of the
distribution of any such securities
registered for sale under the Securities
Act) will, to the extent not payable by
the Advisers under their respective
investment advisory agreements with
Affiliated Funds and the Regulated
Funds, be shared by the Regulated
Funds and the Affiliated Funds in
proportion to the relative amounts of the
securities held or to be acquired or
disposed of, as the case may be.
13. Any transaction fee 15 (including
break-up or commitment fees but
excluding broker’s fees contemplated by
Section 17(e) or 57(k) of the Act, as
applicable), received in connection with
a Co-Investment Transaction will be
distributed to the participating
Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds
on a pro rata basis based on the amounts
they invested or committed, as the case
may be, in such Co-Investment
Transaction. If any transaction fee is to
be held by an Adviser pending
consummation of the transaction, the
fee will be deposited into an account
maintained by such Adviser at a bank or
banks having the qualifications
prescribed in Section 26(a)(1) of the Act,
and the account will earn a competitive
rate of interest that will also be divided
pro rata among the participating
Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds
based on the amounts they invest in
such Co-Investment Transaction. None
of the Affiliated Funds, the Advisers,
the other Regulated Funds or any
affiliated person of the Regulated Funds
or Affiliated Funds will receive
additional compensation or
remuneration of any kind as a result of
or in connection with a Co-Investment
Transaction (other than (a) in the case

not providing, any relief for transaction fees

Transaction.

condition 2(c)(iii)(C); and (b) in the case
of an Adviser, investment advisory fees
paid in accordance with the agreement
between the Adviser and the Regulated
Fund or Affiliated Fund.
14. If the Holders own in the aggregate
more than 25 percent of the Shares of
a Regulated Fund (other than Fidus
SBIC), then the Holders will vote such
Shares as directed by an independent
third party when voting on (1) the
election of directors;

affecting the Board’s composition, size
or manner of election.

Applicants' Representations

    1. The Company, a Maryland corporation, is organized as a non-
diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected 
to be regulated as a BDC.\2\ The Company is managed by a board of 
directors (``Board''), currently comprised of five directors; three of 
these directors are not, and a majority of the directors at all times 
will not be, ``interested persons'' within the meaning of section 
2(a)(19) of the Act (the ``Non-Interested Directors'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Section 2(a)(48) defines a BDC to be any closed-end 
investment company that operates for the purpose of making 
investments in securities described in sections 55(a)(1) through 
55(a)(3) of the Act and makes available significant managerial 
assistance with respect to the issuers of such securities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. The Private Fund, a limited partnership under Delaware law, is 
managed by Fidus Advisors. Applicants state that the Private Fund would 
be an investment company but for the exclusion from the definition of 
investment company provided by section 3(c)(7) of the Act. Applicants 
state that the Private Fund's investment objectives and policies are 
substantially similar to the Objectives and Strategies of the 
Company.\3\ To the extent there is an investment that falls within the 
Objectives and Strategies of one or more Regulated Funds (as defined 
below) and the investment strategies of one or more other Affiliated 
Funds (as defined below), the Advisers would expect such Regulated 
Funds and Affiliated Funds to co-invest with each other.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ ``Objectives and Strategies'' means a Regulated Fund's 
investment objectives and strategies, as described in the Regulated 
Fund's registration statement on Form 10 (or if applicable, Form N-
2), other filings the Regulated Fund has made with the Commission 
under the Securities Act of 1933 (the ``Securities Act''), or under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Regulated Fund's 
reports to shareholders.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. Fidus SBIC and Fidus SBIC II, Delaware limited partnerships, are 
SBIC

[[Page 90027]]

Subsidiaries of the Company.\4\ Fidus SBIC, a wholly owned subsidiary 
of the Company, has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Act.\5\ 
Fidus SBIC II is a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub of the Company.\6\ Fidus 
SBIC II is not registered under the Act, and would be an investment 
company but for section 3(c)(7) of the Act. The Company may form other 
SBIC Subsidiaries in the future.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ ``SBIC Subsidiary'' means an entity that is licensed by the 
Small Business Administration (``SBA'') to operate under the Small 
Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, (``SBA Act'') as a 
small business investment company (``SBIC'').
    \5\ On March 1, 2011, Fidus SBIC filed its registration 
statement on Form N-5 with the Commission, as a co-registrant with 
the Company on its registration statement on Form N-2. As a result 
of the Company's initial public offering and a series of related 
transactions, Fidus SBIC could be deemed to fail to meet the 
requirements for exclusion from the definition of an investment 
company set forth in (1) section 3(c)(1) by reason of subparagraph 
(A) of section 3(c)(1) and (2) section 3(c)(7) by virtue of the 
Company's failure to qualify as a ``qualified purchaser'' within the 
meaning of section 2(a)(51) by virtue of rule 2a51-3(a) of the Act, 
as the Company could be deemed to have been formed for the purpose 
of investing in Fidus SBIC. Accordingly, on June 20, 2011, Fidus 
SBIC filed an election to be regulated as a BDC. The Fidus SBIC 
Board will consider all Potential Co-Investment Transactions in 
accordance with the Conditions.
    \6\ ``Wholly-Owned Investment Sub'' means an entity (i) that is 
wholly-owned by a Regulated Fund (with the Regulated Fund at all 
times holding, beneficially and of record, 100% of the voting and 
economic interests); (ii) whose sole business purpose is to hold one 
or more investments on behalf of the Regulated Fund and, in the case 
of an SBIC Subsidiary, maintain a license under the SBA Act and 
issue debentures guaranteed by the SBA; (iii) with respect to which 
the Regulated Fund's Board has the sole authority to make all 
determinations with respect to the entity's participation under the 
conditions of the application; and (iv) that would be an investment 
company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act. An SBIC 
Subsidiary may be a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub if it satisfies the 
conditions in this definition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. Fidus Advisors, a Delaware limited liability company, is 
registered with the Commission as an investment adviser under the 
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (``Advisers Act''). Fidus Advisors 
serves as investment adviser to the Company (including the assets of 
Fidus SBIC, Fidus SBIC II and the Private Fund).
    5. Applicants seek an order (``Order'') to permit one or more 
Regulated Funds \7\ and/or one or more Affiliated Funds \8\ to 
participate in the same investment opportunities through a proposed co-
investment program (the ``Co-Investment Program'') where such 
participation would otherwise be prohibited under section 57(a)(4) and 
rule 17d-1 by (a) co-investing with each other in securities issued by 
issuers in private placement transactions in which an Adviser 
negotiates terms in addition to price; \9\ and (b) making additional 
investments in securities of such issuers, including through the 
exercise of warrants, conversion privileges, and other rights to 
purchase securities of the issuers (``Follow-On Investments''). ``Co-
Investment Transaction'' means any transaction in which a Regulated 
Fund (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Sub) participated together with 
one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds 
in reliance on the requested Order. ``Potential Co-Investment 
Transaction'' means any investment opportunity in which a Regulated 
Fund (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Sub) could not participate 
together with one or more Affiliated Funds and/or one or more other 
Regulated Funds without obtaining and relying on the Order.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ ``Regulated Fund'' means the Company, Fidus SBIC, and any 
Future Regulated Fund. ``Future Regulated Fund'' means any closed-
end management investment company (a) that is registered under the 
Act or has elected to be regulated as a BDC, (b) whose investment 
adviser is an Adviser, and (c) that intends to participate in the 
Co-Investment Program. The term ``Adviser'' means (a) Fidus Advisors 
and (b) any future investment adviser that controls, is controlled 
by, or is under common control with Fidus Advisors and is registered 
as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act.
    \8\ ``Affiliated Fund'' means the Private Fund and any Future 
Affiliated Fund. ``Future Affiliated Fund'' means any entity (a) 
whose investment adviser is an Adviser, (b) that would be an 
investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act, 
and (c) that intends to participate in the Co-Investment Program.
    \9\ The term ``private placement transactions'' means 
transactions in which the offer and sale of securities by the issuer 
are exempt from registration under the Securities Act.
    \10\ All existing entities that currently intend to rely upon 
the requested Order have been named as applicants. Any other 
existing or future entity that subsequently relies on the Order will 
comply with the terms and conditions of the application.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. Applicants state that a Regulated Fund may, from time to time, 
form one or more Wholly-Owned Investment Subs. Such a subsidiary would 
be prohibited from investing in a Co-Investment Transaction with any 
Affiliated Fund or Regulated Fund because it would be a company 
controlled by its parent Regulated Fund for purposes of Section 
57(a)(4) and rule 17d-1. Applicants request that each Wholly-Owned 
Investment Sub be permitted to participate in Co-Investment 
Transactions in lieu of its parent Regulated Fund and that the Wholly-
Owned Investment Sub's participation in any such transaction be 
treated, for purposes of the requested order, as though the parent 
Regulated Fund were participating directly. Applicants represent that 
this treatment is justified because a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub would 
have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the 
Regulated Fund's investments and, therefore, no conflicts of interest 
could arise between the Regulated Fund and the Wholly-Owned Investment 
Sub. The Regulated Fund's Board would make all relevant determinations 
under the conditions with regard to a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub's 
participation in a Co-Investment Transaction, and the Regulated Fund's 
Board would be informed of, and take into consideration, any proposed 
use of a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub in the Regulated Fund's place. If 
the Regulated Fund proposes to participate in the same Co-Investment 
Transaction with any of its Wholly-Owned Investment Subs, the Board 
will also be informed of, and take into consideration, the relative 
participation of the Regulated Fund and the Wholly-Owned Investment 
Sub.
    7. When considering Potential Co-Investment Transactions for any 
Regulated Fund, the applicable Adviser will consider only the 
Objectives and Strategies, investment policies, investment positions, 
capital available for investment (``Available Capital''), and other 
pertinent factors applicable to that Regulated Fund.\11\ The Board of 
each Regulated Fund, including the Non-Interested Directors has (or 
will have prior to relying on the requested Order) determined that it 
is in the best interests of the Regulated Fund to participate in the 
Co-Investment Transaction.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ The amount of each Regulated Fund's Available Capital will 
be determined based on the amount of cash on hand, existing 
commitments and reserves, if any, the targeted leverage level, 
targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions 
set from time to time by the Board of the applicable Regulated Fund 
or imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or 
interpretations. An Affiliated Fund's capital available for 
investment will be determined based on the amount of cash on hand, 
existing commitments and reserves, if any, the targeted leverage 
level, targeted asset mix and other investment policies and 
restrictions set by the Affiliated Fund's directors, general 
partners or adviser, or imposed by applicable laws, rules, 
regulations or interpretations.
    \12\ The Regulated Funds, however, will not be obligated to 
invest, or co-invest, when investment opportunities are referred to 
them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    8. Other than pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as 
provided in conditions 7 and 8, and after making the determinations 
required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the Adviser will present each 
Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation to the 
directors of the Board eligible to vote under section 57(o) of the Act 
(``Eligible Directors''), and the ``required majority,'' as defined in 
section 57(o) of

[[Page 90028]]

the Act (``Required Majority'') \13\ will approve each Co-Investment 
Transaction prior to any investment by the participating Regulated 
Fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ In the case of a Regulated Fund that is a registered 
closed-end fund, the Board members that make up the Required 
Majority will be determined as if the Regulated Fund were a BDC 
subject to Section 57(o).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9. With respect to the pro rata dispositions and Follow-On 
Investments provided in conditions 7 and 8, a Regulated Fund may 
participate in a pro rata disposition or Follow-On Investment without 
obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if, among other 
things: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and 
Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding 
investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or 
Follow-On Investment, as the case may be; and (ii) the Board of the 
Regulated Fund has approved that Regulated Fund's participation in pro 
rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as being in the best 
interests of the Regulated Fund. If the Board does not so approve, any 
such disposition or Follow-On Investment will be submitted to the 
Regulated Fund's Eligible Directors. The Board of any Regulated Fund 
may at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata 
dispositions and Follow-On Investments with the result that all 
dispositions and/or Follow-On Investments must be submitted to the 
Eligible Directors.
    10. No Non-Interested Director of a Regulated Fund will have a 
financial interest in any Co-Investment Transaction, other than through 
share ownership in one of the Regulated Funds.
    11. If an Adviser or its principals, or any person controlling, 
controlled by, or under common control with an Adviser or its 
principals, and the Affiliated Funds (collectively, the ``Holders'') 
own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the outstanding voting 
shares of a Regulated Fund (other than Fidus SBIC) (``Shares''), then 
the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third 
party when voting on (1) the election of directors; (2) the removal of 
one or more directors; or (3) any other matter under either the Act or 
applicable State law affecting the Board's composition, size, or manner 
of election. Applicants believe that this will ensure that the Non-
Interested Directors will act independently in evaluating the Co-
Investment Program, because the ability of an Adviser or its principals 
to influence the Non-Interested Directors by a suggestion, explicit or 
implied, that the Non-Interested Directors can be removed will be 
limited significantly. The Non-Interested Directors shall evaluate and 
approve any such independent third party, taking into account its 
qualifications, reputation for independence, cost to the shareholders, 
and other factors that they deem relevant.

Applicants' Legal Analysis

    1. Section 57(a)(4) of the Act prohibits certain affiliated persons 
of a BDC from participating in joint transactions with the BDC or a 
company controlled by a BDC in contravention of rules as prescribed by 
the Commission. Under section 57(b)(2) of the Act, any person who is 
directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common 
control with a BDC is subject to section 57(a)(4). Applicants submit 
that each of the Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds could be deemed 
to be a person related to each Regulated Fund in a manner described by 
section 57(b) by virtue of being under common control. Section 57(i) of 
the Act provides that, until the Commission prescribes rules under 
section 57(a)(4), the Commission's rules under section 17(d) of the Act 
applicable to registered closed-end investment companies will be deemed 
to apply to transactions subject to section 57(a)(4). Because the 
Commission has not adopted any rules under section 57(a)(4), rule 17d-1 
also applies to joint transactions with Regulated Funds that are BDCs. 
Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act are applicable to 
Regulated Funds that are registered closed-end investment companies.
    2. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit 
affiliated persons of a registered investment company from 
participating in joint transactions with the company unless the 
Commission has granted an order permitting such transactions. In 
passing upon applications under rule 17d-1, the Commission considers 
whether the company's participation in the joint transaction is 
consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and 
the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or 
less advantageous than that of other participants.
    3. Applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief, 
the Regulated Funds would be, in some circumstances, limited in their 
ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment 
opportunities. Applicants believe that the proposed terms and 
conditions will ensure that the Co-Investment Transactions are 
consistent with the protection of each Regulated Fund's shareholders 
and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the 
Act. Applicants state that the Regulated Funds' participation in the 
Co-Investment Transactions will be consistent with the provisions, 
policies, and purposes of the Act and on a basis that is not different 
from or less advantageous than that of other participants.

Applicants' Conditions

    Applicants agree that the Order will be subject to the following 
conditions:
    1. Each time an Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment 
Transaction for an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Fund that falls 
within a Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies, the 
Regulated Fund's Adviser will make an independent determination of the 
appropriateness of the investment for such Regulated Fund in light of 
the Regulated Fund's then-current circumstances.
    2. (a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated Fund's participation in any 
Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for the Regulated 
Fund, it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for the 
Regulated Fund.
    (b) If the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser 
to be invested by the applicable Regulated Fund in the Potential Co-
Investment Transaction, together with the amount proposed to be 
invested by the other participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated 
Funds, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the 
investment opportunity, the investment opportunity will be allocated 
among them pro rata based on each participant's Available Capital, up 
to the amount proposed to be invested by each. The applicable Adviser 
will provide the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated 
Fund with information concerning each participating party's Available 
Capital to assist the Eligible Directors with their review of the 
Regulated Fund's investments for compliance with these allocation 
procedures.
    (c) After making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 
2(a), the applicable Adviser will distribute written information 
concerning the Potential Co-Investment Transaction (including the 
amount proposed to be invested by each participating Regulated Fund and 
Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible Directors of each participating 
Regulated Fund for their consideration. A Regulated Fund will co-invest 
with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated 
Funds only if, prior to the Regulated Fund's participation in the 
Potential Co-

[[Page 90029]]

Investment Transaction, a Required Majority concludes that:
    (i) The terms of the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, including 
the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Regulated 
Fund and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of 
the Regulated Fund or its shareholders on the part of any person 
concerned;
    (ii) the Potential Co-Investment Transaction is consistent with:
    (A) The interests of the shareholders of the Regulated Fund; and
    (B) the Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies;
    (iii) the investment by any other Regulated Funds or Affiliated 
Funds would not disadvantage the Regulated Fund, and participation by 
the Regulated Fund would not be on a basis different from or less 
advantageous than that of other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds; 
provided that, if any other Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund, but not 
the Regulated Fund itself, gains the right to nominate a director for 
election to a portfolio company's board of directors or the right to 
have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the 
governance or management of the portfolio company, such event shall not 
be interpreted to prohibit the Required Majority from reaching the 
conclusions required by this condition (2)(c)(iii), if:
    (A) The Eligible Directors will have the right to ratify the 
selection of such director or board observer, if any;
    (B) the applicable Adviser agrees to, and does, provide periodic 
reports to the Regulated Fund's Board with respect to the actions of 
such director or the information received by such board observer or 
obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in 
the governance or management of the portfolio company; and
    (C) any fees or other compensation that any Affiliated Fund or any 
Regulated Fund or any affiliated person of any Affiliated Fund or any 
Regulated Fund receives in connection with the right of an Affiliated 
Fund or a Regulated Fund to nominate a director or appoint a board 
observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of 
the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the 
participating Affiliated Funds (who each may, in turn, share its 
portion with its affiliated persons) and the participating Regulated 
Funds in accordance with the amount of each party's investment; and
    (iv) the proposed investment by the Regulated Fund will not benefit 
the Advisers, the Affiliated Funds or the other Regulated Funds or any 
affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the Co-
Investment Transaction), except (A) to the extent permitted by 
condition 13, (B) to the extent permitted by Section 17(e) or 57(k) of 
the Act, as applicable, (C) indirectly, as a result of an interest in 
the securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment 
Transaction, or (D) in the case of fees or other compensation described 
in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).
    3. Each Regulated Fund has the right to decline to participate in 
any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the 
amount proposed.
    4. The applicable Adviser will present to the Board of each 
Regulated Fund, on a quarterly basis, a record of all investments in 
Potential Co-Investment Transactions made by any of the other Regulated 
Funds or Affiliated Funds during the preceding quarter that fell within 
the Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies that were 
not made available to the Regulated Fund, and an explanation of why the 
investment opportunities were not offered to the Regulated Fund. All 
information presented to the Board pursuant to this condition will be 
kept for the life of the Regulated Fund and at least two years 
thereafter, and will be subject to examination by the Commission and 
its staff.
    5. Except for Follow-On Investments made in accordance with 
condition 8,\14\ a Regulated Fund will not invest in reliance on the 
Order in any issuer in which another Regulated Fund, Affiliated Fund, 
or any affiliated person of another Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund 
is an existing investor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ This exception applies only to Follow-On Investments by a 
Regulated Fund in issuers in which that Regulated Fund already holds 
investments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. A Regulated Fund will not participate in any Potential Co-
Investment Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class of 
securities to be purchased, settlement date, and registration rights 
will be the same for each participating Regulated Fund and Affiliated 
Fund. The grant to an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Fund, but 
not the Regulated Fund, of the right to nominate a director for 
election to a portfolio company's board of directors, the right to have 
an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate 
in the governance or management of the portfolio company will not be 
interpreted so as to violate this condition 6, if conditions 
2(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) are met.
    7. (a) If any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund elects to sell, 
exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security that was 
acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Advisers will:
    (i) Notify each Regulated Fund that participated in the Co-
Investment Transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest 
practical time; and
    (ii) formulate a recommendation as to participation by each 
Regulated Fund in the disposition.
    (b) Each Regulated Fund will have the right to participate in such 
disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same 
terms and conditions as those applicable to the participating 
Affiliated Funds and Regulated Funds.
    (c) A Regulated Fund may participate in such disposition without 
obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The proposed 
participation of each Regulated Fund and each Affiliated Fund in such 
disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the 
issuer immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board of the 
Regulated Fund has approved as being in the best interests of the 
Regulated Fund the ability to participate in such dispositions on a pro 
rata basis (as described in greater detail in the application); and 
(iii) the Board of the Regulated Fund is provided on a quarterly basis 
with a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this condition. 
In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation 
as to the Regulated Fund's participation to the Eligible Directors, and 
the Regulated Fund will participate in such disposition solely to the 
extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated 
Fund's best interests.
    (d) Each Affiliated Fund and each Regulated Fund will bear its own 
expenses in connection with any such disposition.
    8. (a) If any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund desires to make 
a Follow-On Investment in a portfolio company whose securities were 
acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Advisers will:
    (i) Notify each Regulated Fund that participated in the Co-
Investment Transaction of the proposed transaction at the earliest 
practical time; and
    (ii) formulate a recommendation as to the proposed participation, 
including the amount of the proposed Follow-On Investment, by each 
Regulated Fund.
    (b) A Regulated Fund may participate in such Follow-On Investment 
without obtaining prior approval of the Required

[[Page 90030]]

Majority if: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and 
each Affiliated Fund in such investment is proportionate to its 
outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-
On Investment; and (ii) the Board of the Regulated Fund has approved as 
being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund the ability to 
participate in Follow-On Investments on a pro rata basis (as described 
in greater detail in the application). In all other cases, the Adviser 
will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Fund's 
participation to the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Fund will 
participate in such Follow-On Investment solely to the extent that a 
Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Fund's best 
interests.
    (c) If, with respect to any Follow-On Investment:
    (i) the amount of the opportunity is not based on the Regulated 
Funds' and the Affiliated Funds' outstanding investments immediately 
preceding the Follow-On Investment; and
    (ii) the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser to 
be invested by the applicable Regulated Fund in the Follow-On 
Investment, together with the amount proposed to be invested by the 
other participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds, collectively, 
in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the investment 
opportunity; then the investment opportunity will be allocated among 
them pro rata based on each participant's Available Capital, up to the 
maximum amount proposed to be invested by each.
    (d) The acquisition of Follow-On Investments as permitted by this 
condition will be considered a Co-Investment Transaction for all 
purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in this 
application.
    9. The Non-Interested Directors of each Regulated Fund will be 
provided quarterly for review all information concerning Potential Co-
Investment Transactions and Co-Investment Transactions, including 
investments made by other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds that the 
Regulated Fund considered but declined to participate in, so that the 
Non-Interested Directors may determine whether all investments made 
during the preceding quarter, including those investments that the 
Regulated Fund considered but declined to participate in, comply with 
the conditions of the Order. In addition, the Non-Interested Directors 
will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for the 
Regulated Fund of participating in new and existing Co-Investment 
Transactions.
    10. Each Regulated Fund will maintain the records required by 
Section 57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of the Regulated Funds were a 
BDC and each of the investments permitted under these conditions were 
approved by the Required Majority under Section 57(f) of the Act.
    11. No Non-Interested Director of a Regulated Fund will also be a 
director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise 
an ``affiliated person'' (as defined in the Act) of an Affiliated Fund.
    12. The expenses, if any, associated with acquiring, holding or 
disposing of any securities acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction 
(including, without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any 
such securities registered for sale under the Securities Act) will, to 
the extent not payable by the Advisers under their respective 
investment advisory agreements with Affiliated Funds and the Regulated 
Funds, be shared by the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds in 
proportion to the relative amounts of the securities held or to be 
acquired or disposed of, as the case may be.
    13. Any transaction fee \15\ (including break-up or commitment fees 
but excluding broker's fees contemplated by Section 17(e) or 57(k) of 
the Act, as applicable), received in connection with a Co-Investment 
Transaction will be distributed to the participating Regulated Funds 
and Affiliated Funds on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they 
invested or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment 
Transaction. If any transaction fee is to be held by an Adviser pending 
consummation of the transaction, the fee will be deposited into an 
account maintained by such Adviser at a bank or banks having the 
qualifications prescribed in Section 26(a)(1) of the Act, and the

Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual



Document Number: 2017-15862    

Type: Rule    

Date: 2017-07-28    

Agency: Securities and Exchange Commission, Agencies and Commissions    


    The Securities and Exchange Commission (``the Commission'') is adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (``EDGAR'') Filer Manual and related rules to reflect updates to the EDGAR system. The updates are being made primarily to reflect amendments made to several forms under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to effectuate inflation adjustments and other technical amendments required under Titles I and III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (``JOBS'') Act; support recent updates to Form C and Form D; includes instructions for hyperlinking to exhibits included with certain Securities Act and Exchange Act forms and makes certain corrective changes to previously revised sections. The revised EDGAR Filer Manual also announces updates to the technical specifications for the ABS-EE schema and terminates support for US-GAAP-2015, EXCH-2015, CURRENCY-2014, and COUNTRY-2013 taxonomies. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded on July 17, 2017.

	II. Background











	   

	     The Company was organized under the General Corporation Law of the state of Maryland on February 14, 2011 for the purpose of operating as an externally-managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. On June 16, 2011, the Company filed a registration statement on Form 8-A to register its common stock under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. On June 20, 2011, the Company filed a notice of its election to be regulated as a BDC within the meaning of Section 2(a)(48) of the 1940 Act


	7


	on Form N-54A. It completed the initial public offering (the “IPO”) of its shares of common stock on June 24, 2011. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “FDUS

	.”






	 









	4

	 The

	term “private placement transactions” means transactions in which the offer and sale of securities by the issuer are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “

	1933 Act

	”)

	.



	 





	5


	 No

	Non-Interested Director (as defined below) of a Regulated Fund will have a financial interest in any Co-Investment Transaction, other than indirectly through share ownership in one of the Regulated Funds

	.

	See, e.g.

	,

	Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. (pub. avail. June 7, 2000), Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. (pub. avail. July 28, 2000) and SMC Capital, Inc. (pub. avail. Sept. 5, 1995)

	.





	 





	7


	 Section 2(a)(48)

	defines a BDC to be any closed-end investment company that operates for the purpose of making investments in securities described in Section 55(a)(1) through 55(a)(3) of the 1940 Act and makes available significant managerial assistance with respect to the issuers of such securities

	.

	 The Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) for tax purposes as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and intends to continue to make such election in the future

	.













	   

	 The Company provides customized mezzanine debt and equity financing solutions to lower middle-market companies located throughout the United States that have revenues between $10 million and $150 million. As of September 30, 2015, the Company had total assets of approximately $457.1 million. The Company’s investment objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating both current income from debt investments and capital appreciation from equity related investments. The Company’s investments generally range from $5 million to $20 million per portfolio company.














	   

	 The Company is managed by a board of directors (the “


	Board


	”) currently comprised of five persons; three of these directors are not, and a majority of the directors at all times will not be, “interested persons” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the “


	Non-Interested Directors


	”).







	 





	   


	The Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds have, or will have, investment objectives and strategies that are similar to or overlap with the Company’s Objectives and Strategies.


	8


	 To the extent there is an investment that falls within the Objectives and Strategies of one or more Regulated Funds and the investment objectives and strategies of one or more Affiliated Funds, the Advisers would expect such Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds to co-invest with each other.







	   

	 The Private Fund is organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law.

	The Private Fund’s investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. The Private Fund has not yet held a closing with any limited partners and currently has no investments. The Private Fund would be an investment company but for the exclusion from the definition of investment company provided by Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. Its investment objective and investment policies are substantially similar to those of the Company.  The Private Fund will not rely on the Order unless it is advised by an Adviser.






	   







	   

	 Fidus SBIC and Fidus SBIC II are SBIC Subsidiaries (the “

	Existing SBIC Subsidiaries

	”). Fidus SBIC was organized as a limited partnership under the laws of the state of Delaware on February 5, 2007 and received its license from the SBA on October 22, 2007 to operate as an SBIC under the

	Small Business Investment Act of 1958

	(the “

	SBA Act

	”). The principals of Fidus SBIC sought an SBIC license in order to give Fidus SBIC access to attractive fixed-rate SBA guaranteed debentures. On June 20, 2011, Fidus SBIC filed an election to be regulated as a BDC within the meaning of Section 2(a)(48) of the 1940 Act on Form N-54A under the 1940 Act

	.




	 







	   

	 Fidus SBIC has appointed a board of directors (“Fidus SBIC Board”) consisting of three persons who are not “interested persons” of Fidus SBIC within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act and two persons who are “interested persons” of Fidus SBIC


	.







	 





	   



	Fidus SBIC II was organized as a limited partnership under the laws of the state of Delaware on October 12, 2012, and received its license from the SBA in on May 28, 2013 to operate as an SBIC.


	Fidus SBIC  II is a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub of the Company.  Fidus SBIC II is not registered under the 1940 Act, and would be an investment company but for Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act


	.



	 



	   

	T

	he Existing SBIC Subsidiaries’ licenses under the SBA Act allow the Existing SBIC Subsidiaries to issue SBA-guaranteed debentures at favorable interest rates.



	 





	   

	Fidus Advisors, a Delaware

	limited liability company

	, is registered with the Commission as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act

	.

	It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Fidus

	Group Holdings, LLC.

	  Fidus Advisors





	 









	8


	 “Objectives and Strategies”

	means the Company’s investment objectives and strategies, as described in the Company’s registration statement on Form N-2, other filings the Company has made with the Commission under the 1933 Act or under the 1934 Act, and the Company’s reports to stockholders

	.



	 



	9

	As

	Fidus Group Holdings, LLC controls Fidus Advisors, and will control any other Adviser, it may be deemed to control the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds. However, Fidus Group Holdings, LLC is a holding company




	 




	 




	4 



	 




	 





	 







	manages the consolidated assets of the Company, including those of Fidus SBIC and Fidus SBIC II, and

	serves as investment adviser to the Company pursuant to the terms of an investment advisory agreement that has been approved by the Board. Under the investment advisory agreement, Fidus Advisors manages the portfolio of the Company in accordance with the Company’s investment objective and policies, makes investment decisions for the Company, places purchase and sale orders for portfolio transactions for the Company, and otherwise manages the day-to-day operations of the Company, subject to the oversight of its Board. An Adviser will serve as investment adviser to the Private Fund pursuant to the terms of an investment advisory agreement with the Private Fund. Under such investment advisory agreement, an Adviser will manage the portfolio of the Private Fund in accordance with the investment objective and policies of the Private Fund, will makes investment decisions for the Private Fund, will place purchase and sale orders for portfolio transactions for the Private Fund, and will otherwise manage the day-to-day operations of the Private Fund

	.









	III.  Order Requested





	 







	   

	 The Applicants request the Order of the Commission under Sections 17(d) and 57(i) under the 1940 Act, and Rule 17d-l under the 1940 Act to permit, subject to the  proposed conditions of the Application (the “

	Conditions

	”), one or more Regulated Funds to be able to participate in Co-Investment Transactions with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds

	.





	 





	   


	The Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds seek relief to invest in Co-Investment Transactions because such Co-Investment Transactions would otherwise be prohibited by Sections 17(d) and 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-l under the 1940 Act. This Application seeks relief in order to (i) enable the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds to avoid the practical difficulties of trying to structure, negotiate and persuade counterparties to enter into transactions while awaiting the granting of the relief requested in individual applications with respect to each Co-Investment Transaction that arises in the future, and (ii) enable the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds to avoid the significant legal and other expenses that would be incurred in preparing such individual applications

	.



	 



	A. Section 17(d) and Section 57(a)(4)



	 






	   

	 Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits an affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act), or an affiliated person of such affiliated person, of a registered closed-end investment company acting as principal, from effecting any transaction in which the registered closed-end investment company is a joint or a joint and several participant, in contravention of such rules as the Commission may prescribe for the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by the registered closed-end investment company on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of such other participant. Rule 17d–1 under the 1940 Act generally prohibits participation by a registered investment company and an affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act) or principal underwriter for that investment company, or an affiliated person of such affiliated person or principal underwriter, in any “joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan,” as defined in the rule, without prior approval by the Commission by order upon application

	.




	 






	   

	 Similarly, with regard to BDCs, Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act prohibits certain persons specified in Section 57(b) of the 1940 Act from participating in a joint transaction with a BDC or a company controlled by a BDC in contravention of rules as prescribed by the Commission. In particular Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act applies to:





	 








	 





	•





	 







	Any director, officer, employee, or member of an advisory board of a BDC, or any person (other than the BDC itself) who is an affiliated person of the foregoing pursuant to Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the 1940 Act; or










	 







	 





	•





	 







	Any investment adviser or promoter of, general partner in, principal underwriter for, or person directly or indirectly either controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, a BDC,


	10


	or any person who is










	 









	and does not currently offer investment advisory services to any person and is not expected to do so in the future. Accordingly, Fidus Group Holdings, LLC has not been included as an Applicant

	.




	 






	10


	Excluded

	from this category are the BDC itself and any person who, if it were not directly or indirectly controlled by the BDC, would not otherwise be under common control with the BDC.




	 







	 






	5 



	 







	 







	 





	 





	 









	an affiliated person of any of the foregoing within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3)(C) or (D) of the 1940 Act.











	 






	   

	 Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the 1940 Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person to include any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person. Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act defines “control” as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the result of an official position with that company. Under Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act a person who beneficially owns, either directly or through one or more controlled companies, more than 25% of the voting securities of a company is presumed to control such company. The Commission and its staff have indicated on a number of occasions their belief that an investment adviser controls the fund that it advises, absent compelling evidence to the contrary.


	11








	 






	   

	 Fidus Advisors is the investment adviser to the Company, and an Adviser will be the investment adviser to each of the Regulated Funds. Fidus Advisors may be deemed to control the Company, and any other Adviser will be controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Fidus Advisors. In addition, an Adviser will be the investment adviser to each Affiliated Fund. The Regulated Funds may be deemed to be under common control, and thus affiliated persons of each other under Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the 1940 Act. In addition, the Affiliated Funds may be deemed to be under common control with the Regulated Funds, and thus affiliated persons of each Regulated Fund under Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the 1940 Act. As a result, these relationships might cause a Regulated Fund and one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds participating in Co-Investment Transactions to be subject to Sections 17(d) or 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, and thus subject to the provisions of Rule 17d-l of the 1940 Act

	.








	B. Rule 17d–1



	 






	   

	 Rule 17d–l under the 1940 Act generally prohibits participation by a registered investment company and an affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act) or principal underwriter for that investment company, or an affiliated person of such affiliated person or principal underwriter, in any “joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan,” as defined in the rule, without prior approval by the Commission by order upon application

	.




	 






	   

	 Rule 17d–1 was promulgated by the Commission pursuant to Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act and made applicable to BDCs by Section 57(i) of the 1940 Act. Section 57(i) of the 1940 Act provides that, until the Commission prescribes rules under Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, the Commission’s rules under Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act applicable to registered closed-end investment companies will be deemed to apply. Because the Commission has not adopted any rules under Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, Rule 17d–I under the 1940 Act applies

	.




	 






	   

	 Applicants seek relief pursuant to Rule 17d-l under the 1940 Act, which permits the Commission to authorize joint transactions upon application. In passing upon applications filed pursuant to Rule I7d–l under the 1940 Act, the Commission is directed by Rule 17d–1(b) under the 1940 Act to consider whether the participation of a registered investment company or controlled company thereof in the joint enterprise or joint arrangement under scrutiny is consistent with provisions, policies and purposes of the 1940 Act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants

	.




	 






	   

	 The Commission has stated that Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act, upon which Rule 17d–1 under the 1940 Act is based, and upon which Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act was modeled, was designed to protect investment companies from self-dealing and overreaching by insiders. The Commission has also taken notice that there may be transactions subject to these prohibitions that do not present the dangers of overreaching. See

	. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has enunciated a like rationale for the purpose behind Section 17(d): “The objective of [Section] 17(d) . . . is to prevent . . . injuring the interest of stockholders of registered investment companies by causing the company to participate on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of such other participants.”

	Securities and Exchange Commission v. Talley Industries. Inc.

	, 399 F.2d 396, 405 (2d Cir. 1968),

	cert. denied

	393 U.S. 1015 (1969). Furthermore, Congress acknowledged that the protective system established by the enactment of Section 57 is “similar to that applicable to registered investment companies under section 17 of the 1940 Act, and rules thereunder, but is modified to address concerns relating to unique characteristics presented by business development companies.” H.Rep. No. 96-1341, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 45 (1980) 

	reprinted in

	 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4827.





	 






	Applicants believe that the terms and conditions of this Application would ensure that the conflicts of interest that Section 17(d) and Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act were designed to prevent would be addressed and the standards for an order under Rule 17d–1 under the 1940 Act are met.






	 



	C. Protection Provided by the Proposed Conditions



	 






	   

	 Applicants believe that the Conditions, as discussed more fully in Section III.D. of this Application, will ensure the protection of shareholders of the Regulated Funds and compliance with the purposes and policies of the 1940 Act with respect to the Co-Investment Transactions. In particular, the Conditions, as outlined below, would ensure that each Regulated Fund would only invest in investments that are appropriate to the interests of shareholders and the investment needs and abilities of that Regulated Fund. In addition, each Regulated Fund would be able to invest on equal footing with each other Regulated Fund and the Affiliated Funds, including identical terms, conditions, price, class of securities purchased, settlement date, and registration rights. Each Regulated Fund would have the ability to engage in Follow-On Investments in a fair manner consistent with the protections of the other conditions. Each Regulated Fund would have the ability to participate on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions in any sale of a security purchased in a Co-Investment Transaction. Fees and expenses of Co-Investment Transactions would be borne by the applicable Adviser, or shared pro-rata among the Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds who participate in the Co-Investment Transactions. The conditions would also prevent a Regulated Fund from investing in any current investments of an affiliated person, which eliminates the possibility of a Regulated Fund from being forced to invest in a manner that would benefit an affiliated person’s existing investment. Also, sufficient records of the transactions would be maintained to permit the examination staff of the Commission to monitor compliance with the terms of the requested order

	.




	 






	   

	 The Conditions impose a variety of duties on the Advisers with respect to Co-Investment Transactions and Potential Co-Investment Transactions by the Regulated Funds. These duties include determinations regarding investment appropriateness, the appropriate level of investment, and the provision of information to the Board of any Regulated Fund. In addition, when considering Potential Co-Investment Transactions for any Regulated Fund, the applicable Adviser will consider only the Objectives and Strategies, investment policies, investment positions, Available Capital (defined below), and other pertinent factors applicable to that Regulated Fund. Each Adviser, as applicable, undertakes to perform these duties consistently for each Regulated Fund, as applicable, regardless of which of them serves as investment adviser to these entities. The participation of a Regulated Fund in a Potential Co-Investment Transaction may only be approved by a required majority, as defined in Section 57(o) (a “

	Required Majority

	”), of the directors of the Board eligible to vote on that Co-Investment Transaction under Section 57(o) (the “

	Eligible Directors

	”)

	.


	12






	 





	   

	 The amount of each Regulated Fund’s capital available for investment (“

	Available Capital

	”) will be determined based on the amount of cash on hand, existing commitments and reserves, if any, the targeted leverage level, targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set from time to time by the Board of the applicable Regulated Fund or imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or interpretations. Likewise, an Affiliated Fund’s capital available for investment will be determined based on the amount of cash on hand, existing commitments and reserves, if any, the targeted leverage level, targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set by the Affiliated Fund’s directors, general partners or adviser or imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or interpretations.



	 










	12


	 In

	the case of a Regulated Fund that is a registered closed-end fund, the Board members that make up the Required Majority will be determined as if the Regulated Fund were a BDC subject to Section 57(o)

	.



	 






	 






	7 





	 





	 







	   

	 If an Adviser or its principals, or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with an Adviser or its principals, and the Affiliated Funds (collectively, the “

	Holders

	”) own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the outstanding voting shares of a Regulated Fund (the “

	Shares

	”), then the Holders will vote such Shares as required under condition 14.





	 





	            

	Applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the Non-Interested Directors will act independently in evaluating the Co-Investment Program, because the ability of an Adviser or its principals to influence the Non-Interested Directors by a suggestion, explicit or implied, that the Non-Interested Directors can be removed will be limited significantly. The Non-Interested Directors shall evaluate and approve any such independent party, taking into accounts its qualifications, reputation for independence, cost to the shareholders, and other factors that they deem relevant.




	 






	   

	 In sum, the Applicants believe that the proposed conditions would ensure that each Regulated Fund that participates in a Co-Investment Transaction does not participate on a basis different from, or less advantageous than, that of such other participants. As a result, the Applicants believe that the participation of the Regulated Funds in Co-Investment Transactions done in accordance with the Conditions would be consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the 1940 Act, and would be done in a manner that was not different from, or less advantageous than, the other participants.





	 







	   

	 With respect to each Wholly-Owned Investment Sub, such a subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a Co-Investment Transaction with an Affiliated Fund or Regulated Fund because it would be a company controlled by its parent Regulated Fund for purposes of Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-l under the 1940 Act. Applicants request that each Wholly-Owned Investment Sub be permitted to participate in Co-Investment Transactions in lieu of its parent Regulated Fund and that the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub’s participation in any such transaction be treated, for purposes of the Order, as though the parent Regulated Fund were participating directly. Applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the Regulated Fund’s investments and, therefore, no conflicts of interest could arise between the Regulated Fund and the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub. The Regulated Fund’s Board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub’s participation in a Co-Investment Transaction, and the Regulated Fund’s Board would be informed of, and take into consideration, any proposed use of a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub in the Regulated Fund’s place. If the Regulated Fund proposes to participate in the same Co-Investment Transaction with any of its Wholly-Owned Investment Subs, the Board will also be informed of, and take into consideration, the relative participation of the Regulated Fund and the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub.






	 



	D. Proposed Conditions



	 






	   

	 Applicants agree that any Order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following Conditions:





	 



	1. Each

	time an Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment Transaction for an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Fund that falls within a Regulated Fund’s then-current Objectives and Strategies, the Regulated Fund’s Adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for such Regulated Fund in light of the Regulated Fund’s then-current circumstances.




	 








	2.






	(a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated Fund’s participation in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for the Regulated Fund, it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for the Regulated Fund.








	 




	(b) If the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser to be invested by the applicable Regulated Fund in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, together with the amount proposed to be invested by the other participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity, the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participant’s Available Capital, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each. The applicable Adviser will provide the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Fund with information concerning each participating party’s Available Capital to assist the Eligible Directors with their review of the Regulated Fund’s investments for compliance with these allocation procedures.




	 






	 






	8 





	 






	(c) After making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the applicable Adviser will distribute written information concerning the Potential Co-Investment Transaction (including the amount proposed to be invested by each participating Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Fund for their consideration. A Regulated Fund will co-invest with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds only if, prior to the Regulated Fund’s participation in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, a Required Majority concludes that:




	 




	(i) the terms of the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Regulated Fund and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Regulated Fund or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned;



	 



	(ii) the Potential Co-Investment Transaction is consistent with:



	 



	(A) the interests of the shareholders of the Regulated Fund; and



	 



	(B) the Regulated Fund’s then-current Objectives and Strategies;



	 





	(iii) the investment by any other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds would not disadvantage the Regulated Fund, and participation by the Regulated Fund would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds;

	provided that

	, if any other Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund, but not the Regulated Fund itself, gains the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company’s board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company, such event shall not be interpreted to prohibit the Required Majority from reaching the conclusions required by this condition (2)(c)(iii), if:






	 





	(A) the Eligible Directors will have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer, if any;





	 





	(B) the applicable Adviser agrees to, and does, provide periodic reports to the Regulated Fund’s Board with respect to the actions of such director or the information received by such board observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company; and





	 






	(C) any fees or other compensation that any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund or any affiliated person of any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund receives in connection with the right of the Affiliated Fund or a Regulated Fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the participating Affiliated Funds (who each may, in turn, share its portion with its affiliated persons) and the participating Regulated Funds in accordance with the amount of each party’s investment; and






	 





	(iv) the proposed investment by the Regulated Fund will not benefit the Advisers, the Affiliated Funds or the other Regulated Funds or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction), except (A) to the extent permitted by condition 13, (B) to the extent permitted by Section 17(e) or 57(k) of the 1940 Act, as applicable, (C) indirectly, as a result of an interest in the securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction, or (D) in the case of fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).




	 



	3. Each

	Regulated Fund has the right to decline to participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the amount proposed

	.



	 



	4. The

	applicable Adviser will present to the Board of each Regulated Fund, on a quarterly basis, a record of all investments in Potential Co-Investment Transactions made by any of the other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds during the preceding quarter that fell within the Regulated Fund’s then-current Objectives and Strategies that were not made available to the Regulated Fund, and an explanation of why the investment opportunities were not offered to the Regulated Fund. All information presented to the Board pursuant to this condition will be kept for the life of the Regulated Fund and at least two years thereafter, and will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff

	.




	 






	 






	9 



	 





	5. E

	xcept for Follow-On Investments made in accordance with condition 8,


	13


	a Regulated Fund will not invest in reliance on the Order in any issuer in which another Regulated Fund, Affiliated Fund, or any affiliated person of another Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund is an existing investor.








	6.

	A Regulated Fund will not participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class of securities to be purchased, settlement date, and registration rights will be the same for each participating Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund. The grant to an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Fund, but not the Regulated Fund, of the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company’s board of directors, the right to have an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will not be interpreted so as to violate this condition 6, if conditions 2(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) are met.




	 








	7.






	(a) If any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund elects to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security that was acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Advisers will:








	 




	(i) notify each Regulated Fund that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest practical time; and



	 



	(ii) formulate a recommendation as to participation by each Regulated Fund in the disposition.



	 



	(b) Each Regulated Fund will have the right to participate in such disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the participating Affiliated Funds and Regulated Funds.



	 



	(c) A Regulated Fund may participate in such disposition without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) the proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and each Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board of the Regulated Fund has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund the ability to participate in such dispositions on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in this application); and (iii) the Board of the Regulated Fund is provided on a quarterly basis with a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this condition. In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Fund’s participation to the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Fund will participate in such disposition solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Fund’s best interests.



	 



	(d) Each Affiliated Fund and each Regulated Fund will bear its own expenses in connection with any such disposition.




	 










	8.






	(a) If any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund desires to make a Follow-On Investment in a portfolio company whose securities were acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Advisers will:







	 



	(i) notify each Regulated Fund that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed transaction at the earliest practical time; and



	 



	(ii) formulate a recommendation as to the proposed participation, including the amount of the proposed Follow-On Investment, by each Regulated Fund.



	 




	(b) A Regulated Fund may participate in such Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) the proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and each Affiliated Fund in such investment is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and (ii) the Board of the Regulated Fund has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund the ability to participate in Follow-On Investments on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in this application). In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Fund’s participation to the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Fund will participate in such Follow-On Investment solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Fund’s best interests.



	 


	(c) If, with respect to any Follow-On Investment:




	 











	13


	 This


	exception applies only to Follow-On Investments by a Regulated Fund in issuers in which the Regulated Fund already holds investments.







	 






	 






	10 



	 






	 







	(i) the amount of the opportunity is not based on the Regulated Funds’ and the Affiliated Funds’ outstanding investments immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and



	 



	(ii) the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser to be invested by the applicable Regulated Fund in the Follow-On Investment, together with the amount proposed to be invested by the other participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity, then the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participant’s Available Capital, up to the maximum amount proposed to be invested by each.



	 



	(d) The acquisition of Follow-On Investments as permitted by this condition will be considered a Co-Investment Transaction for all purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in this application.




	 



	9.

	The Non-Interested Directors of each Regulated Fund will be provided quarterly for review all information concerning Potential Co-Investment Transactions and Co-Investment Transactions, including investments made by other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds that the Regulated Fund considered but declined to participate in, so that the Non-Interested Directors may determine whether all investments made during the preceding quarter, including those investments that the Regulated Fund considered but declined to participate in, comply with the conditions of the Order. In addition, the Non-Interested Directors will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for the Regulated Fund of participating in new and existing Co-Investment Transactions.




	 



	10.

	Each Regulated Fund will maintain the records required by Section 57(f)(3) of the 1940 Act as if each of the Regulated Funds were a BDC and each of the investments permitted under these conditions were approved by the Required Majority under Section 57(f) of the 1940 Act.




	 



	11.

	No Non-Interested Director of a Regulated Fund will also be a director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise an “affiliated person” (as defined in the 1940 Act) of an Affiliated Fund.




	 



	12.

	The expenses, if any, associated with acquiring, holding or disposing of any securities acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction (including, without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any such securities registered for sale under the 1933 Act) will, to the extent not payable by the Advisers under their respective investment advisory agreements with Affiliated Funds and the Regulated Funds, be shared by the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds in proportion to the relative amounts of the securities held or to be acquired or disposed of, as the case may be.






	 




	13.

	Any transaction fee


	14


	(including break-up or commitment fees but excluding broker’s fees contemplated by Section 17(e) or 57(k) of the 1940 Act, as applicable), received in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction will be distributed to the participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they invested or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment Transaction. If any transaction fee is to be held by an Adviser pending consummation of the transaction, the fee will be deposited into an account maintained by such Adviser at a bank or banks having the qualifications prescribed in Section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, and the account will earn a competitive rate of interest that will also be divided pro rata among the participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds based on the amounts they invest in such Co-Investment Transaction. None of the Affiliated Funds, the Advisers, the other Regulated Funds or any affiliated person of the Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds will receive additional compensation or remuneration of any kind as a result of or in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction (other than (a) in the case of the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds, the pro rata transaction fees described above and fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C); and (b) in the case of an Adviser, investment advisory fees paid in accordance with the agreement between the Adviser and the Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund.





	 




	14. 

	If the Holders own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Shares of a Regulated Fund (other than Fidus SBIC)


	15


	, then the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on (1) the

















	14


	Applicants





	are not requesting and the staff is not providing any relief for transaction fees received in connection with any Co-Investment Transaction.











	 





	15



	On March 1, 2011, Fidus SBIC filed its registration statement on Form N-5 with the Commission, as a co-registrant with the Company on its registration statement on Form N-2. As a result of the Company’s initial public offering and a series of related transactions, Fidus SBIC could be deemed to fail to meet the requirements for exclusion from the definition of an investment company set forth in (1) Section 3(c)(1) by reason of subparagraph (A) of Section 3(c)(1) and (2) Section 3(c)(7) by virtue of its failure to qualify as a “qualified purchaser” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(51) by virtue of Rule 2a51-3(a) of the 1940 Act, as the Company could be deemed to have been formed for the purpose of investing in Fidus SBIC. Accordingly, on June 20, 2011, Fidus SBIC filed an election to be regulated as a BDC.

	 


	The Fidus SBIC Board will consider all Potential Co-Investment Transactions in accordance with the Conditions.

	election of directors; (2) the removal of one or more directors; or (3)


	any other matter under either the 1940 Act or applicable State law affecting the Board’s composition, size or manner of election.







	 





	IV. Statement in Support of Relief Requested




	 





	   

	 Applicants submit that allowing the Co-Investment Transactions described by this Application is justified on the basis of (i) the potential benefits to the Regulated Funds and the shareholders thereof and (ii) the protections found in the terms and conditions set forth in this Application.



	 




	A. Potential Benefits




	 







	   

	 In the absence of the relief sought hereby, in some circumstances the Regulated Funds would be limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities. Section 17(d) and Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d–1 under the 1940 Act should not prevent BDCs and registered closed–end investment companies from making investments that are in the best interests of their shareholders.





	 







	   

	 In cases where the Advisers identify investment opportunities requiring larger capital commitments, they must seek the participation of other entities with similar investment styles. The ability to participate in Co-Investment Transactions that involve committing larger amounts of financing would enable each Regulated Fund to participate with one or more of the Affiliated Funds and the other Regulated Funds in larger financing commitments, which would, in turn, be expected to obtain discounted prices and increase income, expand investment opportunities and provide better access to due diligence information for the Regulated Funds. Indeed, each Regulated Fund’s inability to co-invest with one or more of the Affiliated Funds and the other Regulated Funds could potentially result in the loss of beneficial investment opportunities for such Regulated Fund and, in turn, adversely affect such Regulated Fund’s shareholders. For example, a Regulated Fund may lose investment opportunities if the Adviser cannot provide “one-stop” financing to a potential portfolio company. Portfolio companies may reject an offer of funding arranged by an Adviser due to a Regulated Fund’s inability to commit the full amount of financing required by the portfolio company in a timely manner (i.e., without the delay that typically would be associated with obtaining single-transaction exemptive relief from the Commission). The Regulated Fund Advisers expect that any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a Regulated Fund should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds, with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification. The Regulated Funds, however, will not be obligated to invest, or co-invest, when investment opportunities are referred to them.





	 







	   

	 Each Regulated Fund and its shareholders will benefit from the ability to participate in Co-Investment Transactions. The Board of each Regulated Fund, including the Non-Interested Directors, has (or will have prior to relying on the requested Order) determined that it is in the best interests of the Regulated Fund to participate in Co-Investment Transactions because, among other matters, (i) the Regulated Fund will be able to participate in a larger number and greater variety of transactions; (ii) the Regulated Fund will be able to participate in larger transactions; (iii) the Regulated Fund will be able to participate in all opportunities approved by a Required Majority or otherwise permissible under the Order rather than risk underperformance through rotational allocation of opportunities among the Regulated Funds; (iv) the Regulated Fund and any other Regulated Funds participating in the proposed investment will have greater bargaining power, more control over the investment and less need to bring in other external investors or structure investments to satisfy the different needs of external investors; (v) the Regulated Fund will be able to obtain greater attention and better deal flow from investment bankers and others who act as sources of investments; and (vi) the general terms and conditions of the proposed Order are fair to the Regulated Funds and their shareholders. The Company’s Board, including the Non-Interested Directors, also determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to obtain the Order at the earliest possible time and instructed the officers of the Company, the Advisers and counsel to use all appropriate efforts to accomplish such goal. For these reasons, the Board has determined (or will have prior to relying on the requested Order) that is proper and desirable







	 





	 






	12 



	 






	 





	 






	for the Company to participate in Co-Investment Transactions with the other Regulated Funds and/or one more Affiliated Funds.





	 




	B. Protective Representations and Conditions



	 





	   

	 The terms and conditions set forth in this application ensure that the proposed Co-Investment Transactions are consistent with the protection of each Regulated Fund’s shareholders and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act. Specifically, the Conditions incorporate the following critical protections: (i) in each Co-Investment Transaction, all Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds participating in the Co-Investment Transactions will invest at the same time for the same price and with the same terms, conditions, class, registration rights and any other rights, so that none of them receives terms more favorable than any other; (ii) a Required Majority of each Regulated Fund must approve various investment decisions with respect to such Regulated Fund in accordance with the Conditions; and (iii) the Regulated Funds are required to retain and maintain certain records.




	 





	   

	 Other than pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as provided in conditions 7 and 8, and after making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the Adviser will present each Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation to the Eligible Directors, and the Required Majority will approve each Co-Investment Transaction prior to any investment by the participating Regulated Fund. With respect to the pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments provided in conditions 7 and 8, a Regulated Fund may participate in a pro rata disposition or Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if, among other things: (i) the proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or Follow-On Investment, as the case may be; and (ii) the Board of the Regulated Fund has approved that Regulated Fund’s participation in pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund. If the Board does not so approve, any such disposition or Follow-On Investment will be submitted to the Regulated Fund’s Eligible Directors. The Board of any Regulated Fund may at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments with the result that all dispositions and/or Follow-On Investments must be submitted to the Eligible Directors.



	 





	   

	 The Applicants believe that participation by the Regulated Funds in pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments, as provided in conditions 7 and 8, is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the 1940 Act and will not be made on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants. A formulaic approach, such as pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments, eliminates the discretionary ability to make allocation determinations, and in turn eliminates the possibility for overreaching and promotes fairness. The Applicants note that the Commission has adopted a similar pro rata approach in the context of Rule 23c-2 under the 1940 Act, which relates to the redemption by a closed-end investment company of less than all of a class of its securities, indicating the general fairness and lack of overreaching that such approach provides.





	 





	   

	 The foregoing analysis applies equally where a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub is involved in a Co-Investment Transaction as each Wholly-Owned Investment Sub will be treated as one company with its parent for purposes of this Application.






	 



	V. Precedents











	   

	 The Commission previously has issued orders permitting certain investment companies subject to regulation under the 1940 Act and their affiliated persons to co-invest in Private Placement Securities.

Fidus remains well positioned to selectively grow our portfolio with a focus on our long-term goal of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns from our debt and equity investments.”(1) Supplemental information regarding adjusted net investment income: On a supplemental basis, we provide information relating to adjusted net investment income, which is a non-GAAP measure.  This measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net investment income.  Adjusted net investment income represents net investment income excluding any capital gains incentive fee expense or (reversal) attributable to realized and unrealized gains and losses.  The management agreement with our advisor provides that a capital gains incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to cumulative realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital gains) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized losses.  In addition, we accrue, but do not pay, a capital gains incentive fee in connection with any unrealized capital appreciation, as appropriate.  As such, we believe that adjusted net investment income is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any capital gains incentive fee expense or (reversal) attributable to realized and unrealized gains and losses. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of net investment income to adjusted net investment income are set forth in Schedule 1.First Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsFor the three months ended March 31, 2017, total investment income was $16.2 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 10.2%, over the $14.7 million of total investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was attributable to a $1.2 million increase in interest income resulting from higher average debt investment balances outstanding during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, a $0.5 million increase in dividend income due to increased levels of distributions received from equity investments during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, and partially offset by a $(0.2) million decrease in fee income during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.For the three months ended March 31, 2017, total expenses, including income tax provision, were $8.3 million, an increase of $0.7 million or 9.2%, over the $7.6 million of total expenses, including income tax provision, for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Interest and financing expenses for both the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $2.6 million. The base management fee increased $0.3 million, or 15.0%, to $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to higher average total assets during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. The incentive fee for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $2.3 million, a $0.4 million, or 21.1%, increase from the $1.9 million incentive fee for the three months ended March 31, 2016, which is comprised of increases in the income and capital gains incentive fees of $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. The administrative service fee, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses totaled $1.1 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.Read MoreNet investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $7.9 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 11.3%, compared to net investment income of $7.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as a result of the $1.5 million increase in total investment income compared to only a $0.7 million increase in total expenses, including income tax provision.For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the total net realized gain on investments was $6.4 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded a net change in unrealized depreciation on investments of $(3.4) million attributable to (i) the reversal of net unrealized appreciation of $(4.5) million related to the exit, sale or restructuring of investments, resulting in unrealized depreciation, (ii) net unrealized depreciation of $(2.1) million on debt investments and (iii) net unrealized appreciation of $3.2 million on equity investments.  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recorded a net change in unrealized appreciation on investments of $0.8 million attributable to (i) the reversal of net unrealized depreciation on investments of $0.9 million related to the exit or sale of investments, resulting in unrealized appreciation, (ii) net unrealized depreciation of $(5.9) million on debt investments and (iii) net unrealized appreciation of $5.8 million on equity investments.During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded $(1.4) million of income tax provision for realized gains on investments.  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, no income tax provision for realized gains on investments was recorded.As a result of these events, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $9.5 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 26.7%, compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $7.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016.Portfolio and Investment ActivitiesAs of March 31, 2017, the fair value of our investment portfolio totaled $536.6 million and consisted of 55 active portfolio companies and four portfolio companies that have sold their underlying operations. As of March 31, 2017, two debt investments bore interest at a variable rate, which represented $18.0 million of our portfolio on a fair value basis, and the remainder of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed rate investments. Overall, the portfolio had net unrealized appreciation of $20.5 million as of March 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2017, our average active portfolio company investment at amortized cost was $9.4 million, which excludes investments in the four portfolio companies that have sold their underlying operations. The weighted average yield on debt investments as of March 31, 2017 was 12.9% (excluding debt investments on non-accrual status, if any).  First quarter 2017 investment activity included the following new portfolio company investments:New Era Technology, Inc., a global provider of end-to-end IT solutions primarily to the state and local government, education, and healthcare markets. Fidus invested $12.3 million in subordinated notes and common equity. Revenue Management Solutions, LLC, a leading provider of services that match, reconcile, and facilitate the posting of healthcare payments received against submitted claims from healthcare providers, benefit managers, and billing companies. Fidus invested $12.3 million in subordinated notes and common equity. TransGo, LLC, a specialty manufacturer and designer of aftermarket automotive transmission parts and repair kits. Fidus invested $10.5 million in subordinated notes and common equity.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of March 31, 2017, Fidus had $19.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. SBA debentures outstanding were $199.3 million and unfunded SBA commitments totaled $51.0 million as of March 31, 2017. Fidus had no borrowings outstanding on its senior secured revolving credit facility as of March 31, 2017. The weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding as of March 31, 2017 was 3.9%.Subsequent EventsOn April 7, 2017, we sold our equity investment in Anatrace Products, LLC for a realized gain of $0.9 million.Second Quarter 2017 Dividend of $0.39 Per Share DeclaredOn May 1, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share for the second quarter of 2017, payable on June 23, 2017 to stockholders of record as of June 9, 2017.When declaring dividends, the Company’s Board of Directors reviews estimates of taxable income available for distribution, which differs from consolidated income under generally accepted accounting principles due to (i) changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation, (ii) temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition, and (iii) the amount of undistributed taxable income carried over from a given year for distribution in the following year. The final determination of 2017 taxable income, as well as the tax attributes for 2017 dividends, will be made after the close of the 2017 tax year.  The final tax attributes for 2017 dividends will generally include ordinary taxable income but may also include capital gains, qualified dividends and return of capital.Fidus has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) that provides for reinvestment of dividends on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, when the Company declares a cash dividend, stockholders who have not “opted out” of the DRIP at least three days prior to the dividend payment date will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s common stock. Those stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive dividends in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election.First Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference CallManagement will host a conference call to discuss the operating and financial results at 9:00am ET on Friday, May 5, 2017.  To participate in the conference call, please dial (877) 810-3368 approximately 10 minutes prior to the call.

Adjusted net investment income represents net investment income excluding any capital gains incentive fee expense or (reversal) attributable to realized and unrealized gains and losses.  The management agreement with our advisor provides that a capital gains incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to cumulative realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital gains) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized losses for such year, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid in all prior years.  In addition, we accrue, but do not pay, a capital gains incentive fee in connection with any unrealized capital appreciation, as appropriate.  As such, we believe that adjusted net investment income is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any capital gains incentive fee expense or (reversal) attributable to realized and unrealized gains and losses. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a reconciliation of net investment income to adjusted net investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.   ($ in thousands)Three months endedMarch 31,(unaudited)       2017   2016     Net investment income $ 7,859   $ 7,082     Capital gains incentive fee expense   335     92     Adjusted net investment income $ 8,194   $ 7,174                      (Per share)Three months ended March 31,(unaudited)       2017   2016     Net investment income $ 0.35   $ 0.43     Capital gains incentive fee expense   0.01     0.01     Adjusted net investment income (1) $ 0.37   $ 0.44                   (1) Adjusted net investment income per share amounts are calculated as adjusted net investment income dividend by weighted average shares outstanding for the period. Due to rounding, the sum of net investment income per share and capital gains incentive fee expense (reversal) amounts may not equal the adjusted net investment income per share amount presented here.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderTax cuts just got more likelyYahoo FinanceThe Revival of Main Street: Big Banks vs. Regional BanksInvestorPlaceZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoFast food chains are coping with their labor cost problemYahoo FinanceAPNewsBreak: Yellowstone to punish workers for misconductAssociated PressDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredTODAY'S CHARTS: Don't get blindsided by Tesla's shiny new Model 3Yahoo FinanceNorth Korea 2nd ICBM test puts much of US in range: expertsAssociated PressChinese investors paid $3b for Singapore office assetsSingapore Business ReviewWhat's the Problem with Joel Osteen?ChurchLeaders.comSponsoredMy bullish view on stocks hasn't changed one iota: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoThe government can't help people from making the single-biggest investing mistakeYahoo FinanceExclusive: Majority of Americans support transgender military service - pollBob: How about a poll that asks if tax payers should fund sex change surgery?
