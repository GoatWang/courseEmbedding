Monsignor Gets 4-Year Sentence for Large Thefts From His East Side Parish

A priest and former pillar of the Roman Catholic Church in New York experienced an extraordinary downfall yesterday as a judge sentenced him to four years in prison for stealing tens of thousands of dollars from his parish on the affluent Upper East Side.To avoid trial, the priest, Msgr. John G. Woolsey, 69, admitted to stealing more than $50,000 from parish funds at his former church, St. John the Martyr, and using it to finance a lifestyle more in keeping with that of a corporate C.E.O., including golf outings, the purchase of expensive watches and cosmetic dental work.His lawyer said he had bought or traded as many as 50 or 60 watches, and called his thieving “compulsive, repetitive and irrational” and obviously the product of a disturbed mind.But prosecutors contend that he took advantage of the good will and trust of his parishioners, including some elderly church members, to steal more than $800,000 over seven years, and that another $287,000 is inexplicably missing from church bank accounts.

“You should know that across the street in Criminal Court, people who steal cans of tuna fish wind up going to jail for 30 days or 50 days,” Justice Bruce Allen of State Supreme Court in Manhattan told Monsignor Woolsey at yesterday’s hearing. Continue reading the main story

Wearing a tie and shirtsleeves, Justice Allen stood up and leaned over his bench in a gesture of intimacy as he looked the priest in the eye, smiling slightly, and told him that he had considered the option of giving him no jail time at all, as the defense lawyer had asked.“But I’ll tell you right now I’m not going to do that,” the judge said.Justice Allen said he had been touched by the more than 140 “letters from the heart” from Monsignor Woolsey’s supporters, and in light of those, was cutting a year off the promised sentence of no more than five years. He sentenced the priest to one to four years in prison and $50,000 in restitution, in addition to $200,000 that the priest had already paid.Monsignor Woolsey is the only priest in the New York Archdiocese to have been convicted of financial crimes in at least two decades, and maybe much longer, although three have been convicted of sex offenses, Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said.Monsignor Woolsey was visibly stunned to be sentenced to jail rather than community service, and he was unable to stand up for a few minutes. His lawyer, Nicholas DeFeis, leaned over and hugged him. Then Monsignor Woolsey rose unsteadily to his feet and was placed in handcuffs by court officers.

He recovered his composure enough to turn and offer a professional  smile, of the kind a priest or psychiatrist might hone during years of counseling, to about 20 supporters in the court pews, some of whom had tears streaming down their cheeks.He is eligible for work release immediately, his lawyer said, and for probation after a year. Cardinal Edward M. Egan, the archbishop of New York, said yesterday in a statement that he prayed that the sentencing would mark “a new beginning for all who may have been hurt” by the monsignor’s actions.On Tuesday, the cardinal had submitted a measured letter to the court, saying his purpose was not to “address the underlying crimes,” but to provide an account of Monsignor Woolsey’s good works previously.

Before being sentenced, Monsignor Woolsey apologized, saying, “God willing I could turn back the clock, which I can’t do.”

He spent more time, however, discussing how it had felt to be at the center of a public scandal than expressing remorse. “I have felt the sting of comments when I was down,” he said. As a result, he said, he would be “more conscious of someone who is down.”He compared himself to Moses, invoking a scriptural story in which Moses is tired of standing and praying, and two of his followers “come along and hold each arm.”He was grateful, he said, to his supporters for sticking with him.The prosecutor, Matthew Amatruda, said Monsignor Woolsey had abused the trust of parishioners by telling them he was spending their donations on church repairs and good works, when in fact he was spending it on his lavish lifestyle.The archdiocese began investigating in 2003 when the family of an elderly parishioner, who has since died, accused him of manipulating her into giving him $490,000 in cash and stocks.Exactly how much money he stole was hotly debated for nearly an hour yesterday by the defense and prosecution lawyers. Ultimately, Justice Allen agreed to state for the record that the monsignor “allegedly” stole more than $800,000. The amount could be important, lawyers said, in determining how much time he spends in jail before being released.Monsignor Woolsey was ordained in 1965, after completing St. Joseph Seminary in Yonkers, and assigned to St. Margaret of Antioch Parish in Pearl River, N.Y. He was admired for inspirational homilies, and his sermons were often standing room only, his lawyer said.He taught at Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx in the late 1960’s, and in 1977 became assistant director of the archdiocese’s Office of Christian and Family Development.

Item Description: The Modern Library, New York, 1946. Hard Cover. Book Condition: Good. No Jacket. Lacks jacket. Spine faded, boards lightly rubbed, ink & pencil underlining in text. Article celebrating Joyce's 100th birthday laid in. xvii, 768 pp. Includes foreword by Morris L. Ernst, as well as the decision of the United States District Court rendered by Judge John M. Woolsey, which lifted the ban imposed on the book by the Tariff Act of 1930. "Ulysses is a novel by James Joyce, first serialized in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920, then published in its entirety by Sylvia Beach on February 2, 1922, in Paris. Many consider it one of the most important works of Modernist literature. Ulysses chronicles the passage of Leopold Bloom through Dublin during an ordinary day, June 16, 1904. The title parallels and alludes to Odysseus (Latinised into Ulysses), the hero of Homer's Odyssey (e.g., the correspondences between Leopold Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus). Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate June 16 as Bloomsday. Ulysses totals about 265,000 words from a vocabulary of 30,030 words (including proper names, plurals and various verb tenses), divided into 18 'episodes'. Since publication, the book attracted controversy and scrutiny, ranging from early obscenity trials to protracted textual 'Joyce Wars.' Ulysses' stream-of-consciousness technique, careful structuring, and experimental prose -- full of puns, parodies, and allusions -- as well as its rich characterisations and broad humour, made the book a highly regarded novel in the Modernist pantheon. In 1999, the Modern Library ranked Ulysses first on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century."Keywords: CLASSICS LITERATURE LITERARY ULYSSES GREEK MYTHOLOGY MYTHOLOGICAL FIGURE CHARACTER JAMES JOYCE BRITISH AUTHOR WRITER NOVELIST JUDGE JOHN M.
