Company Information
       In 1885, Ashbel Merrel Leonard started a nursery as a hobby in his backyard in Piqua, Ohio. By 1912 he and his sons Parker and Stanley established A.M. Leonard & Sons as a nursery/landscaping service. The business was further developed in 1928 when A. M. and his youngest son John started a wholesale horticultural tool and supply company serving nursery and landscape customers. In 1941, following the death of A. M. Leonard, John became the President of the company. John’s forte was customer service. He mailed out 7,500 pocket-sized catalogs per year and monitored the purchases of each customer. John kept impeccable notes. When an order was not received from a customer within a year, John would contact the customer personally to ask how his organization might be of better service. The call usually resulted in a sale. Since only the finest quality tools were offered, customers always knew that when they bought something from the Piqua based company, they would receive the highest quality.         Howard Kyle became a partner with John Leonard in February 1964. Like the Leonard’s, Howard had a strong background in the nursery and mail order businesses. His family owned Springhill Nursery in Tipp City, Ohio. Howard quickly learned the A. M. Leonard operation. Ill health caused John Leonard to retire early, and Howard took over as sole owner inheriting a staff of 8. Howard and the staff expanded the catalog and merchandising operations emphasizing customer service, product dependability, and fast order response serving growers, landscapers, foresters, arborists, contractors, golf courses, resorts, grounds management and gardeners. In 1979 continuous growth caused the company to move again to a 20,000 square foot facility with 15 employees. Fourteen years later, in November of 1993, the company made a major commitment to its customers and the community by constructing a new 50,000 square foot facility.
 
In 1996, A.M. Leonard produced its first Retail Catalog to reach the serious home gardener. In 2005, as this segment of the business continued to grow, A.M. Leonard re-introduced the Retail publication as A.M. Leonard’s Gardeners Edge, offering gardeners the quality and selection they couldn’t find locally.
 
In 1999, A.M. Leonard introduced an industry exclusive Corporate Account Program. This service provides their professional customers with a dedicated Account Manager (single point of contact) who is truly devoted to learning and understanding their business and is invested in their continued success. Their goal will always be to meet or exceed your needs and expectations. 
 
Also in 1999, A.M. Leonard introduced its line of A.M. Leonard Brand Tools. The A.M. Leonard line of tools offers the quality and features that most manufacturers aren’t willing to make –– all at a price that saves money and helps produce results you can stand behind.
 
The Internet has added another exciting dimension to the daily business activity at A.M. Leonard as their presence there continues to grow with two company web sites and sales through Amazon.com.
 
A.M. Leonard keeps in close touch with local customers through their Counter Sales in the company Showroom. Here professionals and homeowners enjoy picking up their product on the spot and getting right back to the job.
In May 2005 Howard Kyle passed away at the age of 94 while still working six days a week. Today, under the leadership of Gregory Stephens, grandson of Howard Kyle, A.M. Leonard’s state-of-the-art Distribution facility has expanded to over 100,000 square feet with more than 100 dedicated employees. A. M. Leonard, Inc. continues today as a leader in the horticultural tool and supply business with emphasis on doing business the “old fashioned way”. They offer quality products, superior customer service and a selection of over 7,000 items.
A.M. Leonard understands customers have a choice on where to shop and pledges to continue its tradition of exceptional products and service.

Stage Stores Credit Card


                                            I was charged fees then late fees then fees. So $28.22 balance appeared out of thin air without any purchase. I moved while opening the credit card account so I did not receive statements on time (or maybe they did not send it to me). Called and got $17 back. As for the rest, I...show more

Walmart® Credit Card


                                            My husband called a customer service dealing with our balance. We've had this card for over 4 years and have only missed one payment. And have not used this card in over 2 years. This is our debt, and we do without some things to make sure it gets paid here lately. He told...show more

AAA Insurance


                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent. She had me send my claim to the Walnut Creek, California office. When I contacted the adjuster IN OKLAHOMA CITY, he said...show more

                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees. I purchased 1400 dollars worth of stuff, and believing I had 12 months to pay off, I didn't worry about it for the first two months. The next time I looked they had hit me with 100$...show more

Personal Statement
Everything that we do at our center, whether clinical care, research or education, is focused on helping patients.
Here are some of the many reasons why patients tell us they come here - whether from the New York area, the surrounding region, or traveling from all over the country and other parts of the world in order to receive evaluation and treatment for lymphoma by our group:
Please also scroll down below in order to view a video which describes our team and the experiences of some of our patients:
We are not a "factory" or a "machine", moving patients through as if they are boxes in a warehouse. Instead we provide personalized and compassionate care that is state of the art.  We take the time to get to know our patients, and partner with them to devise the best available evaluation and treatment program.  While we are well aware of "guidelines", "treatment algorithms", and "institutional programs and regimens", we focus on what is best for the individual patient rather than a cookbook.
Patients seek treatment here because they are referred here by their physicians, who recognize our expertise and know that across the region and the country we are a "go to" place to seek the best lymphoma care.  Our physicians are internationally recognized for clinical skill, research, and personal qualities.  In fact, we care for a substantial number of individual physicians (or their family members) who are themselves dealing with lymphoma.  
Cancer patients don't always (or unfortunately won't always) just have cancer - they have multiple other complex medical problems that may be active concurrently with or exacerbated by cancer treatment.  Weill Cornell Medical College physicians are among the best across all medical specialties, not just cancer.  New York Presbyterian Hospital is one of the top hospitals in the nation.  This can be particularly valuable in patients dealing with issues such as cardiology, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, neurology, endocrinology, lung and kidney issues.  Patients do not want to have to be sent to another hospital or center should their other medical issues become a problem in the midst of cancer treatment.  They want access to the best specialists if needed, all in one place, in a coordinated fashion.  
Our center provides access to the full array of resources needed for "comprehensive" cancer care.  This includes nutrition, psychosocial support, complementary medicine, rehabilitation, pain management, and other areas.  We have developed an outstanding team of physicians (including medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, and others), nurses, physician assistants and related health care personnel in order to optimally serve patients with these disorders.  Our patients recognize the value of this support.
The hematopathology group (responsible for diagnosing and evaluating biopsies of lymphomas and other blood cancers) is among the best and largest of any academic medical center.  They are widely recognized for their diagnostic and research expertise, and in fact have a significant role in educating other hematopathology specialists.
Weill Cornell Medical College has an outstanding electronic medical record, which facilitates communication among caregivers and also makes information directly available to patients via Weill Cornell Connect.
We are available to our patients.  They appreciate countless late night phone calls and frequent interactions by email when we are needed.
Physicians in our group are tightly connected with and collaborate with lymphoma-related non-profit organizations such as the Lymphoma Research Foundation and Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.  Several have leadership roles with these groups.  They know our team very well.
Our program and our physicians are internationally recognized for efforts to enable patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and related disorders to have the best possible clinical outcome. We have helped to establish standards of care practiced across the US.  Our group has played a role in development of nearly every drug that has been FDA approved for lymphoma therapy in the last decade. Through clinical trials, many of our patients were among the first in the world to receive them.  We are leaders of the Lymphoma Committee of National Cancer Institute-supported Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology within the NCI's National Clinical Trials Network.  In this capacity, and through the NCI Lymphoma Steering Committee, we lead NCI sponsored trials being conducted at major medical centers across the US that will establish the next generation of therapies.  
We also interact with other leading lymphoma centers across the world - their physicians know us well, mutually share advice and opinions, and appreciate our expertise and collaboration.  Pharmaceutical companies who need help in developing new agents for lymphoma also regularly seek our counsel and participation.
Many patients come here from initial diagnosis because they recognize that we are the place to be for their entire lymphoma journey.  Others come for a second opinion, and return to a local physician - we are happy to provide this service and to remain available for input whenever needed.  Unfortunately, some patients come here because they have few effective treatment possibilities left due to the nature of their disease.  We are committed to making every effort to meet the needs of each patient that turns to us, and in many cases we have new ideas and strategies that can make a significant difference.
Our laboratory collaborators at Weill Cornell include many of the leading lymphoma and cancer researchers in the world.  We are recognized for our translational studies in areas such as immunotherapy, cell cycle inhibitors, tumor profiling, PI3 kinase inhibition, epigenetic therapy, tumor suppressors, and other areas that are at the forefront of lymphoma research.
While a major part of our efforts are focused on trying to bring new and "cutting edge" treatments to patients, we recognize that many patients are not interested in or appropriate for participation in clinical trials.  Our patients recognize and appreciate that we are committed to providing information on all of the options (both standard and new), and partnering with patients and families in order to develop a treatment approach that fits every individual situation.
Lymphomas as a group are a complex set of disorders. While many patients are treated here as their primary oncologist, others come for a second opinion while having their primary oncologic care with a local physician, having us follow along as needed. Others are referred (or otherwise seek care) for access to novel agents as part of clinical trials. We are pleased to provide care in any fashion that would be of assistance to patients, in order to help them achieve the best possible therapeutic results. Patients or physicians with any questions about our lymphoma programs, clinical trials, or related issues should feel free to contact us for more information.
You can feel free to follow me on Twitter @JohnPLeonardMD regarding new developments in lymphoma, activities of our program, and other topics and comments from me and colleagues in the field.
Please view this video which describes our team and the experiences of some of our patients:
