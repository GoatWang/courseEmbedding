For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

The board appointed William "Bill" Fontenot, Cleco's chief operating officer, interim CEO of Cleco Power. During Fontenot's 30 years of Cleco service, he managed the development and restructuring efforts of generation projects valued at over $900 million, as well as led the development and construction of a $1 billion power plant.  In the last five years, he has been responsible for operating the company's generation, transmission and distribution assets.
Both appointments are effective immediately.
