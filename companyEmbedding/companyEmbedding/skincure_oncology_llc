Oncology Skin Care






Cancer Aware SkincareRecognizing & Working Safely Within a Framework of Clinical ConsiderationI am an Oncology Trained Aesthetician through the Institute of Integrative Oncology. My primary objective in providing skin care treatments for Oncology clients in active treatment or recent recovery is, to soothe sensitivity, replenish hydration, strengthen barrier function and to protect.  I am well trained in the ability to work with an implanted port, Neuropathy, Lymphedema, and Compromised Lymph nodes. Keeping the skin as hydrated as possible during cancer treatment is of the utmost importance. To also keep the skin feeling good, and to prevent cracking and chapping, which can lead to infection. Risk of infection is higher due to the suppressed immune system from the anti-cancer therapies.  Additionally, many studies show that the power of touch, such as through a facial or massage, can help reduce pain, improve mood, and reduce fatigue in cancer patients. Rest assured I go by The Tracy Walton Pressure Scale, therefore anyone in active treatment or recently completed treatment can still receive massage by means of Stationary Weightless or Still Touch. Often times a recipient of a facial or massage can go home and report flu-like symptoms in the days following the skin care or body work session, it may be an indication that the therapist used too much pressure, an overly vigorous pace, or products, practices and methods that were too demanding. *Note* Flu-like symptoms can also be a side effect of the anti cancer therapies. Not all Aestheticians have the proper training on how to work with a client who is in active treatment or who has recently completed treatment. Make sure when you go to make your next appointment with an Aesthetician go to a provider who has been trained from a reputable educator in Oncology Aesthetics. Check out these websites for more information.  www.iioncology.org, www.greettheday.org, www.oti-oncologytraining.com.In my practice, I use Osmosis, a skincare line that has vast array of products specifically designed for people who are in treatment or who have just completed treatment.  You want to be very careful about which products you do use, just because they’re organic, unscented, all natural or dermatologist tested doesn’t guarantee the product is anymore safe or effective. Using a specifically designed product that is oncology friendly is the safest way to go.  I have a true passion for helping those with skin concerns affected by cancer or who are immune suppressed.  I realize that most days you are being poked and prodded, left feeling depleted. I have created a space to wrap you up in a cocoon of pure bliss. Letting go of any worry and relaxing with the confidence that I have the knowledge to properly provide you with a healthful, safe and blissful treatment.

OUR EXPERTISE IN CYBER SKIN CANCER TREATMENT IS NOW YOURS
The scalpel-free approach for treating skin cancer – “Cure without Cutting”








The first nationally focused company to develop AND support a network of dermatology-based, SRT skin cancer treatment practices
SkinCure Oncology helps practices capitalize on new technology to treat the ever-increasing incidence of skin cancer, which is expanding with the aging U.S. population. The company was created in 2016 by the founders of Accelitech and Dermatologist/Mohs surgeon Dr. Daniel J. Ladd. Until recently the primary intervention for non-melanoma skin cancer treatment centered on surgical interventions, with Mohs micrographic surgery existing as the “gold standard.” However, a new non-surgical alternative now exists, and the numbers of Mohs surgeons are limited. The goal for SkinCure Oncology is to provide better access to this new non-surgical alternative for certain patients, including those with co-morbid conditions of blood thinner maintenance and diabetic concerns. Traditional therapies are not workable for these types of patients. Upon researching the problem, Accelitech and Dr. Ladd realized that there exists a genuine need for non-surgical alternatives and better access to care.








Mission




Implement and expand proven treatment protocols developed in the radiotherapy arena in Dermatology offices
Educate and involve Dermatologists (the real skin cancer experts) in the use of SRT as an alternative to traditional surgical interventions for their patients
Use the most recent advances in computerized image-guided radiotherapy for non-melanoma skin cancers
Be known as the leader in SRT skin cancer solutions
