Summa Equity – Creating future-proof superior returns


































Summa Equity
Creating future-proof superior returns







 About Summa Equity
Summa Equity was founded in 2016 by an experienced group of people that have a long track record from investing in successful companies. The group was brought together by a shared view of the world and the economy, and a passion for developing companies that can outperform through providing products and services needed to meet the increasing demands and complexities our societies face.
We are thematically oriented investors with extensive experience from the markets that we focus on. We target proven companies where we see a significant potential to achieve strong growth through investments in technology, development of the organisation, new products and services, consolidation, or through internationalisation of the business. We focus on companies with strong niche positions operating in sectors that benefit from strong underlying megatrends. We are active in assisting our companies in creating strong financial value, whilst acting responsibly and contributing to a broader set of stakeholders.
Our team aims to be transparent and develop trust-based relationships, are passionate about continuous improvement and seek to disrupt, challenge and innovate, as well as strive to be fun and inspiring to work with. We care not only for our colleagues and portfolio companies, but also for our business partners, the environment, and for the communities we are a part of.
Investment focus




Growth in western economies has been, and is expected to continue to be, weak. Yet we are experiencing strong increase in asset prices due to financial stimuli by central banks and from rising debt levels. At the same time, we face disruption occurring due to technology change, climate change and demographic shifts.
Even in such a volatile and low growth environment there are attractive “pockets of growth” which are more resilient and supported by strong megatrends, such as global population growth, resource scarcity, aging demographics, movement of people, energy efficiency and technology disruption. Summa Equity’s investment strategy is therefore focused around specific sectors that are experiencing tailwind growth due to these megatrends.
Summa Equity’s main focus is investing in growing companies with significant business relations in the Nordic region that require equity investments from Summa Equity of EUR 10-50 million and whereby we can get significant governance rights. We prefer companies where we can partner with existing founders and management to assist in accelerating growth through add-on acquisitions, internationalisation, technology development or organisational enhancements.

Energy efficiency 
Changing demographics 
Technology-enabled businesses 


Resource scarcity
The global population is expected to reach around 10 billion people in 2050. This fact, coupled with a trend of rising living standards in a large part of the world is causing scarcity of certain resources and rising prices for a broad range of commodities and products. These trends create attractive business opportunities in sectors such as waste and recycling, aquaculture/salmon farming, urban farming and agricultural improvements, in technologies and services that increase asset utilisation and their life time, in water treatment, in biomaterials, as well as in circular economy business models.

Energy efficiency

Technology-enabled businesses 
Back to Investment focus 


Energy efficiency
Concerns around energy security and climate change is driving both consumer behavior and regulatory and political decision making, such as the Paris Agreement. Innovation and big data are also enabling improved energy efficiency. There are attractive opportunities for businesses that facilitate improvements in energy consumption and/or production, that lower costs in energy production and delivery, insulate against weather volatility, or that curb carbon emissions.

Resource scarcity 
Changing demographics 
Technology-enabled businesses 
Back to Investment focus 


Changing demographics
The global population is ageing, life expectancies increasing, and we are facing higher costs of elderly care and a decreasing working population relative to the total population to support this. Simultaneously, we experience continuing urbanisation as well as a rise in the movement of people across countries. These trends will impact our society and economies in significant ways, and there will be growth in companies catering to these changes. Health related products and services will be in high demand, there will be an increasing need for education, training and re-education, and business models that enable improved quality and productivity or lower the cost for products and services in these markets are likely to flourish.

Technology-enabled businesses
The trends towards digitalisation, big data and “internet of things” will continue to disrupt businesses at an increasingly rapid pace. Every industry will be affected in the coming years, and no company can be complacent about these trends. At the heart of these trends lie not only business risks, but also business opportunities. Companies with a willingness to invest to be part of, or even stay in the forefront of, the new paradigm will be positioned to prosper while others will be at risk of extinction. Companies that enable more ubiquitous access to information, products and services, knowledge sharing, or that lower the cost in interactions and transactions, are likely to see strong growth going forward.

Meet the Rising Stars of Private Equity 2017
FN’s powerlists have just got more competitive and this year’s list of private equity talent reflects the continued diversification by firms. To up the ante and ensure only the best and brightest candidates made the cut, we selected 25 young executives – rather than 40 – to be crowned Private Equity Rising Stars

 Yann Bak, managing director, Ardian (37)

Paris-based Bak has earned the reputation as a skilled deal originator and fundraiser for Dominique Senequier-led Ardian. Bak, who joined the private equity firm in 2003 and oversees all its investments in France and sources investment opportunities in Belgium and Switzerland, was rewarded with promotion to managing director last year.

As well as working on Ardian’s sixth-generation mid-cap buyout fund helping it secure €4.5bn in just four months, he spent much of last year overseeing portfolio companies. These include calibration services firm Trescal – which continued its acquisition spree into 2017 - and insurance broker SIACI Saint Honoré, where he is on the supervisory board. Bak is also general secretary of the Ardian Foundation, which helps students from modest backgrounds achieve their potential.

Greg Ciesielski, principal, HarbourVest (34)

Ciesielski has excelled managing complex transactions since rejoining HarbourVest’s London team in 2013 after taking time out for an MBA in 2011. In October 2016, he guided HarbourVest through its £807m acquisition of SVG Capital's investment portfolio following a month-long bidding war in what was one of the second-hand fund stakes market’s thorniest deals.

The tricky negotiations became tougher with the arrival of two rival bidders for the SVG portfolio — as well as Ciesielski's first child at a fraught moment. David Atterbury, a managing director at HarbourVest who has worked with Ciesielski on fund restructurings involving Motion Equity Partners, Portobello and Mandarin Partners, praised his “unflappable” attitude. Ciesielski first joined HarbourVest as an associate in Boston in 2007.

Jonathan Crane, director, 3i (39)

Dedicated dealmaker Crane has had an impressive 18 months. In March 2017, he led 3i’s sale of MKM Building Supplies to Bain Capital, generating a six-times return on investment. He was also key to the sale of technology testing company Element achieving a 3.9 times return in December 2015 – Element was his first acquisition for 3i having joined from Bain in 2010.

Crane is a European mid-market specialist and is head of 3i’s UK industrials team. He also sits on the board of Element, Aspen and MKM. Cambridge graduate Crane is a guitarist and is learning to play the piano. He acts as a trustee of London-based youth charity Caius House.

Stephen Dalton, director, leveraged finance, middle-market financial sponsors, HSBC (37)

As a director in HSBC’s mid-market leveraged finance team, Dalton is one of the group’s most prolific dealmakers providing acquisition debt to private equity companies, and has seen an average of one transaction a month through to completion. Described as “extremely entrepreneurial” and “highly visible in the market” by one adviser to private equity firms, Dalton joined HSBC in 2013 from Lloyds Banking Group, where he also worked in leveraged finance.

In the past 12 months, he has worked on the lending behind Bridgepoint’s refinancing of Azzurri Group, which owns the ASK Italian and Zizzi restaurant chains; on the financing for New York-based Aquiline Capital Partners to buy UK online insurer Simply Business; and on deals with Lloyds Banking Group's private equity arm LDC, turnaround investor Rutland Partners and UK mid-market house Dunedin. Recognised as having a “strong book of business”, Dalton – who dreamed of playing centre forward for Manchester City Football Club –  says his primary objective is to make sure private equity firms keep coming back.

Joel Davidkin, director, Nordic Capital (32)

Helsinki-based healthcare specialist Davidkin worked on two of Nordic Capital’s flagship deals and was promoted to director in 2016. He helped prepare the London listing of ConvaTec, a clinical products business that was valued at £4.4bn. It was both the largest ever European healthcare initial public offering and the biggest medical technology IPO globally for a decade.

Davidkin also worked on the £3.51bn merger of European credit service providers Lindorff and Stockholm-listed Intrum Justitia, announced in December and now pending regulatory approval. Senior colleagues credit Davidkin - a keen sailor and reader of military history - with skills and maturity well beyond his years in the market. The former Goldman Sachs investment banker joined Nordic Capital in 2012.

Stefan Dziarski, principal, Permira (37)

A star of Permira’s German tech team, Dziarski is one of the most active private equity investors in the country’s technology market. Last year he worked on two key acquisitions: buying omnichannel fashion retailer Schustermann & Borenstein from Ardian, and German HR software firm P&I from HgCapital.

Dziarski is on the board of P&I and TeamViewer, the software firm bought in 2014. He cut his teeth on Permira’s renowned investment in ProSiebenSat.1, the media firm it transformed into a digital player. Dziarski was on the board and closely involved throughout the deal’s seven-year history. A keen snowboarder and mountain biker, he cites Jörg Rockenhäuser, head of Permira’s Frankfurt office as his mentor.

Philip Edmans, investment director, Inflexion (33)

Edmans, who became investment director in 2015, had a busy 2016 working on four new investments and managing two fundraisings. The 33-year-old also achieved “a personal turning point” last year, running a deal for the first time. He led Inflexion’s £41m investment in financial consultancy Lane Clark & Peacock, on whose board he also sits. The deal was unusual in that private equity investments in partnership structures are rare.

Edmans also worked on Inflexion investments in agricultural data provider Kynetec in May; corporate travel firm Reed & Mackay in August; and advertising video workflow provider Group IMD in September. In a break from dealmaking, he helped raise £250m each for Inflexion’s Enterprise Fund IV, a lower mid-market fund, and its Supplemental Fund IV. Praised by colleagues for his “great track record and solid relationships”, Edmans – who has volunteered for the Clinton Foundation in Kenya working with governments and NGOs to reduce malaria treatment costs - joined Inflexion from corporate finance firm Gleacher Shacklock in 2010.

Neil Fleming, senior principal, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (34)

A karate black-belt and hockey fan, Fleming has risen rapidly at Ontario Teachers, one of the largest private equity investors in the world. Having joined the Canadian pension fund in Toronto as an intern straight from university in 2005, Fleming became its youngest portfolio manager aged 30 in 2013. Two years later, he was asked to move to London to help establish the fund’s infrastructure investing arm in Europe, and was named senior principal.

In early 2017, Fleming led an unusual deal involving Ontario Teachers setting up a new company - instead of investing in an existing one - with co-investors Borealis Infrastructure and UK energy firm SSE. He describes that deal to create MapleCo - an energy smart meter supplier that in March started installing 2.7 million meters in the UK – as a career highlight. In late 2015, Fleming managed the acquisition of a €1.5bn stake in Dutch storage company Koole Terminals from EQT, and in 2016 led on the construction of Koole’s supervisory board. He also sits on boards of Birmingham Airport and Scotia Gas Networks.

Federica Gironi, principal, KKR Capital Markets (35)

At just 35 years old, Gironi is responsible for arranging financings across all KKR’s European debt and equity funds and leads on every infrastructure transaction handled by the capital markets team. In 2016, she closed six deals, including the acquisition financing for UK smart-metering business Calvin Capital and the construction financing to allow Deutsche Glasfaser’s roll-out of fibre optic to rural Germany.

Gironi joined KKR in 2013 – the year she structured Serbia’s first high-yield bond issue – from Citigroup’s leveraged finance team, reporting directly to KKR Capital Markets’ head of debt, John Empson. Gironi is also a mentor for ThinkForward, which helps young people progress their careers.

Rohan Haldea, partner, Apax Partners (39)

One of private equity giant Apax’s star dealmakers, praised by senior colleagues, rivals and clients, the head of technology services investments globally and telecoms in Europe is behind many of the firm’s top-performing deals this year. In January, Apax sold of half its 96% stake in California-based R&D services provider GlobalLogic to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, valuing GlobalLogic at $1.5bn. The deal marked an estimated three-times return on Apax’s original investment, which Haldea led in 2013.

A planned initial public offering of IT services business Evry – one of Haldea’s acquisitions – is seeking a valuation of $1.8bn, more than four times what Apax paid in 2015. Haldea, who is an avid investor in the UK venture and tech market, includes among his mentors Apax co-chief executive Andrew Sillitoe. In 2015, Haldea – who enjoys reading history, golf and travelling – became co-chief executive of charity Apax Foundation, and he is also involved with Udayaan, a children’s adoption home in India.

Alex Humphreys, principal, Apollo Global Management Europe (35)

Instrumental in establishing private equity giant Apollo’s foothold in the insurance and industrials sectors since joining from Goldman Sachs in 2008, Humphreys sits on the board of three insurance companies – Catalina Holdings, Tranquilidade and Amissima – and has invested $1.25bn of equity capital in the sector across five transactions. He also worked on Apollo’s $2bn acquisition of Royal Philips’ global lighting business Lumileds in 2016, and led a €2bn capital raising for Ager, a new European run-off insurance consolidator managed by Apollo.

Humphreys, who has impressed senior managers with his strategic vision and leadership skills, credits Jonathan Sorrell, his first boss at Goldman and now president of Man Group, for his work ethic. The former New York film school student, who is married to a human rights barrister, joined Goldman in 2005. Apollo manages around $197bn of assets globally.

Natacha Jamar, principal, corporate private equity group, Blackstone (29)

Yet to celebrate her 30th birthday, Jamar already has several landmark investments under her belt since joining Blackstone in London straight from university in 2009. In 2016, she was promoted to principal from associate and became a director of Armacell, the insulation products maker that Blackstone bought for $1bn at the end of 2015. Part of a five-strong team focusing on building materials, retail and consumers, Jamar’s other deals include working on Blackstone’s investments in home shopping channel ISD in 2015 and in Milan-based fashion house Versace in 2014.

Born in the US, to a Canadian mother and Belgian father, Jamar graduated cum laude from Princeton with an AB degree in economics. She names London senior managing director Robert Ramsauer, and managing directors Juergen Pinker and Tania Daguere Lindbäck, among her mentors, and says a lack of senior female mentors in the private equity industry is “really tough” for younger women. As well as running – she conquered the 2016 Seville marathon in under three hours – Jamar relaxes by playing Settlers of Catan, a strategic boardgame.

Melis Kahya, vice-president, General Atlantic (34)

Kahya was set on a career in academia but hasn’t looked back since Yale University friends convinced her to apply for a JP Morgan internship in 2004. After two years as an analyst and six years at US private equity firm TSG Consumer Partners, in February 2016 she joined General Atlantic, relocating from New York to London to build and run its retail and consumer operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Kahya led General Atlantic’s investment in Scandinavian healthy juice bar chain Joe & the Juice, worked on its US expansion plans and sits on the board. Electrical engineering and economics graduate Kahya has an MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business. Her charitable work includes helping organisations dedicated to empowering and educating women and girls.

Jenny Keisu, partner, Summa Equity (32)

A lawyer by training, Keisu is one of five founding partners of Summa Equity, a Nordic firm set up last year to invest in companies with strong environmental, social and governance credentials. As chief operating officer, Keisu takes the lead on fundraising and oversaw the closing in February 2017 of Summa’s debut fund at Skr4.5bn ($500m), exceeding its Skr3.3bn target.

She was also involved in buying Summa’s first portfolio companies: eGain, a technology provider of remote controlled heating, and building waste recycling firm Sortera. Keisu, whose childhood ambition was to become a professional football player, studied law at Uppsala University and, following a stint at law firm Mannheimer Swartling, joined private equity firm Nordic Capital as general counsel in 2012.

Andreas Kumeth, principal, PAI Partners (33)

Munich-based healthcare sector specialist Kumeth joined European buyout house PAI as a director in 2014 from Apax Partners, and three years later was promoted to principal, gaining increased responsibilities in northern European healthcare.

As part of PAI’s German team, keen tennis player Kumeth also worked on PAI’s €2.2bn sale of German construction materials business Xella Group, alongside Goldman Sachs, to US private equity firm Lone Star achieving a two times return in December 2016, and the €790m acquisition of French budget hotel chain B&B Hotels from private equity firm Carlyle Group and Montefiore Investment in March 2016. Kumeth started out at Dutch firm Waterland Private Equity Investments in 2009 before joining Apax in 2011.

Avital Lobel, partner and head of principal investments, Grovepoint Capital (36)

Lobel left Investec in 2010 to be part of a four-strong team that launched Grovepoint, the investment and credit specialist co-founded by Bradley Fried, former chief executive of Investec Bank, and Leon Blitz, who previously headed Investec’s direct investments and growth and acquisition finance businesses. By 2016, Lobel was a partner and head of Grovepoint’s principal investments business.

In January this year he led the £72m exit of Grenade, the sports nutrition investment he had sourced three years earlier, to private equity firm Lion Capital. Grenade’s revenues grew five-fold from 2014 to 2017. He also led the acquisition of infrastructure support firm EnServe from Cinven for an undisclosed amount, and worked on the deal to buy cash machine operator Payzone from Duke Street for £35m in 2016. Born in Israel, Lobel and his family moved to Zimbabwe when he was seven. He says he always wanted to be in business, starting early by selling sandwiches to fellow pupils.

Fabio Longo, managing director, Bain Capital Credit (37)

Distressed debt rising star Longo joined Bain Capital Credit from Apollo in 2013 to set up its non-performing loans business, which since launch has invested more than €1.2bn across 13 transactions. The deals equate to more than €4bn in assets under management. Longo, and his team of 15, most recently worked on the acquisition of an Italian-regulated real estate leasing business – that manages repossessed assets and performing and non-performing contracts – and the acquisition of Bain’s seventh portfolio of hotel and real estate developer loans in Spain.

The former Goldman Sachs analyst, who trained as a chemical engineer at Cambridge and MIT, has ambitious plans for his team to target European banks’ €1trn of non-performing loans.

Paul Owsianowski, partner, C5 Capital (30)

Owsianowski swapped a career in investment banking for cybersecurity investing when he left advisory firm Evercore in late 2013 to join the launch team of technology investment boutique C5 - which raised £100m in 2014. Last year, at just 29, he was made a partner.

Owsianowski counts C5 founder André Pienaar and chief investment officer Daniel Freeman among his mentors. He also works closely with C5’s strategic partners, including Iain Lobban, former director of GCHQ, and Graeme Lamb, former director of UK Special Forces. In 2016, Owsianowski played a key role investing in Hungarian IT security firm Balabit and Copenhagen-based digital business Omada. He leads C5’s relationship with UK magnetic detection technology provider Metrasens. Keen hiker Owsianowski is based in London but also counts Berlin as home.

Daniel Pindur, senior managing director, CVC Capital Partners (39)

Described as “a black-belt private equity professional” by Alex Dibelius, CVC’s influential managing partner and head of Germany, Pindur is one of the buyout giant’s top dealmakers in Germany. His recent deals include working on the acquisition of a majority stake in sports betting and casino games company Tipico in 2016, and the sale of CVC’s remaining 25% stake in Swiss telecoms provider Sunrise Communications Group, which raised $2.2bn debuting on the Swiss stock exchange in 2015.

The former Goldman Sachs mergers and acquisitions banker joined CVC in 2005, climbing the ranks to senior managing director by 2015. Pindur is an enthusiastic windsurfer, and says the best piece of advice he’s ever received was to “listen”.

Imogen Richards, principal and global head of investment structuring and strategy, Pantheon Ventures (36)

Lauded for her leadership skills, Richards’ remit at London-based private equity firm Pantheon expanded significantly in 2016 when she was named global head of investment structuring and strategy and asked by Pantheon’s managing partner Paul Ward to lead two departments. In August, she created the investment structuring team, which closes all of the firm’s investment transactions, working on 30 deals at any one time. It completed $750 million of transactions in its first quarter – roughly a quarter into private equity funds. In November, she also assumed responsibility for Pantheon’s portfolio strategy team, which oversees about 50 client portfolios at any point.

Richards, who has a master’s in natural sciences from Cambridge University, joined Pantheon as an analyst in 2005 from Anglo Irish Bank. She spent eight years in the global secondaries team, and three years project managing new initiatives, including a performance-based fee structure for defined contribution pension schemes, which launched in February. Richards, who made principal in 2014, was an early mentee at Level 20, a not-for-profit body seeking to increase women’s representation in private equity. She describes herself as a “maker”, recently completing a 10,000-piece marble mosaic floor with a nautical theme for a house in Mallorca.

Stephen Roberts, investment director, ECI Partners (33)

Roberts’ private equity career only began two years ago after joining UK mid-market firm ECI as a secondee from PwC. By January 2017 he was promoted to investment director based in Manchester, with a remit also covering Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle and Scotland. During his nine years at PwC he spent five in corporate finance covering a range of M&A deals, including the sale of employment law and health and safety consultancy Citation to ECI in 2012.

In 2016, he played a key role in the origination and execution of ECI’s investment in corporate music provider Imagesound. He now holds board observer positions with portfolio companies Imagesound, Evans Cycles and Great Rail Journeys. He is an Everton Football Club season-ticket holder and keen cyclist.

Ella Stapelfeldt, vice-president, co-investments, AlpInvest Partners (32)

Stapelfeldt joined Dutch private equity investor AlpInvest in 2015 from First Reserve as a senior associate in the co-investment team, rising quickly to vice-president in January 2017. Now responsible for sourcing, executing and monitoring co-investment deals (those originated by private equity firms) in consumer retail, healthcare and information technology in Europe, she has looked at more than 20 deals in the last 18 months, and closed five.

AlpInvest’s co-investment team has €5.6bn of assets under management, and this year Amsterdam-based Stapelfeldt also gained responsibility for coverage of the German-speaking region of Europe and France. Stapelfeldt, who enjoys running, horse riding and yoga, started out as an analyst at Merrill Lynch in 2009.

Nico Taverna, executive director and head of secondaries programme, Adveq (34)

When keen golfer and cross-country marathon skier Taverna joined Adveq in 2012, the Swiss private equity firm had little presence in the secondaries market – buying and selling of stakes in private equity funds. Taverna, formerly of Partners Group, quickly rose through the ranks, driving the expansion of Adveq’s secondaries programme. In 2014, he was named head of the unit, which manages almost $1bn of assets, becoming executive director in 2016 overseeing a team of four.

In the past 18 months, Zurich-based Taverna has led deals worth $350m and is fundraising for a third dedicated secondaries fund. In April 2017, Adveq, which manages $7bn, announced it was being bought by Schroders, the UK’s biggest listed fund manager.
          
…










Joris Van Gool, principal, HgCapital (30)

Belgian-born Van Gool has closed seven deals and two exits for HgCapital despite being only 30 years old. His hardworking approach was rewarded in 2016 with the promotion to principal, having joined the UK mid-market buyout firm from McKinsey & Company in 2012. Focusing on the Benelux region and business and financial services, Van Gool played a key role on HgCapital’s £750m sale of vehicle leasing business Zenith to private equity firm Bridgepoint, which achieved an investment multiple of 2.9 and a 46% gross internal rate of return.

Van Gool already stands out as one of HgCapital's most humble, smart and diligent dealmakers, according to a senior executive at a rival European firm. A keen runner and cyclist who speaks Dutch, English, French and German, Van Gool holds a Master’s degree in commercial engineering from the University of Leuven and an MBA with distinction from Harvard Business School.

Julian Woollard, assistant director, Advent International (35)

Woollard hung up his gloves as a brain surgeon in 2010 to pursue his interest in finance, joining consultancy Bain & Co on industrials and healthcare corporate strategy. He worked weekends as a locum neurologist until kick-starting his private equity career at industry giant Advent in 2013. After just two years Woollard was promoted to assistant director within Advent’s healthcare team led in Europe by Tom Allen.

He has since impressed colleagues and advisers with his “great interpersonal skills” on key deals. These include last year’s £1.5bn sale of healthcare specialist Priory Group to Acadia - which netted Advent a reported £500m profit on its 2011 investment, and Advent’s purchase of inVentiv Health, valued at £3.8bn. InVentiv is now preparing to merge with INC Research Holdings in the US.

Portfolio Characteristics 

 
Portfolio Characteristics 



P/B Ratio
The price to book (P/B) value ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. The book value of a company is a measure of how much a company&#39;s assets are worth assuming the company&#39;s debts are paid off. Negative book values are excluded from this calculation and holding price to book ratios over 25 are set to 25.

as of 30-Jun-2017



2.07




P/E Ratio - Forward
The forward price-to-earnings ratio is used to assess a company’s valuation. To compute this ratio, the latest closing price is divided by the company’s consensus mean EPS estimate for the next unreported fiscal year. The ratio represents a weighted harmonic mean of the forward price-to-earnings ratios of its holdings with negative values being excluded from the calculation.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary.  Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.  International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.  The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.  Morningstar Analyst Rating™is not a credit or risk rating. It is a subjective evaluation performed by Morningstar’s manager research group, which consists of various Morningstar, Inc. subsidiaries (“Manager Research Group”). In the United States, that subsidiary is Morningstar Research Services LLC, which is registered with and governed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Manager Research Group evaluates funds based on five key pillars, which are process, performance, people, parent, and price. The Manager Research Group uses this five pillar evaluation to determine how they believe funds are likely to perform relative to a benchmark, or in the case of exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds, a relevant peer group, over the long term on a risk-adjusted basis. They consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research, and the weight of each pillar may vary. The Analyst Rating scale is Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. A Morningstar Analyst Rating of Gold, Silver, or Bronze reflects the Manager Research Group’s conviction in a fund’s prospects for outperformance. Analyst Ratings ultimately reflect the Manager Research Group’s overall assessment, are overseen by an Analyst Rating Committee, and are continuously monitored and reevaluated at least every 14 months. For more detailed information about Morningstar’s Analyst Rating, including its methodology, please go to global.morningstar.com/managerdisclosures/. The Morningstar Analyst Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a fund, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause Analyst expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what they expected, and (iii) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the fund.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.
