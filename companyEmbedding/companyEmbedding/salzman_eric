Later, he re-engineered the business, quadrupled its size, executed a joint venture with Hutchison Whampoa and sold it to Lockheed Martin. At Lockheed Martin, as President of Strategic Venture Development, Vik focused on turning the company’s military technologies and programs into global commercial ventures ranging from seabed mining to nanomaterials.
Vik earned engineering degrees from the Florida Institute of Technology, the University of Michigan and Stanford University. He completed the trifecta of top management schools earning graduate executive credentials from Stanford, Harvard and the University of California at Berkeley.

The New Music Theater
Seeing the Voice, Hearing the Body
Eric Salzman and Thomas Desi


Salzman is a well-known and influential music historian and critic
Focuses on artistic and social aspects of music theatre
Provides the first comprehensive overview of this popular theatrical genre
Tackles the question of high art and popular culture








The New Music Theater
Seeing the Voice, Hearing the Body
Eric Salzman and Thomas Desi



Description



Alternatives to grand opera and the popular musical can be traced at least as far back as the 1912 premiere of Schoenberg's "Pierrot Lunaire." Yet this ongoing history has never been properly sorted out, its complex ideas and philosophy as well as musical and theatrical achievements never brought fully to light. The New Music Theater is the first comprehensive attempt in English to cover this still-emerging art form in its widest range. This book provides a wealth of examples and descriptions not only of the works themselves, but of the concepts, ideas, and trends that have gone into the evolution of what may be the most central performance art form of the post-modern world. Authors Salzman and Desi consider the subject of music theatre from a social as well as artistic point of view, exploring how theatre works in culture, and how music works in the theatre. Illuminating their discussion with illustrations from current artists and their works, The New Music Theater both describes where we have been and points the way to the future of this all-encompassing art form.

The New Music Theater
Seeing the Voice, Hearing the Body
Eric Salzman and Thomas Desi


Reviews and Awards


"Fascinating, sometimes maddening cornucopia of erudition, the authors have many wise, often provocative ideas and insights to share."--Bookforum
"As an artist who has worked between the cracks of art forms since the 1960's, I applaud Salzman and Desi for providing a fresh and inclusive survey of the important and evolving field of new music theater- a form that continues to expand our perception of what is possible in art that lives and breathes."--Meredith Monk
"Thoroughly researched and historically grounded, this is a comprehensive look at this alternative performance art."-Library Journal
"The New Music Theater traces the complicated evolution of many artistic traditions and leads to a deeper understanding of the state of new music theater today. The authors infuse their analysis with perspective that is certain to provoke debate - as well as a desire to learn more about the context and direction of new creation in the realm of singing theater."--Marc Scorca, President and CEO, Opera America
"This valuable book appears like Orpheus to guide the reader through the land of that complex and unpredictable reality which is the music theater of our time. This book tells us about music theater not just as a show, but as a way of bringing onto the stage what the real world cannot show us."--Giorgio Battistelli, Composer-in-residence at the D:usseldorf Opera and Music Director of the Arena di Verona
"A very good read of contemporary music history that has been missing until now. Bravo!"--Michel Rostain, Stage Director, Librettist and Director, Scène nationale de Quimper
"The New Music Theater is a smart, thoughtful book." -- Theaterforschung
