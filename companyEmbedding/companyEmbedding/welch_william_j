BEWARE OF DR. WILLIAM J. WELCH, D.C.IF YOU WERE SENT HERE BY A LAWYER BE CAREFUL, VERY CAREFUL ESPECIALLY OF DR. WELCH.LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE. I HAVE BEEN AT THE SAME JOB FOR 25 YEARS WITH GREAT HEALTH INS. I HAD NEVER BEEN IN A ACCIDENT BEFORE. WELL ONE DAY ON MY WAY TO WORK I WAS HIT BY A TRUCK. MY CAR WAS PAID FOR AND ONLY HAD LIABILITY INS. SO THIS MEANS MY INS. HAD NO INTEREST IN MY ACCIDENT SO I CALLED A LAWYER. THEY SENT ME TO DR. WELCH. DR. WELCH WOULD NOT TAKE MY INS. DR. WELCH SAID IF AND WHEN THERE WAS A SETTLEMENT HE WOULD GET PAID. THAT’S IT. I WOULD NOT BE RESPOSIBLE FOR ANY DOCTOR BILLS. REMEMBER I HAVE GREAT INS. THAT WOULD OF COVERED ALL DOCTOR EXPENSES. WELL EVENTUALLY THE CASE GETS DROPPED AND 2 YEARS LATER WITHOUT CONTACT FROM DR. WELCH I END UP WITH A COLLECTION AGENCY. I REFUSE TO PAY AND NOW WE ARE IN COURT.BOTTOM LINE DR. WELCH IS DISHONEST.DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU. THERE ARE GREAT DOCTORS OUT THERE BUT DR. WELCH IS NOT ONE. YOU HAVE NOW BEEN WARNED.

Dr. Welch appears to be a nice man and caring doctor. Unfortunately he has a bad side that has put us in court. He has mislead me on the billing. He has even lied. Well now I have to defend myself in court. Avoid this chirpractor. It is not worth it. There are honest doctors out there but he is not one. If anyone has had a similar situation with Dr. Welch please e-mail me at kdaug5@msn.com.
