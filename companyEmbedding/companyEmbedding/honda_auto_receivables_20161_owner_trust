Fitch Rates Honda Auto Receivables 2016-1 Owner Trust; Outlook Stable



2016-02-25 19:58:50









NEW YORK--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the Honda Auto Receivables 2016-1 Owner Trust notes:
--$265,700,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
--$312,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
--$332,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
--$90,300,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
--$25,648,881 certificates 'NR'.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
Strong Credit Quality: The credit quality of 2016-1, as measured by the weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score of 761 and internal credit score tiering, is consistent with recent pools. New vehicles total 93.7%, and the WA seasoning is 13.6 months.
Consistent Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 2.75% (subordination of 2.50% and a 0.25% reserve). A yield supplement account (YSA) increases the effective WA annual percentage rate (APR) and, thus, excess spread (XS), which totals 2.67%, higher than 2015-4 (NR) and 2015-3.
Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on American Honda Finance Corporation's (AHFC) portfolio and 2010-2015 securitizations have been low historically and remained well below peak levels from 2008 due to stronger quality originations and healthy used vehicle values. Fitch's base case loss proxy remains at 0.90%; however, pool-factor projections of recent HAROT securitizations suggest 2016-1 could be expected to perform within a 0.35%-0.45% range, assuming stable macroeconomic conditions.
Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates AHFC 'F1' and its parent, Honda, 'A/F1'/Outlook Stable. AHFC has recorded positive corporate financial results in recent years, while the overall health of Honda has remained strong.
Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AHFC demonstrates adequate capabilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization performance. Fitch deems AHFC capable of servicing 2016-1.
Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of AHFC would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of 2016-1 to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing no expected impact on the rating of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience a downgrade of two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on a random sample of 287 receivables selected from the 97,109 receivables (as of Dec. 31, 2015). A comparison was made of the various attributes of each of the selected receivables (first payment date, original amount financed, among others) in the data file to contractual documents provided by the company. Based on the results of the procedures, KPMG concluded with a 99% confidence level that the maximum estimated error occurrence rate for each of the attributes does not exceed 5%.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

(FICO) score of 765 and internal credit score tiering is consistent with recent pools. New vehicles total 95.1% and the WA seasoning is 13.6 months.Consistent Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 2.75% (subordination of 2.50% and a 0.25% reserve). A yield supplement account (YSA) increases the effective WA APR, resulting in excess spread (XS) of 2.30%. All structural features are consistent with 2015-2016 transactions.Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on AHFC's portfolio and 2010-2016 securitizations have been low historically and remained well below peak levels in 2008 due to stronger quality originations, the improved U.S. economy and healthy used vehicle values.Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates AHFC 'F1' and Honda, its parent, 'F1'/'A' with a Stable Rating Outlook. AHFC has recorded positive corporate financial results in recent years, while the overall health of Honda has remained strong.Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AHFC demonstrates adequate capabilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization performance. Fitch deems AHFC capable of servicing this series.Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of AHFC would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of 2016-4 to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing no expected impact on the rating of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience a downgrade of up to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenarioUSE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on a random sample of 287 receivables selected from the 128,973 receivables (as of Aug. 31, 2016). A comparison was made of the various attributes of each of the selected receivables (first payment date, original amount financed, among others) in the data file to contractual documents provided by the company. Based on the results of the procedures, KPMG concluded with a 99% confidence level that the maximum estimated error occurrence rate for each of the attributes does not exceed 5%.A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the link found at the end of this rating action commentary.REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMSFitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in the report titled 'Honda Auto Receivables 2016-4 Owner Trust -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated May 31, 2016.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Read MoreRating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/878723Related ResearchHonda Auto Receivables 2016-4 Owner Trust (US ABS)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/888996Honda Auto Receivables 2016-4 Owner Trust - Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/889035Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1013055ABS Due Diligence Form 15E 1https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf15E_frame.cfm?pr_id=1013055&flm_nm=15e_1013055_1.pdfSolicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1013055Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
