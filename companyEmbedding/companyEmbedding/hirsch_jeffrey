Starz








The former Time Warner Cable executive will report to CEO Chris Albrecht.

Starz has named Jeffrey Hirsch, a former top marketing executive at Time Warner Cable, as president of global marketing and product planning, effective July 20.
In the newly created position, he will report to Starz CEO Chris Albrecht. Hirsch will move from New York to Los Angeles to join the Starz executive team.
Hirsch’s responsibilities will include overseeing the development of new Starz products and services for the company’s current and prospective new distributors, both in the U.S. and abroad. Hirsch will be working in close coordination with the company’s strategy, distribution, marketing and product planning teams "with a focus on optimizing worldwide sales and revenue growth efforts and increasing Starz brand awareness through the company’s expanding portfolio of original programming," Starz said.




Hirsch most recently served as executive vp and chief marketing officer for residential services at Time Warner Cable. In that role since 2011, Hirsch was responsible for all corporate marketing activities to residential customers. Hirsch first joined Time Warner Cable in 1999 and served in various executive roles, including in strategic product development for the Time Warner Cable iPad app. He also served as president for residential services in the Time Warner Cable New York City, Los Angeles and Rochester, NY regions.
Before that, Hirsch worked at NYNEX in product bundling and at McCann-Erickson in advertising.
"Jeff comes to Starz with sterling credentials and a proven, multi-discipline background in our industry that should prove to be a great asset," said Albrecht. "This is a period of rapid change in the total media business ecosystem and one of tremendous worldwide opportunity at Starz thanks to our successful transformation as a company."

He added: "Jeff’s experience as a successful cable operator with one of our largest distributors, and his talents in marketing, product development and planning, sales and operations, make him a great addition to our executive ranks."




Said Hirsch: "Chris has done a remarkable job leading the evolution of the business at Starz the past recent years. The opportunity to become a key member of the Starz executive team and join a programming company whose prospects are rising both in the U.S. and overseas in an exciting new role is a tremendous opportunity."

Jeffrey Hirsch has been upped to chief operating officer at Starz.

“Jeff’s talent and experience will help us accelerate the transformation that began five years ago,” said Starz CEO Chris Albrecht. “We have made great progress in our programming, brands, subscribers and shareholder value, and the organization is focused with an eye to the future.”







As COO Hirsch will oversee affiliate sales, marketing, programming operations and research, Starz Distribution and technology and product development. Before Starz he spent 16 years with Time Warner Cable.
Weil was previously Starz’s exec VP and general counsel.
