The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement.

The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Signs for push-out forces
After almost 16 years on the job
Laud and praise for Swoboda
Search for a successor
Swoboda spoke at length and said 121 words

(exechange) — Durham, North Carolina, May 19, 2017 — Chuck Swoboda, chief executive of Cree, leaves. As announced by Cree, Inc. in a news release and in a regulatory filing published on Friday, May 19, 2017, Charles M. (Chuck) Swoboda leaves the post as Chief Executive Officer at the maker of lighting-class LEDs in a surprising move after almost 16 years on the job.
It is the end of an era.
Chuck Swoboda will step down from his executive positions and as a member of the Board of Directors following a transition period.
Cree will undertake a search for a successor.
“My decision to change my work-life balance follows a recent medical issue”
The management change is explained as follows. Swoboda said: “My decision to change my work-life balance follows a recent medical issue, which was resolved, and which caused me to reevaluate my priorities.”
Precise information about the future plans of Swoboda was not immediately available.
“Step down”
Cree announced “that it is accelerating its chief executive officer succession planning and Charles M. Swoboda will step down from his executive positions and as a member of the Board of Directors following a transition period”.
Share price decline
The change follows a decline in the share price of Cree, Inc. since October 2013.
On the job as CEO since 2001
Swoboda has served as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer since June 2001, as President since January 1999, as a member of the Board of Directors since October 2000 and as chairman since April 2005.
He was Chief Operating Officer of the Company from 1997 to June 2001 and Vice President for Operations from 1997 to 1999.
Prior to his appointment as Vice President for Operations, Swoboda served as Operations Manager from 1996 to 1997, as General Manager of the Company’s former subsidiary, Real Color Displays, Incorporated, from 1994 to 1996 and as LED Product Manager from 1993 to 1994.
He was previously employed by Hewlett-Packard Company.
Swoboda intends to stay on until a successor is appointed, and thereafter will remain available as a consultant to the Company to ensure a seamless transition of leadership responsibilities.
Unplanned
As a general rule, when a top leader announces to step aside with no successor in place, it’s a signal that the move was unexpected and too early.
Signs for push-out forces
It is not completely certain what forces eventually triggered Chuck Swoboda’s move.
The Push-out Score™ determined by exechange suggests that push-out forces may have contributed to the management change.

Board of Trustees


The Board of Trustees has fiduciary responsibility and is the principal  governance authority for Marquette University. The board is responsible  for preserving and enhancing Marquette’s mission and ensuring that  long-term planning and goals are defined and executed by the university  community. 
Marquette’s bylaws stipulate that the Board of Trustees be  comprised of not fewer than 25 and not more than 40 members, of whom no  fewer than five and no more than eight must be members of the Society of  Jesus. The university’s president serves ex-officio as a member of the  board. The board is self-perpetuating, meaning that trustees are  responsible for electing new members. Trustees serve for three-year  terms and may be re-elected to serve for a maximum of 12 years. Trustees  are volunteers and are not compensated for their service.
The board holds in trust Marquette’s human, physical, and financial  and assets for future generations. The trustees are stewards of  Marquette’s Catholic and Jesuit identity. They establish policies on  university strategy, financial management, fundraising, investments,  property and assets. The board is responsible for hiring and evaluating  the university’s president. The day-to-day administration of Marquette  is the responsibility of the university president and his leadership  team.
