IPO Preview: Crescent Capital Finance - Crescent Capital Finance Group (:CCFG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»IPO Preview: Crescent Capital FinanceMar. 6.12 | About: Crescent Capital (CCFG) IPOdesktop Value, IPOs, long onlyIPOpremiumBased in Los Angeles, California, Crescent Capital Finance ((CCFG)) scheduled a $125 million IPO with a market capitalization of $129 million at $15 per share for Wednesday, March 7, 2012. CCFG is one of five IPOs scheduled for this week (see our IPO calendar). Summary CCFG is a junk bond Business Development Corp. (BDC, see below) that looks like it is set up to funnel to create profits for the manager, Crescent. It is buying a portfolio of $75 million from TCW, a very large money manager in Los Angeles, and will have $50 million left to invest. There is a $.90 cent per share load built in that will be triggered to pay the underwriters $6 million if the when the fund pays more than 7% to shareholders. Competing BDCs pay much more. Conclusion Pass on this IPO and look instead at CCFG's competitors including the following.

Read here more about BDC's.
 Junk Bond Portfolio CCFG was recently formed to originate and invest primarily in secured debt (including senior secured, unitranche and second lien debt) and unsecured debt (including senior unsecured and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. lower-middle-market companies. CCFG is focused on companies with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of less than $40 million. These companies typically are highly leveraged, and, in most cases, will not be rated by national rating agencies. If such companies were rated, CCFG believes that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (i.e., below BBB or Baa, respectively) from the national rating agencies of Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC, or Standard & Poor's, and Moody's Investor Services, Inc. Distributions CCFG currently intends to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (1) 98% of its net ordinary income for such calendar year. (2) 98.2% of its net capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on December 31 of the calendar year. (3) any net ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which CDFG previously paid no U.S. federal income tax. Initial Portfolio On February 24, 2012, CCFG entered into a portfolio acquisition agreement for $74.9 million with the seller, which is managed by TCW Asset Management Company and sub-advised by Crescent Capital Group. The portfolio, as of December 31, 2011, consists of 155 issuers of 170 secured loans and corporate bonds having an aggregate fair value of $74.1 million as of December 31, 2011. You can see the portfolio in the SEC filing pages 62-67. Competition Looking at other Business Development Corporations it appears that CCFG has significant competition in terms of current yields and price-to-book value ratios. About Crescent Capital Corp. CCFG is a spin-off from Trust Company of the West (TCW).
 TCW agrees to split off Crescent Capital Group on July 29, 2010, according to a Los Angeles Times article. At the time CCFG has $11.5 billion under management. However, CCFG's web site now says it has $9 bb in assets, down 22% from the initial spin-off. Still, that's a considerable asset based from which only $75 million is being sold. IPO Objective? It strikes us that the CCFG IPO is a just a vehicle to increase management fees to Crescent Capital, and is not designed to be particularly favorable to IPO investors. Investment Advisory Agreement CCFG will pay CCFG Advisors a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement. This fee consists of two components: A base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2% of gross assets (including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage). The incentive fee consists 20% of CCFG's "pre-incentive fee net investment income" for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a hurdle rate of 2% per quarter (8% annualized return to investors). 'Sales' Bonus To Investment Bankers CCFG Advisors has agreed to pay the underwriters a sales load of $7.5 million, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds an annual rate of 7% for one year after the IPO. Dilution to Shareholders That works out to $.90 a share dilution to shareholders, and makes CCFG overvalued relative to other public Business Development Corporations. Concurrent Private Placement At or prior to the closing of this offering, CCFG will sell $4 million in shares of common stock to CCFG Advisors, certain of its affiliates, certain officers, directors and/or employees, or entities owned by, or family trusts for the benefit of, such persons, and/or certain other persons or entities designated by Crescent Capital Group, in a separate private placement, at a price per share equal to $15.00. Use of Proceeds CCFG expects to net $128 million from its IPO, $75 million of which is allocated to purchasing a loan portfolio and the balance is for investment.
 Shares Outstanding Post-IPO 8,601,000 shares (including 266,667 shares purchased in the private placement and assuming the initial public offering price is $15.00 per share), excluding 1,250,000 shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters. Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.About this article:ExpandTagged: Investing Ideas, IPO AnalysisWant to share your opinion on this article?

Applicants' Representations
1. Crescent is a Delaware corporation organized as a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under section Start Printed Page 1215654(a) of the Act.[1] 
           Crescent's investment objective is to maximize the total return to its stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation. Crescent's primary focus is originating and investing primarily in secured debt (including senior secured, unitranche and second lien debt) and unsecured debt (including senior unsecured and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies. The board of directors (“Board”) of Crescent has five members, three of which members are not “interested persons” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act (“Independent Directors”).[2] 

2. CBDC Advisors is a Delaware limited liability company and is an investment adviser registered with the Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). CBDC Advisors serves as the investment adviser to Crescent, which is currently CBDC Advisors' sole client.
3. Crescent Capital is a limited partnership organized under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, Crescent Direct Lending Management, LLC and Crescent SBIC Management, LLC are each Delaware limited liability companies, and Crescent Credit Europe LLP is a limited liability partnership organized in England and Wales. Each Existing Crescent Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act.
4. The Existing Affiliated Funds pursue strategies focused on originating and investing primarily in secured debt (including senior secured, unitranche and second lien debt) and unsecured debt (including senior unsecured and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies. Each Existing Affiliated Fund is advised by a Crescent Adviser [3] 
           and would be an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act.
5. Applicants seek an order (“Order”) to permit a Regulated Entity [4] 
           and one or more other Regulated Entities and one or more Affiliated Funds [5] 
           to (a) participate in the same investment opportunities through a proposed co-investment program where such participation would otherwise be prohibited under sections 17 and 57 of the Act; and (b) make additional investments in securities of such issuers (“Follow-On Investments”), including through the exercise of warrants, conversion privileges, and other rights to purchase securities of the issuers. “Co-Investment Transaction” means any transaction in which a Regulated Entity (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary, as defined below) participated together with one or more other Regulated Entities and/or Affiliated Funds in reliance on the requested Order. “Potential Co-Investment Transaction” means any investment opportunity in which a Regulated Entity (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary) seeks to participate together with one or more other Regulated Entities and/or Affiliated Funds in reliance on the Order.[6] 

6. Applicants state that a Regulated Entity may, from time to time, form a Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary.[7] 
           Such a subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a Co-Investment Transaction with any other Regulated Entity or Affiliated Fund because it would be a company controlled by its parent Regulated Entity for purposes of section 57(a)(4) and rule 17d-1. Applicants request that each Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary be permitted to participate in Co-Investment Transactions in lieu of its parent Regulated Entity and that the Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary's participation in any such transaction be treated, for purposes of the Order, as though the parent Regulated Entity were participating directly. Applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the Regulated Entity's investments and, therefore, no conflicts of interest could arise between the Regulated Entity and the Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary. The Regulated Entity's Board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary's participation in a Co-Investment Transaction, and the Regulated Entity's Board would be informed of, and take into consideration, any proposed use of a Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary in the Regulated Entity's place. If the Regulated Entity proposes to participate in the same Co-Investment Transaction with any of its Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiaries, the Board will also be informed of, and take into consideration, the relative participation of the Regulated Entity and the Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary.
7. When considering Potential Co-Investment Transactions for any Regulated Entity, the relevant Adviser [8] 
           will consider only the Objectives and Strategies,[9] 

           investment policies, investment positions, capital available for investment, and other pertinent factors applicable to that Regulated Entity. CBDC Advisors expects that any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a Regulated Entity should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other Regulated Entities and/or one or more Start Printed Page 12157Affiliated Funds, with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification.[10] 

8. Other than pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as provided in conditions 7 and 8, and after making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the applicable Adviser will present each Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation to the directors of the Board eligible to vote under section 57(o) of the Act (“Eligible Directors”), and the “required majority,” as defined in section 57(o) of the Act (“Required Majority”) [11] 
           will approve each Co-Investment Transaction prior to any investment by the participating Regulated Entity.
9. With respect to the pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments provided in conditions 7 and 8, a Regulated Entity may participate in a pro rata disposition or Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if, among other things: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or Follow-On Investment, as the case may be; and (ii) the Board of the Regulated Entity has approved that Regulated Entity's participation in pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as being in the best interests of the Regulated Entity. If the Board does not so approve, any such disposition or Follow-On Investment will be submitted to the Regulated Entity's Eligible Directors. The Board of any Regulated Entity may at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments with the result that all dispositions and/or Follow-On Investments must be submitted to the Eligible Directors.
10. No Independent Director of a Regulated Entity will have a direct or indirect financial interest in any Co-Investment Transaction (other than indirectly through share ownership in one of the Regulated Entities), including any interest in any company whose securities would be acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction.
11. Under condition 14, if an Adviser, its principals, or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser or its principals, and the Affiliated Funds (collectively, the “Holders”) own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the outstanding voting shares of a Regulated Entity (the “Shares”), then the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on matters specified in the condition. Applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the Independent Directors will act independently in evaluating the co-investment program, because the ability of an Adviser or its principals to influence the Independent Directors by a suggestion, explicit or implied, that the Independent Directors can be removed will be limited significantly. Applicants represent that the Independent Directors will evaluate and approve any such independent third party, taking into account its qualifications, reputation for independence, cost to the Regulated Entity's shareholders, and other factors that they deem relevant.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 57(a)(4) of the Act prohibits certain affiliated persons of a BDC from participating in joint transactions with the BDC or a company controlled by a BDC in contravention of rules as prescribed by the Commission. In particular, section 57(a)(4) applies to any person who is directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a BDC is subject to section 57(a)(4). Applicants submit that each of the Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds could be deemed to be a person related to each Regulated Entity in a manner described by section 57(b) by virtue of being under common control. Section 57(i) of the Act provides that, until the Commission prescribes rules under section 57(a)(4), the Commission's rules under section 17(d) of the Act applicable to registered closed-end investment companies will be deemed to apply to transactions subject to section 57(a)(4). Because the Commission has not adopted any rules under section 57(a)(4), rule 17d-1 also applies to joint transactions with Regulated Entities that are BDCs. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act are applicable to Regulated Entities that are registered closed-end investment companies.
2. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit affiliated persons of a registered investment company from participating in joint transactions with the company unless the Commission has granted an order permitting such transactions. In passing upon applications under rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the company's participation in the joint transaction is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
3. Applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief, the Regulated Entities would be, in some circumstances, limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities. Applicants believe that the proposed terms and conditions will ensure that the Co-Investment Transactions are consistent with the protection of each Regulated Entity's shareholders and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that the Regulated Entities' participation in the Co-Investment Transactions will be consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and on a basis that is not different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that the Order will be subject to the following conditions:
1. Each time an Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment Transaction for another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund that falls within a Regulated Entity's then-current Objectives and Strategies, the Regulated Entity's Adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for the Regulated Entity in light of the Regulated Entity's then-current circumstances.
2. (a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated Entity's participation in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for the Regulated Entity, the Adviser will then determine an appropriate level of investment for the Regulated Entity.
(b) If the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser to be invested by the applicable Regulated Entity in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction together with the amount proposed to be invested by the other participating Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity, the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participant's capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each. The applicable Adviser will provide the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Entity with information Start Printed Page 12158concerning each participating party's available capital to assist the Eligible Directors with their review of the Regulated Entity's investments for compliance with these allocation procedures.
(c) After making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the applicable Adviser will distribute written information concerning the Potential Co-Investment Transaction (including the amount proposed to be invested by each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Entity for their consideration. A Regulated Entity will co-invest with another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund only if, prior to the Regulated Entity's participation in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, a Required Majority concludes that:
(i) the terms of the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Regulated Entity and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Regulated Entity or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned;
(ii) the Potential Co-Investment Transaction is consistent with:
(A) the interests of the Regulated Entity's shareholders; and
(B) the Regulated Entity's then-current Objectives and Strategies;
(iii) the investment by any other Regulated Entities or any Affiliated Funds would not disadvantage the Regulated Entity, and participation by the Regulated Entity would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of any other Regulated Entities or any Affiliated Funds; provided that, if any other Regulated Entity or any Affiliated Fund, but not the Regulated Entity itself, gains the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company's board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company, such event shall not be interpreted to prohibit the Required Majority from reaching the conclusions required by this condition (2)(c)(iii), if:
(A) the Eligible Directors will have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer, if any; and
(B) the applicable Adviser agrees to, and does, provide periodic reports to the Board of the Regulated Entity with respect to the actions of such director or the information received by such board observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company; and
(C) any fees or other compensation that any Regulated Entity or any Affiliated Fund or any affiliated person of any Regulated Entity or any Affiliated Fund receives in connection with the right of a Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the participating Affiliated Funds (who may each, in turn, share its portion with its affiliated persons) and the participating Regulated Entities in accordance with the amount of each party's investment; and
(iv) the proposed investment by the Regulated Entity will not benefit any Adviser, the other Regulated Entities, the Affiliated Funds or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction), except (A) to the extent permitted by condition 13, (B) to the extent permitted by section 17(e) or 57(k) of the Act, as applicable, (C) indirectly, as a result of an interest in the securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction, or (D) in the case of fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).
3. Each Regulated Entity has the right to decline to participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the amount proposed.
4. The applicable Adviser will present to the Board of each Regulated Entity, on a quarterly basis, a record of all investments in Potential Co-Investment Transactions made by any of the other Regulated Entities or Affiliated Funds during the preceding quarter that fell within the Regulated Entity's then-current Objectives and Strategies that were not made available to the Regulated Entity, and an explanation of why the investment opportunities were not offered to the Regulated Entity. All information presented to the Board pursuant to this condition will be kept for the life of the Regulated Entity and at least two years thereafter, and will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.
5. Except for Follow-On Investments made in accordance with condition 8,[12] 
           a Regulated Entity will not invest in reliance on the Order in any issuer in which another Regulated Entity, Affiliated Fund, or any affiliated person of another Regulated Entity or Affiliated Fund is an existing investor.
6. A Regulated Entity will not participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class of securities to be purchased, settlement date, and registration rights will be the same for each participating Regulated Entity and Affiliated Fund. The grant to another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund, but not the Regulated Entity, of the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company's board of directors, the right to have an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will not be interpreted so as to violate this condition 6, if conditions 2(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) are met.
7. (a) If any Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund elects to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security that was acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Adviser will:
(i) notify each Regulated Entity that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to participation by each Regulated Entity in the disposition.
(b) Each Regulated Entity will have the right to participate in such disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the participating Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds.
(c) A Regulated Entity may participate in such disposition without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board of the Regulated Entity has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Entity the ability to participate in such dispositions on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in the application); and (iii) the Board of the Regulated Entity is provided on a quarterly basis with a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this condition. In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Entity's participation to the Regulated Entity's Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Entity will participate in such disposition solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Entity's best interests.Start Printed Page 12159

(d) Each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated Fund will bear its own expenses in connection with any such disposition.
8. (a) If a Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund desires to make a Follow-On Investment in a portfolio company whose securities were acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Adviser will:
(i) notify each Regulated Entity that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed transaction at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to the proposed participation, including the amount of the proposed Follow-On Investment, by each Regulated Entity.
(b) A Regulated Entity may participate in such Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated Fund in such investment is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and (ii) the Board of the Regulated Entity has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Entity the ability to participate in Follow-On Investments on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in the application). In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Entity's participation to the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Entity will participate in such Follow-On Investment solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Entity's best interests.
(c) If, with respect to any Follow-On Investment:
(i) the amount of a Follow-On Investment is not based on the Regulated Entities' and the Affiliated Funds' outstanding investments immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and
(ii) the aggregate amount recommended by the Adviser to be invested by each Regulated Entity in the Follow-On Investment, together with the amount proposed to be invested by the participating Affiliated Funds in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the opportunity; then the amount invested by each such party will be allocated among them pro rata based on each party's capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each.
(d) The acquisition of Follow-On Investments as permitted by this condition will be considered a Co-Investment Transaction for all purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in the application.
9. The Independent Directors of each Regulated Entity will be provided quarterly for review all information concerning Potential Co-Investment Transactions and Co-Investment Transactions, including investments made by other Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds that the Regulated Entity considered but declined to participate in, so that the Independent Directors may determine whether all investments made during the preceding quarter, including those investments which the Regulated Entity considered but declined to participate in, comply with the conditions of the Order. In addition, the Independent Directors will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for the Regulated Entity of participating in new and existing Co-Investment Transactions.
10. Each Regulated Entity will maintain the records required by section 57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of the Regulated Entities were a business development company and each of the investments permitted under these conditions were approved by the Required Majority under section 57(f) of the Act.
11. No Independent Director of a Regulated Entity will also be a director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise an “affiliated person” (as defined in the Act) of an Affiliated Fund.
12. The expenses, if any, associated with acquiring, holding or disposing of any securities acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction (including, without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any such securities registered for sale under the Securities Act) will, to the extent not payable by an Adviser under the investment advisory agreements with the Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds, be shared by the Affiliated Funds and the Regulated Entities in proportion to the relative amounts of the securities held or to be acquired or disposed of, as the case may be.
13. Any transaction fee [13] 
           (including break-up or commitment fees but excluding broker's fees contemplated by section 17(e) or 57(k) of the Act, as applicable), received in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction will be distributed to the participating Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they invested or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment Transaction. If any transaction fee is to be held by the Adviser pending consummation of the transaction, the fee will be deposited into an account maintained by the Adviser at a bank or banks having the qualifications prescribed in section 26(a)(1) of the Act, and the account will earn a competitive rate of interest that will also be divided pro rata among the participating Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds based on the amounts they invest in such Co-Investment Transaction. None of the Affiliated Funds, the Advisers, the other Regulated Entities or any affiliated person of the Regulated Entities or Affiliated Funds will receive additional compensation or remuneration of any kind as a result of or in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction (other than (a) in the case of the Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds, the pro rata transaction fees described above and fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C); and (b) in the case of the Advisers, investment advisory fees paid in accordance with the agreements between the Advisers and the Regulated Entities or the Affiliated Funds).
14. If the Holders own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Shares of a Regulated Entity, then the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on (a) the election of directors; (b) the removal of one or more directors; or (c) all other matters under either the Act or applicable State law affecting the Board's composition, size or manner of election.

Seeks to consistently deliver excess return with below average volatilityCrescent is one of the most experienced High Yield bond managers in the industry. For more than 20 years, we have relied on fundamental bottom-up credit research to capture inefficiencies across all rating segments of the High Yield bond market.
