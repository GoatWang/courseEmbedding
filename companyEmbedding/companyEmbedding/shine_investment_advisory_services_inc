Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services. Fiduciary standards or fiduciary duties do not apply, for example, when the Bank is offering or providing credit solutions, banking, custody or brokerage products/services or referrals to other affiliates of the Bank.

We focus on the long-term drivers, the macro forces and investment themes at play across industries that are taking us into the next growth cycle.

Why a Raymond James Advisor






Our advisors have a 
legacy of serving clients differently.

                    It’s a more personal approach that goes far beyond an investment portfolio. It’s an ongoing and open dialogue about all aspects of your life, your goals and your financial vision. And it’s developing a long-term relationship built on understanding and trust. Your advisor is there for you throughout the planning and investing process, giving you objective and unbiased advice along the way.
                



Who Our Advisors Serve


Raymond James advisors serve clients with a variety of sophisticated financial planning needs. From families and individuals to business owners and institutions, your Raymond James advisor has the expertise and experience to provide guidance for a wide range of financial planning needs. They’ll take care of the big picture and the finer details with an approach that is as disciplined as it is strategic.

Working with an Advisor


Your advisor is there to help you reach major milestones and all of the smaller ones in between. You’ll work together to build a customized plan just for you, taking into account all of your objectives, while weighing risk, prioritizing trade-offs and accounting for “what ifs.” And because your plan is a living document, your advisor will continually adapt it while utilizing the latest technology to identify potential unknowns and your changing needs, making adjustments that will help you reach your financial goals.

With the benefit of hindsight, we can see it would have been a bad idea to sell stock holdings after the Brexit vote.

Why Shine





Important Conversations
People come to Shine with important questions about their financial lives.  Some of these might relate to your personal situation.
We engage in meaningful conversations around very basic and powerful life changes.
What’s the best way to navigate the passing of a spouse, divorce, remarriage, the birth of a child, a child in college?  How do can I know I’m making the right choices in these life-altering circumstances?
People ask us how to invest in today’s volatile investment environment.
Can you create a mix of investments that provides the returns I need, but doesn’t scare me so much when the markets get choppy that I can’t sleep at night?  Do I have the resources to retire early?  How much do I need to save?
Others ask for help sorting out the noise in today’s 24-hour financial news cycle.
Can you help me figure out what matters to my long-term well-being?  What headlines should I be worried about and what can I ignore?
Many seek our guidance on tax-related matters.
Should I be considering Roth conversions?  Can you help me set up an individual retirement plan for my business?  What are my deferred compensation options and opportunities?
A surprising number of people will be looking at 30 years of retirement.
Will my money last that long?  How much can I spend each year without running out of money?  Can you help us maintain our desired level of income amidst changing market conditions, political environments, and personal circumstances?
We talk with individuals who have a significant part of their investment portfolio concentrated in single stocks.
What’s the best strategy to reduce the risk of relying on one company for my future financial health?
Executives with stock options have especially complicated financial issues.
Can you help me create a schedule that will maximize my benefits?
Just about everybody needs an objective, unbiased review of insurance coverage and areas of exposure without the influence of a product to sell.
Would my family be financially secure if something unexpected happened to me?
Other important conversations revolve around trusts and tax-efficient strategies for estate planning.  But often the questions take us to a deeper level.
How can I ensure that the assets that pass on to my children and heirs reflect my values and priorities?  Can you help our blended family find a way to fairly arrange our resources?
 
People hire us to make sense out of the complexities they face.  Our conversations with you will be about your unique circumstances, addressing your own questions, which may or may not relate to the questions we’ve been answering for people like you for more than 20 years.
Bring us your challenges.  We’ll provide a safe environment to talk them over and, together, we will find workable solutions.

Philosophy





You are much, much more than your investment portfolio
When you become a client of Shine, we start by getting to know you, so we can understand your “big picture” – your needs, your dreams, your goals and even your fears.
We have to know where you’re going before we can properly start the journey to get there.
A customized plan that’s right for you
The goal of our planning process is to create a “map” of investing and financial actions that will get you safely from Point A, where you are now, to Point B, where you want to be in the near-term and to Point C, where you want to be in the long-term future.
We provide personalized attention to the details of the plan, so it fits with who you are and what you want to accomplish, and also so you experience the least amount of stress.  We make sure that it gets done.
Along the way, we coordinate with your other advisors – your accountant, attorney and insurance agent—to make sure everybody is on the same page and the overall plan is consistent and efficient.
Your total financial well-being is our most important concern
Our investment strategies are long-term in nature, based on the most compelling academic and scientific literature, and also grounded on our decades of experience with the ever-fluctuating investment markets.
We do not engage in market timing because the evidence—and our experience—strongly suggests that jumping in and out of the market not only doesn’t work; it’s dangerous to your financial health and well-being.
Look back, move forward
We believe every financial plan should be a living document that serves your changing needs.
As you move forward in your journey, your circumstances will inevitably change.  You’ll achieve short-term goals and need to make new ones.  The unforeseen will happen. There may be pleasant surprises; there may be setbacks.
You may need to change direction to get back on course, or you may find yourself making new, better goals.
Financial planning is an ongoing process that adjusts with your circumstances.  As we work together, we’ll revisit and review your life changes, and help update your goals, strategies and objectives as needed.
Putting your interests ahead of all others
Key to our business philosophy is a professional commitment to the well-being of everyone with whom we work.  You will never have to question our loyalties, or wonder if our advice is related to product sales or other financial conflicts of interest.
We put your interests first when we answer questions, when we give advice, and when we work with you to map out a plan.
In the profession, this is called the “fiduciary standard” of practice.
We call it the right way to provide advice for our community.

About Us





Our Story
Our company started because our founder, Judy Shine, couldn’t find a financial advisory firm that would provide the advice she wanted and needed.  In fact, they didn’t exist.
As a highly-successful sales professional at Xerox, Judy needed unbiased professional advice on how to invest her money and make good financial decisions.  But where could she turn for objective advice?  With whom could she feel comfortable talking about her financial success and the challenges it presented?
After several disappointing investment losses due to self-serving sales agendas, Judy decided to take matters into her own hands.  She enrolled in the Certified Financial Planner® (CFP®) certification program.
In 1986, once certified, Judy took a job writing financial plans for a new division of New England Life.  Before long, she decided to step out and create the firm she had hoped to find years earlier.  In 1995, Shine Investment Advisory Services, Inc. was born.
Over the years, our firm has expanded to include a team of like-minded CFP® professionals sharing the same commitment to provide the care and advice that Judy once sought for herself.
Today, our nationally recognized firm exceeds Judy’s original vision as a safe haven of investment advice for people like her.  We are proud to set the standard for excellence in the Denver market by integrating the highest level of institutional portfolio management with deep, broad financial planning expertise.
We are committed to being the kind of advisor that we would seek ourselves and that we would recommend to our family members.  Over the last two decades, we’ve enjoyed many productive and interesting relationships with people in our community.  Our strategies continue to evolve and grow as new generations of people seek objective advice and a safe place to discuss their own challenges.

Insights








FAQ





Whether you’re ready to get started or have an additional question we can answer, please give us a call and let’s start the conversation.
How are you paid for your services?Our clients pay us a single fee for comprehensive, customized advice.  This includes answering your most important financial questions, creating a customized plan that addresses the challenges you’re facing now, plus managing your investments within your comfort zone on an ongoing basis.
The fee to create an initial financial plan will be based on complexity.Our ongoing financial planning and investment management services are charged as a percentage of the total assets we manage for you.  Under our typical fee arrangement, the first $1 million in assets is billed at a 1% annual rate, and amounts above $1 million are billed on a declining rate schedule. (Our engagement letter including a detailed fee schedule is available upon request.)
What if I have questions between formal meetings?We do not charge separately for calls updating your situation or asking questions.  We want to encourage, rather than discourage communication with the people we serve.
Once we start working together, who will I be working with?Shine takes a team approach to serving you.  That means that you will be working with different members of our staff depending on the issues that arise and who is best suited to provide answers and service.  You will work with a primary advisor as well as a backup advisor who also is intimately familiar with your personal situation.
What is a fiduciary?  Why does it matter to me that you function as fiduciaries?Most people who call themselves ‘advisors’ are really sales agents who work in the best interests of their brokerage firm or insurance company.  They won’t tell you this, but they’re held to a much lower standard of care than fiduciaries.  They can legally recommend investments that pay them and their company high commissions, and make it seem like they’re offering advice in your best interests.
As fiduciaries under the law, we are required to always put your best interests first.  The advice we give doesn’t ever get tainted by any outside compensation—no commissions, sales prizes, trailing compensation or revenue sharing.
This is our choice, and we wouldn’t want to work in any other way with the people we serve.  We believe it provides important protections for your financial well-being.
Can you work with my CPA and attorney to coordinate estate and tax planning issues?Absolutely. We do this for most of our clients, which ensures that all parts of your overall plan are working together.
How do you manage my investments?We start by working with you to determine your comfort zone in the ups and downs of today’s investment markets.  Only then can we appropriately recommend a mix of investments that will work together—making your money work for you.
We select the individual investments from “institutional” mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investments which, in many cases, are not available to the general public, and which often charge lower operating expense ratios.  The savings are passed on to you.
Is there any reason why I couldn’t use index funds and manage my own investment portfolio?You could manage your own nest egg, and many people do—with mixed results.
Using index funds is a great strategy for minimizing the drag of yearly portfolio costs, and we do it ourselves where appropriate.
The first challenge of investment management is hard wired into our brains.  Some of the most costly mistakes people make, in our experience, have to do with normal human behavior.  When markets go down, sometimes dramatically, there is a natural impulse to sell. This behavior locks in losses, and few people know when to get back into the market to catch the next upturn.
When the markets are roaring ahead, there is a natural tendency to want to double down and pour more money into the hot investment (like a mutual fund) or class of investments (like U.S. or foreign stocks).  Often these periods of high returns are followed by inevitable declines.
All of us are subject to these natural human tendencies.  All of these natural human tendencies can lead to costly investment mistakes.
A second challenge of investment management is constructing an appropriate mix of different assets.  Many people unknowingly create portfolios that are concentrated in one or two asset types, industry sectors or even individual company stocks.  They experience much more portfolio risk than necessary.
How do you avoid the behavioral pitfalls?Over the past 30 years, we’ve seen a lot of market turbulence, and learned a lot about what does and doesn’t work in investing.  We know the different asset classes and have stayed abreast of academic research into what kinds of portfolios deliver the highest returns per unit of risk.
And we have the advantage of looking at your investments objectively.
The index funds don’t provide you with financial advice, or information about how to proceed when the investment ride gets bumpy.
Will you help me understand my investments?Yes.  As you ask questions during our meetings, we’ll share our professional knowledge about everything from the particular investments we recommend to broader savings and financial issues—in plain English, rather than industry jargon.
Can I view my accounts online?Yes! We primarily use Charles Schwab & Co. as the custodian for our clients’ accounts. You can view your account information and activity at www.schwaballiance.com.
You will also be given access to a secure portal on our website, so you can view your quarterly portfolio statements if you elect this delivery method.
What steps should I take to get started?Please give us a call at 303-740-8600 and let's start the conversation.

Partnering with You to Achieve your Life Goals
Nothing is more important—to you, and to us—than having you achieve what you want out of your life. We have decades of experience and expertise helping people understand their choices.
When you become a client of Shine, we start by getting to know you, so we can understand your “big picture” – your needs, your dreams, your goals and even your fears.
Our questions will help you focus on what you truly want and help you identify your most personal goals and desires.
SETTING A COURSE
Once we have a mutual understanding of your goals, we create a “map” of investing and financial actions that will get you safely where you need to go.
With a clear picture of your current resources and future income streams we develop detailed financial models to estimate what your assets and liabilities will look like in the near and distant future.
This process raises many questions and also provides the answers that make sense for your situation.
How much do we need to save each year to eventually be financially independent? …or…. Now that I’m no longer earning income, how will my investments make up the shortfall between what I spend and what I get from Social Security each month?
How should we best balance spending on things we want to enjoy today and saving for longer term goals like college for our kids and our own retirement? …or… When do I start taking money from my IRA? Should I spend down my other accounts first?
How much can I afford to give to charity and still be in good shape for my own retirement? …or… How can I structure my estate to leave a family legacy?
Whatever the questions may be, having a strong analytical framework to help answer them is essential.
AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT WORKS FOR YOU
It’s critical that your investment portfolio be designed specifically to meet your financial objectives. Asset location and account titling matter. The mix of stocks and bonds and cash and real estate or other ‘alternative assets’ matters as well.
Our deep professional knowledge of the investment markets and decades of experience in evaluating investment managers serve as the foundation for the recommendations we make for your investment portfolio.
AVOIDING POT HOLES
Avoiding big financial missteps is just as important (or even more so) to your financial success as making good investments. We review and discuss everything that touches you financially.
We start with a review of your insurance coverages (property and casualty, liability, life, health and long-term care) to ensure your family isn’t unduly exposed to any risks that could derail your financial progress.
We evaluate your investments to identify risky concentrations in a single company stock, illiquid asset, or market sector.
We advise on income tax strategies as well as estate planning techniques to help you retain a greater percentage of every dollar you earn.
STAYING ON TRACK
Insurance, Taxes, Retirement Plans, Investments, Charitable Gifting, Preservation of an Estate – none can be addressed just once and then put on auto-pilot. As your life circumstances inevitably change, you will need to make adjustments to some or all of your well-laid plans.
When you become a client of Shine, we monitor your progress on all financial fronts and help you make adjustments along the way to ensure you stay on track.
We continuously monitor your investments and make changes when needed to balance appropriate risks with potential reward.
Our financial advisory service includes phone calls and in-person meetings regularly and as needed.
SAFE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MONEY
Everybody has questions about their finances. Some are basic, some are more complicated. Let us give you the kind of thoughtful answers and guidance that we’d give our own families.
As we work through your questions, the financial decisions become easier—and clearer. Your life becomes less complicated. Your odds of success—in many of your most important personal goals—go up. You sleep better at night, because we do the worrying for you.
Unlike sales professionals, brokers or product representatives, our firm works exclusively for you. In fact, Shine is a pioneer in the fiduciary advice model putting your interests and well-being first and foremost in all the advice we give. Our only allegiance is to you.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!

We focus on the long-term drivers, the macro forces and investment themes at play across industries that are taking us into the next growth cycle.

Why a Raymond James Advisor






Our advisors have a 
legacy of serving clients differently.

                    It’s a more personal approach that goes far beyond an investment portfolio. It’s an ongoing and open dialogue about all aspects of your life, your goals and your financial vision. And it’s developing a long-term relationship built on understanding and trust. Your advisor is there for you throughout the planning and investing process, giving you objective and unbiased advice along the way.
                



Who Our Advisors Serve


Raymond James advisors serve clients with a variety of sophisticated financial planning needs. From families and individuals to business owners and institutions, your Raymond James advisor has the expertise and experience to provide guidance for a wide range of financial planning needs. They’ll take care of the big picture and the finer details with an approach that is as disciplined as it is strategic.
Learn More



Working with an Advisor


Your advisor is there to help you reach major milestones and all of the smaller ones in between. You’ll work together to build a customized plan just for you, taking into account all of your objectives, while weighing risk, prioritizing trade-offs and accounting for “what ifs.” And because your plan is a living document, your advisor will continually adapt it while utilizing the latest technology to identify potential unknowns and your changing needs, making adjustments that will help you reach your financial goals.

Get one-on-oneinvestment helpwith advisor referral.

Lorem ipsum



			Life's complex. Setting your financial goals doesn't have to be. That's why we offer a complimentary goal planning
			session with one of our Financial Consultants to help get you started with setting up an actionable plan for your future.
		

			Call us at 800-870-9668 to start setting your financial goals. 
Lorem ipsum







The four easy steps to goal planning
Having concrete goals gives you confidence as you prepare for your future. Here at TD Ameritrade, we make goal planning easy, and it all starts with a call.


Making the call

Make an appointment to meet with a Financial Consultant either in person, or over the phone. We’ll ask you to gather some relevant information about your investment objectives and strategies so we can start drafting a detailed analysis.






Setting your goals

During your goal planning session, we’ll evaluate your goals based on a number of factors, including your desired retirement age, assets, net worth, and how you want to spend your time—and money.






Planning together

We’ll determine how likely you are to achieve your financial goals based on various factors. We’re also able to see how hypothetical situations could influence your plan.






Leaving with a plan

End the session with an actionable plan in hand, and the confidence you need to know you’re on the right track.











IMPORTANT: The projections or other information generated by the TD Ameritrade Goal Planning tool (“Goal Planning”) regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. Goal Planning results may vary with each use and over time.



















Stay on target after your goal planning session
Sometimes goals change as life happens. That's why our Financial Consultants are always available after your complimentary goal planning session to help adjust your plan as needed.Schedule your goal planning session today by calling 800-870-9668.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
