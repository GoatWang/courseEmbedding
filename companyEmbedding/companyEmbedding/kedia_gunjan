MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--U.S. Bank, the fifth largest commercial bank in the United States, 
      announced today that it has named Gunjan Kedia as vice chairman of its 
      Wealth Management & Securities Services division. Kedia has more than 20 
      years of financial services experience, most recently as executive vice

      “Our Wealth Management & Securities Services businesses are important 
      components of our diversified business model. Wealth Management is 
      steadily growing as Americans focus on their retirement readiness. In 
      addition, we have leadership positions in all of our Securities Services 
      market segments, giving us a competitive stronghold,” Cecere said. “We 
      are thrilled to add Gunjan to our management team. She is a 
      forward-thinking leader with a deep understanding of the banking and 
      asset management industries. We are confident that she will lead us into

      York Mellon, where she served as an executive vice president and led the 
      global product management function for their global asset servicing 
      business. In addition, she was a partner at McKinsey & Company and a 
      core leader of their Financial Services practice and an associate at 
      PricewaterhouseCoopers.
    

      “It is a privilege to join such an exceptional, world-class financial 
      institution,” Kedia said. “U.S. Bank is a purpose-driven organization 
      that invests in its customers, communities, and each other every day. I 
      look forward to connecting with the team and being part of its long-term 
      growth story.”
    

      Kedia earned a bachelor’s degree in engineering from the Delhi School of 
      Engineering, and an MBA from Carnegie Mellon University. She has served 
      on the boards of directors of the American Red Cross of Massachusetts,
