                          Relizorb™ (immobilized lipase)                        

















RELiZORB™ is a first-of-its kind digestive enzyme cartridge designed to mimic the function of pancreatic lipase. RELiZORB is designed for use by adults on enteral tube feeding who have trouble breaking down and absorbing fats. RELiZORB is developed using Alcresta’s proprietary enzyme immobilization technology. The active ingredient in RELiZORB is the digestive enzyme lipase, attached to polymeric carriers together called iLipase™.
As the enteral tube feeding formula passes through RELiZORB, it makes contact with the iLipase, and the fat in the formula is broken down to its absorbable form (fatty acids and monoglycerides) prior to ingestion. The iLipase remains in the cartridge and does not become part of what is ingested. Relizorb has been shown to break down 90% of fats in enteral feeding tube formulas, including the most difficult to break down long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and arachidonic acid (AA), which are critical for growth and development.
Over time, decreased fat absorption can lead to deficiencies in important fatty acids, such as omega-3. A balanced ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids is beneficial in maintaining normal development and overall health.

Alcresta Therapeutics Receives 510(k) Clearance For Use of RELiZORB® 
      in Children




RELiZORB, The Only Digestive Enzyme Cartridge for Patients Requiring 
      Supplemental Enteral Nutrition, Now Cleared to Help Children Suffering 
      from Fat Malabsorption






July 20, 2017 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



WARREN, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc., dedicated to developing products designed 
      to address nutritional challenges faced by patients with Cystic 
      Fibrosis, Chronic Pancreatitis, Pancreatic Cancer, Gastric Cancer, and 
      other serious diseases, announced that it has received 510(k) clearance 
      from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for its RELiZORB 
      digestive enzyme cartridge for use in pediatric patients suffering from 
      fat malabsorption. RELiZORB was cleared in 2015 for use in patients 18 
      years and older. This latest clearance will extend the use in children 
      as young as 5 years old.
    


      Children have a tendency toward reduced metabolic reserves in the form 
      of muscle and fat tissues, when compared to adults. This is due to the 
      increased energy requirements associated with normal growth and 
      development. As a result, children are much more susceptible to the 
      effects of poor nutrition; especially in medical conditions like cystic 
      fibrosis or pancreatitis in which their ability to convert food into 
      energy, as well as into important cellular and tissue building blocks, 
      is compromised 1.
    

      RELiZORB is the only external digestive enzyme therapy 
      designed to mimic the normal pancreatic function of lipase. Pancreatic 
      lipase is a critical enzyme in the digestion of dietary fats and 
      accounts for as much as 90% of fat breakdown by the human body. The 
      inability to absorb fats leads to problems in gaining or maintaining a 
      healthy weight, as well as a deficiency of healthy fats, such as omega-3 
      fats similar to those found in fish oil and fat-soluble vitamins. These 
      patients are more likely to suffer from gastrointestinal problems such 
      as stomach pain, excess gas, stool-related problems, bloating and 
      nausea. They often have to supplement their oral food intake with 
      enteral tube feedings that are administered overnight. RELiZORB® 
      significantly increases fat absorption by breaking down fats found in 
      enteral nutrition formulas, leading to an increased availability of 
      critical calories and important healthy fats that may otherwise pass 
      through the body unabsorbed.
    

      “This clearance represents a significant milestone for children who 
      suffer from fat malabsorption,” said Daniel Tassé, Chief Executive 
      Officer of Alcresta Therapeutics. “FDA clearance for extending the use 
      of RELiZORB into the pediatric population is a significant step forward 
      in addressing the nutritional challenges confronting this critically-ill 
      population.”
    

      Data from a recent pivotal clinical study, known as the 497 Study, 
      supported this clearance. The findings were recently published in the 
      July issue of the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition 
      entitled, Increased Fat Absorption From Enteral Formula Through an 
      In-line Digestive Cartridge in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis.2


      “The 497 Study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of RELiZORB use in 
      correcting deficiencies of healthy fats that are often observed in 
      patients receiving enteral nutrition,” said Eric First, M.D., Chief 
      Scientific Officer, Alcresta Therapeutics.

NEWTON, Mass., June 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc., a company focused on developing innovative enzyme-based products for gastrointestinal and rare diseases, today announced the commercial launch of its RELiZORB product, a first-of-its-kind digestive enzyme cartridge. 








RELiZORB is designed to mimic the function of the digestive enzyme lipase to break down fats in enteral tube feeding formula. By breaking down fats in enteral tube feeding formulas prior to ingestion, RELiZORB allows for the delivery of absorbable fatty acids and monoglycerides for adult patients who are unable to partially or completely break down and absorb fats.
Patients with fat malabsorption due to compromised pancreatic function lack the pancreatic enzymes necessary to properly digest and absorb fats from their diet. This has two potential consequences: first, this limits the caloric and vital nutrient intake and the ability of patients to maintain or gain weight; and second, the malabsorption of fats can cause significant gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., steatorrhea, flatulence, cramps) which may affect patient quality of life and adherence with treatment.
When patients with fat malabsorption, such as those with cystic fibrosis or pancreatic or liver disease, cannot maintain their weight or develop nutritional deficits, they often rely on supplemental nutrition through a gastrostomy tube (or G-tube) to meet their nutritional needs. Until the FDA clearance of RELiZORB in November of 2015, there had been no approved products available to break down or hydrolyze fats in enteral tube feeding formulas.
The launch of RELiZORB will be focused on adults with cystic fibrosis who rely on enteral nutrition. Approximately 90 percent of patients with cystic fibrosis have fat malabsorption, and about 10-15% of patients with cystic fibrosis rely on enteral nutrition in order to meet their nutritional needs.
"The launch of RELiZORB, our flagship enzyme-based product, for use in adult patients with cystic fibrosis who rely on daily enteral feeding to support their medical and nutritional needs marks a hopeful day for patients that suffer from this condition," said Daniel Tassé, Chief Executive Officer of Alcresta Therapeutics.  
According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's 2014 Patient Registry Annual Data Report, nutrition status and lung function are related, and improvements in body mass index (BMI) are associated with increased pulmonary function. The correlation between lung function and BMI reinforces the need for individuals to maintain adequate weight gain and absorb critical fatty acids and other nutrients. 
In 2013, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, the nonprofit drug discovery and development affiliate of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, issued an award to Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc. to accelerate the development of products to optimize the benefits of enteral feeding in people living with CF.
"The launch of RELiZORB for use in adult patients with cystic fibrosis who receive enteral tube feeding is just the beginning for us as we continue our efforts to bring innovative products to people in need of improved nutritional care," said Robert Gallotto, Co-Founder and President of Alcresta Therapeutics.

Over time, decreased fat absorption can lead to deficiencies in important fatty acids, such as omega-3 fatty acids. A balanced ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids is beneficial in maintaining normal development and overall health.
About Cystic Fibrosis 
Cystic fibrosis is a progressive, genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time.  In people with CF, a defective gene causes a thick, buildup of mucus in the lungs, pancreas and other organs. In the lungs, the mucus clogs the airways and traps bacteria leading to infections, extensive lung damage and eventually, respiratory failure. In the pancreas, the mucus prevents the release of digestive enzymes that allow the body to break down food and absorb vital nutrients.

Alcresta Therapeutics Receives 510(K) Clearance for Use of RELiZORB® in Children
Jul 20 17
Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc. announced that it has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for its RELiZORB digestive enzyme cartridge for use in pediatric patients suffering from fat malabsorption. RELiZORB was cleared in 2015 for use in patients 18 years and older. This latest clearance will extend the use in children as young as 5 years old. Children have a tendency toward reduced metabolic reserves in the form of muscle and fat tissues, when compared to adults. This is due to the increased energy requirements associated with normal growth and development. As a result, children are much more susceptible to the effects of poor nutrition; especially in medical conditions like cystic fibrosis or pancreatitis in which their ability to convert food into energy, as well as into important cellular and tissue building blocks, is compromised.


Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc. Announces Data from the Clinical Study of RELiZORB
Oct 28 16
Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc. announced data from the clinical study of RELiZORB, a novel in-line digestive enzyme cartridge designed specifically for use by patients receiving enteral tube feeding who have trouble breaking down and absorbing fats. These results were presented at the 30th Annual Meeting of the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference (NACFC) in Orlando, Florida. This study was conducted in pediatric and adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) receiving enteral feeding. The absorption of fat was calculated by assessing changes in plasma concentrations over 24 hours of physiologically relevant long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), such as omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). DHA and EPA are not only sources of energy, but are also essential components of cell membranes, and are integral in maintaining normal development and overall health. RELiZORB use, compared with administration through placebo, resulted in a statistically significant 2.8 fold improvement (p<0.001) in total DHA and EPA absorption. The study also found that RELiZORB use during the administration of enteral nutrition across both pediatric and adult patients with CF and EPI was found to be safe and well tolerated. There was a decrease in the frequency and severity of GI symptoms, particularly stool-related symptoms, associated with fat malabsorption. Importantly, more patients had a preservation of appetite and were able to eat breakfast.


Alcresta Therapeutics Inc. Launches RELiZORB Product
Jun 7 16
Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc. announced the commercial launch of its RELiZORB product, a digestive enzyme cartridge. RELiZORB is designed to mimic the function of the digestive enzyme lipase to break down fats in enteral tube feeding formula. By breaking down fats in enteral tube feeding formulas prior to ingestion, RELiZORB allows for the delivery of absorbable fatty acids and monoglycerides for adult patients who are unable to partially or completely break down and absorb fats. The launch of RELiZORB will be focused on adults with cystic fibrosis who rely on enteral nutrition. RELiZORB is designed for use by adults on enteral tube feeding who have trouble breaking down and absorbing fats. RELiZORB was developed using Alcresta Therapeutics' proprietary enzyme immobilization technology. The active ingredient in RELiZORB is the digestive enzyme lipase, attached to polymeric carriers, together called iLipase™. As the enteral tube feeding formula passes through RELiZORB it makes contact with the iLipase, and the fat in the formula is broken down to its absorbable form prior to ingestion. The iLipase remains in the cartridge and does not become part of what is ingested. RELiZORB has been shown to break down more than 90% of fats in most enteral feeding tube formulas tested, including the most difficult to break down long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and arachidonic acid, which are critical for growth and development. Over time, decreased fat absorption can lead to deficiencies in important fatty acids, such as omega-3 fatty acids. A balanced ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids is beneficial in maintaining normal development and overall health.

NEWTON, Mass., June 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc., a company focused on developing innovative enzyme-based products for gastrointestinal and rare diseases, today announced the commercial launch of its RELiZORB product, a first-of-its-kind digestive enzyme cartridge. RELiZORB is designed to mimic the function of the digestive enzyme lipase to break down fats in enteral tube feeding formula. By breaking down fats in enteral tube feeding formulas prior to ingestion, RELiZORB allows for the delivery of absorbable fatty acids and monoglycerides for adult patients who are unable to partially or completely break down and absorb fats.Patients with fat malabsorption due to compromised pancreatic function lack the pancreatic enzymes necessary to properly digest and absorb fats from their diet. This has two potential consequences: first, this limits the caloric and vital nutrient intake and the ability of patients to maintain or gain weight; and second, the malabsorption of fats can cause significant gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., steatorrhea, flatulence, cramps) which may affect patient quality of life and adherence with treatment.When patients with fat malabsorption, such as those with cystic fibrosis or pancreatic or liver disease, cannot maintain their weight or develop nutritional deficits, they often rely on supplemental nutrition through a gastrostomy tube (or G-tube) to meet their nutritional needs. Until the FDA clearance of RELiZORB in November of 2015, there had been no approved products available to break down or hydrolyze fats in enteral tube feeding formulas.The launch of RELiZORB will be focused on adults with cystic fibrosis who rely on enteral nutrition. Approximately 90 percent of patients with cystic fibrosis have fat malabsorption, and about 10-15% of patients with cystic fibrosis rely on enteral nutrition in order to meet their nutritional needs."The launch of RELiZORB, our flagship enzyme-based product, for use in adult patients with cystic fibrosis who rely on daily enteral feeding to support their medical and nutritional needs marks a hopeful day for patients that suffer from this condition," said Daniel Tassé, Chief Executive Officer of Alcresta Therapeutics.  According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's 2014 Patient Registry Annual Data Report, nutrition status and lung function are related, and improvements in body mass index (BMI) are associated with increased pulmonary function. The correlation between lung function and BMI reinforces the need for individuals to maintain adequate weight gain and absorb critical fatty acids and other nutrients. In 2013, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, the nonprofit drug discovery and development affiliate of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, issued an award to Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc. to accelerate the development of products to optimize the benefits of enteral feeding in people living with CF."The launch of RELiZORB for use in adult patients with cystic fibrosis who receive enteral tube feeding is just the beginning for us as we continue our efforts to bring innovative products to people in need of improved nutritional care," said Robert Gallotto, Co-Founder and President of Alcresta Therapeutics.About RELiZORBRELiZORB is a first-of-its-kind digestive enzyme cartridge designed to mimic the function of pancreatic lipase. RELiZORB is designed for use by adults on enteral tube feeding who have trouble breaking down and absorbing fats. RELiZORB was developed using Alcresta Therapeutics' proprietary enzyme immobilization technology.  The active ingredient in RELiZORB is the digestive enzyme lipase, attached to polymeric carriers, together called iLipase.As the enteral tube feeding formula passes through RELiZORB it makes contact with the iLipase, and the fat in the formula is broken down to its absorbable form (fatty acids and monoglycerides) prior to ingestion. The iLipase remains in the cartridge and does not become part of what is ingested. RELiZORB has been shown to break down more than 90 percent of fats in most enteral feeding tube formulas tested, including the most difficult to break down long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (AA), which are critical for growth and development.  Over time, decreased fat absorption can lead to deficiencies in important fatty acids, such as omega-3 fatty acids. A balanced ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids is beneficial in maintaining normal development and overall health.About Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is a progressive, genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time.  In people with CF, a defective gene causes a thick, buildup of mucus in the lungs, pancreas and other organs. In the lungs, the mucus clogs the airways and traps bacteria leading to infections, extensive lung damage and eventually, respiratory failure. In the pancreas, the mucus prevents the release of digestive enzymes that allow the body to break down food and absorb vital nutrients.About Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc.Alcresta Therapeutics is a company dedicated to developing and commercializing novel enzyme-based products designed to address challenges faced by people living with gastrointestinal disorders and rare diseases. The company uses its proprietary technology platform to support a broad pipeline of products, with an initial focus on pancreatic insufficiency, which results in malabsorption common in cystic fibrosis, digestive cancers, premature birth and other serious diseases. The company's lead product, RELiZORB, is designed to reliably and efficiently deliver the optimal nutritional and caloric benefit from existing enteral tube feeding formulas by improving the breakdown and absorption of fats, in particular long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids like omega-3 (including DHA, EPA). The importance of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids like omega-3 is well documented across the full spectrum of patient care from infants to adults and individuals battling acute conditions or chronic diseases. The company's platform is supported by the Alcresta team's extensive experience in pharmaceutical, medical device, and nutritional product development. Based in Massachusetts, the company is backed by top-tier venture investors like Athyrium Capital Management, Bessemer Venture Partners, Frazier Healthcare and Third Rock Ventures.
