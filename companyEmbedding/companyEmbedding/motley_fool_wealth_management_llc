A: We absolutely understand your fear. And you're absolutely not alone.
You're investing your hard-earned dollars to make your dreams come true, not to see it drip out of your brokerage account like change through a hole in your pocket.
The truth is that loss happens. Even the world's best investors pick the occasional dud.

Bob A.


"I use the Fool to do the things that I don't have time to do. If you have a busy life and want to invest in the market, this is one of the best vehicles to support you in doing that."


And see the advice Linda has for folks just getting started with investing...



Linda Q.


"If I can do it, you can do it. I was able to buy my house because of investments through here. There’s a [30-day] membership fee-back guarantee, so go right ahead. It won’t hurt. It’s been a life-changing experience for me."

Wall Street is getting it all wrong... And we believe the little guy can outsmart the market with a simple investing strategy
Our time-tested investing approach has resulted in market-beating returns. In fact, The Motley Fool's newsletter services earned the top three spots in Wall Street Journal columnist Mark Hulbert's August 2013 ranking of more than 200 services he tracks.





The Motley Fool's Secret to Uncovering Wealth-Building Buys




Buy Businesses, Not TickersStraight from the mouth of famed investor Peter Lynch, we buy into a company's prospects, future, and management, and we put our money into companies that will generate shareholder value over the long term.


Be a Lifetime InvestorWe're investors that believe the best way to beat the market is to hold stocks for the long term. But we don't just buy and forget about our stocks. We dive deep into research, keep a close eye on our investing thesis, and relentlessly pursue compelling stocks we think will outperform.




Fish Where Others Aren'tWe're not interested in following the crowds or what Wall Street thinks is the next hot stock. That's a money-losing strategy! We are interested in thinking for ourselves and scoring profits with unbiased research.


Be Foolish and Have FunMany believe the little guy can't win in the market, but we believe our members can beat Wall Street professionals... and we think you should have fun along the way.

Motley Fool Wealth Management





























Motley Fool Wealth Management

All of the Foolish investment philosophies you love — none of the day-to-day investing hassles you don't
Simply scroll down to discover exactly how we can put this "auto-pilot" investment solution to work for you! 






First we’ll ask you a few easy questions…



That way we can get to know you and your financial situation a little better, and we can begin building you a Foolish portfolio that is custom-tailored to your age, goals, and risk-tolerance.
Based on what you tell us, we can allocate your Foolish Separately Managed Account (SMA) across a precise blend of several unique investment strategies inspired by many of The Motley Fool, LLC's services you already know and trust — including PRO, Supernova, and Million Dollar Portfolio.



























Next, we’ll show you the Foolish portfolio we’ve custom-built just for you…
As you can see from the example portfolios below, our team can handle all of your Foolish investing for you, whether you're just starting out, working towards retirement, or already retired. Of course, these are only hypothetical portfolios designed for 8 types of investors with very different circumstances and goals. 






Meet Frank
Frank is in his mid-60’s, is already enjoying retirement, and has a portfolio just a bit over a half a million dollars. Market drops tend to keep him up a bit at night – particularly with a son already in college and a daughter about to go off to school as well. So as he continues taking advantage of retirement, he knows he needs to continue growing his portfolio while simultaneously protecting its downside as well. While Frank was able to weather the stock market crash of 2008 rather well, he worries about how his portfolio would do if another crash hit.

Meet Olivia
Now 65 and already in retirement with more than a half million dollar portfolio, Olivia was calm, cool, and collected throughout the 2008 financial crisis and loves investing in high growth stocks. That said, without the previous large and consistent stream of revenue from her successful career as an environmental attorney, she fully understands the need to effectively manage her risk and not take too many chances with her portfolio in order to leave a lasting legacy for her three grandchildren.

Meet Oscar
Oscar, 53, plans to retire within a decade and has already built a strong portfolio for himself worth more than $250,000 — most of which came from his steady career as a computer programmer. Although he did sell some stock during the 2008 financial crisis, he can tolerate a good deal of risk and even gets enthusiastic about the prospect of buying more stock at a reduced price after a major sell-off. If he keeps taking advantage of those opportunities, he should be well on his way to a comfortable retirement in a decade or less now that his only daughter has graduated college.

Meet Leonard
Leonard is 39 and still a couple of decades out from retirement, but his successful career at such a young age as a hot-shot graphics designer for a prestigious advertising firm has allowed him to already amass a more than quarter million dollar portfolio — allowing him to already start saving up for college for his three daughters. So you can see why he's a moderate risk-taker who tends to get uncomfortable when the market drops, and did sell a bit of stock during the 2008 financial crisis. But if he keeps up his current pace of investing, he should have well over a million dollars in his portfolio by the time he retires in roughly 20 years.

Meet Eric
Eric is roughly a decade from retirement, and with his steady career as a Certified Public Accountant, he's worked hard to build up a nearly $200,000 portfolio. He generally likes investing in higher growth, higher risk companies, but now that he's turning 50 in a few months, he does tend to get uncomfortable when a stock he likes takes a big hit — especially with a son and daughter currently in college. That said, even though investment losses make his stomach churn, he did have the foresight to buy more stock after the market dipped in 2008.

Meet Darian
Darian's level-headed and hugely risk-tolerant approach to investing has netted him a more than $600,000 portfolio, even though he's only 52 and still roughly a decade out from retirement after a quarter century running his own local grocery store. He's fully composed when his stocks drop, and happily bought more at a bargain price when the market tanked in 2008. With his aggressive investment approach, coupled with an ability to keep calm during (and even take advantage of) rough market times, he's well on his way to not only topping a million dollar portfolio by the time he retires, but also leaving a lasting legacy for his newborn granddaughter.

Meet Phillip
Although Phillip's still about two decades out from retirement, his hugely successful career as an up-and-coming investment banker at J.P. Morgan has already allowed him to amass a portfolio worth $1.25 million at the age of just 37. Even though he tends to get uncomfortable when the market drops, Phillip avoided selling any stock during the 2008 pullback. He embraces a solid amount of risk, and is well on his way to his goal of $3-5 million portfolio, or more, by the time he retires.

Meet Rita
Rita, 64, has settled in nicely to retirement. Although she typically sticks with a more conservative investment strategy, she calmly weathered the 2008 financial crisis — even buying more shares to take advantage of the drop. Now with a $2.73 million portfolio, she has plenty of money to not only take care of her five grandchildren, but buy the summer home in Nantucket that she's always wanted.

Then you can simply sit back, relax, and let us manage your Foolish portfolio for you!









After you accept the personalized portfolio we have designed for you, we'll send you over to our partners at Interactive Brokers with everything you need to open and fund your Foolish Separately Managed Account…

Like raising your family… building your own business… furthering your career… pursuing your passions… or even just enjoying your retirement.


The bottom line is that Motley Fool Wealth Management can make Foolish investing easier, more personalized, and less time-consuming than you ever thought possible — so you can do more with your days and sleep easier at night!

Many Fools have been asking why Motley Fool Wealth Management chose Interactive Brokers as our exclusive partner for Foolish SMAs...
And while it's true that Barron's recently named Interactive Brokers as the No. 1 discount online brokerage in the world for three years running...
The truth of the matter is that after countless hours of meetings with a variety of online brokerage companies, Motley Fool Wealth Management ultimately selected Interactive Brokers as our exclusive partner for Foolish SMAs because of their...

 Wide range of investment options...
 Superior trading platform...
 And low-cost trading fees...

We'll discuss fees more fully once you're ready to take the next step — but for the sake of complete transparency, we do want to point out that while you won't have to pay a single extra cent to have our team build and manage a portfolio for you beyond the flat fee that you'll pay upfront to become a client of Motley Fool Wealth Management...
Interactive Brokers will charge you a maintenance fee of $7.50 per quarter for any IRAs that we manage on your behalf. And there will also be small trading fees that will have to be paid to Interactive Brokers anytime a security is bought or sold on your behalf...
But the good news is that these fees typically run less than 1/3 of a cent per share — meaning if the Motley Fool Wealth Management team buys or sells 100 shares of stock on your behalf, the total fees that would be paid to Interactive Brokers out of your account would amount to just roughly 33 cents.
(Please note that for any accounts with balances of less than $100,000, Interactive Brokers will impose a $10 monthly minimum trading fee.)
As you might imagine, these are among the absolute lowest trading fees you'll ever see. And as you probably well know, it's not uncommon to pay upwards of $10 anytime you trade any number of shares in your own brokerage account...
And it's just one of the many reasons we're confident you'll be just as impressed with Interactive Brokers as we have been.
Which bring us to another very important point ... while you will be giving Motley Fool Wealth Management permission to make trades on your behalf, all of your money and investments will actually be held by Interactive Brokers — and the only person who will ever be able to touch the money in your account will be YOU.
This is just another of the many steps the Fool Wealth team has happily taken to enhance transparency and ensure that what we're offering is as straightforward, secure, and "Fool friendly" as possible.
Granted, this does mean that if the account you want to have managed is held at a different brokerage — like Schwab, Fidelity, or TD Ameritrade — you will have to transfer your account over to Interactive Brokers in order to have the Fool Wealth team manage it for you...
While we realize this may sound a bit daunting, you can rest assured that the Fool Wealth team will provide you with all the necessary paperwork and absolutely everything else you need to make this transition as smooth and efficient as possible. 
And, of course, there will be Client Care Experts standing by via phone and chat should you get hung up at any point or need any kind of assistance whatsoever.

Nick Crow, CFA



Nick is one of the most eclectic investors to have come up through the ranks of The Motley Fool, LLC. As a senior analyst, he contributed to the portfolio-management decisions and security selection for Motley Fool Pro, Motley Fool Options, and various other newsletter services. Tasked with identifying and developing the next generation of investing talent, Nick led a team that retooled and decentralized The Motley Fool’s selective Analyst Development Program. 
As president of MFWM, Nick is responsible for overseeing the trading and operational teams who support SMAs. He works closely with the portfolio managers to develop and oversee the investment strategies — and develop future wealth management offerings.
Though both a lifelong investor and Fool, before joining The Motley Fool and then Motley Fool Wealth Management, Nick learned valuable leadership skills by proudly serving as a paratrooper in the U.S. Army. Later he used these skills to advise clients, manage teams, and create a development program serving bankers who provided investment advice at a major bank. 
Nick has a B.A. in business administration and earned the right to use the Chartered Financial Analyst designation.

Megan Brinsfield, CPA, CFP®



Megan is a rare breed, in that she enjoys specializing in areas that most would rather avoid - individual tax and estate planning. She began her career as a CPA, mainly working with high-net-worth families and business owners. She spent several years working almost exclusively with corporate executives of Fortune 500 companies. In addition to financial planning responsibilities, she led the income tax compliance function in her previous role.

An entrepreneur at heart, Ross loves helping small business owners navigate financial markets; he also has a penchant for using options as short-term instruments for leveraging long-term ideas.
Ross is a graduate of Christopher Newport University, where he obtained a BSBA with a focus in finance and communications, and became a Certified Financial Planner™ in 2012 after studying at the College for Financial Planning. When he's not poring over financial statements and tax returns, Ross enjoys golfing, skiing, and honing his skills as a DJ.

Jeff is excited about some of the initiatives for MFWM that will deliver value to clients earlier in our process. 
There is no “average day” for Jeff, since his work touches all aspects of our service. He could be working on how to display information on our webpage one day, and making backend processes work more smoothly on the next. One thing is constant in his work – he likes solving logic puzzles, and being creative by coming up with solutions that may not be obvious. 
Jeff graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in Information Systems. He plays several musical instruments and enjoys running, but mostly thinks of himself as a boring dad to his two children. His third child is a cat names Tobias, inspired by a character from the TV show Arrested Development.

Nick Crow, CFA



Nick is one of the most eclectic investors to have come up through the ranks of The Motley Fool, LLC. As a senior analyst, he contributed to the portfolio-management decisions and security selection for Motley Fool Pro, Motley Fool Options, and various other newsletter services.

Later he used these skills to advise clients, manage teams, and create a development program serving bankers who provided investment advice at a major bank. 
Nick has a B.A. in business administration and earned the right to use the Chartered Financial Analyst designation.

Megan Brinsfield, CPA, CFP®



Megan is a rare breed, in that she enjoys specializing in areas that most would rather avoid - individual tax and estate planning. She began her career as a CPA, mainly working with high-net-worth families and business owners. She spent several years working almost exclusively with corporate executives of Fortune 500 companies. In addition to financial planning responsibilities, she led the income tax compliance function in her previous role. 
Megan came to Motley Fool Wealth Management in 2014 with a desire to help investors put together ALL the pieces of their financial well-being instead of just handling taxes — and to have the opportunity to enjoy weekends between January and April every year.
She graduated with a BS in Commerce from The University of Virginia and has a Master of Accounting from The Ohio State University. Megan loves horseback riding and travel, but she has never traveled on horseback. She may be the only CPA you know who has run with the bulls in Pamplona.

Ross Anderson, CFP®



Having spent time in major Wall Street brokerage houses, Ross became aware of the disconnect between what's best for investors and what's best for brokers. Today, he's happy to serve as a Foolish financial planner and put your interests first – and believes that the best financial advice is holistic and, most important, actionable. An entrepreneur at heart, Ross loves helping small business owners navigate financial markets; he also has a penchant for using options as short-term instruments for leveraging long-term ideas.
Ross is a graduate of Christopher Newport University, where he obtained a BSBA with a focus in finance and communications, and became a Certified Financial Planner™ in 2012 after studying at the College for Financial Planning. When he's not poring over financial statements and tax returns, Ross enjoys golfing, skiing, and honing his skills as a DJ.

Sean F. Gates, CFP®, CLU



Sean embodies an ethos of extreme saving in his personal life, but as a Foolish Financial Planner at Motley Fool Wealth Management, he is busy developing impactful, tax-saving, wealth-building strategies for our clients. Sean started down the path to becoming a financial planner after his father's retirement benefits were cut, and as he saw the stress that money decisions have on people. Sean completed his Certified Financial Planning™ board-certified program at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. 
Building on his education, Sean entered the financial-services industry in 2007, helping families build comprehensive financial plans. He codified this background with his CFP® designation in 2013. Working in the trenches, Sean recognized that incentives drive behavior and watched financial professionals rationalize selling expensive investment products. Seeing such a lack of integrity around him, he jumped at the chance to work at Motley Fool Wealth Management, starting in 2014.

Amanda B. Kish, CFA, CFP®



Amanda is excited to be a part of the talented team at Motley Fool Wealth Management.

Joseph Perna, CFP®, CLU



After turning an internship into a full-time position as a financial advisor at a prominent Wall Street firm, Joe saw firsthand how monetary incentives in the financial services industry could shift the focus from a client’s need to an advisor’s pocket. Joe would rather focus on providing honest advice to help clients meet their goals. In addition to his experience with investments, he spent time in the risk management industry, providing internal consulting on disability insurance, life insurance, and long-term care insurance to representatives of Northwestern Mutual.

Mohna Shah



As Director of Operations and Cat Herder Extraordinaire, Mohna is responsible for making sure Fool Wealth runs like a well-oiled machine. She is particularly skilled at setting other Fools up for success – whether that’s clearly documenting procedures, enforcing compliance requirements, or facilitating communication with our brokerage partner, Interactive Brokers.
Someday, Mohna aspires to wear as many hats as Chris Harris. But for now, she handles promotion fulfillment, trade error reporting, recordkeeping, AUM billing, special-snowflake wrangling, fitness coaching, and anything else that doesn’t neatly fall into someone else’s role.
Mohna graduated from Emory University with a degree in Economics and subsequently earned her Masters in Professional Accounting from the University of Texas at Austin. She lives in Washington, DC with her husband and their adorable cat, Puig. Outside of work, she’s usually running or reading, and she tries to have her passport stamped at least once a year.

Derek Newman



Derek was introduced to The Motley Fool during his years at the Securities and Exchange Commission, where he was the examiner of the filings done for Motley Fool Funds.

Now he spends his days as the go-to person for our regulated businesses, whether that involves ensuring day-to-day compliance, determining how the latest SEC guidance impacts our operations, or investigating [confidential] new ventures.
After completing his undergraduate work at The College of New Jersey, Derek received his JD from Syracuse University College of Law. Although he set out to be a history professor, he was guided into the field of law when he was working in politics. Derek has a winning trifecta of legal experience – years spent working for respected law firms, a large asset management company, and most recently the Securities and Exchange Commission.
If you think all lawyers are heartless, you haven’t met Derek.

Anthony Price



Anthony's role is one of the most important jobs in all of Fool Wealth – he’s one part of the three-man team that works with our portfolio managers to execute trades in our clients’ accounts. He also works with our brokerage partner, Interactive Brokers, to implement new initiatives such as the ability to trade in fractional shares within Separately Managed Accounts. Goodbye cash drift, and thank you Mr. Price!

He has had a long career in Accounting and Finance, with roles including Accounts Payable, Receivable, Contract Management, and trading The Motley Fool LLC's real money portfolios. When the opportunity came to build Motley Fool Wealth Management from the ground up with respected Foolish investor Nick Crow in 2014, Anthony accepted the challenge.
When he’s not dodging nerf darts at the office, Anthony can be found grilling in his back yard (Do I sense a competition, Bo Boland??), watching the many food channels on TV, or brushing up on his knowledge as a car enthusiast.

He spent some time working as a business analyst with CAPS, later attending law school and joining the legal team as Associate General Counsel in 2010.

Spencer Holleman



Spencer joined The Motley Fool, LLC in 2013 as a web developer, and joined the Motley Fool Wealth Management team in 2015. As a Software Engineer, Spencer works on designing, building, and maintaining the systems that make everything on our website work. Whether it’s physical objects or software, he enjoys building things and likes the challenge of solving consequential problems. Spencer recalls the first experience that got him hooked on a career in technology – as a middle schooler, he purchased a personal digital assistant (before the days of cellular phones!) and figured out how to program an adventure game into it. Motley Fool Wealth Management may not be quite the same adventure, but Spencer is still excited about what’s on the horizon for the team – index-based investing portfolios, and fractional shares just to name a few. 
Spencer has always enjoyed learning, and holds two interdisciplinary degrees from Baylor University. He lives in the DC area with his wife and two children. Outside of the office, he is involved in the Maker Community, which is a technology-based extension of the DIY community.

Jeff Lee



Jeff joined The Motley Fool, LLC in 2013 with a background in product analysis, testing, software design, and systems integration. He jumped at the opportunity to work for Motley Fool Wealth Management in its infant stages since he believed it would become an important part of the Fool’s mission to help the world invest better. Jeff is excited about some of the initiatives for MFWM that will deliver value to clients earlier in our process. 
There is no “average day” for Jeff, since his work touches all aspects of our service. He could be working on how to display information on our webpage one day, and making backend processes work more smoothly on the next. One thing is constant in his work – he likes solving logic puzzles, and being creative by coming up with solutions that may not be obvious. 
Jeff graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in Information Systems. He plays several musical instruments and enjoys running, but mostly thinks of himself as a boring dad to his two children. His third child is a cat names Tobias, inspired by a character from the TV show Arrested Development.

David Mitchell



David is an accomplished IT professional with over twenty years of experience, and is the person that makes sure the infrastructure for our website and backend processes is working. His background with multiple databases, operating systems, web server platforms and a variety of web languages provides any project he works on with the strong technical expertise needed for a reliable backend infrastructure and user experience. 
If all of that sounded like a foreign language, just know that his work allows all the other developers on the tech team to build foolwealth.com. In thinking about what is on the horizon for Motley Fool Wealth Management he is most excited to see what role machine learning will take in the future, not only improving our lives with automation but also by helping us make optimized decisions.
David progressed down the path to a career in technology when he learned how to program in elementary school, wrote a program to test the central limit theorem and visually display the results in middle school, and build his own computer in high school. He lives with his wife and five boys. David enjoys all elements of soccer – playing, coaching youth teams, and watching the English Premier League.

Aaron Torgerson



Aaron came to The Motley Fool, LLC in 2006 as a Software Developer, where he worked on various systems that power the premium newsletters including the real-time market data system that remains intact today. Attracted by Motley Fool Wealth Management’s mission and potential to improve clients’ investing outcomes, he joined the Fool Wealth tech team in 2014.
As the head of the Tech team, Aaron is in charge of all development efforts and tech systems, and is ultimately responsible for the team’s output and product quality. He makes sure that fellow technology Fools are collaborating to complete projects, all of which manifest in our website and account trading functionality. 
Aaron graduated from Frostburg State University with a degree in Music and Vocal Performance. His passion for technology was sparked when he combined an existing computer program with his custom coding to compose music during his undergraduate studies. He also completed Computer Science coursework at University of Maryland and University of Maryland University College. Aaron does not whistle while he works (or sing while he codes) but he can be found singing with his wife at church. He lives in Annandale with his wife and three boys.

Q: "I want to invest, but I don't want to lose money."
A: We absolutely understand your fear. And you're absolutely not alone.
You're investing your hard-earned dollars to make your dreams come true, not to see it drip out of your brokerage account like change through a hole in your pocket.
The truth is that loss happens. Even the world's best investors pick the occasional dud.
But they don't panic.
They understand that if you buy and hold for the long term, it's possible one of your investments could go to 0. But you can gain many, many times more than you could ever lose.
And they play it smart.
With a portfolio made up of a dozen great stocks or more, your winners will most likely squash the ones that didn't play out the way you expected.
That strategy has helped hundreds of thousands of investors build lasting wealth. Without fear.

We understand you might still have some questions...
You still might even have some doubts...
We don't blame you.
If you're still not sure if Motley Fool newsletter services are worth checking out...
Or if they're right for you...
Here's what we recommend:
Take a look at the results Mark and Bob have been getting because they were a part of our services...



Mark T.


"Motley Fool's changed my life in this main respect: I'm financially independent today. I didn't think that would be possible until maybe my mid or late 60s. I have the ability to make choices and quality-of-life decisions now that I would never be able to make before."





Bob A.


"I use the Fool to do the things that I don't have time to do. If you have a busy life and want to invest in the market, this is one of the best vehicles to support you in doing that."


And see the advice Linda has for folks just getting started with investing...



Linda Q.


"If I can do it, you can do it. I was able to buy my house because of investments through here. There’s a [30-day] membership fee-back guarantee, so go right ahead. It won’t hurt. It’s been a life-changing experience for me."


Now it's clear what we're doing works, isn't it?
If you're looking for a magic formula or a quick fix, The Motley Fool investing newsletter services are not for you. We're all about finding fantastic companies and holding them for the long haul.
Investing riches don't magically appear overnight.
But if you're serious about your financial future and want to commit to building your lasting wealth...

Before you submit your order
Lots of people spin their wheels, collecting information, joining groups, and running in place. But you can do that your whole life and never actually get anywhere!
We don't want to be a part of that endless cycle.

And because we want to be sure you're getting into a service that's right for you, we're even offering you a full 30-day membership fee refund if you don't love it.

The Motley Fool












Wall Street is getting it all wrong... And we believe the little guy can outsmart the market with a simple investing strategy
Our time-tested investing approach has resulted in market-beating returns. In fact, The Motley Fool's newsletter services earned the top three spots in Wall Street Journal columnist Mark Hulbert's August 2013 ranking of more than 200 services he tracks.





The Motley Fool's Secret to Uncovering Wealth-Building Buys




Buy Businesses, Not TickersStraight from the mouth of famed investor Peter Lynch, we buy into a company's prospects, future, and management, and we put our money into companies that will generate shareholder value over the long term.


Be a Lifetime InvestorWe're investors that believe the best way to beat the market is to hold stocks for the long term. But we don't just buy and forget about our stocks. We dive deep into research, keep a close eye on our investing thesis, and relentlessly pursue compelling stocks we think will outperform.




Fish Where Others Aren'tWe're not interested in following the crowds or what Wall Street thinks is the next hot stock. That's a money-losing strategy! We are interested in thinking for ourselves and scoring profits with unbiased research.


Be Foolish and Have FunMany believe the little guy can't win in the market, but we believe our members can beat Wall Street professionals... and we think you should have fun along the way.

Linda Q.
