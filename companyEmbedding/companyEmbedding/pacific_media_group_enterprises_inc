The Company was established as part of the Chapter 11 Plan of
Reorganization of Pacific Shores Development, Inc. ("PSD"). In
September 2015 the Company began development of mobile apps
designed (a) to allow patients/clients to see fee quotes from
professionals such as dentists and attorneys for professional
services, and (b) to provide these professionals with prospects or
leads for new patients/clients. The Company is currently testing
the first app in preparation for its launch.

 

NOTE 2.
 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

a. BASIS
OF PRESENTATION

 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting  principles  generally
 accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"),  and
include all the notes required by GAAP for complete financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for
fair presentation of the financial statements have been
included.

 

b. USE OF
ESTIMATES

 

The
preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets
 and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the
financial  statements and the  reported  amounts of
revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting
 period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 

c. BASIC
AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARE

 

Net loss
per share is calculated in accordance with Codification topic 260,
“ Earnings Per Share ” for the periods presented.
 Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted loss per
share has not been presented because there are no dilutive items.
 Diluted earnings loss per share is based on the assumption
that all dilutive stock options, warrants, and convertible debt are
converted or exercised by applying the treasury stock method.
 Under this method, options and warrants are assumed exercised
at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if
later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase
common stock at the average market price during the period.
 Options, warrants and/or convertible debt will have a
dilutive effect, during periods of net profit, only when the
average market price of the common stock during the period exceeds
the exercise or conversion price of the items.

 

d. CASH
and CASH EQUIVALENTS

 

For
 the  Balance  Sheets  and  Statements
 of  Cash  Flows,  all  highly
 liquid investments  with  maturity of three
 months or less are  considered  to be cash
equivalents.  The Company had no cash equivalents as of
September 30, 2016.

 

e. REVENUE
RECOGNITION

 

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC topic 605 “
Revenue Recognition, and other applicable revenue recognition
guidance under US GAAP.  Sales revenue is recognized for our
retail and




6

  

wholesale
customers when: (i) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement
exists, (ii) the sales terms are fixed or determinable, (iii) title
and risk of loss have transferred, and (iv) collectability is
reasonably assured — generally when products are shipped to
the customer and services are rendered, except in situations in
which title passes upon receipt of the products by the
customer.  In this case, revenues are recognized upon services
rendered.

 

f.
 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL
ACCOUNTS

 

Accounts
receivable are recorded at invoiced amount and generally do not
bear interest. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established,
as necessary, based on past experience and other factors which, in
management's judgment, deserve current recognition in estimating
bad debts. Such factors include growth and composition of accounts
receivable, the relationship of the allowance for doubtful accounts
to accounts receivable, and current economic conditions. The
determination of the collectability of amounts due requires the
Company to make judgments regarding future events and trends.
Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on assessing
the Company ’ s portfolio on an individual customer and on an
overall basis. This process consists of a review of historical
collection experience, current aging status of the customer
account, and the financial condition of the Company ’ s
customers. Based on a review of these factors, the Company
establishes or adjusts the allowance for specific customers and the
accounts receivable portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2016 an allowance for doubtful accounts was not considered
necessary as there were no accounts receivable.

 

g.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

 

Codification
topic 718 “ Stock Compensation ” requires the cost
resulting from all share-based transactions be recorded in the
financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement
objective for share-based payment transactions with employees and
acquired goods or services from non-employees.  The
codification also provides guidance on valuing and expensing these
awards, as well as disclosure requirements of these equity
arrangements.  The Company adopted the codification upon its
creation and will expense share based costs in the period incurred.
 The Company completed one share-based transaction for mobile
app development and programming services on April 1, 2016 valued at
$9,000.

 

h. INCOME
TAXES

 

Income
taxes are provided in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards
Classification.  A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded
for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting
and net operating loss carry forwards.  Deferred tax expense
(benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred
tax assets and liabilities.

 

Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the
opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 Deferred  tax assets  and  liabilities
 are adjusted  for the  effects  of
 changes  in tax  laws  and  rates on the
date of enactment.

 

i. IMPACT
OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

 

The
 Company  does  not  expect  the
 adoption  of  recently  issued
 accounting pronouncements  to  have a
 significant  impact  on  the  Company's
 results  of operations, financial position, or cash
flow.

 

 

NOTE 3.
GOING CONCERN

 

The
Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP
applicable to a going concern. This contemplates the realization of
assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of
business.  As of September 30, 2016 the Company did not have
 significant  cash or other  material  assets,
 nor did it have  operations  or a source  of
 revenue sufficient  to cover its  operating
 costs and




 

7

  

allow it
to  continue  as a going concern.  The Company
’ s officers and directors have committed to advancing
certain operating costs of the Company.

 

While the
Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate
sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds,
there can be no assurances that it will accomplish either. The
Company ’ s ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations or
obtain adequate financing. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to
continue as a going concern.

 

 

NOTE 4.
STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

 

As of
September 30, 2016 the authorized share capital of the Company
consisted of 100,000,000  shares of common stock with $0.0001
par value,  and 20,000,000  shares of preferred
 stock also with $0.0001 par value.

 

COMMON
STOCK:  The Company's first issuance of common stock, totaling
580,000 shares, took place on March 6, 2014  pursuant  to
the  Chapter  11 Plan of  Reorganization confirmed
by the U.S.  Bankruptcy Court in the matter of Pacific Shores
Development, Inc. ("PSD"). The Court ordered the distribution of
shares in the Company to all general unsecured creditors of PSD,
with these creditors to receive their PRO RATA share (according to
amount of debt held) of a pool of 80,000 shares in the Company.
 The Court also ordered the distribution of shares in the
Company to all administrative creditors of PSD, with these
creditors to receive one share of common stock in the Company for
each $0.10 of PSD's administrative debt which they held. A total of
500,000 shares were issued to PSD ’ s administrative
creditors.

 

The Court
also ordered the distribution of 2,500,000 warrants in the Company
to all  administrative  creditors  of PSD, with
these  creditors  to receive five warrants in the Company
 for each $0.10 of PSD's  administrative  debt which
they held. These creditors received 2,500,000 warrants
 consisting of 500,000 "A  Warrants"  each
 convertible  into one share of common stock at an
exercise price of $4.00;  500,000 "B Warrants" each
convertible into one share of common  stock at an exercise
 price of $5.00;  500,000  "C  Warrants"
 each convertible  into one  share of  common
 stock at an  exercise  price of  $6.00;
500,000 "D  Warrants"  each  convertible  into
one share of common stock at an exercise price of $7.00;  and
500,000 "E Warrants" each  convertible  into one share
 of  common  stock  at an  exercise
 price  of  $8.00.  All warrants are
exercisable at any time prior to August 30, 2019. As of the date of
this report, no warrants have been exercised.

 

On June 1,
2014 the Company issued a total of 1,520,000 common shares for
services at par value, $0.0001 per share for total value of $152.
On April 1, 2016 the Company issued 9,000 common shares for
services related to mobile app programming and development valued
at $1.00 per share for a total value of $9,000.

 

As a
result of these  issuances  there  were 2,109,000
 common  shares issued and  outstanding,  and a
total of  2,500,000  warrants to acquire  common
shares issued and outstanding, at September 30, 2016.

 

PREFERRED
STOCK: The authorized share capital of the Company includes
20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with $0.0001 par value. As of
September 30, 2016 no shares of preferred stock had been issued and
no shares of  preferred  stock  were
outstanding.

         10-Q: PACIFIC MEDIA GROUP ENTERPRISES, INC.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The discussion contained herein contains "forward-looking statements" that involve risk and uncertainties. These statements may be identified by the use of terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "should" or anticipates" or expressing this terminology negatively or similar expressions or by discussions of strategy. The cautionary statements made in this Form 10-Q should be read as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Form 10-Q. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this report.  BUSINESS AND PLAN OF OPERATION  Extract Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("the Company" or "the Issuer") was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 6, 2014 under the name Pacific Media Group Enterprises, Inc. The Company was established as part of the implementation of the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization of Pacific Shores Development, Inc. ("PSD"). PSD had been in the residential real estate development business and the predecessor of the issuer was a subsidiary of PSD operating as an in-house advertising agency to plan and create advertising and media planning and buying for its parent, PSD. Under PSD's Plan of Reorganization the Company was incorporated to: (1) receive and own the interest which PSD had in the advertising business; and (2) issue shares of its common stock to PSD's creditors "in order to enhance the Debtor's distribution to its Creditors." Management of PSD "agreed to use its best efforts to develop an active business within [the Company] and to have the shares? publicly traded on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board market in order to provide an opportunity for liquidity to the Creditors." The Company entered the mobile app business and became a reporting issuer in partial fulfillment of that commitment to the court and creditors. Subsequent to March 31, 2017 the name of the corporation and its business direction changed as discussed in Footnote Note 7, Subsequent Events, of the footnotes to our financial statements.  In December 2016 we completed initial development of the Android version of our first mobile app, and during the three months ended March 31, 2017 we worked on the IOS version of that app. As of March 31, 2017 the IOS version was still not complete and therefore no marketing efforts had been undertaken and no revenues were realized. Further, we did not anticipate any revenues until, at the earliest, late in calendar 2017. This was because our plan was to offer the service free until such time as there was a substantial volume of users. Only at that point would we begin to charge the professional service providers for our service. Because of the long lead time to first revenues and the high cost of marketing the app, the Company decided on April 10, 2017 to pursue a different business direction as discussed in Footnote Note 7, Subsequent Events, of the footnotes to our financial statements.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  As of March 31, 2017 we had assets of $500 and we had liabilities of $22,992 and an accumulated deficit of $31,702. As of June 30, 2016 we had assets of $500 and we had liabilities of $500 and we had an accumulated deficit of $9,210. Our only expenses in the three months and nine months periods ended March 31, 2017 were for professional, general, and administrative expenses. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 these totaled $1,400 and for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 these totaled $22,492. We had no revenues during the period. In the three and nine months ended March 31,  2016 we had no expenses and no revenue. Our increase in liabilities from $0 at March 31, 2016 to $22,992 at March 31, 2017 was the result of general and administrative expenses arising from our registration as a reporting issuer with the SEC and our set-up with a licensed stock transfer agent. We will, in all likelihood, sustain continued operating expenses without corresponding revenues, until at least the fourth quarter of 2017. Until then we will continue to depend upon officers and directors to make loans to the Company to meet any costs that may occur. All such advances will be interest-free.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The Company has not yet realized any revenues or earnings from operations however, as noted above, it incurs ongoing expenses related to its SEC registration and status as a reporting issuer. We completed development of the Android version of our first mobile app in December 2016 and during the three months ended March 31, 2017 we concentrated on developing the iOS version of our first app. All such efforts have since been abandoned and the Company's future results will be based on its efforts to develop a chewing gum product for delivery of medicinal cannabis oils.  GOING CONCERN  The accompanying financial statements are presented on a going concern basis. The Company's financial condition raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has little cash and its proposed products are still in development and therefore generate no revenues from operations. It is relying on advances from officers and directors to meet its limited operating expenses. The accompanying financial statements are presented on a going concern basis under US GAAP.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
