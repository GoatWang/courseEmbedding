 Educational Background



Graduate Degree 
Class of 1993 


Rutgers University

                  Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, is a leading national research university and the state’s preeminent, comprehensive public institution of higher education. Rutgers is dedicated to teaching that meets the highest standards of excellence; to conducting research that breaks new ground; and to providing services, solutions, and clinical care that help individuals and the local, national, and global communities where they live.

Founded in 1766, Rutgers teaches across the full educational spectrum: preschool to precollege; undergraduate to graduate; postdoctoral fellowships to residencies; and continuing education for professional and personal advancement.                




Undergraduate Degree 


University of Scranton

                  Founded in 1888, The University of Scranton is a private Catholic and Jesuit university that is known for outstanding academic quality, a beautiful and technology-rich campus, and a sense of community that helps you feel right at home.

Nestled in Pennsylvania’s Pocono Northeast region, The University’s 58-acre hillside campus is in the heart of Scranton, a community of 75,000 within a greater metropolitan area of 750,000 people. 

Scranton offers 61 bachelor’s degree programs, 45 minors, 25 master’s degree programs and a doctor of physical therapy program through four colleges and schools. Visit our Undergraduate and Graduate program pages to see the full range of available majors.
Always Improving

Since 2003, we've invested more than $237 million in campus improvements, either completed or under way. Recently completed buildings include a new campus center and sophomore residence hall. In fall 2011, the University opened the first phase of the new Loyola Science Center, as well as Pilarz and Montrone halls, which include apartment-style residences and a fitness center. The second phase of the Loyola Science Center opened in fall 2012. In addition, we recently completed a beautification project extending the Commons and improving Mulberry Street, the gateway to campus.
