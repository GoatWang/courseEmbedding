Brian Modoff
    Wireless Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities

    Brian Modoff is a senior analyst covering the wireless telecommunications 
    equipment segment at Deutsche Bank Securities. He is currently an Institutional 
    Investor Magazine ranked analyst for both North America and Global Wireless 
    Telecom sectors. Key investment themes include the commoditization of the 
    handset industry and its suppliers, as well as the slow emergence of next-generation 
    wireless technologies (WCDMA) due to numerous technical challenges and hesitancy 
    from the operators to aggressively deploy 3G networks in advance of compelling 
    applications. Ultimately, he believes that 3G, as a standard, will be successful 
    and based upon a form of CDMA technology. Brian joined the firm in early 1997 
    and in 1999 he was promoted to Director. He began covering the telecommunications 
    space at Cruttenden Roth in 1993, later joining Rauscher Pierce Refsnes in 
    1995.
    Brian has 12 years of industry experience. Brian worked at Rockwell International 
    for four years as a manufacturing supervisor on the Ships Communication and 
    Control Systems program and four years in navigation systems testing. Prior 
    to Rockwell, he tested and repaired communication and navigation systems for 
    the US Navy. Brian received a Master of International Management at the American 
    Graduate School of International Management in Glendale, Arizona. He received 
    a B.A. in Economics from California State University, Fullerton.

Brian has been widely 
    quoted in major financial publications including the Wall Street Journal, 
    Money Magazine, Forbes, Reuters, Dow Jones and Business Week. He has guest 
    lectured at MIT Sloan School of Business and appeared on CNN and CNBC MarketWatch. 
    He is regularly quoted and featured in various industry-specific publications 
    such as Wireless Week, RCR and the Microwave Product Digest. Brians 
    research has been published in the International Engineering Consortium Annual 
    review as well as two leading trade journals.
Brian publishes a weekly 
    newsletter entitled Signals to Noise with a readership approaching 
    4,000 subscribers. Key Theme Reports include The Rise of the 3G Empire: 
    Even a Cannes of worms has a silver lining (6/2003), The Rise 
    of the 3G Empire: Even Watching Paint Dry Can Be More Eventful (10/2002), 
    The Rise of the 3G Empire: Even Rome Had Its Bad Days (5/2002), 
    The Rise of the 3G Empire: Even Rome Wasnt Built in a Day
