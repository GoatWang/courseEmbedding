          California Hydrogen Fuel Company's Regulation A+ Crowdfunding Campaign Offers First Opportunity for Main Street Investors to Invest in Hydrogen Fuel Stations

LOS ANGELES, May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- HyGen Industries, Inc., a supplier of clean renewable hydrogen for fuel cell electric vehicles, today announced that it has filed a public offering to raise $20 million under Regulation A+ Tier 2 – updated under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act – as the next phase of its fundraising strategy. The news follows HyGen's $5.3 million award from the California Energy Commission to build clean renewable hydrogen fueling stations. The company's equity offering is a chance for accredited and unaccredited investors to take advantage of new crowdfunding rules to support a much-needed clean, renewable hydrogen infrastructure.








The company's zero-emission stations will service the new line-up of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) from forward-looking companies such as Toyota, Hyundai, Honda and others. HyGen's clean and renewable production method involves purchasing renewable electricity and creating hydrogen, via water electrolysis, a process that uses state-of-the-art electrolyzers, at partner gas stations. FCEVs complete the cycle, emitting only water vapor into the atmosphere, contributing zero carbon emissions.
"HyGen is excited to offer the public an opportunity to invest in a carbon-free alternative to fossil fuels for transportation," says Paul Dillon, CFO of HyGen Industries. "We firmly believe that the JOBS Act provides an ideal opportunity for small investors to become stakeholders in companies generating a positive impact. Our offering allows millions across the U.S., and the world, the chance to vote with their pocketbook for cleaner transportation."
Renewable energy is intermittent. Clean energy companies often generate more power than they can sell to the grid, and storage of this excess electricity has not traditionally been feasible at scale. HyGen takes that energy, stores it as hydrogen and adds value, selling the stored energy (hydrogen) as a transportation fuel. In HyGen's model, renewable energy companies will be able to sell their excess energy to power cars. Marginal renewable energy projects become viable, increasing the renewable portfolio.
Progress Generates Huge Market Potential as California Welcomes Hydrogen FleetsZero-emission hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are becoming established in California. Los Angeles already has a viable hydrogen station network. HyGen is adding to this nascent infrastructure, enabling more people to make the switch away from polluting fossil fuels. All fuel from HyGen is 100% carbon-free and renewable. Recent projections from the California Air Resources Board indicate that California's FCEV fleet will grow to 13,500 by the end of 2019 and 43,600 by the end of 2022.
Thanks to the JOBS Act, millions of Americans can get in on the ground floor of the first pure-play investment opportunity in clean renewable hydrogen. Available on StartEngine, a premiere equity crowdfunding platform, accredited and unaccredited investors alike can purchase shares and contribute to the building of clean, renewable hydrogen stations across California and take part in fueling the next generation with HyGen Industries.
For more information about HyGen Industries and their equity offering, interested individuals can visit: http://www.startengine.com/startup/HyGen.
About HyGen Industries, Inc.HyGen Industries is a California company organized to produce and distribute clean renewable hydrogen fuel in partnership with gas station owners. Beginning in 2017, the company plans to deploy the latest generation hydrogen production systems at locations throughout California. Only clean renewable energy is used by our process without the need for new pipelines or infrastructure. Our requirements are basic: renewable electricity and water. Most gas stations operating today already meet these criteria. Welcome to a cleaner future. Visit www.hygen.com.

How HyGen works
HyGen believes the hydrogen infrastructure is mostly in place. With electricity and water universally available, the missing piece is on-site equipment to extract hydrogen from water using clean renewable electricity.

The most straight forward method would be electrolysis, but the electricity for electrolysis has to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is likely fossil fuels. Because electrolysis is not 100% efficient, you lose energy when converting fossil-fuel-derived electricity to hydrogen. Because hydrogen fuel cells are not 100% efficient, you lose more energy when you convert the hydrogen back to electricity to drive a vehicle. With the ultimate source of hydrogen power leading back to fossil fuel and the inevitable energy losses to inefficiency, how is this a solution?

Renewable Hydrogen For Electric Vehicles Supplier HyGen Industries Seeks Funds Under Regulation A+ Rules on StartEngine
 Tweet1 Share12 Share11 +13 Reddit Pin EmailShares 27

May 5, 2017 @ 11:23 am By Samantha Hurst 


HyGen Industries, Inc. a California-based company that supplies clean renewable hydrogen for fuel cell electric vehicles, announced on Friday it launched a crowdfunding offering on StartEngine to raise funds under Regulation A+ Tier 2. The company reported that this offering news comes just after it awarded $5.3 million from the California Energy Commission to build clean renewable hydrogen fueling stations.
According to the company, its zero-emission stations will service the new line-up of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) from forward-looking companies such as Toyota, Hyundai, Honda and other manufacturers. Its clean and renewable production method notably involves purchasing renewable electricity and create hydrogen through water electrolysis, which is described as a process that uses electrolyzers at partner gas stations. HyGen Industries revealed:

“Renewable energy is intermittent. Clean energy companies often generate more power than they can sell to the grid, and storage of this excess electricity has not traditionally been feasible at scale. HyGen takes that energy, stores it as hydrogen and adds value, selling the stored energy (hydrogen) as a transportation fuel. In HyGen’s model, renewable energy companies will be able to sell their excess energy to power cars. Marginal renewable energy projects become viable, increasing the renewable portfolio.”

Speaking about the public offering, Paul Dillon, CFO of HyGen Industries, stated; 

“HyGen is excited to offer the public an opportunity to invest in a carbon-free alternative to fossil fuels for transportation.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
