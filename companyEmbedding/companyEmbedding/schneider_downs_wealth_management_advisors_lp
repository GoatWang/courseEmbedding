What’s Coming Out of Silicon Valley


				By Randall Stross			
August 23, 2012 6:20 am
August 23, 2012 6:20 am







Randall Stross, the Digital Domain columnist for The New York Times, has been following Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley start-up incubator, for more than a year. His book, “The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator, Silicon Valley’s Most Exclusive School for Startups,” will be published next month by Portfolio/Penguin. 
He got a rare insider look at all of the incubator’s fledgling start-ups in robotics, mobile apps, e-commerce services and software for companies. Here is his exhaustive, but not exhausting, special report for Bits on the current crop of companies Y Combinator has produced.

Peer through the window of a hospital nursery and you see rows and rows of cute babies. I think newborn start-ups possess the same kind of cheek-pinching appeal.
And nowhere can you find as large a collection of start-ups in a single place as those that come out of Y Combinator, the Mountain View, Calif., seed fund.
On Tuesday, YC, as insiders call it, staged its 15th semiannual Demo Day for investors. Sixty-three of the summer batch’s companies made a formal public presentation to investors and the press. That’s a lot of newborns.
The Demo Day format hasn’t changed much as YC has grown over the years, attracting ever larger numbers of applications and funding larger batches of start-ups. The purpose of the exercise is to give investors a tantalizing tidbit or two of information sufficient for determining whether to have the conversations that may eventually lead to an investment. Each presentation lasts just two or two and a half minutes, is filled with astounding figures (“a $150 billion market!”), comes in thematically random order, and is stacked one on top of the other, in a blur. (Eleven more presentations came at the end that were designated off-the-record.)
Sure, some of the babies appear to be a bit cuter than the others. But all deserve a chance to make their way. What can be done immediately is view the group portrait. YC’s summer 2012 batch captures prevailing start-up ideas in one moment in time.
A little more than half of the start-ups that presented are attempting to sell to business customers. Let’s start, however, with the start-ups that are consumer oriented. Many are fledgling media businesses built upon user-generated content.  We users apparently have very short attention spans. The humor site 9gag , which serves up silly memes found by users — and draws 65 million unique users a month — says “bite size is the future of entertainment.” Reelsurfer lets users reduce a video clip, which may already be short, to extremely short length.
For more conventional entertainment, there is Mars Frontier, a massively multiplayer, real-time strategy game, the first game produced by SpinPunch. What is not so conventional, at least not yet, is the use of HTML5, which requires no download as Flash-based games do.
Tapin, which like many of its batchmates incorporates the twin motifs of mobile and social, is a mobile video app designed for a speedy start. Kamcord also is in social and mobile entertainment: mobile game developers are invited to use its software so that gamers can record and share their gameplay. Another company makes the Coco Controller, a smartphone case that has physical buttons for use with mobile games that are written to work with the case. 
Circular applies the social theme to news, letting one’s friends act as a filter. Or, for those who would like to not have the social overlay on everything one does, there’s Everyday.me, an iPhone app that “captures all your life moments” but whose default setting is private: not to be shared with others.
There is some playful experimentation with communication. Visitors to Voicegem’s Web site can record a voice message that is sent to an e-mail address rather than a phone number.  Hubchilla matches users up with strangers to have conversations via texting but keeps the participants’ phone numbers hidden. (One of its co-founders, who is a 20 Under 20 Thiel Fellow, said he began coding at the age of 8.)
Tablets receive the focused attention of Grid, which makes a spreadsheet that does some tricks that no spreadsheet on a PC could ever match.
Amid the fascination with mobile, the Web has not disappeared completely, however. For sharing favorite images found on the Web, there’s Imgfave. For favorite links, with the pitch addressed to office workers in particular, there’s Kippt.  For finding stuff of our own that is stored in Google Docs, Collections provides a “finder for the cloud.”
No fewer than four of the start-ups in the batch provide travel-related services. Flightfox runs contests in which travel agents and other humans compete to find the lowest fare for international or multicity flights. Or travelers can use GetGoing, which describes itself as “the next-generation Priceline.” It supplies a deeply discounted fare for leisure travelers who are willing to agree to go to either of two separate destinations — but cannot choose which one it is.  Vayable offers unusual travel experiences, bringing travelers and independent guides together. TomoGuides is preparing smartphone city guides that will be offered free. 
Like Vayable, other start-ups are creating an online marketplace, bringing together suppliers and customers and offering prices lower than those available using existing middlemen in the physical world. Tastemaker does the same for interior designers and customers.
RegistryLove works with existing merchants but is attempting to create a consolidated wedding registry that spans all stores.
Healthy Labs, a start-up hosting what it calls “patient social networks” for chronic diseases, has begun with a site for those with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis:  Crohnology.
In education, Knowmia has set up a site that invites teachers to contribute video lessons, what the company describes as “a crowdsourced Khan Academy.”  StudyEdge offers college students study guides, video content and live review sessions that address challenging courses at particular universities. It’s now available at the University of Florida. 
The personal finance category of software is an old one. SmartAsset, a Web-based service, applies its own analytical engine to the category, which supplies customized answers to users’ questions like how much house can one afford.
Instacart is an intrepid start-up that has entered another old category, one known for the notorious failure of early pioneers: Web-based grocery ordering. Its founder stressed that it carried no inventory (unlike the infamous failure Webvan): “We’re entirely software.”
A category of software with a much shorter history is that for 3-D printers. Dreamforge lets users create a customized design for a three-dimensional superhero that the company will print — that is, manufacture — then send back to the customer.
The blend of the physical and the digital is also found in Vastrm, a Web site that offers customized shirts, including a “Home Try-On Program,” similar to what Warby Parker offers for eyeglasses. Vastrm’s founder received one of the loudest appreciative laughs of the day when he pointed to Warby Parker’s success and remarked, “Not everyone wears glasses, but everyone wears a shirt.”
Suppose you’re not home when U.P.S. tries to deliver your Dreamforge superhero or Vastrm polo shirt to your apartment? Someday you may live close to a BufferBox location, each with a box containing multiple parcel lockers that are controlled through software. (BufferBox is rolling out its initial boxes in Toronto.)
The remaining start-ups in this summer batch are pitching to the enterprise or to fellow software developers.
Some services are focused on a particular industry and are highly specialized. Keychain Logistics brings together shippers and truckers, eliminating human brokers. Viacycle runs bike-sharing programs for universities, cities and businesses. Rentio tells apartment owners what they should charge for rent. Eligible helps insurance companies and health care providers fully automate insurance eligibility queries, eliminating the expense of placing, and fielding, phone calls between humans. Hiptype teams up with e-book publishers, embedding its software in the books to gather data for what it calls “data-driven book publishing.”
If the business is one in which individuals outside the company send in documents that must then be reviewed — résumés, grant applications, college applications — there’s a YC company that handles the process: Submittable.
Parallel Universe supplies a database service for businesses or organizations that manage vast amounts of spatial data in real time, like the Israeli air force, an early customer.
Amicus seeks to profit from helping nonprofits replace inefficient fund-raising using old means, like mail appeals and cold calls, with social media: friends referring friends.
Finance, with its large I.T. budgets, has attracted BigCalc, which does fast simulations for quants and algo traders, and DataNitro, which weds Python financial and math libraries to Excel spreadsheets. 
FundersClub wants to be “the future Nasdaq,” matching accredited investors with tech start-ups. Coinbase offers a way for nontechnical users to get started with Bitcoin, the digital currency.
Many of the start-ups that are selling to the enterprise aim at customers that belong to no particular industry.  MicroEval seeks to move performance reviews to the cloud. Statwing supplies easy “data visualization” to nontechnical people working with spreadsheets.  QuicklyChat is a video chat service for co-workers that the company claims is easy to use but will not interrupt the work of the person who is asked to respond because of the software’s “intelligent availability detection.”
Small and medium-size businesses that need a customized phone system can turn to Profig. For warehouse management, there’s HD Trade Services’ cloud-based inventory manager.
A large cluster of the start-ups are in marketing or advertising. Sponsorfied seeks to match corporate sponsors with targets. LeanMarket guides ad buyers on banner-ad exchanges. Canopy Labs does customer modeling to help clients evaluate the value of leads. Referly expands affiliate marketing, working with more than 30,000 retailers. Tracksby plans to arrange celebrity endorsements. Virool offers to help spread advertisers’ videos through social networks, blogs and phones. On behalf of clients, Survata distributes market research surveys to Web publishers, who let visitors who complete the surveys read articles free instead of paying.
Mth Sense provides mobile advertisers with information about the gender and interests of users;  the company deduces these by looking at what other apps are installed on a phone. (This company holds what I believe must be the day’s record for largest figure mentioned — 25 trillion — a reference to the number of in-app ads that the company says will appear in 2016.)
We come to the last category of start-ups in the batch, the one that is, by far, the largest: tools and services for software developers. YC has always attracted strong technical teams and no one knows better than developers and designers themselves what they need. This batch has Light Table, an interactive programming development that had raised more than $300,000 on Kickstarter last spring; Easel and Markupwand for Web site design; Scoutzie,  a marketplace for mobile app designers; Airbrite for tightly integrating e-commerce functionality to mobile apps; Clever, which has APIs for software developers who are working with schools and their student rosters; Plivo, challenging the dominant incumbent, Twilio, which has APIs for voice and SMS applications; Filepicker.io, which eases file movement between a local device and the cloud; and Zapier, which seeks to be the master translator of all APIs.
Representatives of one company in the batch stood out in particular; they were arguably the sensation of the day and had a thick knot of observers surrounding them at every break. These were the svelte robots of Double Robotics, designed to provide telepresence inexpensively. One iPad is mounted on top, facing outward; another iPad is held by the human who controls the machine. In developing it, the founders took on challenges in hardware as well as software, but they were able to come to market with a price of $2,000, a fraction of the price for telepresence robots from incumbents. The company received $500,000 of advance orders in just one week.
Gratifying, yes, but being in the hardware business means dealing with real materials and finite supplies. The company sold out its first production run and says orders placed today won’t be filled until early 2013.

		Across the country, individuals and entities alike are struggling with their efforts to find the best investment design structure for their future security, fiduciary responsibilities and specific needs and goals.

		Further complicating this dilemma has been the meltdown of the investment markets in 2008. The impact of two historic bear markets in ten years has not only been financial but psychological as well. Confidence and optimism about the future have been replaced with insecurity and a fear that financial independence at retirement is at risk even after a lifetime of hard work and diligent planning.

		In our opinion, this crisis and lack of confidence in the current American retirement system and the financial insecurity that accompanies it will bring change on many levels. The good news, at least from our perspective, is that change is needed, and it will be positive for those who embrace it and are proactive about making adjustments or even changing direction. We strongly believe that economic value and retirement security can still be created for those following “best practices” that result in meaningful and measurable progress toward acceptable outcomes.

		Explore our full suite of services for individuals, trusts, estates, pension and profit sharing plans, charitable organizations and businesses.

		We work closely with you to focus on critical issues and find the process best suited to achieve your goals.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
