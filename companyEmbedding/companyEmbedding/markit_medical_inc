This letter allows you to provide information needed to assess how Canadian regulatory requirements do or may apply to transactions between counterparties.Register your interest in Canadian Representation Letter   Product SummaryThe ISDA Amend tool, built on the Markit Counterparty Manager platform enables dealers and their clients to centrally manage Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) documentation requirements, as well as track and control counterparty access at the fund and account level.ISDA Amend 2.0 builds upon existing functionality and applies a multi-jurisdictional approach.

The Letter will be expanded to cover additional jurisdictions that may be subject to the margin requirements in due course.Variation Margin (VM) ProtocolThe Variation Margin Protocol is designed to help market participants comply with new rules on margin for uncleared swaps, by providing a scalable solution to amend derivatives contract documentation with multiple counterparties. The Protocol addresses documentation changes necessary to comply with the variation margin requirements that will apply to a large number of market participants in various jurisdictions from March 2017.ISDA Jurisdictional Modular Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA JMP)The ISDA Jurisdictional Modular Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA JMP) enables parties to comply with new restrictions on termination rights in financial contracts. Each Jurisdictional Module of the ISDA JMP is aimed at facilitating compliance with regulations in a different jurisdiction. ISDA Amend 2.0, in conjunction with the ISDA JMP, allows you to make certain elections related to a Jurisdictional Module and to inform counterparties of relevant adherence information, such as the capacity in which you have adhered (as an entity subject to applicable regulations, as a counterparty to such entities or both), which parties you choose to amend your third-country law financial arrangements with and which underlying funds or principals you have adhered on behalf of, as applicable.UK (PRA Rule) Jurisdictional Module to the ISDA Jurisdictional Modular Resolution Stay ProtocolThis enables compliance with the Prudential Regulation Authority's (UK PRA) final rule on contractual stays in financial contracts governed by third-country law (PRA 2015/82) (UK PRA Stay Rule). Entities subject to the UK PRA Stay Rule must amend 'third-country law' financial arrangements with counterparties so that their counterparties agree to be bound by stays on or overrides of termination rights under the UK Banking Act if such entities enter UK bank resolution proceedings.German Jurisdictional Module to the ISDA Resolution Stay Jurisdictional Modular ProtocolThis enables compliance with Section 60a of the German Recovery and Resolution Act (German Legislation). Entities subject to the German Legislation must obtain from certain counterparties a contractual recognition of the application of stays on termination in financial contracts governed by the law of a 'third country' (a jurisdiction other than that of a member of the European Union) or with a place of venue in a third country.Japanese Jurisdictional Module to the ISDA Resolution Stay Jurisdictional Modular ProtocolThis module enables compliance with the amendments to the Comprehensive Guidelines issued by Japanese Financial Services Agency regarding contractual stays in certain financial contracts governed by non-Japanese law (Japanese Regulation). Entities subject to the Japanese Regulations will require certain counterparties to include a contractual stay in certain contracts governed by non-Japanese law and as specified in the Japanese Regulation.ISDA Regulatory ToolsAugust 2012 Dodd- Frank Protocol/ March 2013 Dodd-Frank ProtocolCFTC’s External and Internal Business Conduct rules and standards.Cross-Border Representation – US/Non US PersonOn July 26th 2013, the CFTC published an “Interpretive Guidance and Policy Statement Regarding Compliance with Certain
							Swap Regulations” providing guidance as to when the CFTC will assert jurisdiction over swap transactions that have a
							non-U.S. element. This allows market participants to provide counterparties with status representations needed to
							determine whether compliance with various CFTC swap regulations is required by the Interpretive Guidance.CFTC IM Segregation Right NoticeIn November 2013, the CFTC published Regulation 23.701, implementing requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants to notify counterparties of their right to require segregation of margin (other than variation margin) for uncleared swap transactions.
							The rule became effective on January 6, 2014.  For market participants that became “new counterparties” of a swap dealer or major swap participant after that date (for example, by putting in place an ISDA Master Agreement to begin trading uncleared swaps), the relevant swap dealer or major swap participant must comply with the requirements by May 5, 2014. For market participants that were existing counterparties on or before January 6, 2014, the compliance date is November 3, 2014.EMIR Counterparty and Clearing Classification ToolsThe EMIR Counterparty Classification Tool and the EMIR Clearing Classification Tool allows entities to communicate the classification status between counterparties to help ensure compliance with EMIR. By answering a series of questions, derivative counterparties can classify themselves according to the EMIR taxonomy for various purposes, including obligations on mitigation of risks associated with cleared and uncleared OTC derivatives.Canadian Representation Letter #1The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), the Manitoba Securities Commission (MSC) and the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), respectively, published Rule 91-507 requiring “reporting counterparties” to report certain derivatives data to “designated” or “recognized” trade repositories with respect to transactions involving “local counterparties”.  The OSC, MSC and AMF have also published companion policies. In these three jurisdictions, for trades involving a “clearing agency” or a Dealer, trade reporting begins on October 31, 2014 and, for trades that do not involve such entities, on June 30, 2015. The securities regulatory authorities in certain of the remaining provinces of Canada have indicated their intention to introduce substantially identical rules by way of a multi-lateral instrument.  Canadian federally regulated financial institutions may become subject to similar federal or national rules, orders or directives.
							It is anticipated that other rules and instruments to be published and finalized by Canadian Regulators with respect to Derivatives will include a substantially equivalent definition of “local counterparty” to that in the TR Rules. 
							This letter allows you to provide information needed to assess how Canadian Regulatory Requirements do or may apply to Transactions between counterparties.Australian Single-Sided Reporting LetterISDA Australian Single-Sided Reporting Letter allows certain market participants to take advantage of the Australian single-sided reporting regime for Phase 3 Entities. The letter allows market participants to provide counterparties with status representations that can be used to help determine whether single-sided reporting is applicable for those entities with total gross notional outstanding positions of less than A$5b (Phase 3 Entities), provided they engage in derivatives transactions with counterparties that are already required or agree to report.
							Australian Mandatory Clearing Classification Letter
The ISDA Australian Clearing Classification Letter allows counterparties to bilaterally communicate their status by answering a series of questions and enable counterparties to notify each other of their status for clearing requirements under Australia’s mandatory central clearing regime for over-the-counter derivatives. ISDA prepared the appendices in order to help counterparties provide classification-status information to determine the application of certain requirements under the ASIC Derivative Transaction Rules (Clearing) 2015. The letter and the appendices may be used by a named entity to meet its requirements under Rule 3.1.2 of the ASIC clearing rules.UK (PRA Rule) Jurisdictional Module to the ISDA Jurisdictional Modular Resolution Stay ProtocolThis tool enables compliance with the Prudential Regulation Authority’s (UK PRA) final rule on contractual stays in financial contracts governed by third-country law (PRA 2015/82) (UK PRA Stay Rule).

Others, such as Credit Cards (ABX.CC), Student Loans (ABX.SL), Auto Loans (ABX.AU) were to be announced in the future. Advertised daily prices were available on the Markit website. The purpose of the indices is to allow investors to trade exposures to the subprime market without holding the actual asset backed securities.

The Deutsche Bank, alone, reportedly made $250 million.(2007 & Lenzer)[23]

It introduced a "second generation product such as index tranches and index options."(Wiley 2006)[22] They launched the Home Equity (ABX.HE) ABX on 19 January 2006. Others, such as Credit Cards (ABX.CC), Student Loans (ABX.SL), Auto Loans (ABX.AU) were to be announced in the future. Advertised daily prices were available on the Markit website. The purpose of the indices is to allow investors to trade exposures to the subprime market without holding the actual asset backed securities.

Background[edit]
Markit was founded in 2003 by Canadian Lance Uggla[7][8] in St Albans, outside London, as Mark-it Partners to provide daily credit default swap (CDS) pricing.[9]
Markit's credit derivative data sales rose during the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 and later years.[10]
In September 2009 Markit and Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) launched MarkitSERV, a joint venture to provide over-the-counter (OTC) derivative trade processing.[11]
On May 5, 2014, Markit Ltd., a company registered in Bermuda, filed for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), to be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol MRKT.[2][12] The stock began trading on June 19, 2014 with an initial pricing of $24 per share.[13]
Company performance[edit]

Index products[edit]
On 17 January 2006, CDS IndexCo and Markit launched ABX.HE, a subprime mortgage backed credit derivative index, with planned to extend the index to underlying asset types other than home equity loans.[20][21] In a marketing presentation(2006 & Wiley) CDS IndexCo was described as the owner of the DJ CDX family of credit default swap (CDS) indices formed from a merger of the major CDS indices (iBoxx and Trac-X) in April 2004. It introduced a "second generation product such as index tranches and index options."(Wiley 2006)[22] They launched the Home Equity (ABX.HE) ABX on 19 January 2006. Others, such as Credit Cards (ABX.CC), Student Loans (ABX.SL), Auto Loans (ABX.AU) were to be announced in the future. Advertised daily prices were available on the Markit website. The purpose of the indices is to allow investors to trade exposures to the subprime market without holding the actual asset backed securities. The ABX.HE Index was created from "qualifying deals of 20 of the largest sub-prime home equity ABS shelf programs from the six month period preceding the roll."(Wiley, 2006 & 11) The market makers of ABX.HE were listed JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Barclays Capital, Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, RBS Greenwich, UBS and Wachovia.(Wiley, 2006 & 13)
The Loan credit default swap index (LCDX), a loan-only credit default swap index was created in 2007 by CDS Index Company (CDSIndexCo).[23] Forbes journalist described the creation of the index as just-in-time financial engineering. The LCDX provided protection for banks and hedge fund clients from the overly leveraged loan market.(2007 & Lenzer)[23]
Sixteen major financial institutions, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Barclays Capital, Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, RBS Greenwich, UBS and Wachovia,[23] owned the private company called the CDS Index Company (CDS IndexCo), that developed the ABX index on 17 January 2006. Markit Group Limited marketed the ABX index and by 2007 had acquired (CDS IndexCo). On 17 The ABX index was a credit default swap of asset-backed mortgages of 30 of the most liquid mortgage-backed bonds. Hedge funds began shorting that ABX index in early 2006 at par. The Deutsche Bank, alone, reportedly made $250 million.(2007 & Lenzer)[23]
Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange (NYSE: ICE), a derivatives exchange and clearing house operator, announced four credit index futures contracts, based on the Markit CDX and Markit iTraxx indices—Markit CDX NA IG, Markit CDX NA HY, Markit iTraxx Europe (Main), and Markit iTraxx Crossover, would start in May 2013.
