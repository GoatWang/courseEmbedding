Employment Agreement - Expedia Inc. and Mark D. Okerstrom



Employment Forms


Employment Agreement. Employers can customize an employment agreement that states the salary, benefits, working hours and other important provisions for their new or existing employee.
Consulting Agreement. Answer simple questions to build a contract with a consultant. Specify the services rendered, when payment is due, as well as IP rights.
Commission Agreement. Employers who compensate their sales employees based on commissions can prepare an agreement to reduce misunderstandings by specifying the base salary and how commissions are calculated.
Executive Employment Agreement. Companies may offer their business executives a contract that is different from the one provided to their regular employees. Executive employment agreements may be more complex because the compensation structure may include a combination of salary and commissions, provide for bonuses based on sales, stock or other financial targets, and include non-compete, confidentiality and severance provisions.
Sales Representative Contract. Independent sales representatives offer companies the potential to increase the sale of products or services without the burden of increasing headcount. Both parties should understand how commissions are calculated, when commissions will be paid, as well as how the representative will treat confidential information from the company and whether the representative may also sell a competing line of products or services.

(b) DISABILITY. If, as a result of Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness ("Disability"), Executive shall have been absent from the full-time performance of Executive's duties with the Company for a period of four consecutive months and, within 30 days after written notice is provided to Executive by the Company (in accordance with Section 4A hereof), Executive shall not have returned to the full-time performance of Executive's duties, Executive's employment under this Agreement may be terminated by the Company for Disability. During any period prior to such termination during which Executive is absent from the full-time performance of Executive's duties with the Company due to Disability, the Company shall continue to pay Executive's Base Salary at the rate in effect at the commencement of such period of Disability, offset by any amounts payable to Executive under any disability insurance plan or policy provided by the Company.

(c) TERMINATION FOR CAUSE; RESIGNATION WITHOUT GOOD REASON. The Company may terminate Executive's employment under this Agreement with or without Cause at any time and Executive may resign under this Agreement with or without Good Reason at any time. As used herein, "Cause" shall mean: (i) the plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, conviction for, or the commission of, a felony offense by Executive; provided, however, that after indictment, the Company may suspend Executive from the rendition of services, but without limiting or modifying in any other way the Company's obligations under this Agreement; (ii) a material breach by Executive of a fiduciary duty owed to the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) a material breach by Executive of any of the covenants made by Executive in Section 2 hereof; (iv) the willful or gross neglect by Executive of the material duties required by this Agreement; or (v) a knowing and material violation by Executive of any Company policy pertaining to ethics, legal compliance, wrongdoing or conflicts of interest that, in the case of the conduct described in clauses (iv) or (v) above, if curable, is not cured by Executive within 30 days after Executive is provided with written notice thereof. Upon Executive's (A) termination of employment by the Company for Cause prior to the expiration of the Term or (B) resignation without Good Reason prior to the expiration of the Term, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligation by the Company, except for the payment of any Accrued Obligations in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of such termination.


(d) TERMINATION BY THE COMPANY OTHER THAN FOR DEATH, DISABILITY OR CAUSE OR RESIGNATION BY EXECUTIVE FOR GOOD REASON. Upon termination of Executive's employment prior to the expiration of the Term by the Company without Cause (other than for death or Disability) or by Executive for Good Reason (as defined below), then:
(i) the Company shall continue to pay Executive the Base Salary through the longer of (x) the end of the Term over the course of the then remaining Term and (y) 12 months (such period, the "Salary Continuation Period" and such payments, the "Cash Severance Payments"), in each case payable in equal biweekly installments and the Company shall pay in cash to Executive (within 10 business days of each applicable monthly period) for each month between the date of termination and the end of the Salary Continuation Period an amount equal to the premiums charged by the Company to maintain COBRA benefits continuation coverage for Executive and Executive's eligible dependents to the extent such coverage is then in place;
(ii) the Company shall pay Executive within 30 days of the date of such termination in a lump sum in cash any Accrued Obligations;
(iii) the Company will consider in good faith the payment of a discretionary bonus on a pro rata basis for the year in which the Termination of Employment occurs, any such payment to be paid (if at all) based on actual performance during the year in which termination has occurred and based on the number of days of employment during such year relative to 365 days (payable in a lump sum at the time such annual bonus would otherwise have been paid);
(iv) any compensation awards of Executive based on, or in the form of, Company equity (e.g. restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options or similar instruments) ("Equity Awards") that are outstanding and unvested at the time of such termination but which would, but for a termination of employment, have vested during the 12 months following such termination (such period, the "Equity Acceleration Period") shall vest (and with respect to awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights, settle) as of the date of such termination of employment; provided that any outstanding award with a vesting schedule that would, but for a termination of employment, have resulted in a smaller percentage (or none) of the award being vested through the end of such Equity Acceleration Period than if it vested annually pro rata over its vesting period shall, for purposes of this provision, be treated as though it vested annually pro rata over its vesting period (e.g., if 100 restricted stock units ("RSUs") were granted 2.7 years prior to the date of the termination and vested pro rata on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date and 100 RSUs were granted 1.7 years prior to the date of termination and vested on the fifth anniversary of the grant date, then on the date of termination 20 RSUs from the first award and 40 RSUs from the second award would vest and settle); provided further that any amount that would vest under this provision but for the fact that outstanding performance conditions have not been satisfied shall vest (and with respect to awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights, settle) only if, and at such point as, such performance conditions are satisfied; and provided further that if any Equity Awards made subsequent to the Effective Date of this Agreement specifies a more favorable post-

termination vesting schedule for such equity, the terms of the award agreement for such Equity Award shall govern; and
(v) any then vested options of Executive (including options vesting as a result of (iv) above) to purchase Company equity, shall remain exercisable through the date that is 18 months following the date of such termination or, if earlier, through the scheduled expiration date of such options.
The expiration of the Term shall not give rise to any payment to Executive or acceleration obligation under this Section 1(d). The payment to Executive of the severance pay or benefits described in Section 1(d) (other than any Accrued Obligations) is contingent upon Executive signing and not revoking a separation and release of the Company and its affiliates in a form substantially similar to that used for similarly situated executives of the Company (the "Release"), the offset provisions in Section 1(e), and Executive's compliance with the restrictive covenants set forth in Section 2 (other than any non-compliance that is immaterial, does not result in harm to the Company or its affiliates, and, if curable, is cured by Executive promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Company). The Release must become effective no later than sixty (60) days following Executive's employment termination date or such earlier date required by the Release (such deadline, the "Release Deadline"). If the Release does not become effective by the Release Deadline, Executive will forfeit any rights to severance. In no event will severance payments or benefits (other than any Accrued Obligations) be paid or provided until the Release becomes effective and irrevocable. Upon the Release becoming effective and irrevocable, any payments delayed from the date Executive terminates employment through the effective date of the Release will be payable in a lump sum without interest as soon as administratively practicable after the Release Deadline and all other amounts will be payable in accordance with the payment schedule applicable to each payment or benefit. In the event the termination occurs at a time during the calendar year where the Release could become effective in the calendar year following the calendar year in which Executive's termination occurs, then any severance payments or benefits that would be considered Deferred Payments (as defined below) will be paid on the first payroll date to occur during the calendar year following the calendar year in which such termination occurs, or, if later, (i) the Release Deadline, (ii) such time as required by the payment schedule provided above that is applicable to each payment or benefit, or (iii) the Delayed Initial Payment Date (as defined below). Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's payment of severance pay and benefits (except Accrued Obligations) constitutes good and valuable consideration for such Release.
As used herein, "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following without Executive's prior written consent: (A) the Company's material breach of any material provision of this Agreement, (B) the material reduction in Executive's title, duties, reporting responsibilities or level of responsibilities as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, excluding for this purpose any such reduction that is an isolated and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith or that is authorized pursuant to this Agreement, (C) the material reduction in Executive's Base Salary or Executive's total annual compensation opportunity, or (D) the relocation of Executive's principal place of employment more than 50 miles outside the Seattle metropolitan area, provided that in no event shall Executive's resignation be for "Good Reason" unless (x) an event or circumstance set forth in clauses (A) through (D) shall have occurred and Executive
 
3


provides the Company with written notice thereof within 30 days after Executive has knowledge of the occurrence or existence of such event or circumstance, which notice specifically identifies the event or circumstance that Executive believes constitutes Good Reason, (y) the Company fails to correct the circumstance or event so identified within 30 days after receipt of such notice, and (z) Executive resigns within 90 days after the date of delivery of the notice referred to in clause (x) above. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 1(d), in the event that Executive is a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Section 409A) on the date of termination of Executive's employment with the Company and the Cash Severance Payments to be paid within the first six months following such date (the "Initial Payment Period") exceed the amount referenced in Treas. Regs. Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) (the "Limit"), then (1) any portion of the Cash Severance Payments that is a "short-term deferral" within the meaning of Treas. Regs. Section 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i) shall be paid at the times set forth in Section 1(d), (2) any portion of the Cash Severance Payments (in addition to the amounts contemplated by the immediately preceding clause (1)) that is payable during the Initial Payment Period that does not exceed the Limit shall be paid at the times set forth in Section 1(d) as applicable, (3) any portion of the Cash Severance Payments that exceeds the Limit and is not a "short-term deferral" (and would have been payable during the Initial Payment Period but for the Limit) shall be paid, with Interest, on the first business day of the first calendar month that begins after the six-month anniversary of Executive's "separation from service" (within the meaning of Section 409A) and (4) any portion of the Cash Severance Payments that is payable after the Initial Payment Period shall be paid at the times set forth in Section 1(d). For purposes of this Agreement, "Interest" shall mean interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code, from the date on which payment would otherwise have been made but for any required delay through the date of payment.
(e) OFFSET. If Executive obtains other employment during the Salary Continuation Period, any payments to be made to Executive under Section 1(d) hereof after the date such employment is secured shall be offset by the amount of compensation earned by Executive from such employment. For purposes of this Section 1(e), Executive shall have an obligation to inform the Company regarding Executive's employment status following termination and during the Salary Continuation Period, but shall have no affirmative duty to seek alternate employment.
(f) ACCRUED OBLIGATIONS. As used in this Agreement, "Accrued Obligations" shall mean the sum of (i) any portion of Executive's accrued and earned but unpaid Base Salary through the date of death or termination of employment for any reason, as the case may be; (ii) any compensation previously earned but deferred by Executive (together with any interest or earnings thereon) that has not yet been paid and that is not otherwise paid at a later date pursuant to any deferred compensation arrangement of the Company to which Executive is a party, if any (provided, that any election made by Executive pursuant to any deferred compensation arrangement that is subject to Section 409A regarding the schedule for payment of such deferred compensation shall prevail over this Section 1(f) to the extent inconsistent herewith); and (iii) other than in the event of Executive's resignation without Good Reason or termination by the Company for Cause (except as required by applicable law), any portion of Executive's accrued but unpaid vacation pay through the date of death or termination of employment.
 
4


(g) OTHER BENEFITS. Upon any termination of Executive's employment prior to the expiration of the Term, Executive shall remain entitled to receive any vested benefits or amounts that Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice or program of, or any other contract or agreement with, the Company in accordance with the terms thereof (other than any such plan, policy, practice or program of the Company that provides benefits in the nature of severance or continuation pay).
(h) SECTION 409A. This Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including any regulations and guidance issued thereunder ("Section 409A"), to the extent Section 409A is applicable to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall be interpreted, operated and administered by the Company in a manner consistent with such intention and to avoid the pre-distribution inclusion in income of amounts deferred under this Agreement and the imposition of any additional tax or interest with respect thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent required in order to comply with Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable under this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following the date of termination of the Employee's employment shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following the Employee's "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A.
2. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION; DUTY OF LOYALTY; NON-SOLICITATION; AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.
(a) CONFIDENTIALITY. Executive acknowledges that while employed by the Company Executive will occupy a position of trust and confidence. The Company has provided and shall continue to provide Executive with Confidential Information. Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for benefit of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and shall not, except as may be required to perform Executive's duties hereunder or as required by applicable law, without limitation in time, communicate, divulge, disseminate, disclose to others or otherwise use, whether directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information. "Confidential Information" shall mean information about the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, and their respective businesses, employees, consultants, contractors, suppliers, clients and customers that is not disclosed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates for financial reporting purposes and that was learned by Executive in the course of employment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, including (without limitation) any proprietary knowledge, trade secrets, data, formulae, processes, methods, research, secret data, costs, names of users or purchasers of their respective products or services, business methods, operating procedures or programs or methods of promotion and sale, information relating to accounting or tax strategies and data, information and client and customer lists and all papers, resumes, and records (including computer records) of the documents containing such Confidential Information. For purposes of this Section 2(a), information shall not cease to be Confidential Information merely because it is embraced by general disclosures for financial reporting purposes or because individual features or combinations thereof are publicly available. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if Executive is required to disclose any such confidential or proprietary information pursuant to applicable law or a subpoena or court order, Executive shall promptly notify the Company in writing of any such requirement so that the
 
5


Company may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions hereof. Executive shall reasonably cooperate with the Company to obtain such a protective order or other remedy. If such order or other remedy is not obtained prior to the time Executive is required to make the disclosure, or the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, Executive shall disclose only that portion of the confidential or proprietary information which he is advised by counsel that he is legally required to so disclose. Executive acknowledges that such Confidential Information is specialized, unique in nature and of great value to the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates, and that such information gives the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates a competitive advantage. Executive agrees to deliver or return to the Company, at the Company's request at any time or upon termination or expiration of Executive's employment, all documents, computer tapes and disks, plans, initiatives, strategies, records, lists, data, drawings, prints, notes and written information (and all copies thereof) created by or on behalf of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates or prepared by Executive in the course of Executive's employment by the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates. As used in this Agreement, "subsidiaries" and "affiliates" shall mean any company controlled by, controlling or under common control with the Company.
(b) DUTY OF LOYALTY. In consideration of the Company's promise to disclose, and disclosure of, its Confidential Information and other good and valuable consideration provided hereunder, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by Executive, Executive hereby agrees and covenants that: Until the longer of (i) the last day of the Term and (ii) a period of 18 months beyond Executive's date of termination of employment for any reason, including the expiration of the Term (the "Restricted Period"), Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in, assist or become associated with a Competitive Activity. For purposes of this Section 2(b): (i) a "Competitive Activity" means, at the time of Executive's termination, any business or other endeavor in any jurisdiction of a kind being conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (or demonstrably anticipated by the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates), including, without limitation, those that are engaged in the provision of any lodging or travel related services (including, without limitation, corporate travel services), in any jurisdiction as of the Effective Date or at any time thereafter (such affiliates including, without limitation, Hotels.com, Hotwire, Inc. and TripAdvisor); and (ii) Executive shall be considered to have become "associated with a Competitive Activity" if Executive becomes directly or indirectly involved as an owner, principal, employee, officer, director, independent contractor, representative, stockholder, financial backer, agent, partner, advisor, lender, or in any other individual or representative capacity with any individual, partnership, corporation or other organization that is engaged in a Competitive Activity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Executive may make and retain investments during the Restricted Period, for investment purposes only, in less than five percent of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly-traded corporation engaged in a Competitive Activity if stock of such corporation is either listed on a national stock exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market System if Executive is not otherwise affiliated with such corporation; (ii) Executive may serve as an employee or partner (or otherwise hold an ownership interest) in an investment firm that has an ownership interest in a partnership, corporation or other organization that is engaged in a Competitive Activity provided such ownership interest does not constitute greater than 20% of such investment firm's total assets under management and Executive is not directly involved with the provision of direction
 
6


or management of such entity; and (iii) Executive may serve as an employee of or partner (or otherwise hold an ownership interest) in a consultancy or investment bank engaged in providing advisory services to entities engaged in Competitive Activities provided that Executive is not directly involved in the provision of the advisory services to such entities.
(c) NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. Executive recognizes that he or she will possess Confidential Information about other employees, officers, directors, agents, consultants and independent contractors of the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities, compensation and benefits, and inter-personal relationships with suppliers to and customers of the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates. Executive recognizes that the information he or she will possess about these employees, officers, directors, agents, consultants and independent contractors is not generally known, is of substantial value to the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates in developing their respective businesses and in securing and retaining customers, and will be acquired by Executive because of Executive's business position with the Company. Executive agrees (i) that, during the Restricted Period, Executive will not, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit or recruit the employment or services of (i.e., whether as an employee, officer, director, agent, consultant or independent contractor), or encourage to change such person's relationship with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, any employee, officer, director, agent, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates provided, however, that a general solicitation of the public for employment shall not constitute a solicitation hereunder so long as such general solicitation is not designed to target, or does not have the effect of targeting, any employee, officer, director, agent, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates and (ii) that Executive will not convey any Confidential Information or trade secrets about any employees, officers, directors, agents, consultants and independent contractors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to any other person except within the scope of Employee's duties hereunder.
(d) NON-SOLICITATION OF CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, PARTNERS. During the Restricted Period, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, solicit, attempt to do business with, or do business with any customers of, suppliers (including providers of travel inventory) to, business partners of or business affiliates of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, "Trade Relationships") on behalf of any entity engaged in a Competitive Activity, or encourage (regardless of who initiates the contact) any Trade Relationship to use the services of any competitor of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, or encourage any Trade Relationship to change its relationship with the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates.
(e) PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; ASSIGNMENT. All Executive Developments (as defined below) shall be made for hire by Executive for the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. "Executive Developments" means any idea, discovery, invention, design, method, technique, improvement, enhancement, development, computer program, machine, algorithm or other work or authorship, in each case, (i) that (A) relates to the business or operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or (B) results from or is suggested by any undertaking assigned to Executive or work performed by Executive for or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether created alone or with others, during or
 
7


after working hours and (ii) that is conceived or developed during the Term. All Confidential Information and all Executive Developments shall remain the sole property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Executive shall acquire no proprietary interest in any Confidential Information or Executive Developments developed or acquired during the Term. To the extent Executive may, by operation of law or otherwise, acquire any right, title or interest in or to any Confidential Information or Executive Development, Executive hereby assigns to the Company all such proprietary rights. Executive shall, both during and after the Term, upon the Company's request, promptly execute and deliver to the Company all such assignments, certificates and instruments, and shall promptly perform such other acts, as the Company may from time to time in its reasonable discretion deem necessary or desirable to evidence, establish, maintain, perfect, enforce or defend the Company's rights in Confidential Information and Executive Developments.
(f) COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. During the Term, Executive shall adhere to the policies and standards of professionalism set forth in the Company's Policies and Procedures as they may exist from time to time.
(g) REMEDIES FOR BREACH. Executive expressly agrees and understands that Executive will notify the Company in writing of any alleged breach of this Agreement by the Company, and the Company will have 30 days from receipt of Executive's notice to cure any such breach. Executive expressly agrees and understands that the remedy at law for any breach by Executive of this Section 2 will be inadequate and that damages flowing from such breach are not usually susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that upon Executive's violation of any provision of this Section 2 the Company shall be entitled to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction immediate injunctive relief and obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach as well as an equitable accounting of all profits or benefits arising out of such violation. Nothing in this Section 2 shall be deemed to limit the Company's remedies at law or in equity for any breach by Executive of any of the provisions of this Section 2, which may be pursued by or available to the Company.
(h) SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Section 2 shall, to the extent provided in this Section 2, survive the termination or expiration of Executive's employment with the Company and, as applicable, shall be fully enforceable thereafter in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state that any restriction in this Section 2 is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under the laws of that state, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the law of that state.
3. MERGER. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and terminates and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Executive acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has made, and is not making, and in executing this Agreement, Executive has not relied upon, any representations, promises or inducements except to the extent the same is expressly set forth in this Agreement. All Stock Option Agreements and Restricted Stock Unit Agreements between
 
8


Executive and the Company survive and are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
4. ASSIGNMENT; SUCCESSORS. This Agreement is personal in its nature and none of the parties hereto shall, without the consent of the others, assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder, provided that, in the event of a transfer of Executive to any entity affiliated with the Company and/or the merger, consolidation, transfer, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company with or to any other individual or entity, this Agreement shall, subject to the provisions hereof, be binding upon and inure to the benefit of such successor and such successor shall discharge and perform all the promises, covenants, duties, and obligations of the Company hereunder, and all references herein to the "Company" shall refer to such successor.
5. WITHHOLDING. The Company shall make such deductions and withhold such amounts from each payment and benefit made or provided to Executive hereunder, as may be required from time to time by applicable law, governmental regulation or order.
6. HEADING REFERENCES. Section headings in this Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose. References to "this Agreement" or the use of the term "hereof" shall refer to these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Employment Agreement attached hereto, taken as a whole.
7. WAIVER; MODIFICATION. Failure to insist upon strict compliance with any of the terms, covenants, or conditions hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant, or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of, or failure to insist upon strict compliance with, any right or power hereunder at any one or more times be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times. This Agreement shall not be modified in any respect, or extended beyond expiration of the Term (regardless of continued employment), except by a writing executed by each party hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the assignment of Employee to a different Reporting Officer due to a reorganization or an internal restructuring of the Company or its affiliated companies nor a change in the title of the Reporting Officer shall constitute a modification or a breach of this Agreement.
8. SEVERABILITY. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Agreement is in violation of any law or public policy, only the portions of this Agreement that violate such law or public policy shall be stricken. All portions of this Agreement that do not violate any statute or public policy shall continue in full force and effect. Further, any court order striking any portion of this Agreement shall modify the stricken terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect as possible to the intentions of the parties under this Agreement.
9. INDEMNIFICATION. The Company shall indemnify and hold Employee harmless for acts and omissions in Employee's capacity as an officer, director or employee of the Company to
 
9


the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Expedia, Inc. (Delaware).

Good day and welcome to Expedia's Q1 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Alan Pickerill, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc.
Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to Expedia, Inc.'s financial results conference call for first quarter ended March 31, 2017. I am pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP of Operations.
The following discussion including responses to your questions reflects management's views as of today, April 27, 2017 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise the information.
As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release.
I would like to note that beginning here in Q1 2017, we are including HomeAway on-platform gross bookings and property nights in our operational metrics. We've disclosed the quarterly balances for 2016 via an 8-K filing for comparative purposes. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.
With that, let me turn the call over to Dara.
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
Thanks, Alan. Expedia is off to a good start this year with first quarter gross bookings up 14%, revenue up 15% and adjusted EBITDA up 18% year-over-year. Stayed room nights grew 12%, negatively impacted by the Easter shift, while booked room nights grew 18% year-over-year. The Core OTA segment continue to gain momentum with the global brands delivering healthy room night growth through solid execution and product, technology, marketing and operations. We continue tuning our regional brand operating formula with an eye towards optimizing profitability and with some trade-offs against top-line growth. Note that the travel markets are quite dynamic, and it's been less than a year since we fully optimized Orbitz, integrated Orbitz into the fold. We're early here in our learnings.

Our OTA lodging supply portfolio now stands at about 385,000 properties, up 36% year-over-year. The HomeAway transition continues to go well. We're investing in growing our team of top-tier product and technology talent, and we shifted to a true test and learn culture to drive significant improvements in the overall user, homeowner and property manager experience.
We're still relatively early in developing our muscles in the variable marketing channels, but we're beginning to ramp them up in addition to making aggressive investments in offline and online brand marketing to bring more demand to our growing supply base. We now have nearly 1.4 million online bookable listings, representing over 2 million bookable units and an increasing percentage of instantly bookable properties.
Egencia delivered impressive adjusted EBITDA of $27 million in Q1, up 76% year-over-year, helped in part by lapping over the Orbitz for Business integration last year. We believe the business has reached an operational and technological inflection point and can now begin to scale at a more aggressive pace around the world. We're ramping up Egencia's sales organization to accelerate organic bookings and revenue growth. While this will be a headwind to near-term margins, as we bring in salespeople and train them up to Egencia standards, we believe we can balance this investment through the natural P&L leverage in the business at its current and go-forward scale.
Lastly, trivago continued its very strong pace of growth with standalone revenue growth of 62% and $21 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Growth was strong across all regions with the highest rate of growth in APAC along with solid growth in Europe and North America. The trivago team plans to continue to invest into growth, and we'll share more details on their earnings call in mid-May.
We're happy to have begun the year from a position of strength. Our Core OTA and Egencia businesses are posting attractive top line growth rates, investing aggressively in selling and marketing while leveraging their fixed cost base. After that, the impressive growth of HomeAway and trivago and smart capital allocation, and you get an effective formula for long-term value creation. It's early in the year with plenty of competition in the field, but we like where we stand now. Mark?
Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Thanks, Dara. With both feet firmly back into business as usual mode, we're happy to have kicked off 2017 with a strong set of results. Total lodging revenue, including both hotel revenue and all of the HomeAway revenue, grew 12% for the first quarter, driven by stayed room night growth at the same rate. Normalized for Easter and last year's leap day, we estimate room night growth would have been approximately 300 basis points higher.
Our global brands, Hotels.com, Brand Expedia, EAN and Egencia collectively delivered room night growth of 17%, a growth rate that would have been nicely higher if normalized for Easter. HomeAway revenue grew 30% to $185 million, driven by property night growth and increased revenue per property night.
HomeAway property nights grew 39% year-over-year on a booked basis, while HomeAway stayed property night growth of 12% was particularly impacted by seasonality and the Easter shift. Property night revenue has improved as a result of our service fees, partially offset by decreased subscription revenue as we continue to lap over the elimination of tiered subscription sales in July of 2016 and as we transition more of our listings to the paper booking model and to our lower online bookable subscription rates.
As expected, HomeAway's EBITDA was down year-over-year as a result of seasonal impacts to revenue coupled with aggressive investments in selling and marketing and technology and content. We currently expect HomeAway's 2017 revenue growth to peak in Q3, a quarter in which HomeAway will deliver the significant majority of its adjusted EBITDA dollar growth.

Lastly, as a reminder, we will also start to see somewhat easier expense comps for HomeAway in the back half of the year as we begin to lap the ramp-up of certain selling and marketing and technology and content spend late last year. Advertising and media revenue of $257 million is up 47% year-over-year, a nice acceleration from the 36% growth we saw in Q4.
On a standalone basis, trivago revenue grew 62% year-over-year and delivered $21 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, a bit ahead of our expectations. The trivago formula is working, and the team plans to reinvest some of the upside to-date in selling and marketing to drive continued impressive qualified referral growth around the world. trivago continues to nicely outpace other scale customer acquisition channels in travel.
Our adjusted expenses trended in the right direction, and we're in line with our target P&L, something we also expect to see for the full year. We're driving leverage on our fixed costs, which allows us to make aggressive investments in selling and marketing. Cost of revenue grew just 3% year-over-year in Q1, leveraging nicely on efficiency in our credit card and fraud costs and our global customer operations platform, partially offset by growth in our cloud spending. While we continue to expect to see leverage in cost of revenue, we are forecasting somewhat higher growth rates for the rest of the year.
Direct selling and marketing expenses grew 25% as we continued to push for global growth, primarily led by aggressive spending at trivago and HomeAway, along with continued growth for Brand Expedia and Hotels.com.
Indirect selling and marketing, which represents people costs, grew 7% year-over-year. We currently expect total selling and marketing cost to grow faster than revenue for the balance of the year. G&A expenses grew 6% in Q1, leveraging nicely, which we expect to see for the full year as well. Technology and content were just 2% year-over-year as we are lapping over the accelerated pace of hiring and the Orbitz integration-related head count we carried in the first half of 2016.
As expected, continued growth of the HomeAway team led to faster technology content expense growth for that business. In total, though we expect technology and content expenses to grow faster next quarter and accelerate further in the back half, on a full year basis, we currently expect to be able to deliver slight leverage on this line item, fully inclusive of the planned cloud spend.
On that note, I'm pleased to say that our cloud migration efforts are going well. Total cloud spending for the quarter was $16 million, up from $6 million last year with nearly 60% of that spend in cost of revenue and about 40% of it in technology and content. We remain comfortable with our estimate of total cloud costs of $110 million in 2017 and though difficult to predict with certainty, we expect the full year mix to be roughly even between cost of revenue and technology and content.
From a capital deployment standpoint, we have repurchased nearly 450,000 shares so far in 2017 for a total of $54 million. Our longstanding approach to capital deployment has not changed, and we continue to balance share repurchases, our quarterly dividend and opportunistic M&A.
Turning to our financial expectations for full year 2017, on a consolidated basis, including the ramp-up in cloud spending, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% to 15%. Excluding cloud expenses, growth would be 14% to 19%. Separately, we have trimmed our CapEx forecast a bit and now expect CapEx excluding cost related to our headquarters project to be down year-over-year.
For the full year, we are expecting depreciation expense to grow in the mid-20% range with the pace of growth decelerating from Q1 through the end of the year.

With that, let's turn to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We'll go first to Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Yes. Hi. Thank you very much. Just on – two quick questions. So first, on HomeAway, Dara, can you talk about the conversion rates on the instantly bookable properties, what kind of trend you have seen to date and what should we expect going forward, given that you are willing to spend so much on the variable channels? And then I have a follow-up.
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
Sure. In general, we are seeing overall conversion rates at HomeAway continue to increase on a year-on-year basis and continuing to increase at healthy rates. So when you look at the booking trends, which are strong and positive, it's a combination of traffic to HomeAway increasing on a year-on-year basis. It's double digits. We're being hurt by SEO but certainly being helped by other traffic sources, including the investment that we're making in the variable channels.
And then the team is optimizing around booking conversion, and booking conversion is up at healthy rates on a year-on-year basis, although we feel that we have a long way to go. In general, the move towards what we're trying to make are two moves. One is from offline to online bookable, and we have over 85% of our properties now online bookable. And then we're also making the transition over from online bookable to instant bookable. That's still earlier and we think that the move to instant booking will continue to be a tailwind as it relates to overall conversion rates.
Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Okay. And then just sort of drilling a little bit into the – into your response, so what should we expect about your ability to tweak the best sort for the remain- as we look into the remainder of the year? So I guess, with the ungrandfathering of the subscriptions, you would probably have more flexibility to do that. What would be the cadence of your tweak to the thing?
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
Yeah. I'd say the cadence is unpredictable. These are – we're putting in sort changes on a daily, weekly basis. You are right to conclude that as the paid tier subscription or the higher tier subscriptions roll off, we have greater room for optimization. And we think we're very, very early in the overall optimization. So the sort teams continue to roll out new algorithms and, in general, the algorithms are getting better and better. And this is really before we put machine learning into play as well. These are, call it, more static algorithms that are being optimized, and I think machine learning can take this to a different level. And we're really one year in here. So we got a long, long way to go.
Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
And Naved, as a reminder, that tiered subscriptions will completely become a non-issue starting in July of this year. So at that point, we've got complete freedom, but as Dara said, there's lots of tests already going on.
Operator
We'll go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks very much for the question. A couple, if I could. Last quarter, you talked about improving the homeowner dashboard control to help property owners better understand the algorithms. Wondering if any of those improvements have rolled out yet and if so, what the feedback has been. And then secondly, wondering if you could give us any color on Orbitz? Thanks so much.
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
Sure. As far as the owner dashboard, we have – there's been a significant amount of development going into the owner dashboard. In general, we want to arm up the owners with significantly more data, both in terms of their earning power, in terms of the kinds of folks looking at their properties and really how they can capture more share within our marketplace. I would expect some pretty significant releases over the year. I think we're pretty early. We've introduced some better calendar management, for example. We've optimized the traveler app for the checkout experiences. We've launched House Rules that inform travelers of what's expected of them before they book, but I think these are really the basics, and we're just getting started here.

I do think we can do a better job, in general, in explaining to owners what they can and should be doing to improve their sorts. One of the significant factors is content, the quality of content as far as pictures goes, the quality of content as far as what to expect when you get into the home and, obviously, reviews. And I do think that this is an area that when we talk to our owners, we get some feedback that we can be doing better, and the HomeAway team is certainly focused on making sure owners understand exactly why they are getting the demand that they're getting and how they can optimize and improve their demand inside the marketplace.
Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
And then, Peter, in terms of Orbitz, I'd say generally, we're pretty pleased with the way that the – what was the old Orbitz and is now part of Expedia, Inc. is performing. In terms of just some specifics on that, from a top-line perspective, the business is still declining and, call it, the mid-teens range. As a reminder, the reason for this is there's a number of formerly Orbitz Partner Network customers that we didn't migrate over, a number of points of sale for e-workers that we didn't migrate over, some Orbitz for Business customers that we didn't migrate over.
But if you back out the impact of that, the core of the business looks good. The conversion rates we're seeing on hotel looks solid and of course, the cost synergies that we really brought in to fruition through 2016 are there in full force. So we're happy with what we see. We are still optimizing the Orbitz businesses and getting that right marketing formula in place to optimize for profit margin and of course, profit margin in these businesses looks absolutely excellent. Next question, please?
Operator
We'll go next to Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer.
Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Should we expect HomeAway online gross bookings to follow similar seasonal trends as last year or as you are able to pivot the business to a more transactional model, should we expect a more smooth seasonal pattern? And then additionally for HomeAway, can you provide a breakdown between traveler fee or transactional revenue versus subscription and other?
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
Sure. I'll answer the first, Jed. We are getting used to HomeAway booking patterns and stay patterns at this point. So we can't answer your question with absolute certainty. It actually looks to us like the seasonal stay patterns are going to become more pronounced. What we're seeing is that the early entrants into the HomeAway marketplace or property managers who might have had more apartments kind of the professionally managed concept apartments. We're seeing the average dollar value per property booking with HomeAway move up, which means that the bigger homes are coming online, and the demand is moving over to the bigger homes. Those larger homes tend to be more seasonal in nature, so we would actually expect to see a higher percentage of dollar stays if for HomeAway concentrated in Q3 than what you saw last year. Mark, you want to answer the HomeAway traveler fee versus transactional revenue?
Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Yes, sure. Yeah. So we're not going to give the quarterly number but just as a reminder, what we said was that by the end of 2017 here, we'd be at about 25% subscription and no change. We're really on track to turn that way.
Operator
We'll go next to Ross Sandler with Barclays.
Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, guys. This is Deepak on for Ross. Can you talk about the levels of marketing spend that are going into different components between the OTA brands and HomeAway this year? I think HomeAway was expected to ramp. And then given the several quarters we are into the integration, are the practices that are employed typically in Expedia to optimize for conversions currently put into place in HomeAway at this stage? How do you view their efficiency of marketing programs? I have one more follow-up after that.

Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
Yeah. I think on the second question, most definitely, the CEO of HomeAway is John Kim, and John was the Head of Product at Expedia. So you can imagine that we have taken a number of Expedia practices and we have combined them with HomeAway practices that come up with, call it, the best-of-breed both in terms of design and in product and in technology as well.
So, the HomeAway team is driving a lot more experimentation, significantly more A/B testing and the pace of change and testing on that site now is – while it's not up to, call it, Expedia or Hotels.com standards, it has significantly accelerated versus where they were a year ago, and I anticipate it's going to significantly accelerate going into next year, which is going to help conversion rates and is also going to help our ability to market into variable channels.
We have moved over talent from online marketing from Hotels.com to HomeAway as well. So there's a bunch of talent moving over. The trends in terms of conversion are good. It's translating into higher online marketing numbers, and it's safe to assume that the HomeAway marketing spend on a year-on-year basis, the increase is higher than the year-on-year increases that you see in our Core OTA. Anything to add there, Mark?
Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I'd say, I'd put some numbers on it. I think our direct sales and marketing for HomeAway up north of 50% in the first quarter. We will start to see those decelerate, though, as we move through the year, because we're going to lap particularly in the back half of the year the aggressive ramp-up in sales and marketing. That's not in a spot where it's totally moving the needle on our overall sales and marketing numbers yet, although it is a factor.
And to your other point around where we're putting dollars across the Core OTA brands, we're really putting money in behind Brand Expedia. We're putting it in behind Hotels.com. Egencia is a driver as well, other segment for us. And when you look at the bulk of our direct sales and marketing spend, which is growing 25% in the quarter, I think about the growth rate in sales and marketing in the Core OTA segment as being pretty close to that, because that's really where it's going. It's going to the big global brands.

We'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
There Doug?
Operator
Douglas, your line is open. Please check your mute function.
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
Let's try someone else and maybe Doug will come back.
Operator
We'll go next to Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.
Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC
Thanks guys. As you look at the inventory additions this quarter, can you give us any color of the mix overall, hotels versus non-traditional? I guess what I'm getting at is, are you happy with your overall inventory mix, maybe across geographies? Are you happy with the way you're adding non-traditional and hotels?
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
Yeah. I'd say we're happy, but we think we have a long way to go. The inventory now is at about 385,000 hotels. We are early in the integration of the HomeAway inventory into the mainline OTA inventory. So we're just getting started there, and we have a long way to go. And we think that the pace of inventory addition, I think, we've added, it's up about 36% on a year-on-year basis as far as inventory goes. That kind of a pace is going to continue. It's not going to be consistent every single quarter, but that kind of a base is certainly going to continue.
The new hotels continue to perform well within our marketplace. They represent an opportunity for us to spend more marketing dollars as well as to increase conversion on a destination basis as well, and it's just part of the formula right now. It's higher conversion, the higher conversion driving more marketing both online and offline. The more marketing allowing us the ability to add more supply into the marketplace and all of that increasing customer loyalty, which is really the formula that we've had for a long time, and you've got to optimize each portion of that formula a little bit in order to improve. And of course, you have to improve more than the overall market because the market is certainly improving as well. So I think we are in the early middle portion of the game, and we're quite optimistic about the opportunities here over the next 3 to 5 years.

Operator
We'll go next to Akshay Bhatia with Bank of America.
Akshay Bhatia - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for the question. When we look at the Core OTA take rate, looks pretty stable year-over-year. Could you talk about some of the puts and takes, specifically touching on maybe the mix of agency, hotel accelerator, and then maybe some of the negotiations you guys are having with hotel brands?
Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Yeah. So I think the story is similar to what we've seen for a while. I think on the hotel side, there still is a little bit of a headwind on margin, although that's significantly less than what it's been in the past. That's essentially offset by a couple of factors. One is, we do continue to see a mix shift of the business towards hotel, which is generally going faster than our air business.
Secondly, we've seen nice results from ancillary revenues and media revenues that are also buttressing those take rates, and all of those sort of net out to something that's relatively stable. And I think we're happy with generally where we are, and we're particularly happy with some of these ancillary revenue streams in the Core OTA business, like insurance, like our activities business that are performing nicely.
Akshay Bhatia - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
Thank you.
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
You're welcome. Next question, please.

We'll go next to Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse.
Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. First off, how should we think about the room night growth trajectory during the summer booking season for both domestic and international, given the deceleration and especially domestic in the reported numbers? And then just generally, how would you characterize the macro backdrop for travel in the U.S., Europe, and APAC?
Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Sure. So in terms of room night growth, I'd just remind you that the Easter impact was significant here in the first quarter. We were actually quite happy with what we saw in terms of room night growth and generally pointed to stable to faster in the first quarter on the normalized numbers that we look at. A few things to keep in mind, though, as we move into Q2 and Q3, one is, Easter will be a helper for us in Q2 from a reported basis, and then our comps do start to get easier as we move into Q2, and again, the easiest comp is probably into Q3, so a few things to keep in mind on that front.
In terms of the macro landscape in Europe and otherwise, I think largely similar. I think the London attack for us, we could certainly see impact to London but it's hard to tease that out completely from Easter. And our expectation, thing would be to get back to business as usual is that's what we've seen generally with other regions. The elections in France didn't cause too much of a stir for us. The macro backdrop in Europe seems to be reasonably healthy. When we look at the U.S., again, similar stories. Things seem to be reasonably healthy. We have seen a little bit of a slowdown in travel from the Middle East into the U.S. and a few cross-regional patterns like that, but, net-net, from where we see, looks like a healthy market to us.
Operator
We'll go next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could give us a bit of a sense of strategically how you're thinking about the trade-off between sales and marketing leverage and revenue growth. Obviously, you've got the targets out there for EBITDA, but to the extent that we saw the roughly 344 basis points of deleverage in sales and marketing this year or this quarter, can you give us a sense of what you're trying to get or what you think you'll get out of that kind of spend from a revenue growth perspective and where as a company you're happy with that revenue growth being?

Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Thanks, Heath. I guess, just one note for you in terms of sales and marketing leverage this quarter. This is always a tough quarter for us from a sales and marketing deleverage standpoint, and primary reason is that we're spending sales and marketing essentially against bookings, not against stayed revenues so there's a little bit of a mismatch. That's accentuated this quarter by the fact that we had Easter also shift which, of course, is an impact revenue and nothing to sales and marketing.
I'd say, generally, our strategy, though, as it relates to sales and marketing, has not changed. I mean, we are really looking to drive bottom-line adjusted EBITDA dollar growth and, to that end, really, we're looking to spend to drive more volume, get new customers into the platform, have them get a great experience and have them come back to us through the direct channels like apps, like e-mail, et cetera, and the formula is working.
And so, most of what you see when you see sales and marketing de-levered with us is largely as a result of mix drivers. It's the fact that we're spending more aggressively and the region is getting bigger, Asia Pacific, for example, than we are in the U.S. and, though even Asia – even though Asia is less efficient from a sales and marketing perspective than the U.S., that's what's driving the mix, and Asia itself is getting more efficient over time.
We also see channel shifts in our sales and marketing expense as we drive conversion. It allows us to spend more into variable marketing channels. Again, the direct channels, the chief channels still look very healthy, and they're growing nicely, but essentially we're able to buy more in these variable channels, and that's a factor for us as well. So I think you'll see the same strategy for us. We like to invest aggressively in sales and marketing. We like to fund that with leverage and fixed cost. That's the formula. And I think you'll expect see that for a long time to come.
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
And just to push that home, Heath, we are not at all sensitive to overall sales and marketing leverage or deleverage as a percentage of revenue. We're very much sensitive to channel ROI. But really, the two factors that we look at when we're trying to gauge the health of the business is, how fast is our direct channel growing and that growth really is the biggest driver of our profit growth, and that has been healthy and we're happy about the signs there.
And then how much money can we put to work in some of these indirect channels, especially outside of the U.S. because that's a key factor as the new customer acquisition and then moving those new customers into loyalty customers, for example, with Hotels.com or getting those new customers to try out packages on Expedia that really is an opportunity to save that you can't find really any place else. And the more new customers we bring in, to some extent, the worse our sales and marketing leverage is going to look just because of the margins in that part of the business, but that usually is not connected to ROI.
We're pretty disciplined about our ROI in these channels and, as a result, we're just driving ROI, and the amount we spend in each channel is, to some extent, unbalanced. We'll spend as much as we can at a certain ROI. The more you spend in the channel, the more difficult it is to drive ROIs that are attractive, and those are the two factors that essentially are going after each other.

And we'll go next to Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just one or two. First and foremost, you talked about hotel room nights booked. Great to see that metric grew 18% year-over-year. Is this something we can expect going forward or more like a onetime disclosure, just talking about the booking trends in the quarter? And then, Dara, following up on that last comment, actually around new packages and may be, Mark, to your ancillary revenue comments, there has been talk about the newer format package as more flexible. Can you just help us understand where that is and how sort of meaningful that is in the rollout? And then, lastly, any insight on HomeAway properties on Expedia would be helpful? Thank you.

Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Ron, so just on the hotel room nights booked, it's something that we will periodically disclose when we find it to be helpful to understand what's happening in the business. In this case because Easter was just such a big factor, both for the Core OTA business and particularly for HomeAway, we thought it was relevant to point it out. In normal operating circumstances, those numbers actually look relatively close together. But when they're not, we will call it out when it's helpful.
On the packages side, I'll start and then Dara definitely jump in. I think we are at a, I'd say, relatively early stage here. The Brand Expedia team particularly is working on some really interesting ways to dramatically improve the shopping experience when you're shopping for travel, we can – call it, packages but the experience starts to look a lot more just like a multi-item purchase where either during the time of your purchase, you can bundle things together in whatever order you want into almost like a shopping cart experience or increasing what we're seeing as products that we've launched where if you booked a flight, you don't necessarily have to book it at the same time, but you can get a big discount on a hotel or maybe a car rental or an activity. So I think we're relatively early here. The exciting thing is when we look at it, there's really only one player on a global basis that can do these types of things. There are things that, at least our early tests suggest that, consumers really want, and we think that Brand Expedia and the whole Brand Expedia multi-product group including Orbitz and Travelocity and Wotif and CheapTickets and ebookers in that great staple of brands are going to benefit from this for many, many, many years to come.

The only thing I would add just the key to what Mark said is, with our package path in the past, we would force our users to declare that they're looking for a package upfront, and the fact is that most travelers don't look – a vast majority of our travelers aren't looking for packages upfront. So the key here in our development is allowing users to attach more and more products to the single product that they came into the shop for, so to speak. We are consistently driving up our attach rates. We think there's a lot of upside there. And as we are able to attach more, that allows us to actually pay more for new customers that we find, especially in variable channels and international points-of-sale as well.
So it has a double effect, and that obviously it allows us to monetize users more effectively. It allows us to deliver discounts to those users that they can't find pretty much anywhere else on the web and also the more contact that we have with our users, the better. The more relevant that we are, the better, and it allows us to be more aggressive about marketing in the various channels. So we think it's – we're in the middle of the game, and we think there's lots of potential left for us in that area.
As far as the HomeAway properties on Expedia, we're up to almost 30,000 properties on the platform, still relatively small compared to the overall HomeAway supply base. And one of the factors there is that the Expedia model is based on commission, and the HomeAway model is based on a combination of commission and traveler service fee, and we are going to be looking to build that flexibility into the Expedia platform, which we think is really going to open up the Expedia, Hotels.com channel into the HomeAway supply as well.
So that is going to happen throughout the year. I would say that when you look at this year and the development of HomeAway this year, by far, the number one priority for us is pushing HomeAway and developing that trend – that transition from an advertising platform to a global transactional platform. We think the upside there is absolutely enormous. And, by far, the number one priority is HomeAway on a standalone basis. The HomeAway supply on Expedia, Hotels.com is considerable long-term upside, but it's priority number two at this point.

We'll go next to Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Company.
Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC
Hi. Thanks a lot. I just had a follow-up on HomeAway. When you look at night stayed there at plus 12% in Q1 versus nights booked at plus 39%, it was a pretty dramatic recovery. Could you just go over the top key factors again that you saw over Q4 and Q1 in that business that drove the acceleration? Thanks.
Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Thanks, Kevin. Well, Easter was a factor, but by far, the biggest factor is a lengthening in the booking window that we're seeing with HomeAway, and it really goes to, we believe anyways, one of the factors that Dara called out. The early adopters on online bookability were predominantly some of the larger property managers.
And as we have rolled out online bookability throughout a broader selection of properties, what we've actually seen is an increase in the value per booking, which suggests to us that there's a mix shift into some of these larger bigger tickets, whole-home unique properties and those types of properties generally need to be booked much further in advance. So we're definitely seeing a lengthening of the booking window. We think that could be a driver. We haven't nailed down all of the specifics of what could be causing it, but that's by far the most obvious one that we can see at this point.
Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Great. And then just to follow-up on that, how far along do you think you are in the process of kind of making sure all of the business that you're originating is [] transacted online to the platform?
Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Well, I'd say we've got a ways to go on that. It's a big opportunity still. We know that there are transactions that are happening off-platform, and the team is really focused on really developing reasons why both on the traveler side and on the property owner side or property manager side, reasons for people to stick with the platform. You've seen it on the consumer side where they've introduced the Book with Confidence Guarantee increasingly. You'll see HomeAway willing to step in front of a traveler, and if they've got a bad experience, help them move to a new property or help solve their problem.
They are working on various series of, what I'd call, carrots and sticks on the owner and the supplier side to incent the right behavior and put more bookings on the platform. They're early on that side. They've got a number of supplier-facing data and tools that they're building out dashboarding, et cetera. As Dara mentioned, they're experimenting with sort, and these are the types of factors around on-platform versus off-platform that can start to influence sort order. And there's a number of other, call it, goodies that HomeAway is looking at rolling out across the platform to incent the right behavior. So it's relatively early. It's a really high priority for that team, and we're very optimistic that they're going to be able to increasingly just drive much more on-platform adoption because it's going to be something that both travelers and suppliers want to do.
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
Yes, I think we're going to make it considerably more attractive, especially for our homeowners and property managers to stay on platform, so there are some pretty exciting products coming out there, so stay tuned.

And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Jim Shaughnessy - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks, guys. This is Jim Shaughnessy stepping in for Mark. Just a quick question on international booking trends. I think on the last call, you mentioned that you expect trends to improve throughout 2017, and it looks like they have. So maybe building off a prior question, why don't you drill down a little bit on which markets you think are performing particularly well and continue in 2017? Thanks.

Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Yes, I mean, I think we're seeing a broad pick-up across the region. Brand Expedia, particularly, has seen some nice growth in Europe. They rolled out some new features in the air side of the business that's been driving some really solid results. We've seen strong results in various parts of Asia. Hotels.com is having a blockbuster year so far in South Korea, posting pretty impressive results, and Latin America generally is good. Mexico has been pretty strongly really for across our brands.
I'd also say that one of the things to keep in mind when you're looking at international booking trends is that we will start to see some improvement further in the back half of the year as we lap over the ebookers transition, and that's actually a headwind on bookings. And because it was a business that had a fair bit of air in it, it has a disproportionate impact on gross bookings. But I'd say, generally Asia, Latin America and Europe are strengths with the countries I mentioned.
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
And Paris is coming back now, is recovering from obviously the negative numbers that we saw last year. So Paris is growing for us, which is great to see. That city certainly needs a business. And London as a destination for us is very, very strong, which we think has to do with the British pound. Once the British pound went down, London as a destination became – the numbers there were pretty darn attractive, and they continue as we speak.

We'll go next to Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.
Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Hey, good afternoon. I guess you may have answered some portion of the question, but tell us what percent of HomeAway properties or transactions are now capturing the traveler bookings, or do you expect to keep that at 100% of properties or will there always be some subset that don't capture the booking fees?
Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Well, the general way to think about it is when properties are online bookable, so the 1.4 million properties we have that are online bookable, they are all fee-able and are generally all being applied a traveler fee to it on the HomeAway platform. There will be some that are on the Brand Expedia platform, for example, which currently don't have a fee attached to them. But generally, on HomeAway, everything that's online, think about that as traveler fee-able. There are still some transactions though that are happening offline, which we don't have great visibility into, and that's where you'd call there be leakage, if you will, but that's really isolated to the offline business.
Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Okay. And then you talked about buying back 450,000 shares so far this year. Is it your goal to somewhat offset stock comp dilution or is the goal longer-term to actually shrink the share count over time through your buyback activity or do you kind of want to focus on keeping dry powder for acquisitions? Thank you.
Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Well, I'd say it's the same strategy as we've always had. If you look back over history, we have shrunk our share count over time, and we're big believers in this business, and I would look at our past behavior as an indication of what we will likely do in the future. But that's not the case always from quarter-to-quarter, and it's not always the case from year-to-year. And we certainly take into account the M&A pipeline and what we're thinking about doing on that side. We look at our dividend, and then share repurchase is something that we do look at. We always have an eye to dilution, but it's not formulaic. It's not the driver and we do think that part of our capital allocation strategy will include share repurchases over the next number of years.

Next question, please.

We'll go next to Mark May with Citi.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Hopefully, these weren't taken already. But in terms of Core OTA margins, could you provide any color in terms of how much of the modest decline year-on-year was attributable to investments in, say, new markets, new growth initiatives versus kind of investing and doubling down, if you will, in some of your core markets?
And if you could provide, if you haven't already, a progress update in terms of where you are in terms of leveraging the HomeAway inventory across the Expedia brands. And what, if any, impact that that is having either in Q1 or you expect to have this year in terms of room night growth. Thanks.
Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Mark, the real driver on margins for the quarter was the shift of Easter to the second quarter. That, I'd call that number one, and no real other significant drivers I'd call out. It's really sort of business as usual for us, and we're happy with the margin profile that we see. And I think in Q2, you'll probably see the offset there of what happened in the first quarter. Dara, you want to talk about HomeAway?
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
Mark, on the HomeAway inventory, we talked about it some earlier. It's very early. Right now the production of HomeAway inventory on Expedia brands is pretty small. And we would expect to see that increase significantly as the year goes on and especially into next year. The priority for the HomeAway teams at this point is to make sure that the transition to online transactions go smoothly, make sure that the experience, the traveler experience and the homeowner experience is as good as it can be, and that's really what we're focused on at this point.

We'll go next to Justin Patterson with Raymond James.
Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. Thank you very much. First on Egencia, Dara, you alluded to the business hitting an inflection point. Could you discuss what changed and just remind us whether the sales force investment was in the initial plan for the year or if it does something you've decided that lean into and invest a bit more in?
And then, secondly, on HomeAway, could you walk through just what differences you see between conversion on instantly bookable and online bookable today, and then what levers you have to move back more toward instant bookable over time? Thanks.
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
Sure. As far as Egencia hitting an inflection point, Egencia has been – the team has been hard at work in a number of integrations over the past three years via integration, Orbitz for business integrations, the Orbitz business integration really, really going well. And those integrations always take time, and they take focus, and they cost money. And at the same time, the team has been investing in the core systems of the business to globalize them or to modernize the technology stack, really in the same way that we've been consistently doing with Expedia, Hotels.com, et cetera.
Egencia has been a little later in coming just because of all the integrations that the team has been driving, but we feel like we're in a really good spot where the team is starting to deliver just excellent innovation on the product side. The sale, the response to our sales pictures, et cetera, has been very attractive, and we just continue to gain share in the core travel marketplace. We think that we are competing against a set of competitors who has fundamentally not made the shift online, has fundamentally not made the shift to agile technology, and we think this is the time for it to double down.
So seeing the very strong results in the first quarter, we were already planning to invest in the Egencia sales team, but the pattern for our company overall Expedia, Inc. is, when we see some strength, we like to lean into that strength. And with Egencia, we're seeing strength, we're leaning into that strength, and it will be safe to assume that the sales plan and the sales hiring plan for Egencia is higher today than where we started a year from and that's a great thing.

As far as HomeAway, the differences in conversion, we're not going to disclose specific differences, but it's safe to assume that online bookable properties convert and produce at better rates – sorry, instant bookable properties produce at stronger rates than simply online bookable properties. Right now, the focus is moving the folks to online bookable, and we will quickly shift to getting as much of them instant bookable as possible.

We'll go next to Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates.
Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates
Thank you. Kind of following up on some of the things you suggested. Interested in your thoughts on if you see some major disruptive technology on the horizon and if so, where so and when so? And does it involve AI or what it may involve? And sort of unrelated to that, can you talk about what you're seeing in timeshare business as competitive for HomeAway and for maybe some of the related type of companies? Thank you.
Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
I think AI is a good deal down the road. I think, right now, we are more dependent on OI, organic intelligence, here of folks here at the company. I think as far as disruptive technology, I do like to talk about the 3Ms, and it's not disruptive. It's just happening. One is mobile for us. And right now with most brands, over a-third of our transactions are mobile. Over half of our traffic is mobile. And the cool thing about mobile is it's always on, and it gives you location context.
The second M for us that's emerging, especially in the APAC markets are messaging. And what messaging does for us is, it allows two-way communication at any time, but it also combines identity with our communication. And once you have identity, you can start communicating with someone on a one-to-one basis. Most of our systems right now are built to serve the average. Basically as a consumer when you come to Expedia, most of our systems are built to serve the average consumer. Now more and more we can optimize to the specific customer.
And you combine that with a third M, which is machine learning, it is only possible to optimize to the individual based on very significant amounts of data, very significant amounts of interaction, so that you can start treating every single customer in a different way. You can go back to the olden days, when you're travel agent knew exactly what you wanted.
This is going to be disruptive, but it's going to be a slow disruption as we learn more and more about you, as you tell us more and more about you through your behavior and otherwise give us more data, but we think that, that personal one-to-one connection is something that's coming over a period of time.
And we think that because we have so many opportunities to interact with a customer we are – and also because we are investing significantly in technology, in product, in user interaction, I think, that we are one of the best positioned companies in travel to take advantage of it. So call it a slow disruption, but it is absolutely coming.
As far as the timeshare business as it relates to HomeAway, I think the timeshare companies and timeshare owners probably are participants in the HomeAway marketplace, but I can't say that it's something that we talk about on a significant basis in the HomeAway haul. So I'm sure they're part of the marketplace, but at this point, it's not a significant portion of our strategy.
Operator
We'll go next to Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson.
Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two please, if I may. Is there any other color you can provide on the overall performance at your OTA brand other than Orbitz? And then also the step-up at inter-company eliminations, does that just have to do with Expedia's brand taking more share on trivago or driving more traffic through trivago relative to other channels? Thanks so much.

Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Sure. I'll take those, Perry. But just take the second one first. The answer is yes. That is largely due to our brands, so it could be Brand Expedia, Hotels.com taking share in the trivago channel and doing very well there. Super attractive channel right now in the market, generally just because it's growing so quickly and our brands are performing well, and we're very happy with the performance there, so it shows up in that number.
In terms of overall performance at the core OTA brands, I think Brand Expedia is doing very well right now. It's great to have that team refocused on the core business and not so focused on integrations. They did a phenomenal job of those integrations. But as we all know, they did take a toll on the results, but that team is right back to business as usual.
They're thrilled to be back to business as usual, and they're thrilled with the opportunity ahead of them, and they're going after it, and the results are starting to show up. We're pleased with what we're seeing at Hotels.com as well. That team has been executing very well for a long period of time. They've got a great rewards program, and they continue to press on that. Their international growth, I mentioned South Korea is impressive, and they just continue to execute on their formula around the world. And then I'd also call out our private label business, the Expedia Affiliate Network business, who had a really good year last year and is just on a really solid footing this year, just exceptional results really powering the whole industry, offline travel agencies, corporate travel players, other online travel agencies, airlines, all with our world-class agency and merchant hotel inventory. And I'd just say the team is executing very well there, and we're very excited about what that team can do.

We'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I think in a number of industry forums it's come up recently that paid marketing channels might actually be increasing their importance in terms of the way consumers are finding travel brands, planning their travel, you obviously have a play on that with trivago, but I don't know, if either Dara or Mark, if you would like to talk about the importance of the paid marketing channels, how relative ROIs might be evolving at some of those channels versus what you can do brand building and trying to drive more direct traffic over time and maybe lowering your overall ROI over time. Thanks, guys.
Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc.
Sure, Eric. In general, listen, I think it's accurate to say that the paid channels are growing their audience share in terms of travel spend, and the fastest share growth is coming from the meta channels, and the fastest share grower in the meta channels is trivago. That team is really executing on a world-class basis, and trivago I think as far as audience share as far as the channel goes, probably the fastest-growing scaled channel there is in terms of audience. And that's a great thing. And as it relates to our relationship with these paid channels, I think, in general, the OTAs are consistently investing in conversion, in user experience and in data science that allows us to get call it a higher share of those paid channels than the other players out there.
So while from a profitability margin basis, the increase in growth of those paid channels hurts our margin, we talked a little bit about our sales and marketing margin as a percentage of revenue. From a share standpoint, it is unquestionably a positive for us, and it's a bigger positive because trivago is a part of the family. We're very strict on ROIs and in general, ROIs for us look stable, and they look good, and we view the paid channels as very significant means for us to gain share and a significant means for us to go acquire new customers, especially in international markets.

And then, if we provide them for – if we provide those customers a great experience, again and again, we see that a certain percentage of those customers move over to repeat customers and stay with us and come direct. And when you look at the profit dollars that are coming into, call it, the big two OTAs, you can certainly see that the profit dollars and the profit dollar growth there is quite healthy on a global basis. And at this point, I don't see anything that would change that.

And we'll go next to Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.
Seth Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks for the question. This is Seth on for Lloyd. I was wondering if you could provide any additional color as to how HomeAway contributed to room night growth in the quarter and what the core room night year-over-year was, as it seems to slowed even given the ex-Easter and leap year impact? Thanks.
Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc.
Yeah. So HomeAway's standalone stayed room night growth was right in line with the rest of the business. So it didn't have an impact. It did help the books room night metric that we gave you. But I think also just keep in mind that the other number we gave is just around the global brands, which grew about 17% year-over-year on a stayed basis. So HomeAway was a factor, but it didn't change the story at all for us. Next question please?
