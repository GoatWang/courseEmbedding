FAQ



Q. Do you help writers sell material worldwide?
Most of the companies we work with are United States based companies. However, these companies may have international distribution capabilities as well as the ability to help translate your writing into other languages in order to be distributed outside of the United States.


Q. What are the fees associated with getting my writing published?
FindPublishingHelp.com is a free referral service for writers that visit our site. Much of the information you will find, and provided by the companies that we work with is also free. There may be fees associated with some of the services provided by these companies. We believe that an informed writer is a smart writer and that the information we provide will help writers determine what services are necessary as well as get the most out of any fee-based services.


Q. Does it matter if I have never published before?
Whether you are a novice or experienced writer, we can help in the publishing process. Our questionnaire will evaluate where you are in the writing process and provide results accordingly based on your responses.

Assuming sale of all of the shares offered herein, of which there is no
assurance, the net proceeds from this offering will be $45,000. The proceeds 
are expected to be disbursed, in the priority set forth below, during the 
first twelve (12) months after the successful completion of the offering:

                                                   Planned Expenditures Over
                    Category                           The Next 12 Months

            Website Design                                  $ 6,000

            Accounting, Auditing & Legal                    $10,500
            Office & Administration                         $ 7,500
            Working Capital                                 $ 5,000

            TOTAL PROCEEDS TO COMPANY                       $45,000
                                                            =======

We will establish a separate bank account and all proceeds will be deposited
into that account until the total amount of the offering is received and all
shares are sold, at which time the funds will be released to us for use in our
operations. In the event we do not sell all of the shares before the expiration
date of the offering, all funds will be returned promptly to the subscribers,
without interest or deduction. There is no assurance we will be able to return
the funds as we are not holding the money in a trust or similar account and a
creditor may be able to execute a judgment against the funds. If necessary our
director has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the
registration process but we will require full funding to implement our complete
business plan. The offering expenses, estimated to be $6,700, may properly be
deferred and charged against the gross proceeds of the offering per ASC
340-10-S99-1 however; the Company has elected to record and pay the offering
expenses as they are incurred.


The literary publishing industry is intensely competitive and fragmented. We 
will compete against a large number of well-established companies with greater 
product and name recognition and with substantially greater financial, 
marketing and distribution capabilities than ours, as well as against a large 
number of small specialty producers. Our competitors include, by way of 
example, Wiley Books, Fitzhenry Whiteside, Simon and Schuster and other well 
known and respected publishers. There can be no assurance that we can compete 
successfully in this complex and changing market. If we can not, our business 
will be adversely affected. 

-----

We will address who is the audience for this book, and why they need to buy 
this book, including providing demographic data that reinforces the writer's 
hypothesis. 

We will address the competition. List each title that would be in direct 
competition with the book, along with the author, publisher, and year of 
publication. We will explain why the book would be better, or how it fills a 
vacant niche in the market. 

-----

Getting a literary agent can be the first vital step towards getting published.
Writers who want to become authors are interested in one thing only and that is
writing. They do not want to worry about how or what is involved in the process
that eventually leads to getting their work published and in bookstores for the
masses to engage and enjoy. We believe also that since we have chosen a niche 
(health and wellness) that we can be very focused in our submissions and 
targeting the right distributor/publisher. 

Additionally, non-published writers have a more difficult time getting the 
attention of the bigger literary agent as often they already represent an 
author in the said genre.


Company Description
RedStone Literary Agents was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 20, 
2010. We were formed to represent and bring to market literary works and 
represent authors in North America. We are a development stage company and 
have not yet opened for business or generated any revenues. We have


 been 
issued a "substantial doubt" going concern opinion from our auditors and 
our only asset is $3,936 in cash in the bank, consisting of $9,230 in cash 
generated from the issuance of shares to our founder, less expenses. 

Redstone Literary Agents intends to represent authors to publishers. We will 
negotiate contract details and provide representation if any part of the book 
is illegally reproduced. It is our intention to first focus in the genre of 
health and wellness as we currently have relationships with some published 
and unpublished authors in the United States. 

Our administrative offices are currently located at the residence of our 
President, Mary Wolf which she donates to us on a rent free basis at 1842 E 
Campo Bello Drive, Phoenix Arizona, 85022. We have not leased an office yet 
but once we are successful in publishing a few titles we may consider doing 
so. Our registered statutory office is located at 375 N Stephanie St, Suite 
1411, Henderson, NV 89014-8909.
