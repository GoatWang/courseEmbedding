For other uses of "Brian Dunn", see Brian Dunn.
Brian J. Dunn (born 1959/1960) is an American businessman who was the chief executive officer of Best Buy, from April 2009 to April 2012, having worked there since 1985. He has also been on the board of directors of Dick's Sporting Goods since June 2006 and on the board of directors of the Best Buy Children's Foundation.[citation needed]
Dunn started working when he was 14 at a grocery store and did not attend college. He began at Best Buy when he was 24 as a salesman in 1985, when Best Buy had only a few stores.[1] Dunn's mother, Ethel, was an accountant at Best Buy.[2]
In 1989, Dunn became a store manager and in 1990 a district manager in Minnesota. He was promoted to regional manager for Ohio, Indianapolis and Philadelphia stores in 1996, and in May, 1998, rose to regional vice president of the northeastern region, leading Best Buy’s entry into that market. In March 2000, he was promoted to senior vice president of division 3 retail sales, encompassing all of Best Buy’s east coast operations. He was named executive vice president of U.S. retail in 2002, and president of North America retail in December 2004. Finally, he rose to chief executive officer, replacing Brad Anderson on June 24, 2009.[3]
Dunn resigned abruptly on April 10, 2012.[4][5]

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Dunn Brian J carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Dunn Brian J currently holds license 206899 (Electrician, Me Master Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Dunn Brian J



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Dunn Brian J



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Dunn Brian J



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

Dunn Joins Grey Cloak Tech Board of DirectorsMarketwiredDecember 8, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareLAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwired - December 08, 2015) -  Grey Cloak Tech (GRCK) announced today that Brian J. Dunn, a respected management consultant, board chairman and public speaker, has joined its Board of Directors. Mr. Dunn, 55, is a former CEO and board member of Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY), former board member of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and current chairman of Upsie, LLC,a Minneapolis-based technology startup in the $40 billion product warranty industry.His appointment to Grey Cloak Tech's Board of Directors comes after a five-month engagement as a strategic advisor, a role in which Mr. Dunn collaborated with Grey Cloak's management team on ways to center on customer needs, scale the company and unlock future value."I'm thrilled to be joining Grey Cloak at such a critical juncture in their growth and development," Mr. Dunn said. "I have for years been an advocate for the connected world, which is now being tabbed as the Internet of Things. Regardless of what we call it, the rapid evolution of technology has revolutionized how we live and work, including the unprecedented rise in digital marketing strategies and tools. However, there has been an unfortunate downside in the online marketing arena: 'black-hat' operators who employ unscrupulous methods to distort and block proprietary data, and rob legitimate enterprises of commissions and payments. Grey Cloak is uniquely positioned to stop these fraudulent activities and protect the integrity of their clients' marketing efforts.""We feel fortunate to add someone of Brian Dunn's caliber to our board," said Fred Covely, CEO of Grey Cloak Tech. "His leadership expertise, wealth of experience in scaling businesses and insights into digital trends are invaluable assets that will greatly benefit our organization."Today's announcement follows Grey Cloak's certification for listing as an OTC-traded stock. Grey Cloak's cloud-based software offers a sophisticated suite of features to track and eliminate multiple forms of digital advertising fraud, a problem the Interactive Advertising Bureauprojects will cost advertisers $8.2 billion annually. With digital advertising on the uptrend, poised to exceed television advertising and become the largest advertising category by 2019 according to PwC, the cost of click fraud threatens to grow exponentially."Online click fraud -- which includes underhanded techniques such as cookie stuffing, ad stacking, and domain spoofing -- is a serious problem affecting too many online marketers," said Covely. "Well-meaning advertisers and agencies may not grasp the extent of the deception because their analytics software is unable to recognize the sophisticated new fraud techniques these nefarious players utilize."Grey Cloak management has identified fraud detection as an initial building block in its vision to help organizations better identify both humans and devices, as the online realm rapidly evolves into the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is the network of physical objects embedded with electronics, sensors, software and network connectivity, enabling the collection and exchange of data.About Grey Cloak TechGrey Cloak Tech is the premier provider of software solutions that identify, track and eliminate digital advertising fraud. Its innovative, proprietary technologies help companies filter inaccurate click and impression data, detect non-human online traffic, block bogus online form submissions and expose counterfeit clicks and video views.It is the only publicly traded digital advertising fraud-protection company in the United States. Its shares are listed and traded on the OTC exchange under the symbol: "GRCK."Forward-Looking StatementsThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the SEC.

 Death Do Us Part is produced and engineered by Jon Matthews at The Sound Mill Studio. Brian’s album is born from the pain and sadness of losing his wife to cancer, but also the joy and hopefulness brought by his three young children.
                    
 
“Brian’s songs come from a place of truth. They resonate with deeply felt emotion, delivered by an authentic voice that you can’t help but believe. His sound carefully navigates the dividing lines of folk, roots, and alt-country, with instantly hummable melodies wrapped around lyrics that always hit home.”—Jon L. Matthews
