I was hurt on the job working for LOWES Companies Inc. in the Grove ok. location.  I came to work for LOWES in May of 2003.  I was hired as one of the initial 120 people who built this store from the ground up.  When I ,and the rest of the group of new hires, walked into this building only a few overhead lights were present.  I ran the steel chop saw, cutting the steel to build the shelves and secure them in this store.  We later stocked all the shelves.  I started out as a cashier in this store.  In 5 years I had worked up thru the ranks.  From cashier, to lumbar cashier, to pricing coordinator.  I took company classes to enable myself for promotions.  I left pricing and went into the Installed sales office.  When the Installed sales manager left, I had completed my training to become a department manager.  I then became Installed sales Department manager.  Was there for 2  1/2 years.  Was then moved out onto the sales floor to Flooring/Appliances/ home decor manager.  Moving heavy objects was no big thing.  I had done this throughout my tenure with lowes, whether it be Rolls of Carpet, Refrigerators, Lumbar, 80 pound sacks of concrete, Then on to the Plumbing department which was where I was working when I was injured.  I was taking a tub out of top stock. all 5 lumbar discs were compromised.  Former attorney only managed to get surgery to weaken L4-5. I hired Mitch in 2011. after a phone call explaining my problems. I took him my records.  He took my case. Today, I was notified that surgery to stabilize my spine had been approved, and finances would be coming.  God bless this man for working for the good of those who've been wronged.  He even helped me get my SS Disability, and was not even the attorney representing me on this venture.  He sent records to that attorney that made my getting approved occur "johnny on the spot", after a long 5 year battle.  How many others do you know that would help you for zero pay. He is incredible!!!!!  Call him if you have a real injury and are not just out to work the system.  He is highly intelligent, and knows his business.Edge Law Firmrandykelley71 ratedThis review is for Jason Edge of the Edge Law Firm in Tulsa, OK.  When my 24 year old son got in trouble with the Tulsa Police he ended up with 12 charges against him.  He had violated parole and was facing 3 years in prison just for that.  After receiving a very professional packet of information from the Edge Law Firm I contacted their office and was given an appointment with Jason Edge.  My wife and I went to meet with him at his office.  Jason treated us respectfully and after getting some basic information, he got on his computer and started checking things out concerning my son's case.  He gave us an initial assessment of the case.    We agreed to hire him to handle the case and he went to work for my son.  My wife and I did pray for Jason to have wisdom from God to handle the case.  We also prayed that God would have mercy on my son and give him another chance.  My son was facing up to life in prison for the charges that were against him.  After Jason was finished working on the case, the final outcome was that the Judge ordered my son to go to a 90-day drug rehab program, and that after completing this program he would have a suspended sentence.  This was a miraculous outcome!  Jason Edge did an outstanding job for us!  He is an Excellent Lawyer!  I hope that I am never in another situation to need a lawyer but if I do I know who I will call!  I will call Jason Edge!Social Security Law Centerladycassandra ratedWhen I used this law firm it w...When I used this law firm it was wonderful. I found them to be extremely thorough and caring. Michael Clay established this law firm and still owns it. He has great integrity and work ethic, very unusual for an attorney. He hold the two attorney's he has employed to the same level of excellence. My case was very complicated and Social Security Law Ctr got it through. In fact, it went to the 10th circuit district court where Michael Clay/Social Security Law Ctr had the Judge's illegal decision reversed and we back to court and won. I do not hesitate to recommend this law firm to anyone needing assistance in obtaining their disability.I have known other people that used other law firms and did not get the type of personal service provided by this firm. Here YOUR attorney shows up in court with you personally and is prepared. Many of the larger SS Law firms are nothing more than clearing houses counting numbers, much like a Slaughter House where the 'cattle' are led to 'THEIR END'.Edge Law FirmTimothy L. ratedJason with Edge Law Firm is my Lawyer. The day I ran into his lead investigator was my last possible day to get the letter to the dmv to keep my liscence, not knowing this due to advice from another attorney's very bad and ignorant advice I had no money right thento pay him. Jason heard my situation and went ahead and used his vast resources to help. I came up with most of the money the next day they are worth whatever it costs. Jason and his father Bruce wrote the book on DUI/DWI laws and rights making Tulsans feel a little less scared in a very scary situation. Most lawyers I have delt with either had no clue what the law was or didn't care enough to explain it in way you understand it. Jason did on both accounts, we have a game plan that I whole heartedly believe in, Jason is still young and passionate, hungry. The community looks up to him and he looks after it. He lifts weight off your shoulder he worries about you, your family and livelihood. Thank you Jason Keith Scott DAnna B. ratedThis man has worked miracles in my life and in my son's 20 years later. If you are looking for someone who won't just find out what the law requires but will jump in and take on your case like it's affecting his own life. He got me out of prison after searching diligently for the technicality that did exist. He ran into roadblocks but kept pushing and I was set free 5 years earlier than what the DA had pushed for. With my son who had an attorney who withdrew due to family problems, Scott stepped in and saw many flaws in the former attorneys decisions and pulled together a deal that pulled all charges into one and then went to bat to get the best sentence possible which we all are so thankful for. And throughout each of these cases we all felt a sincere compassion from him. Thank you Scott Keith!!! You are what attorneys were meant to be. I bet you'd make one hell of a friend!

Kania Law Officedavid_jo ratedWhen I walked into Mr. Kania's office my situation was a mess and I didn't know if any one could help me.  I just had a car wreck and my finances were a mess.  I just couldn't keep up with my bills anymore.  Mr. Kania and his staff made me feel better immediately.  I used the Kania Law firm for my bankruptcy and for my car wreck.  I got a good settlement for the car wreck and I was able to keep the money even though I filed bankruptcy.  Another attorney that I had called told me that would be impossible.  I always felt like his whole staff had my best interest at heart.  They were always straight with me, but kind enough to help me through this.Armstrong & Vaught PLCmandi.weems ratedWe used Mr Vaught a few years ago with a USERRA case. Not only did he go above and beyond, he was able to take on a large corporation with a large corporate law firm and win in a federal trial. I would highly recommend Mr Vaught, or anyone else in his office, for any legal need that you have. Everyone here is wonderful - professional, friendly, and will go out of their way to make you comfortable, help provide as much information on your case as you need, and are always to do whatever needed on a case. Best employment lawyer in Tulsa.Social Security Law CenterJackie H. ratedBefore I called Teresa Grasso at Social Security Law Center, I had called 2 other law offices that help with disability law and they told me I don't qualify. I applied myself and got denied. Then I went to Teresa Grasso and she took my case. She helped me get documentation that SSA wanted. She told me exactly what I needed to do to win my case and I did it. Because of Teresa I was approved in a timely manner. Social Security Law Centertamara w. ratedMy first application for social security benefits was denied.  I had done some things wrong but luckily Teresa Grasso at Social Security Law Center was able to correct them for me.  She helped me fill out my hearing application in the way that would best help me.  She was also more successful at obtaining medical records than I was.  Teresa was always available.  The office staff was extremely helpful.Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
