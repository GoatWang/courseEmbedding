History[edit]
Yottaa was founded in 2009 in Boston by Coach Wei, a Tsinghua University, and MIT alumnus, and Robert Buffone who studied applied mathematics at SUNY Brockport.[1][4][5][6][7] Prior to Yottaa, Wei had founded and served as the chairman of Nexaweb.[8][9] Apart from its office in Boston, Yottaa had opened an office in Beijing in what has been described as an anti-lean startup, due to having a rather big and global team from its inception.[10] Coach Wei served as CEO from 2009 to late 2014 and continues as executive chairman and Robert Buffone serve as the company's CTO respectively. Vick Viren Vaishnavi acts as the CEO since late 2014.[11]
In a series A round in 2010 Yottaa raised $4 million of venture funding from General Catalyst Partners, Stata Venture Partners and Cambridge West Ventures to build its acceleration platform.[12] In 2012 Yottaa named Raymie Stata, a former CTO of Yahoo!, in its board of directors.[9] In a series B round in 2012 the company raised an additional $9 million to expand its platform technology to include monitoring and security features.[4][9] Following the round, Yottaa won MassTLC's award for Innovative Technology of the Year - Cloud, beating out the likes of Acquia, and Basho Technologies.[13] A further $16 million were raised in 2013, in a round led by Intel Capital, also attracting funding from previous investors to expand sales and marketing operations and attract enterprise customers.[14][15][15] From an equity issuance in December 2014, Yottaa received $10.45 million.[16] In early 2015, Yottaa moved its offices from Boston to Waltham, Massachusetts.[6]
Services[edit]
Yottaa has developed a web and mobile optimization platform providing cloud services that improve website speed, and visibility on any device.[17][18] The company's initial target group were mid-sized enterprises (SMEs), with Yottaa aiming to sell its platform as a software as a service.[15] Yottaa's platform combines an Adaptive Content Delivery Network, dynamic site acceleration , web analytics, and internet security.[19] Yottaa deals with the problem of website speed as a software optimization problem, instead of dealing with it as a problem of bits' movement between different places, and does not require any code changes.[15][20]
Yottaa’s platform, named Context Intelligence, identifies the user’s location, browser, device, and interaction with web content to sort application content delivery, thus modifying web content to match the end user’s browsing context.[21] Context Intelligence comprises several components: AdaptiveCDN is the delivery component,[22] AppSequencing is neutralizing ad-blocking software while ensuring that the websites speed is not reduced,[23][24] InstantON is an accelerating component,[25] ContextSAFE provides security to the platform, while ImpactAnalytics offers web analytics.[26][27]

Vick Viren Vaishnavi acts as the CEO since late 2014.[11]
In a series A round in 2010 Yottaa raised $4 million of venture funding from General Catalyst Partners, Stata Venture Partners and Cambridge West Ventures to build its acceleration platform.[12] In 2012 Yottaa named Raymie Stata, a former CTO of Yahoo!, in its board of directors.[9] In a series B round in 2012 the company raised an additional $9 million to expand its platform technology to include monitoring and security features.[4][9] Following the round, Yottaa won MassTLC's award for Innovative Technology of the Year - Cloud, beating out the likes of Acquia, and Basho Technologies.[13] A further $16 million were raised in 2013, in a round led by Intel Capital, also attracting funding from previous investors to expand sales and marketing operations and attract enterprise customers.[14][15][15] From an equity issuance in December 2014, Yottaa received $10.45 million.[16] In early 2015, Yottaa moved its offices from Boston to Waltham, Massachusetts.[6]
Services[edit]
Yottaa has developed a web and mobile optimization platform providing cloud services that improve website speed, and visibility on any device.[17][18] The company's initial target group were mid-sized enterprises (SMEs), with Yottaa aiming to sell its platform as a software as a service.[15] Yottaa's platform combines an Adaptive Content Delivery Network, dynamic site acceleration , web analytics, and internet security.[19] Yottaa deals with the problem of website speed as a software optimization problem, instead of dealing with it as a problem of bits' movement between different places, and does not require any code changes.[15][20]
Yottaa’s platform, named Context Intelligence, identifies the user’s location, browser, device, and interaction with web content to sort application content delivery, thus modifying web content to match the end user’s browsing context.[21] Context Intelligence comprises several components: AdaptiveCDN is the delivery component,[22] AppSequencing is neutralizing ad-blocking software while ensuring that the websites speed is not reduced,[23][24] InstantON is an accelerating component,[25] ContextSAFE provides security to the platform, while ImpactAnalytics offers web analytics.[26][27]

Yottaa's Customer Experience Index

























Request your CEXi!
The Customer Experience Index (CEXi) Helps Online Businesses Benchmark Web Performance and User Experience
 
The CEXi is a compound index that quantifies the desktop and mobile user experience of a web application far more accurately than any single metric. The CEXi combines objective, measurable aspects of performance, such as page load speed from both mobile and desktop simulations, with specific weighting calculations to provide online businesses with an overall performance score that simulates the actual feeling, positive or negative, of using their web applications for a modern, cross-device user.
The Customer Experience Index focuses on three aspects of web performance: speed, parity of experience (across devices), and how well a site is optimized in relation to its complexity.

Speed – For the CEXi, key performance metrics, such as Time to Start Render (TTSR) and Time to Display (TTD), are collected and blended, and then weighted 50/50, for both mobile and desktop users. The mobile user simulation uses a 3G connection and an iPhone 5 with Safari browser, while the desktop user simulation uses a standard broadband connection and the latest version of Chrome. Then Yottaa takes the two resulting figures and weights them 60/40 – 60 percent mobile, 40 percent desktop, to match the current trends in web device usage in the U.S.


Device Parity – The CEXi compares the complexity of a desktop site for an online business versus its corresponding mobile site. Ideally, a site should be built on mobile-first principles, leading to a design that is equivalent for all users in functionality, and also performs well for all users.


Performance Power – While an eCommerce site should not be penalized for choosing to create a simple site, there are some sites that go above and beyond the call of duty by providing a super-rich experience that is also remarkably fast. To reward these companies, Yottaa developed a “bonus” score that bumps up the existing score by 25-50%, depending on how much power it packs from an optimization perspective. This is done by comparing the page weight and Time to Start Render for mobile (the more difficult of the two platforms to optimize). Conversely, Yottaa gives an equivalent penalty to those sites that should be fast, because they’re relatively lightweight, but are not.

To get your organization's CEXi calculated and see where you stand in comparison to other companies, please complete the form on the right.

About Yottaa






Our mission & vision
Yottaa was founded in 2009 by veteran technologists who saw two major trends on a collision course. On one hand, the founders saw that what we called “websites” were in fact becoming online applications: locations that were complex, distributed, and broad in scope of functionality. On the other hand, they saw that advancing mobile technology was leading end users to access these applications on new and different devices in addition to, and even in place of, their PCs.
Today, online businesses struggle to provide optimal digital experiences thanks to the continuing rise in complexity of apps and the requirement to deliver them to smaller and slower devices. As a result, end users’ expectations for online experiences now far outstrip the reality of what is delivered to them. We call this discrepancy the “experience gap.”
Yottaa’s mission is to help companies close the experience gap with an intelligent SaaS platform that accelerates and optimizes ecommerce websites across all devices.
 
 
Our people & culture
The employees at Yottaa are drawn to world-changing technology. Our people thrive from seeing our customers’ success grow in real time and building technology to enable that growth. At the core, our people are rooted in the mantra of LTV – we want our customers to Love, Trust, and Value us. Our technology is fantastic — patented, award-winning, novel — but from our perspective, none of that matters if we’re not helping our customers drive their businesses forward with real, tangible gains.






"Yottaa helped us to significantly speed up ecommerce performance on all devices resulting in a much better experience for our customers."


    - Dan Pingree, VP of Marketing, Moosejaw

Just six months after launching its first paid product, Boston-based web optimization company Yottaa Inc. has landed $9 million in Series B funding from a new investor and plans a slew of new product launches in the next few months, according to CEO Coach Wei.
Wei did not reveal the name of the newest investor, but investors in the previous $4 million Series A round in 2010 were General Catalyst Partners of Cambridge, Stata Venture Partners of Needham, and Cambridge West Ventures of Redwood City, Calif.The company has about 50 employees, 20 of which are in the Boston office. Wei says he’s been hiring in Boston for a number of positions, including marketing and engineering. Most of the engineering department is in Beijing, and the dual offices have enabled the company to release a new product every couple months since its first paid product - the Yottaa Site Speed Optimizer, which uses the cloud to cache images and data from a company’s website so they reach users more quickly - came out last October.

“From day one, we were built as a global startup,” said Wei. “It’s been working unbelievably well.”
For Wei, Yottaa is his second startup. He led his first, Nexaweb, since 2002, leaving in 2008 to launch Yottaa.




 


The company has 24 data centers worldwide - the closest one to Boston being in New York City - and Wei has plans to open more in the next year. Also, he said he plans several product launches in the coming weeks, beginning with the Yottaa Solution for Mobile Acceleration for MocoSpace’s free-to-play mobile apps and HTML5 games. “We think we’re going to see some really significant growth in the next six to 10 months,” he said.
In February, the company was granted a patent for its web performance optimization technology.
