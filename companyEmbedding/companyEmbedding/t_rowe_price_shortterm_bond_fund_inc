The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.

How to Invest



Shares of the Variable Insurance Portfolios are designed to be offered to insurance company separate accounts established for the purpose of funding variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts. The annuity and life contract holders or participants are not the shareholders of the funds. Rather, the separate account of the insurance company is the shareholder. The variable annuity and variable life contracts are described in separate prospectuses issued by the insurance companies. The funds assume no responsibility for such prospectuses, or variable annuity or variable life contracts.
Shares of the funds are sold and redeemed without the imposition of any sales commissions or redemption charges. However, certain other charges may apply to annuity or life contracts. Those charges are disclosed in the insurance contract prospectus. Your ability to exchange from these funds into any other T. Rowe Price fund that serves as an investment option under your insurance contract is governed by the terms of that contract and the insurance contract prospectus, as well as the funds’ excessive and short-term trading policy described in this section.













Benefits & Risks
The portfolio’s income level should generally be above that of a money market fund but less than that of a long-term bond fund.The portfolio’s share price should fluctuate less than a longer-term bond fund.Unlike money market funds, which are managed to maintain a stable share price, the portfolio’s price can decline.Yield and share prices will vary with interest rate changes.



Investor Profile
For investors who seek higher income than money funds or similar investment vehicles provide and can accept modest share price fluctuation.  The portfolio should be used as an investment option for variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts.

				Ultra Short-Term Bond Fund

Investor Class
TRBUX

Invests in a diversified portfolio of shorter-term investment-grade corporate and government securities, asset-backed securities, and bank obligations. Invests at least 80% in bonds and all of the securities purchased by the fund will be rated investment-grade at the time of purchase.
 Due to the nature of the fund’s investment universe, the fund will take on incrementally more credit risk than a money market fund. Additionally, this fund is subject to interest rate risk, as a rise in interest rates may cause the price of its securities to fall.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

Benefits & Risks
The fund’s income should be above that of a money market fund, with only minimal share price fluctuation.Due to the nature of the fund’s investment universe, the fund will take on incrementally more credit risk than a money market fund.Additionally, this fund is subject to interest rate risk, as a rise in interest rates may cause the price of its securities to fall.  However, share price fluctuation should be substantially less than that found in long term bond strategies.



Investor Profile
Investors seeking slightly higher income than what money funds provide who can accept small share price fluctuation.Appropriate for both regular and tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs and Keoghs.

Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays Short-Term Government/Corporate Index




Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.
Numbers may not add due to rounding and/or the exclusion of reserves and other assets.







U.S. government agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a U.S. government agency and may include conventional pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Unlike Treasuries, government agency securities are not issued directly by the U.S. government and are generally unrated but may have credit support from the U.S. Treasury (e.g., FHLMC and FNMA issues) or a direct government guarantee (e.g., GNMA issues). Therefore, this category may include rated and unrated securities.







U.S. Treasury securities are issued by the U.S. Treasury and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The ratings of U.S. Treasury securities are derived from the ratings on the U.S. government.

				Short-Term Bond Fund

Investor Class
PRWBX

Invests in a diversified portfolio of short- and intermediate-term investment-grade corporate, government, and mortgage-backed securities. May also invest in bank obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, foreign securities, and hybrids. The fund’s income level should generally be above that of a money market fund but less than that of a long-term bond fund. 
Unlike money market funds, which are managed to maintain a stable share price, the fund’s price can decline. Yield and share prices will vary with interest rate changes.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.

Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.
Numbers may not add due to rounding and/or the exclusion of reserves and other assets.

ETN Risks
Important information about the VelocityShares ETNs is contained within the current prospectuses. For more complete information regarding the VelocityShares ETNs, download a prospectus from this site, call 1-877-5-VELOCITY or 1-203-992-4301, or write to Prospectus Inquiry, VelocityShares, 17 Old Kings Highway S, Darien, CT, 06820 to request a prospectus. You should read the prospectus carefully before making an investment decision.
Not all risks described below will apply to all products.  Please refer to the applicable prospectus supplement for a detailed discussion of risks applicable to a particular ETN.
An investment in the ETNs involves significant risks. Please read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to an investment in the ETNs in “Risk Factors” in the applicable pricing supplement.
The ETNs are intended to be daily trading tools for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks.  They are designed to achieve their stated investment objectives on a daily basis, but their performance over different periods of time can differ significantly from their stated daily objectives.  The ETNs are riskier than securities that have intermediate- or long-term investment objectives, and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold them for a period other than one day.  Any decision to hold the ETNs for more than one day should be made with great care and only as the result of a series of daily (or more frequent) investment decisions to remain invested in the ETNs for the next one-day period.  Accordingly, the ETNs should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of an investment linked to the underlying index and of seeking daily compounding, leveraged long or leveraged inverse investment results, as applicable.  Investors should actively and frequently monitor their investments in the ETNs, even intra-day.  If an investor holds the ETNs for more than one day, it is possible that the investor will suffer significant losses in the ETNs even if the performance of the underlying index over the time the investor holds them is positive, in the case of the leveraged long ETNs, or negative, in the case of the leveraged inverse ETNs.
Because the ETNs are linked to the daily performance of the applicable underlying index and may include either leveraged long or leveraged inverse exposure, adverse changes in the market price of the futures included in the underlying index will have a magnified adverse effect on the ETNs and a greater likelihood of causing such ETNs to be worth zero than if such ETNs were not linked to the leveraged inverse or leveraged long return of the applicable underlying Index.
The ETNs do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity, acceleration or redemption and do not pay any interest during their term.
Although the issuer intends to list or has listed the ETNs on NYSE Arca, NASDAQ, or BATS, a trading market for your ETNs may not develop.  The issuer is not required to maintain any listing of the ETNs on an exchange.  The issuer of the ETNs may delist the ETNs from any exchange for any reason at any time.
The issuer is not obligated to issue any particular amount of the ETNs and may suspend further issuances at any time.  If the issuer suspends further issuances of the ETNs, it is possible that the ETNs could begin to trade at a premium to the indicative value.  Any premium that develops may be reduced or eliminated at any time, including as a result of an announcement that the issuer will restart issuances or an announcement that the issuer will exercise its right to accelerate the ETNs for an amount based on the indicative value.  Paying a premium purchase price over the indicative value of the ETNs could lead to significant losses in the event the investor sells the ETNs at a time when such premium is no longer present in the marketplace or the ETNs are accelerated at the issuer’s option.
The trading price of the ETNs may vary considerably before any valuation date (as defined in each prospectus), due, among other factors, to fluctuations in the price or the volatility of the underlying index, and other events that are difficult to predict. At higher levels of volatility, and since the ETNs are not principal protected, there is a significant chance of a complete loss of ETN value even if the performance of the underlying index is flat.
The daily resetting of each ETN’s leveraged exposure to the underlying index is likely to cause each ETN to experience a “decay” effect, which is likely to worsen over time and will be greater the more volatile the underlying index.  The “decay” effect refers to a likely tendency of the ETNs to lose value over time independent of the performance of the underlying index.  Accordingly, the ETNs are not suitable for intermediate- or long-term investment, as any intermediate- or long-term investment is very likely to sustain significant losses, even if the underlying index appreciates (in the case of the leveraged long ETNs) or depreciates (in the case of the leveraged inverse ETNs) over the relevant time period.  Although the decay effect is more likely to manifest itself the longer the ETNs are held, the decay effect can have a significant impact on ETN performance even over a period as short as two days.
If the level of the underlying index decreases or does not increase sufficiently (or if it increases or does not decrease sufficiently in the case of inverse ETNs), to offset the effect of the Daily Investor Fee and any other applicable fees over the term of the ETNs, the investor will receive less than the amount invested upon sale, early redemption, acceleration or maturity of the ETNs.
Prior to maturity, you may, subject to certain restrictions described in the pricing supplement, offer the applicable minimum number of your ETNs to the issuer for redemption on an Early Redemption Date (as defined in the prospectus). You must offer for redemption at least the applicable minimum number of ETNs (typically 25’000 or 50’000 depending on the product) as set forth in the pricing supplement, or an integral multiple of such amount in excess thereof, at one time in order to exercise your right to cause the issuer to redeem your ETNs on any Early Redemption Date. In addition, the issuer may charge investors a redemption charge of a percentage of the Closing Indicative Value of any ETN that is redeemed at the investor’s option, at a rate as indicated in the applicable pricing supplement.  Please see the applicable pricing supplement for fees or charges relating to the ETNs.
Any payment on the ETNs is subject to the ability of the issuer to satisfy its obligations as they become due.
The risks listed above are not exhaustive. Investors should review the prospectus for each ETN, including all risk factors set forth therein, and consult their independent tax, accounting, legal and financial advisors before investing in any ETN.

It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

Morningstar Ratings1


as of 06/30/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Short-Term Bond Fund among 
450,
450,
376
and 
261
Short-Term Bond
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest

2 The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 
30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share 
at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the 
fund's inception.  The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC 
standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity 
(assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is 
available the first month after the fund's inception.  
			

3
					
					Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details. 
Past performance cannot guarantee future results. All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Based on cumulative total return, 174 of 232 (75%), 142 of 160 (89%), 115 of 127 (91%), and 105 of 114 (92%) T. Rowe Price stock funds (including all share classes and excluding funds used in insurance products) outperformed their Lipper averages for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

1Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.



1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
3. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
4. Fixed Income StyleMap® StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
