White Fox Ventures, Inc. Established a Fintech Research Laboratory

NEW YORK, NY - White Fox Ventures, Inc., a public corporation in the US (OTC PINK: AWAW), has announced the establishment of its Fintech research laboratory on June 12, 2017 to study the utility value of IoT and AI, the spread of virtual currency and its service providing business. 
The aim of the research institute is to create a new business value, where focus is placed on the services it provides and its users instead of the development of the product itself in the midst of the changes IoT and digitalization bring to the structure of the world industry. 
From the above perspective, we have an advantage in terms of expertise, and we believe that our data collection and analysis task, and a strong partnership with the development team will set us apart from other businesses. 
WFV is developing a next-generation "smartBank" service developed by smart contract technology employed on blockchain, which is centered around our Ethereum-based cryptocurrency "KeY' Token." At the same time, we aim to achieve a smart society with transparency and openness available for everyone, by changing the old system in the current banking and credit system, financing business and so on. 
This investment academy business is currently operated by WFV. It's a new and independent business and it is not the issuer of virtual currency or cryptocurrency for WFV. 
DISCLAIMER Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements 
This press release contains statements that are "Forward-Looking" in nature (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). All statements regarding the Company's ("AWAW") financial position, potential, business strategy, plans and objectives for future operations are Forward-Looking statements. Many of these statements contain words such as "hopefully," "attempt," "goal," "aims," "may," "expect," "believe," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "continue," "would," "exceed," "should," "steady," "plan," "potential," "dramatic," and variations of such words and similar expressions identify Forward-Looking statements, but their absence does not mean that a statement is not a Forward-Looking statement. Because Forward-Looking statements involve future risks and uncertainties, there are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. The Company cannot predict the actual effect these factors will have on its results and many of the factors and their effects are beyond the Company's control. Any forward-looking statement made by the Company speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The Company is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements. For further information regarding these and other risks related to AWAW business, investors should consult AWAW's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, available at http://www.sec.gov.

	ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION




	 




	The
	unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included
	herein have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules and
	regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
	(“SEC”). The financial statements and notes are
	presented as permitted on Form 10-Q and do not contain
	certain information included in the Company’s annual
	statements and notes. Certain information and footnote disclosures
	normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules
	and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures

	These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
	Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
	filed with the SEC, including the audited financial statements and
	the accompanying notes thereto.





	 




	These
	unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments, including
	normal recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management,
	are necessary to present fairly the operations and cash flows for
	the periods presented.




	 




	On
	September 2, 2006, Celtic Capital, Inc. was incorporated in the
	State of Nevada. On October 20, 2008, Celtic Capital, Inc. changed
	its name to Entertainment Educational Arts Inc. On May 12, 2010,
	the Company changed its name to DNA Precious Metals, Inc. (the
	“Company”). On October 29, 2010, the Company formed DNA
	Canada Inc., a Canadian (Province of Quebec) incorporated company,
	as a wholly-owned subsidiary. The Company operated certain
	exploration operations through this Canadian entity.




	 




	The
	Company acquired certain mining claims on September 9, 2011 located
	in the Montauban and Chavigny townships near Grondines-West in the
	Portneuf County of Quebec, Canada. 




	 




	On
	October 30, 2013 and November 27, 2013, the Company entered into
	binding agreements for the asset acquisitions of an undivided one
	hundred percent (100%) interest in certain mineral claims and
	mining assets located in the Province of Quebec’s Montauban
	and Chavigny townships near Grondines West, in the county of
	Portneuf, specifically Mining Lease BM 748 and Mining Concession
	Miniere CM 410. The purchase price was CDN$75,000 together with the
	issuance of 10,500 common shares of the Company. The common shares
	for the acquisition were valued at their fair market value on the
	day they were issued which totaled $496,860. In connection with the
	asset purchase, the Company also issued 400 shares of common stock
	to a former supplier of the vendor for mining related information
	of the assets purchased valued at $20,000 along with cash
	consideration of CDN$20,000. The transaction was approved by a
	bankruptcy court in Montreal, Quebec overviewing the financial
	restructuring of the vendor on April 17, 2014.




	 




	On
	January 10, 2014, the Company entered into an asset purchase
	agreement for an undivided one hundred percent (100%) interest in
	certain mineral claims located in the Province of Quebec’s
	Montauban and Chavigny townships near Grondines West, in the county
	of Portneuf, including claims, rights, concessions and leases. The
	purchase price was CDN$70,000, 10,000 common shares of the Company
	and a one percent (1%) net smelter return. The Company paid
	CDN$10,000 upon the signing of the asset purchase agreement with
	the cash balance due, along with the common shares, upon the
	closing of the asset purchase agreement and transfer of the mineral
	claims in the name of the Company. The transfer of the mineral
	claims was completed in February 2014 whereby the remaining cash
	balance due and the common shares were released to the
	vendor.

	NOTE 1


	-         




	ORGANIZATION
	AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED)




	 




	The
	common shares for the acquisition were valued at their fair market
	value on the day they were issued which totaled $340,000. The total
	cost of the acquisition amounted to $403,840.




	 




	On
	April 14, 2014, the Company entered into an asset purchase
	agreement for an undivided one hundred percent (100%) interest in
	fifty-seven (57) mining claims located in the Province of
	Quebec’s Montauban and Chavigny townships near Grondines
	West, in the county of Portneuf. The purchase price was CDN$5,000
	(US $4,547).





	 




	On
	December 4, 2014, the Company presented a renewal request with the
	Government of the Province of Quebec to renew all 122 claims. 
	This was granted through a decision dated February 23,
	2015.




	 





	On January 16, 2015, Breathe LLC, a Tennessee limited liability
	company, and Breathe eCigs. Corp., a Tennessee corporation
	(“Breathe”), entered into a Share Exchange Agreement
	(the “Exchange Agreement”) with the Company, whereby
	the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership
	interests Breathe LLC in consideration for the issuance of
	1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to the members
	of Breathe LLC.






	 




	As a
	result of the transaction effected by the Exchange Agreement, at
	closing Breathe became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
	with the former Breathe equity holders owning approximately 56% of
	the then issued and outstanding common stock of the Company. The
	Company accounted for this acquisition as a reverse merger, whereby
	Breathe became the accounting acquirer. As a result, the
	comparative figures are those of Breathe. 




	 




	In
	connection with the acquisition of Breathe LLC, on March 5, 2015
	the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
	“Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company
	merged with its wholly owned subsidiary, Breathe eCig Corp. The
	sole purpose of the Merger was to effect a change of the Company's
	name from DNA Precious Metals, Inc. to Breathe eCig Corp. This name
	change more accurately reflected the Company’s operations at
	the time.




	 




	With
	the acquisition of Breathe LLC, the Company determined to spin-off
	the operations of its mining operations, which were being conducted
	through the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, DNA Canada,
	Inc. (“DNAC”).  Effective February 3, 2015,
	the Company declared a stock dividend whereby each of the
	Company’s shareholders on the record date (February 3, 2015)
	would receive one share of DNAC for every two shares of the
	Company’s common stock owned.


	The former members
	of Breathe LLC tendered their shares of DNAC for redemption by the
	Company.




	 




	With
	the completion of the spin-off, the Company was no longer in the
	mining field and its sole and exclusive business operations was the
	marketing of its electronic cigarettes and related vapor devices.
	In March 2015, the Company entered into Distribution Agreements
	with various distributors for the distribution of the
	Company’s products.




	 




	On May
	11, 2015, the Company formed two wholly owned subsidiaries to
	conduct non-eCigarette related business by way of holding medical
	device and other related intellectual property for the future
	development of for-profit activates and/or partnerships. Currently
	these entities are inactive, and neither holds any assets, carries
	any liabilities nor holds any intellectual
	property.

	SEPTEMBER 30, 2016




	 




	NOTE 1


	-         




	ORGANIZATION
	AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED)




	 




	On
	January 25, 2016, Mr. Seth M. Shaw succeeded Mr. Joshua Kimmel
	as Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Mr. Kimmel
	resigned as a director and officer of the Company at that
	time.  




	 




	On
	March 15, 2016, following the receipt of written consents
	representing a majority of its issued and outstanding shares, the
	Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with
	the Nevada Secretary of State, increasing its authorized common
	stock from 500,000,000 to 8,000,000,000 shares.




	 




	On
	April 5, 2016, Mr. Shinsuke Nakano was appointed Chief Executive
	Officer of the Company.  Simultaneously, Mr. Shaw was
	appointed Interim Chief Financial Officer and Director.

	 





	 





	As of March 30, 2016, pursuant to a settlement agreement under
	trademark litigation with plaintiff, Breathe LLC (a Florida limited
	liability company, or “Breathe Florida”), the Company
	ceased its continuing operations in the eCigarette business. In
	accordance with the settlement agreement, the Company was required
	to pay two cash payments to Breathe Florida ($10,000 was paid on
	March 31, 2016 and $15,000 was paid on August 10, 2016). Under this
	agreement, the Company also was required to issue 500,000
	restricted common shares of Company stock to Breathe Florida in
	addition to the transfer of 5,000,000 common shares which it held
	in Tauriga Sciences, Inc. At September 30, 2016 the value of the
	shares was $20,500 ($0.0041 per share). The Company further agreed
	to split 50/50 any future sales of its held inventory. The sale of
	inventory was to be a joint effort by the two companies and was
	expected to last for one year from April 1, 2016. The
	Company’s management does not expect to sell the remaining
	inventory and has fully impaired the asset as of September 30,
	2016.






	 




	On
	April 5, 2016, the Company announced its intention to give White
	Fox Ventures Inc. a majority controlling interest in the Company
	pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement by which White Fox Ventures
	Inc. was to be acquired for an

	 undetermined number of shares
	equating 85% of the total issued and outstanding capital of the
	Company. 

	The deal was initially scheduled to close on
	April 15, 2016, subject to extension. On May 6, 2016, the Company
	and White Fox Ventures Inc. rescinded the transaction following the
	due diligence on the acquisition. It was determined that the
	agreement and acquisition were not in the best interests of the
	Company at the time. The principal of White Fox Ventures Inc.,
	Shinsuke Nakano (“Nakano”), and investors had invested
	$196,557 into the Company in the form of payment of various
	settlements and invoices outstanding. The investment was treated as
	private placement at $0.0001, whereby the Company, on May 10, 2016,
	issued to Nakano and investors 19,655,700 shares of common stock,
	representing approximately 72% of the shares of the Company at the
	time. In addition, Nakano was named as the Chief Executive Officer
	of the Company and the Chairman of the Board and Mr. Takehiro Abe
	was appointed to the positions of Chief Operating Officer ("COO")
	and Director ("Board Member".)




	 




	On May
	23, 2016, the Company filed with the Secretary of State for the
	State of Nevada, the amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to
	change the name of the company to White Fox Ventures, Inc.
	(“White Fox”) to better reflect the new direction of
	the business and to effect a 100:1 reverse stock
	split.




	 




	On June
	17, 2016, the Company formed a subsidiary with 99% majority
	ownership stake.  The remaining 1% of the equity in this
	subsidiary, White Fox Japan LLC, is held by the Company’s
	Chief Operating Officer and Director, Takehiro Abe, a related
	party.  The Company currently conducts all transactional
	operational activity through this subsidiary, which plans, manages
	and promotes seminars and classes in
	Japan. 





	 




	On June
	22, 2016, FINRA announced its final approval for the
	Company’s change of name to White Fox Ventures, Inc., as well
	as a 100:1 reverse stock split and the Company’s new ticker
	symbol, AWAW, which began trading on July 20, 2016.  All
	share figures are shown in this report are on a post reverse split
	basis.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
	(UNAUDITED)




	SEPTEMBER 30, 2016




	 




	NOTE 1




	-         


	ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED)




	 




	Going Concern




	 




	T

	he
	condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a
	going concern basis. The going concern basis of presentation
	assumes that the Company will continue in operation for the
	foreseeable future and be able to realize its assets and discharge
	its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of
	business. The Company has generated net losses from operations
	totaling $866,910 and $5,496,643 for the nine months ended
	September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Losses from discontinued
	operations were $147,675 and $2,217,944 for the nine months ended
	September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.





	 




	The
	Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon,
	amongst other things, continued financial support from its
	shareholders, attaining a satisfactory revenue level, attainment of
	profitable operations and the generation of cash from operations
	and the ability to secure new financing arrangements and new
	capital to carry out its business plan.  These matters
	are dependent on a number of items outside of the Company’s
	control and there exists material uncertainties that may cast
	significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as
	a going concern.




	 





	On March 30, 2016, the Company discontinued the operations of its
	eCigarette business as a result of the settlement agreement that
	the Company entered into with Breathe Florida. The Company was able
	to convert over $1,050,000 in debt in exchange for the intellectual
	property of the Company in the eCig industry, and agreed to exit
	the industry and sell off or dispose of all remaining inventory
	during the next fiscal year. The Company’s management does
	not expect to sell the remaining inventory and has fully impaired
	the asset as of September 30, 2016.






	 




	The
	Company can give no assurance that it will achieve profitability
	through its subsidiary in its new business of membership sales
	providing business seminars and classes in Japan, or be capable of
	sustaining profitable continuing operations. These condensed
	consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
	relating to the recoverability and classification of the carrying
	amounts of assets or the amount and classification of liabilities
	that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going
	concern. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the
	ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.







	Basis of Accounting




	 




	These
	condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in
	conformity with United States generally accepted accounting
	principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and are presented in U.S.
	dollars.




	 




	Use of Estimates




	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
	contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
	statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
	the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates. Estimates include but are not limited to stock-based
	compensation and tax valuation allowances.

	NOTE 2




	-         


	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 




	Principles of Consolidation




	 




	The
	condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
	the Company and Breathe as the acquisition of Breathe was accounted
	for as a reverse merger and Breathe is the accounting acquirer,
	from the effective date of the Merger between the Company and
	Breathe eCigs Corp. All intercompany transactions and accounts had
	been eliminated on consolidation.





	 




	On
	January 16, 2015, Breathe LLC, a Tennessee limited liability
	company, and Breathe eCigs Corp., a Tennessee corporation
	(“Breathe”), entered into a Share Exchange Agreement
	(the “Exchange Agreement”) with the Company, whereby
	the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of
	common stock of Breathe in consideration for the issuance of
	1,500,000 shares of common stock. The consolidation of Breathe
	eCigs Corp began January 16, 2015 through March 29, 2016 as part of
	continuing operations. On March 30, 2016, Breathe eCigs Corp. was
	moved to discontinued operations with retroactive restatement for
	comparative purposes.




	 




	On June
	17, 2016, the Company formed a subsidiary with 99% majority
	ownership stake.  The remaining 1% of the equity in this
	subsidiary, White Fox Japan LLC, is held by the Company's Chief
	Operating Officer and Director, Takehiro Abe, a related
	party.  The Company currently conducts all of its
	transactional operational activity through this subsidiary, which
	plans, manages and promotes seminars and classes in Japan.
	Consolidation of the subsidiary began with the commencement of
	operations upon initial funding on July 19, 2016 through the period
	ended September 30, 2016.




	 




	Business Combination




	 




	On
	January 16, 2015, Breathe LLC, a Tennessee limited liability
	company, and Breathe eCigs., a Tennessee corporation
	(“Breathe”) entered into the Exchange Agreement with
	the Company, whereby the Company acquired all of the issued and
	outstanding shares of common stock of Breathe in consideration for
	the issuance of 1,500,000 shares of common stock. This business
	combination was accounted for as a reverse merger whereby Breathe
	is the accounting acquirer, since the former Breathe shareholders
	then controlled greater than 50% of the voting control of the
	Company.




	 




	Stock Based Compensation




	 




	The
	Company estimates the fair value of stock based payment awards made
	to officers and directors related to the Company’s stock
	incentive plan, on the date of grant using an option-pricing model.
	The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected
	to vest is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite
	service periods. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing
	model to determine the fair value of the stock-based compensation
	that it grants to officers and directors. The Company is required
	to make certain assumptions in connection with this determination,
	the most important of which involves the calculation of volatility
	with respect to the price of its common stock. The computation of
	volatility is intended to produce a volatility value that is
	representative of the Company’s expectations about the future
	volatility of the price of its common stock over an expected term.
	Shares of the Company commenced trading on August 22, 2013. As a
	result, the volatility value that the Company calculated may differ
	from the future volatility of the price of its shares of common
	stock.




	 




	Upon
	the exercise of stock options, any consideration received and the
	amounts previously recorded under stock-based compensation are
	credited to share capital. Upon the issuance of shares resulting
	from share awards, amounts previously recorded under stock based
	compensation are credited to share capital.




	  




	Comprehensive Income (Loss)




	 




	The
	Company adopted ASC 220-10, “Reporting Comprehensive
	Income,” (formerly SFAS No. 130). ASC 220-10 requires the
	reporting of comprehensive income in addition to net income from
	operations.




	 




	Comprehensive
	income is a more inclusive financial reporting methodology that
	includes disclosure of information that historically has not been
	recognized in the calculation of net income.

	The condensed consolidated financial statements
	include the accounts and activities of t

	he 99% majority
	owned subsidiary, White Fox Japan LLC, which is presented with a
	non-controlling interest of 1% for the share owned by a related
	party, the Company's Chief Operating Officer and Director, Takehiro
	Abe. The subsidiary conducts all transactional operational activity
	of the Company.  The subsidiary will plans, manages and
	promotes seminars and classes in Japan.

	SEPTEMBER 30, 2016




	 




	NOTE 2




	-         


	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)




	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 




	The
	Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments and other
	short-term investments (measured on the purchase date) with
	maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash
	equivalents.




	 




	Marketable Securities 




	 




	Marketable
	equity securities included in Investment-available for resale
	(current) and other investments (non-current) are stated at the
	lower of cost or market in the aggregate.   Unrealized gains
	or losses appear in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).
	 Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are based
	on the average cost of all the units of a particular security held
	at the time of sale.




	 




	Income Taxes




	 




	The
	Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes
	under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
	the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences
	between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
	and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
	and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
	are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates in
	effect for the year in which those temporary differences are
	expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
	assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as
	part of the provision for income taxes in the period that includes
	the enactment date. Deferred tax liabilities are always provided
	for in full. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that
	it is probable that they will be able to be utilized against future
	taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only
	when the Company has a right and intention to set off current tax
	assets and liabilities from the same taxation authority. Valuation
	allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax
	assets to amounts that are expected to be realized.




	 




	The
	Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provision of ASC
	740-10, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“ASC
	740-10”) which requires, among other things, an asset and
	liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset
	and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax
	assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
	temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax
	bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided
	to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes
	it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be
	realized.




	 




	The
	Company follows the provision of ASC 740-10 related to Accounting
	for Uncertain Income Tax Position. When tax returns are filed,
	there may be uncertainty about the merits of positions taken or the
	amount of the position that would be ultimately
	sustained.




	 




	In
	accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax
	position is recognized in the financial statements in the period
	during which, based on all available evidence, management believes
	it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon
	examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation
	processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated
	with other positions.




	 




	Tax
	positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold
	are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than
	50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the
	applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated
	with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as
	described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain
	tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any
	associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the
	taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax
	positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination.
	As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax
	benefits.




	 




	The
	Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25, “Definition of
	Settlement”, which provides guidance on how an entity should
	determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the
	purposes of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and
	provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the
	completion and examination by a taxing authority without being
	legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively
	settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit,
	even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to
	be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and
	the statute of limitations remains open. The federal and state
	income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the
	IRS and state taxing authorities generally for three years after
	they were filed.

	NOTE 2




	-         


	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)




	 




	Revenue Recognition




	 




	The
	Company recognizes revenues from the sale of the Company’s
	products when the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive
	evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred;
	(iii) the price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and (iv)
	collection of the sales price is reasonably
	assured.  Delivery occurs when goods are shipped and
	title and risk of loss have passed to the
	customer.  Revenue is deferred in all instances where the
	earnings process is incomplete.  Payments received before
	all the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied
	will be recorded as deferred revenue.  Revenues and costs
	of revenues from consulting contracts will be recognized during the
	period in which the service will be performed.  All
	revenues will be reported net of any sales discounts or
	taxes. 

	Any revenues
	applicable to discontinued operations are
	included

	.








	 





	Deferred
	Revenue





	 




	The
	Company defers revenue for funds received on contracts where future
	value is received or could be received by the subscriber. The
	contracts fall into one of two categories; annual and lifetime
	memberships. The AWA Plus membership and the Premium membership are
	both annual memberships and the revenue received on these contracts
	are recognized pro-rata over the life of the contract or twelve
	months. Crest Partner and Partner memberships are lifetime
	memberships. Lifetime memberships are valid only when an annual
	membership is purchased and in good standing. The revenue on these
	contracts recognized over the expected duration of the contracts.
	In the absence of an observable duration, the Company has estimated
	that the duration of the contracts will be 36 months. Once an
	average length can be estimated the Company will reevaluate this
	assumption.




	 




	Trade Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts




	 




	The
	Company was engaged up until March 30, 2016 in the sales and
	distribution in the consumer products market through sales to
	distributors, wholesalers and direct to consumers via e-commerce
	sales of eCigarettes for use by consumers.  Trade
	receivables consisted primarily of amounts due to the Company from
	its normal business activities whereby approved distributors and
	wholesalers were extended terms after down payments on orders. The
	Company controlled credit risk related to the trade receivables
	through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures,
	and performed ongoing credit evaluations of the customers. In
	assessing the carrying value of its trade receivables, the Company
	estimated the recoverability by making assumptions based on factors
	such as current overall and industry-specific economic conditions,
	historical and anticipated customer performance, historical
	write-off and collection experience, the level of past-due amounts,
	and specific risks identified in the accounts receivable portfolio.
	Additional changes to the allowance could be necessary in the
	future if a customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates, or if
	actual defaults are higher than the Company’s historical
	experience. Any difference could result in an increase or
	decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts. All accounts
	receivable, net of an allowance are considered uncollectable and
	have a carrying value of $0 in light of the discontinuance of
	operations in the consumer products market.









	 




	Prepaid Expenses




	 




	At
	times the Company pays for services, commissions, contracts or
	obligations under other agreements where the value of those
	services may extend beyond the current period. These amounts are
	recognized over the useful benefit period. The Company classifies
	amounts paid for sales commissions on contracts sold by a third
	party. These commissions are recognized to match the revenue
	recognized of the contracts. The Company also classifies costs of
	production of promotional content to recognize expense over the
	period content is in use.




	 




	Inventory




	 





	Finished Goods Inventory

	 - Finished goods inventory is
	stated at the lower of cost or market determined by the first-in,
	first-out method, and include salable eCigarette product items and
	supplies that are sale ready to ship to consumers, wholesalers or
	distributers. Shipping and handling costs (consisting of all costs
	to warehouse, pick, pack and deliver inventory to customers) will
	be included in cost of goods sold. Samples were included in
	marketing expenses which are a component of general and
	administrative costs. Expenses, upon disposition, were reclassified
	to loss from discontinued operations. The Company in March 2015
	entered into Distribution Agreements with various distributors for
	the distribution of the Company’s products. The Company
	placed an initial order for merchandise in the amount of $437,750
	on March 27, 2015. The Company outsourced the assembly and
	production of its products held for resale and did not hold any of
	the product in its possession. The Company’s inventory is
	received, housed and distributed by a third-party fulfillment
	provider. As of September 30, 2016, the inventory held by the
	third-party fulfillment provider had a value of
	$227,685.




	 




	As of
	March 30, 2016, pursuant to a settlement agreement under trademark
	litigation, the Company had ceased its continuing operations in the
	eCigarette business. The Company agreed to split 50/50 any future
	sales of its held inventory with Breathe Florida. The sale of
	inventory is a joint effort by the two companies and shall last for
	one year from April 1, 2016. After such period, the Company will
	dispose of any remaining inventory.




	 





	As a result of the settlement agreement and the discontinuance of
	the eCig operation, management estimated that it could sell the
	current inventory at $.50 for each $1 of inventory. Therefore an
	allowance was recorded to recognize the current expected net
	realizable value of the on-hand inventory.  The inventory
	balance was $0 and $114,067 as of September 30, 2016 and December
	31, 2015, respectively. This balances are reflected in inventory
	from discontinued operations. The Company’s management does
	not expect to sell the remaining inventory and has fully impaired
	the asset as of September 30, 2016.

	SEPTEMBER 30, 2016




	 




	NOTE 2




	-         


	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)




	 




	Loss Per Share of Common Stock




	 




	Basic
	net loss per share (“Basic EPS”) is computed by
	dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted
	average number of common shares outstanding for the
	period.




	 




	Diluted
	loss per share is computed by dividing adjusted net income
	available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
	common shares outstanding adjusted for the effects of all dilutive
	common share issuances.




	 




	Dilutive
	common share issuances shall be deemed to have been converted into
	ordinary shares at the beginning of the period.




	 




	For the
	purpose of calculating diluted



	loss

	per
	share, the Company shall assume the exercise of dilutive stock
	options and warrants, as well as shares reserved for the conversion
	of certain notes payable. The assumed proceeds from these
	instruments shall be regarded as having been received from the
	issue of common shares at the average market price of common shares
	during the period. Dilutive common share issuances are not included
	in the computation of diluted



	loss

	per
	share when the Company reports a loss because to do so would be
	anti-dilutive for the periods presented.




	 




	Derivative Financial Instruments




	 




	The
	Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to
	cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates
	all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments
	are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded
	derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are
	accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is
	initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each
	reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the
	statements of operations. The classification of derivative
	instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded
	as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each
	reporting period.




	 




	The
	accounting treatment for derivative financial instruments requires
	that the Company record the conversion option and related warrants
	at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreements,
	and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date, should
	the characteristics of these instruments warrant the need to record
	the derivative liability.




	 




	During
	the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of entering into the
	convertible notes, the Company was required to classify certain
	non-employee warrants as derivative liabilities and record them at
	their fair values at each balance sheet date. Any change in fair
	value was recorded as a change in the fair value of derivative
	liabilities for each reporting period at each balance sheet date.
	The Company reassessed the classification at each balance sheet
	date. If the classification changed as a result of events during
	the period, the contract was reclassified as of the date of the
	event that caused the reclassification.




	 




	The
	fair value of conversion options at a fixed number of shares is
	recorded using the intrinsic value method. Conversion options at
	variable rates and any options and warrants with ratchet provisions
	are deemed to contain a “down-round protection”.
	Accordingly, they do not meet the scope exception for treatment as
	a derivative under ASC 815 since “down-round
	protection” is not an input into the calculation of the fair
	value of the equity instruments and cannot be considered
	“indexed to the Company’s own stock”, which is a
	for the scope exception as outlined under ASC 815.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)




	 




	Derivative Financial Instruments (Continued)




	 




	The
	Company issued convertible notes and warrants and has determined
	that a conversion option is embedded in the notes and it is
	required to bifurcate the conversion option from the host contract
	under ASC 815 and account for the derivatives at fair value. The
	estimated fair value of the conversion option was determined using
	the binomial model. The fair value of the conversion option was
	classified as a liability until the debt was converted by the note
	holders or paid back by the Company. The fair value was affected by
	changes in inputs to that model including the stock price, expected
	stock price volatility, the contractual term, and the risk-free
	interest rate. The Company continued to classify the fair value of
	the conversion option as a liability until the conversion option
	was exercised, expired or amended in a way that would no longer
	require these conversion options to be classified as a liability,
	whichever comes first. The Company has adopted a sequencing policy
	that reclassifies contracts (from equity to assets or liabilities)
	with the most recent inception date first. Thus any
	available shares are allocated first to contracts with
	the most recent inception date.




	 




	For the
	binomial lattice options pricing model, the Company used the
	following assumptions and weighted average fair value ranges as at
	the transaction date, April 28, 2014:

	The
	Company had repaid the debt associated with the derivative
	liability in December 2014. However, it carried the warrants
	through the conversion of those warrants in September 2015. As a
	result of the conversion of the warrants, the entire derivative
	liability was extinguished as of September 30, 2015. The Company
	has no other instruments that contain embedded
	derivatives.




	 




	Prior
	to the effective date of the March 15, 2016 amendment to the
	Company's Articles of Incorporation increasing the authorized
	common shares of the Company from 500,000,000 to 8,000,000,000
	shares, the Company did not have sufficient authorized shares to
	effectuate any conversion of convertible notes outstanding with
	either of the two noteholders. The Company remained in constant
	negotiations with the noteholders resulting in amended agreements
	dated March 25, 2016 and March 29, 2016, respectively, and the
	noteholders did not exercise their right to issue the Company a
	notice of default. At no time did the Company consider that the
	notes outstanding could not be fully settled. Upon the filing of
	the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation the Company in
	effect, cured any default under the note agreements, and as a
	result, no derivative liability was recorded by the Company. The
	amended note agreements reflect the current number of common shares
	needed to settle the remaining convertible note agreements and
	there are sufficient shares available to settle these
	agreements.




	 




	Reclassifications




	 




	Certain
	prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
	year presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on the net
	loss or cash flows of the Company.

	Prior

	Form 10 Q/A for the quarters ended March 31, 2015 and September 30,
	2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on

	Breathe LLC) on January 16, 2015 as a reverse merger for accounting
	purposes.




	 





	Recently Issued Accounting Standards




	 




	In
	February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
	The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach,
	classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on
	the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed
	purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether
	lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method
	or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is
	also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability
	for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of
	their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will
	be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases.
	The new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods
	beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within
	that reporting period and is applied retrospectively. Early
	adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of assessing
	the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the
	Company’s consolidated financial statements.




	   




	During
	August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, “Presentation
	of Financial Statements—Going Concern.” The provisions
	of ASU No. 2014-15 require management to assess an entity’s
	ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and
	expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S.
	auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a
	definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation
	every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide
	principles for considering the mitigating effect of
	management’s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when
	substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of
	management’s plans, (5) require an express statement and
	other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6)
	require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that
	the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued).
	The amendments in this ASU are effective for the annual period
	ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim
	periods thereafter. The Company is currently assessing the impact
	of this ASU on the Company’s consolidated financial
	statements.

	-         


	ACQUISITION




	 




	Breathe eCigs Corp. Acquisition and Spin-off of DNA Canada,
	Inc.




	 




	On
	January 16, 2015, Breathe LLC, a Tennessee limited liability
	company, and Breathe eCigs Corp., a Tennessee corporation
	(“Breathe”), entered into a Share Exchange Agreement
	(the “Exchange Agreement”) with the Company, whereby
	the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of
	common stock of Breathe in consideration for the issuance of
	1,500,000 shares of common stock.





	 




	As a
	result of the transaction effected by the Exchange Agreement, at
	closing Breathe became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
	with the former Breathe equity holders owning approximately 56% of
	the then issued and outstanding common stock of the Company. The
	Company accounted for this acquisition as a reverse merger, whereby
	Breathe became the accounting acquirer. As a result, the
	comparative figures are those of Breathe.




	 





	With the acquisition of Breathe, management determined that it
	would be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders
	to spin off the exploration stage mining business from the
	eCigarette business, in order to allow each company to focus on its
	principal business activity and to facilitate capital formation.
	The Company declared a stock dividend to its shareholders of record
	as of February 3, 2015 of its wholly owned subsidiary, DNA Canada,
	Inc. Each shareholder of record on the record date received
	one share of DNA Canada, Inc. for every two shares of the Company
	owned by the shareholder on this date. With the completion of
	the stock dividend, the Company no longer has an equity interest in
	DNA Canada, Inc.





	 




	The
	former shareholders of Breathe participating in the stock dividend
	were required to tender for redemption any shares of DNA Canada,
	Inc. common stock received pursuant to the stock dividend in
	accordance with the Exchange Agreement.




	 




	On
	March 5, 2015, the Company and Breathe entered into an Agreement
	and Plan of Merger pursuant to which the Company merged with its
	wholly owned subsidiary, Breathe. As permitted under Nevada law,
	the sole purpose of the Merger was to affect a change to the
	Company’s name from DNA Precious Metals, Inc. to Breathe.
	This change to the Amended Articles of Incorporation and name
	change took effect on March 11, 2015.

	litigation with plaintiff, Breathe LLC (a Florida limited liability
	company, or “Breathe Florida”), the Company ceased its
	continuing operations in the eCigarette business. In accordance
	with the settlement agreement, the Company was required to pay two
	cash payments to Breathe Florida (with $10,000 paid on March 31,
	2016 and $15,000 paid on August 10, 2016). Under the agreement, the
	Company also was required to issue 500,000 restricted common shares
	of Company stock in addition to the transfer of 5,000,000 common
	shares which it held in Tauriga Sciences, Inc. At September 30,
	2016 the value of the shares was $20,500 ($0.0041 per share.) The
	Company transferred the shares of Tauriga Sciences, Inc. on
	November 2, 2016. The Company further agreed to split 50/50 any
	future sales of its held inventory with Breathe
	Florida.  The sale of inventory shall be a joint effort
	by the two companies and shall last for a duration of one year from
	April 1, 2016. After such period, the Company will dispose of any
	remaining inventory. The Company does not expect to sell the
	remaining inventory and has fully impaired the asset as of
	September 30, 2016.






	 




	As a
	result of the disposal of the business and the discontinuance of
	the eCigarette operations, the following chart reflects the results
	of the condensed consolidated financial statements as loss from
	discontinued operations as of September 30, 2016:

	NOTE 5 -          INVESTMENT - AVAILABLE
	FOR SALE SECURITY





	 





	On March 31, 2015, the Company received 10,869,565 common shares of
	Tauriga Sciences, Inc. (“TAUG”) (valued at $100,000) in
	exchange for 26,667 shares in connection with a
	commercialization/license agreement with TAUG to jointly develop a
	new line of business involving CBD oil cartridges on the same date.
	The Company shares were reflected as an investment. Due to the very
	low stock value of both companies and with the Company exiting the
	eCigarette business, both companies have impaired their respective
	investment to $0 as December 31, 2015. As of March 30, 2016,
	pursuant to the settlement agreement under trademark litigation
	with plaintiff, Breathe Florida, the Company was required to
	transfer 5,000,000 of the shares it held in Tauriga Sciences, Inc.
	(the transfer was done on November 2, 2016.) At September 30, 2016,
	the value of total shares held was $44,565 ($0.0041 per
	share.)






	 




	On
	August 22, 2016 the Company entered into an agreement to invest
	$2,500,000 into NQ Minerals, PLC, an Australian mining company
	listed in London under the symbol of NQMI. Upon entering this
	agreement the Company invested $150,000, purchasing 1,351,351
	shares. At September 30, 2016 the Company invested an additional
	$100,000 receiving 900,901 common shares.  Effective December
	1, 2016 the Company has withdrawn from its commitment to NQ
	Materials PLC to purchase a $2,500,000 stake in the company. 
	At the time of the termination of this agreement the Company had
	invested $250,000 acquiring 2,252,252 common shares.  With the
	withdrawal from the commitment the Company has classified the
	entire investment as a current asset. At September 30, 2016, the
	Company recorded an unrecognized loss in Other Comprehensive Income
	in the amount of $103,604.

	The loss was
	determined by recalculating the investment at it's fair value at
	September 30, 2016 and adjusting the valuation account to reflect
	the change in value.

	CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES










	 





	The following is a summary of convertible notes payable and the
	related derivative liabilities associated with the convertible
	notes payable.  As a result of the reverse merger,
	Breathe assumed responsibility of these DNA Precious Metals, Inc.
	notes, and any related derivative liability that exists under these
	notes related to the warrant agreements. Therefore, a full
	discussion has been provided for clarification.





	 




	On May
	18, 2015, Typenex Co-Investment, LLC (“Typenex”) filed
	a binding arbitration against the Company in the State of Utah (the
	“Utah Lawsuit”) regarding a certain Warrant to purchase
	shares of the Company’s common stock. The Utah Lawsuit is
	described in more detail in Item 3 of the Company’s Annual
	Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 and subsequent
	filings.

	CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES
	(CONTINUED)






	 




	On October 13, 2015, Typenex and the Company participated in a
	mediation in an attempt to resolve the Utah Lawsuit without either
	party having to incur additional legal and court
	fees.  As a result of the mediation and in order to
	resolve the Utah Lawsuit and the Arbitration and all other disputes
	between,  on November 17, 2015 (the “Typenex
	Effective Date”), the Company and Typenex entered into a
	Settlement Agreement, Waiver and Release of Claims (the
	“Settlement Agreement”) and related Exchange Agreement
	(the “Exchange Agreement”), Pursuant to the terms of
	the Settlement Agreement and Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed
	to issue to Typenex 80,000 shares of the Company’s common
	shares of stock in exchanges for any rights Typenex may or may not
	have had under the Warrant. The Company will deliver the shares to
	Typenex in two installments: (i) 40,000 Shares with five trading
	days of the Effective Date (the “First Installment
	Shares”) and (ii) 40,000 Shares on or before January 1, 2016
	(the “Second Installment Shares”).  The First
	Installment Shares and the Second Installment Shares are
	collectively referred to herein as the Typenex Shares.




	 



	Additionally,
	pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, beginning on January 1, 2016,
	Typenex had the right to put the Typenex Shares back to the Company
	(the “Put Right”) at the following prices: (a) for
	Typenex Shares put to the Company from January 1, 2016 to April 30,
	2016 the price would be $1.00 per share. (b) for Typenex Shares put
	to the Company from May 1, 2016 to August 31, 2016 the price would
	be $2.00 per share. and (c) for any Typenex Shares put to Company
	between September 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016, the price would be
	$3.00 per share. Typenex had the right to put up to 6,667 Typenex
	Shares per month to Company (the “Monthly Put Amount”)
	per month.  If the number of Typenex Shares put to
	Company in a given month was less than the Monthly Put Amount (such
	difference, the “Rollover Shares”), Typenex had the
	right to put such Typenex Shares to Company at any time in the same
	or immediately succeeding period.  In addition to the
	Monthly Put Amount, Typenex also had the right to put up to 6,667
	Rollover Shares per month to Company.  Additionally, Typenex
	agreed that during any calendar week it would not sell more Typenex
	Shares than the greater of (i) 10% of the weekly trading volume of
	the Common Stock as reported on Bloomberg, L.P. or (ii) an
	aggregate market value of $5,000. At such time that Typenex’s
	Net Sales (gross proceeds of sales of the Typenex Shares sold in a
	minus any trading commissions or costs associated with clearing and
	selling such Typenex Shares minus the purchase price paid for any
	shares of Common Stock purchased on the open market) of Typenex
	Shares was equal to or greater than $200,000, Typenex’s Put
	Right would automatically terminate and Typenex would have no
	further rights to put Typenex Shares or Rollover
	Shares.




	 




	Upon
	execution of the Settlement Agreement and Exchange Agreement, both
	parties released all claims each may have against the other
	relating to any other agreements to which both may be
	party.  Under the Settlement Agreement, the Company
	executed a Confession of Judgment in the amount of $500,000 (the
	“Confession of Judgment”).  In the event the
	Company committed a material breach of the Settlement Agreement
	which was not cured within five trading days, Typenex would have
	the right to enforce the Confession of Judgment.  The
	Confession of Judgment, if filed as set forth above, would have
	carried an interest rate of 12% until paid.




	 




	On
	March 25, 2016, the Company paid $55,000 to Typenex to settle all
	obligations resulting from these agreements.



	 











	Convertible Note dated June 8, 2015




	 




	On June
	8, 2015, the Company entered into a 12% convertible redeemable note
	payable with an investor. The principal amount of the note was
	$100,000, with net proceeds received of $96,500. The $3,500
	represented legal fees. This note was to mature on June 8, 2016.
	The note bore interest at 12%, compounded annually. The note was
	convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of the
	Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to the
	lower of closing price of the common stock on the principle market
	on the training day immediately preceding the closing date or 35%,
	of the lowest trading price of the Company’s common stock
	during the 20 trading days prior to conversion. Under terms of the
	convertible note agreement, if the closing sale price at any time
	fell below $5.00, then such 35% figure specified above would be
	reduced to 20%.  The stock closing price went below $5.00
	per share in the three months ended September 30,
	2015.

	NOTE 6

	CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES
	(CONTINUED)



	 




	Convertible Note Dated June 8, 2015
	(Continued)





	 




	Under
	the convertible note agreement, the Company was required to
	maintain a sufficient number of shares, free from preemptive
	rights, to provide for the issuance of common stock upon
	conversion. The Company was required at all times to authorize a
	reserve of five times the number of shares that are actually
	issuable upon full conversion of this note. The Company initially
	instructed the transfer agent to reserve 165,000 shares of common
	stock for the noteholder for issuance upon
	conversion.  The noteholder waived the
	requirement of the reserve shares above and beyond what was
	needed to convert through the maturity date, notwithstanding the
	initial reserve amount.  At September 30, 2015 the number
	of shares that were issuable upon full conversion of then
	outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest was 740,943,
	based on 20% of the lowest trading price of the Company’s
	common stock as reported on the OTCQB for the twenty prior trading
	days including the day upon which a notice of conversion is
	delivered ($0.70).





	 





	On January 4, 2016 the Company issued 166,700 shares of common
	stock to the holder of the convertible note upon the
	noteholder’s conversion of $10,002 of principal only into
	shares.  The applicable conversion price was
	$0.06.  Upon this conversion, the note had a remaining
	balance including default interest fees of
	$40,000.






	 




	On
	March 29, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with this
	noteholder to amend this convertible note to cure the default
	clause of the original agreement (no notice of default was
	provided).  The event of default was due to the
	Company’s inability to reserve sufficient shares required by
	the convertible note agreement based on the total authorized and
	unissued shares, which was subsequently cured with the increase of
	the authorized shares to 8,000,000,000 on March 15,
	2016.  The holder agreed to reset the total balance due
	to the “Adjusted Current Balance” of
	$40,000.  Also, under the agreement the price of future
	conversions would be set at $0.10.  The Company was
	further required to reserve common shares of not less than 400,000.
	From the date of this agreement, the note shall not be subject to
	interest.




	 





	On April 11, 2016, the Company issued 200,000 shares of common
	stock (of the 400,000) to the noteholder.  The noteholder
	converted $2,030 of principal only for the shares. Upon this
	conversion, the note had a balance of $37,970. Upon the issuance of
	the remaining 200,000 shares, any applicable loss on conversion
	will be recorded at that time. 






	 





	As of July 15, 2016, the noteholder rendered notice of conversion
	to the transfer agent to convert $1,898 of outstanding principal.
	1,897,700 shares were issued at a conversion rate of $0.001 (the
	pre-split basis). The Company believes that the stock should have
	been issued on a post-split basis whereby $189,770 of conversion
	value was transferred. The Company applied these shares towards the
	outstanding balance of the note of $40,000 ($0.021 per share.)
	There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to recover the
	shares or receive value from the excess shares
	transferred.





	 





	The note balance was $0 and $50,002 as of September 30, 2016 and
	December 31, 2015, respectively.






	 




	Convertible Note dated June 10, 2015




	 




	On June
	10, 2015, the Company entered into a 12% convertible redeemable
	note payable with an investor. The principal amount of the note is
	$82,500, with net proceeds received of $75,000. The $7,500
	represents an original issue discount. This note was to mature on
	September 10, 2016. The note bore interest at 12%, compounded
	annually. The note was convertible, in whole or in part, into
	shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price
	will be the lower of 60% of the lowest trading price of the
	Company’s common stock as of the date of conversion notice or
	$6.00 per share.





	 




	As
	consideration for the holder’s commitment to purchase this
	debenture, the Company issued 6,000 shares of the Company’s
	common stock to the holder.





	 




	In
	December 2015, the noteholder in three (3) separate conversions,
	converted $47,250 into 600,000 shares of common stock. Two of these
	note conversions were performed at a price below par value. The
	result was that $22,500 represented a discount to the common stock
	(which is reflected net in APIC).





	 











	In
	March 2016, the noteholder in three (3) separate conversions
	converted $11,188 of principal and accrued fees into 765,000 shares
	of stock leaving a balance due under this note including interest
	and fees of $143,000.




	 




	On
	March 25, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with the
	noteholder to amend original note agreement.  As part of
	this amendment, the Company paid $20,000 in cash to the noteholder
	and the noteholder agreed to reset the total balance due to the
	“Adjusted Current Balance” of $123,000 representing
	1,230,000 shares to be issued at $0.10.




	 





	The note balance was $0 and $154,188 as of September 30, 2016 and
	December 31, 2015, respectively.

	CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES
	(CONTINUED)




	 




	In
	March 2016, the noteholder in three (3) separate conversions
	converted $11,188 of principal and accrued fees into 765,000 shares
	of stock leaving a balance due under this note including interest
	and fees of $143,000.




	 




	On
	March 25, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with the
	noteholder to amend original note agreement.  As part of
	this amendment, the Company paid $20,000 in cash to the noteholder
	and the noteholder agreed to reset the total balance due to the
	“Adjusted Current Balance” of $123,000 representing
	1,230,000 shares to be issued at $0.10





	 




	Convertible Note dated December 23, 2015




	 




	On
	December 23, 2015, the Company entered into a 12% convertible
	redeemable note payable with an investor in the amount of $72,263.
	This note matures on December 23, 2016. The note bears interest at
	12%, compounded annually. Any amount of principal or interest on
	this note which is not paid when due shall bear an interest rate of
	24% per year (“default interest”.) The note may be
	converted, in whole or in part, into shares of the Company’s
	common stock. The conversion price will be the lower of 55%,
	equivalent to a 45% discount, of the lowest trading price of the
	Company’s common stock during the 20 consecutive training
	days immediately preceding the conversion date and the closing sale
	price of the common stock on the principal market on the trading
	day immediately preceding the closing date. If the Company's share
	price at any time loses the bid (ex: 0.0001 on the
	“ask” and zero market makers on the bid on level 2),
	then the conversion price may, in the holder’s sole and
	absolute discretion, be reduced to a fixed conversion price of
	$0.001 (if lower than the conversion price otherwise.)




	 




	Under
	terms of this agreement, the Company was required to set up an
	initial reserve of 50,000 common shares of stock for the potential
	conversion of convertible note principal and interest with an
	additional reserve of 2,450,000 shares of common stock in the name
	of the holder for issuance upon conversion as soon as a sufficient
	number of on issued shares become authorized, no later than January
	25, 2016. This amount was duly reserved with transfer agent. The
	Company is required to have authorized and reserved five times the
	number of shares that are actually issuable upon full conversion of
	this note.




	 




	On
	March 29, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with the
	noteholder to amend this convertible note.  As a result,
	the Company paid $6,271 in cash to the noteholder and the
	noteholder agreed to reset the total balance due to the
	“Adjusted Current Balance” of $78,366.  Also,
	under the agreement the price of future conversions will be set at
	$0.10.  No shares have been issued to the noteholder
	subsequent to this agreement.




	 




	The
	balance as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was $92,000
	including accumulated penalties and interest of $19,737 which was
	restructured as a convertible note with a fixed conversion of $0.10
	with 0% annual interest.




	 




	Convertible Note dated December 24, 2015

	redeemable note payable with an investor in the amount of $43,000.
	This note matures on December 24, 2016. The note will also bear
	interest at 11%, compounded annually. Any amount of principal or
	interest on this note which is not paid when due shall bear an
	interest rate of 24% per year (“default interest”).
	Original issue discount was recognized on this note in the amount
	of $18,000. Deducted from the cash proceeds of this note were
	$10,000 to cover legal and miscellaneous
	expenses.  $15,000 was paid in cash to the
	Company.




	 




	On
	March 29, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with the
	noteholder to amend this convertible note. As a result, the Company
	paid $3,729 in cash to the noteholder and the noteholder agreed to
	reset the total balance due to the “Adjusted Current
	Balance” of $46,634.  Also, under the agreement the
	price of future conversions will be set at $0.10.  The
	Company has not issued any shares under this
	agreement. 




	 




	The
	balance at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $43,000
	including $10,000 in default fees.

	The
	Company was established on September 2, 2006 with 100,000,000
	shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.001. On
	December 8, 2011, the Company amended the authorized stock to
	150,000,000 shares. On March 17, 2014, the Company amended the
	authorized stock to 500,000,000 shares. On March 15, 2016, the
	Company’s shareholders ratified management's restructuring
	plan by approving the increase in authorized shares to
	8,000,000,000.




	 




	On May
	23, 2016, the Company filed with the Secretary of State for the
	State of Nevada, the amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to
	change the name of the company to White Fox Ventures, Inc.
	(“White Fox”) to better reflect the new direction of
	the business and to effect a 100:1 reverse stock split. On May 27,
	2016, the Company filed the necessary documents with FINRA
	requesting these items as well as requesting a new ticker
	symbol.




	 




	On June
	22, 2016, FINRA announced its final approval for the
	Company’s change of name to White Fox Ventures, Inc., as well
	as the 100:1 reverse stock split.  The Company began trading
	under its new Ticker symbol, AWAW, on July 20, 2016.  All
	share figures are shown in this report are on a post reverse split
	basis.




	 




	The
	Company issued the following shares of common stock in

	The Company received from TAUG 10,869,565 shares of TAUG common
	stock (valued at $100,000) in exchange for the Company shares
	(reflected as an investment). Due to the very low stock value of
	both companies and with the Company exiting the eCigarette
	business, both companies have impaired their respective investment
	to $0 as December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, the value of
	total shares held was $44,565 ($0.0041 per share) classified as

	provide general financial advisory and investment banking services
	in exchange for 2.5% of the then issued and outstanding stock at
	the date of execution. The number of shares of common stock issued

	Common
	Stock (Continued)





	 




	171,500
	common shares of stock were issued to noteholders as commitment and
	assignment shares and recorded as debt financing cost at a value of
	$176,050 (average price $1.00.)




	 





	Under the first tranche of a July 2, 2015 securities purchase
	agreement, a single investor committed $240,000 for purchase of
	common stock and warrants.  Net proceeds to the Company
	from the transaction were $233,500, with $6,500 credited to the
	purchaser for legal fees.  The securities purchase
	agreement also called for a second tranche investment by the
	investor in the amount of $200,000, conditioned upon the effective
	date of a registration statement to be filed by the Company
	pursuant to a related registration rights agreement.  The
	Company could terminate the second tranche in its sole
	discretion.  The Company filed a Registration Statement on
	Form S-1 with the SEC on August 17, 2015.   On
	October 2, 2015, the Company submitted a request for withdrawal of
	the previously filed Form S-1 pursuant to Rule 477 under the
	Securities Act

	.





	 





	Under this agreement, the Company was obligated to issue 40,000
	common shares of its stock at $6.00 per share subject to
	adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations
	and other similar transactions after the date of
	agreement.  The final purchase price was subject to
	adjustment based on the closing price of the common stock on a date
	six months immediately following the closing date.  The
	final purchase price was also subject to a second adjustment based
	on the closing price of the common stock thirty days following the
	first adjustment date.





	 




	Under
	the agreement, at any time while warrants are outstanding, if the
	Company sold or grants any option to purchase, or sell or any
	common stock or common stock equivalents, at an effective price per
	share less than the exercise price then in effect but greater than
	$10.00 (price adjusted) will be considered a “dilutive
	issuance” and the holder of the warrant will be entitled to
	receive shares of common stock at an effective price per share that
	is less than the exercise price.




	 




	The
	warrants issued under the agreement gave the investor the right to
	purchase, on a cashless basis at the investor’s election, up
	to 40,000 common shares at an exercise price of $20.00, subject to
	adjustment. At any time while warrants are outstanding, if the
	Company sells, or grants any option to purchase, any common stock
	or common stock equivalents at an effective price per share less
	than the exercise price then in effect but greater than $10.00
	(price adjusted), the exercise price of the warrant will be
	adjusted downward to equal the lower price at which the common
	stock or common stock equivalents were sold.




	 




	On
	August 25, 2015, the Company consented to an assignment agreement
	whereby the assignor received $265,000 cash in exchange for the
	transfer of rights pursuant to the securities purchase agreement
	dated July 2, 2015.  As part of this agreement, the
	Company directly paid to the assignee $180,000 in exchange for the
	assignee waiving all rights under the original agreement related to
	price adjustments, the second tranche issuance and
	warrants.




	 




	On
	September 8, 2015, warrants to purchase 6,906 common shares were
	exercised on a cashless basis to convert to 75,415 common shares
	based on a price reset to equal the conversion price associated
	with the debt agreements from the stated strike price of $75.00.
	The price reset which resulted in the conversion to 75,415 common
	shares was based on the difference between the market value of the
	stock at the time (market price of $25.00 multiplied by exercise
	shares of 6,906) and the exercise price ($3.75) multiplied by
	number of exercise shares (6,906.) This number was then divided by
	the adjusted price of the common stock ($1.946).

	NOTE 7




	-         


	STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT (CONTINUED)




	 




	Authorized Reserved Shares




	 





	Several of the Company’s convertible notes required the
	Company to authorize and reserve four and in some cases five times
	the number of shares that were actually issuable upon full
	conversion of the notes (based on the conversion price of the notes
	in effect from time to time.)  The noteholders waived the
	requirement of the reserve shares beyond what was needed to
	convert through the maturity date, notwithstanding the initial
	reserve amount. The Company did not have sufficient authorized and
	unissued common shares to convert all convertible notes, and
	exercise all outstanding warrants, as of December 31, 2015.
	However, the Company’s March 15, 2016 amendment to its
	Articles of Incorporation, which increased the authorized capital
	of the Company, cured any deficiency under these obligations. As
	noted herein, the noteholders had waived this requirement in
	anticipation of the Company’s charter amendment to increase
	the authorized number of common shares.





	 




	Stock Options




	 




	On
	August 12, 2013, the Company approved and adopted the 2013 Stock
	Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). Under the 2013 Stock
	Incentive Plan, the Company may grant options or share awards to
	its full-time employees, executive officers, directors and
	consultants up to a maximum of 80,000 common shares. Under the
	Plan, the exercise price of each option will be established at the
	time of grant, but may not be less than $25.00. Stock options vest
	as stipulated in the stock option agreement and their maximum term
	is 8 years.

	On September 8, 2015, the cashless warrants to purchase 6,906
	common shares were exercised to convert to 75,415 common shares
	based on a price reset to equal the conversion price associated
	with the debt agreements from the stated strike price of $75.00.
	The price reset which resulted in the conversion to 75,415 common
	shares was based on the difference between the current market value
	(market price of $25.00 multiplied by exercise shares of 6,906) and
	the exercise price ($3.75) multiplied by number of exercise shares
	(6,906). This number is then divided by the adjusted price of the
	common stock ($1.946).






	 






	As of September 30, 2016, there are no warrants
	outstanding.

	Corporate History




	 




	White
	Fox Ventures, Inc. is a Nevada corporation organized September 2,
	2006.  Our original name was Celtic Capital, Inc.
	  On October 20, 2008, we changed our name to
	Entertainment Education Arts Inc.  On May 12, 2010, we changed
	our name to DNA Precious Metals, Inc.  On March 5, 2015
	pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, the Company changed
	its name to Breathe eCig Corp.  On May 23, 2016, the
	Company changed its name to White Fox Ventures, Inc. to better
	reflect its new business direction after the trademark legal
	settlement and discontinuance of the eCigarette operation. White
	Fox Ventures, Inc. may also be referred to as “White
	Fox”, “we”, “us” or the
	“Company”.




	 




	From
	May 2010 through February 3, 2015, we were an exploration stage
	mining company.  The Company’s focus was the
	development of the Montauban Mining Project, located in the
	Montauban and Chavigny townships near Grondines-West in Portneauf
	County, Quebec, Canada (the “Montauban Mine Property”
	or “Property”). Recognizing the need to secure
	significant additional capital to put the Property into production,
	management began to focus its attention on other business
	opportunities which would not require the significant capital
	required to expand the Property.  In furtherance thereof,
	on January 16, 2015, the Company entered into a share exchange
	agreement with Breathe LLC, a Tennessee limited liability company,
	whereby the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding
	membership interests in Breathe LLC in consideration for the
	issuance of 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to
	the members of Breathe, LLC.




	 




	Following
	the acquisition of Breathe LLC, on March 5, 2015 we entered into an
	Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”)
	pursuant to which the Company merged with its wholly owned
	subsidiary, Breathe eCig Corp., the sole purpose of which was to
	effect a change of the Company's name from DNA Precious Metals,
	Inc. to Breathe eCig Corp.




	 




	With
	the acquisition of Breathe LLC, the Company determined to spin-off
	the operations of its mining operations which were being conducted
	through its wholly owned subsidiary, DNA Canada, Inc
	(“DNAC”).  Effective February 3, 2015, we
	declared a stock dividend whereby each of the Company’s
	shareholders on the record date (February 3. 2015) would receive
	one share of DNAC for every two shares of the Company’s
	common stock owned.  The former members of Breathe LLC
	tendered their shares of DNAC for redemption by the
	Company.





	 





	With the completion of the spin-off, the Company exited the mining
	field and its sole and exclusive business operations was marketing
	its electronic cigarettes and related vapor devices. Following the
	trademark litigation through which the Company agreed to cease its
	continuing operations in the electronic cigarette business, and the
	investment by the new management team, each of which developments
	is described in more detail below, the Company’s business
	model changed to the development of business academies in
	Japan.





	 





	On May 23, 2016, the Company filed with the Secretary of State for
	the State of Nevada, the amendment to its Articles of Incorporation
	to change the name of the company to White Fox Ventures, Inc.
	(“White Fox”) to better reflect the new direction of
	the business and to effect a 100:1 reverse stock split. On May 27,
	2016, the Company filed the necessary documents with FINRA
	requesting these items as well as requesting a new ticker symbol,
	AWAW. FINRA announced its final approval on June 22,
	2016.

	On June 17, 2016, the Company formed a subsidiary with a 99%
	majority ownership stake.  The remaining non-controlling
	one percent of this subsidiary, White Fox Japan LLC, is owned by a
	related party, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer and
	Director, Takehiro Abe.  The Company currently conducts
	all of its transactional operational activity through this
	subsidiary, which plans, manages and promotes seminars and classes
	in Japan.






	 




	Breathe eCigs Corp. Acquisition and Spin-off of DNA Canada,
	Inc.




	 




	On
	January 16, 2015, the Company entered into a share exchange
	agreement with Breathe LLC, a Tennessee limited liability company
	whereby the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding
	membership interests in Breathe LLC in consideration for the
	issuance of 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to
	the members of Breathe LLC. 




	 




	As a
	result of the transaction effected by the Exchange Agreement, the
	former Breathe equity holders members owned approximately 56%
	of the then issued and outstanding common stock of the
	Company.  As a result, the Company accounted for this
	transaction as a reverse merger whereby the accounting acquirer and
	the comparative figures are those of Breathe.




	  




	Trademark Settlement/Disposal of eCigarette Operations




	 






	As of
	March 30, 2016, pursuant to a settlement agreement under trademark
	litigation with the plaintiff, Breathe LLC (a Florida limited
	liability company), the Company ceased its continuing operations in
	the eCigarette business. In accordance with the settlement
	agreement, the Company paid two cash payments totaling $25,000 and
	issued 500,000 restricted common shares of Company stock (valued at
	$50,000) to the plaintiff. In addition, the Company agreed to
	transfer 5,000,000 common shares which it held in Tauriga Sciences,
	Inc. At September 30, 2016 the value of the shares was $20,500
	($0.0041 per share.) The Company further agreed to split 50/50 any
	future sales of its held inventory.  The sale of
	inventory shall be a joint effort by the two companies and shall
	last for one year from April 1, 2016. After such period, the
	Company will dispose of any remaining inventory. The Company does
	not expect to sell the remaining inventory and has fully impaired
	the asset as of September 30, 2016.






	 




	On
	November 2, 2016, the Company transferred the 5,000,000 common
	shares which it held in Tauriga Sciences, Inc.




	 




	White Fox Ventures Inc.




	 





	In an agreement dated as of April 1, 2016, the Company agreed to
	acquire White Fox Ventures Inc. for in an undetermined amount of
	shares equating 85% of the total authorized capital of the Company.
	White Fox Ventures Inc., a Nevada Corporation was in existence less
	than 60 days and the only asset in the company was a license
	agreement that it had entered into with a Japanese company. Since
	the license agreement only stipulated a royalty fee on sales, White
	Fox Ventures Inc. did not record a value to the agreement. When the
	Company was completing its due diligence on this acquisition, it
	determined that the agreement and acquisition were not in the best
	interests of the Company at that time. As a result of this, the
	agreement was rescinded as noted in the Current Report on Form 8-K
	filed with the SEC on May 16, 2016.  The principal of
	White Fox Ventures Inc., Mr. Shinsuke Nakano (“Nakano”)
	and investors had invested $196,557 into the Company in the form of
	payment of various settlements and invoices outstanding. The
	investment was treated as private placement at $0.01 per share,
	whereby the Company, on May 10, 2016, issued to Nakano and the
	investors 19,655,700 shares of common stock, which represented
	71.7% of the shares issued and outstanding at the time the
	agreement was rescinded. In addition, for their investments, Nakano
	was named as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the
	Chairman of the Board and Mr. Abe was named to the position of
	Chief Operating Officer ("COO") and Director.

	ABOUT WHITE FOX VENTURES, INC.




	 




	The
	Company was formed as Breathe, LLC in October 2013 and Breathe
	eCigs. Corp. was formed on December 31, 2014.  On
	December 31, 2014, Breathe, LLC entered into a Bill of Sale to
	transfer 100% of the assets to Breathe eCigs Corp. Breathe eCigs
	Corp. operated as a development stage company that developed,
	marketed and distributed electronic cigarettes
	(“E-cigarettes”), vaporizers, e-liquids (i.e., liquid
	nicotine) and related accessories.  As of March 30, 2016,
	pursuant to the settlement agreement under trademark litigation
	with plaintiff, Breathe LLC (a Florida organization), the Company
	had ceased its continuing operations in the eCigarette
	business.



	The Company does
	not expect to sell the remaining inventory and has fully impaired
	the asset as of September 30, 2016.





	 




	With
	the departure of Joshua Kimmel on January 25, 2016 and the
	discontinuance of operations the Company, the Company struggled to
	obtain capital.  The Company was able to settle debts for
	stock, obtain funding via related parties as well as from a
	Japanese based investor group with principals of Japanese based
	White Fox, Co. Ltd. investing $987,592 through September 30,
	2016.  The amount invested through November 30, 2016, was
	$996,667. The Company issued 52,862,002 shares of common stock
	to settle these obligations through November 30, 2016, with $15,618
	still due.




	 




	On May
	23, 2016, the Company filed with the Secretary of State for the
	State of Nevada, the amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to
	change the name of the company to White Fox Ventures, Inc.
	(“White Fox”) to better reflect the new direction of
	the business and to effect a 100:1 reverse stock split. On May 27,
	2016, the Company filed the necessary documents with FINRA
	requesting these items as well as requesting a new ticker
	symbol.




	 




	On June
	22, 2016, FINRA announced its final approval for the
	Company’s change of name to White Fox Ventures, Inc., as well
	as a 100:1  reverse stock split and the Company’s new
	ticker symbol, AWAW, which began trading on July 20,
	2016.




	 





	The Company currently conducts all transactional operational
	activity of the Company through its 99% owned subsidiary, White Fox
	Japan LLC.  The subsidiary will plan, manage and promote
	seminars and classes in Japan.





	 




	BUSINESS STRATEGY




	 




	The
	Company's new core focus is the establishment of business academies
	throughout Japan. The Company has operations throughout Japan:
	Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo, Matsumoto, Nagoya, Osaka, Okoyama, Kumamoto
	and Fukuoka. The Company also plans to launch its academy via
	online throughout Japan.




	 




	White
	Fox is currently developing its online proprietary application to
	be exclusively utilized by its academy members. This application
	shall be available for direct downloading onto smartphones, such
	as: iPhones, Android as well as iOS and Tablet devices. The Company
	expects to launch this application sometime during winter of 2017
	(1st Quarter, 2017).




	 




	The
	Company is currently evaluating possible investment banking
	relationships in Japan as well as in New York for the purpose of
	securing additional working capital and further corporate
	advice.





	 




	Management
	believes that White Fox is building a solid future for shareholders
	by establishing a strong corporate team focused on both the
	Company's product offering as well as multi-faceted support for
	such offerings. The management team is excited about its ongoing
	transition as a publicly traded company and will do their best to
	achieve profitability and maintain stable growth as soon as
	possible. The Company will continue to update shareholders about
	important progress being realized.




	 




	Market Opportunity




	 





	We believe that the market potential in Japan and worldwide will
	continue to rise for the foreseeable future and believe we can
	garner 10,000 users and/or subscribers by the second quarter of
	2017.






	 





	We believe that the market opportunity for online financial
	academies represents a significant potential for the years to come.
	We believe that the ongoing transition to online and mobile banking
	also offers an opportunity to introduce younger generations to
	important concepts in personal finance through online and mobile
	platforms. White Fox’s academies seek to provide academic and
	hands-on experience to a new generation of savers and
	investors.

	Marketing and Growth Strategies




	 




	Our
	marketing strategy involves:





	 






	●




	Collection or
	purchase of e-mail lists of a prospective audience






	 






	●




	Automated e-mail
	delivery to the e-mail addresses on the lis

	t (e

	.g., video ad
	distribution every day at 6:00 p.m. Market Launch May
	2016)







	 






	●




	Introduction of
	White Fox Online Academy videos.






	 






	●




	Use of
	distribution agents who will sell White Fox products for a
	finder’s fee or commission or mark up.






	 




	We sell
	our products via the Internet. We estimate that the conversion rate
	in obtaining new customers will be approximately 1% ~ 2% from our
	total emails or links sent or opened. We are currently
	concentrating our efforts on reaching as many potential new members
	from pre-selected lists as we can. We currently have a list of
	100,000 likely candidates. After obtaining new members or customers
	for our academy videos, we can sell other products, such as digital
	coins or special seminars.




	 




	Upon
	the company reaching 10,000 members, we plan to issue our own
	corporate debit card.




	 




	We
	believe our revenue flow will be somewhat stable from ongoing
	membership fees even without the various added income potentials
	previously described. Because our business plan is in its early
	stages, we can give no assurances that our expected conversion rate
	will be met, that we will be able to obtain a substantial number of
	members or customers for our online videos, that we will be able to
	sell additional products to our existing members or customers, or
	that we will be able to achieve a growth rate or revenue base from
	ongoing membership fees that will make our operations
	profitable.

	DISCUSSION OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




	 




	The
	following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is
	qualified in its entirety by, our unaudited financial statements
	for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and
	September 30, 2015, and certain other financial information
	included elsewhere in this report.





	 




	From
	May 2010 through February 3, 2015 the Company was an exploratory
	stage-mining corporation. The Company did not commence mining
	operations nor did we generate revenues.  With the
	acquisition of Breathe in January 2015, our sole business objective
	became the eCigarette industry.  The mining operations
	were divested pursuant to a stock dividend received by the
	shareholders of the Company.




	 




	As a
	result of the Exchange Agreement, the Company accounted for this
	transaction as a reverse merger whereby Breathe was the accounting
	acquirer and the comparative period figures are those of
	Breathe.




	 




	As of
	March 30, 2016, pursuant to a settlement agreement under trademark
	litigation with the plaintiff, Breathe LLC (a Florida limited
	liability company), the Company ceased its continuing operations in
	the eCigarette business. The Company further agreed to split 50/50
	any future sales of its held inventory.  The sale of
	inventory shall be a joint effort by the two companies and shall
	last for one year from April 1, 2016. After such period, the
	Company will dispose of any remaining inventory.



	The Company does not expect to sell the remaining inventory and has
	fully impaired the asset as of September 30,
	2016.

	Results of Operations for Three and Nine Months Ended September 30,
	2016 and 2015




	 




	Discontinued operations




	 




	As of
	March 30, 2016, pursuant to a settlement agreement under trademark
	litigation with a plaintiff, the Company ceased its continuing
	operations in the eCigarette business.




	 




	For the
	nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company had virtually no
	revenue from its discontinued operations compared to $64,218 and
	$70,218 for the three and nine months ended September 30,
	2015.  




	 


	  




	Cost of Sales from discontinued operations




	 




	For the
	three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company
	had cost of goods sold attributable to its discontinued operations
	of $0 and $1,851 compared to $93,447 and $100,504 for the same
	period in the prior year, related to monthly fees from the
	third-party inventory holding company which still holds our
	remaining inventory.




	 




	The
	Company agreed to split 50/50 any future sales of its held
	inventory.  The sale of inventory shall be a joint effort
	by the two companies and shall last for one year from April 1,
	2016. After such period, the Company will dispose of any remaining
	inventory.



	The Company does
	not expect to sell the remaining inventory and has fully impaired
	the asset as of September 30, 2016.





	 




	Loss from discontinued operations




	 




	For the
	three months ended September 30, 2016, the loss from discontinued
	operations was $117,403 compared to $326,378 in the three months

	Results from continuing operations –




	 




	The
	Company’s continuing operations through its majority owned
	subsidiary, White Fox Japan LLC, are in the financial services and
	technology sector focused on its revenue generating investor
	academy. The Company offers multiple products as trial and annual
	membership subscriptions. The Company also offers lifetime premium
	membership levels which are offered to annual paying
	members.




	 





	Crest Partner membership –

	this is
	an exclusive lifetime membership which requires acceptance based on
	an interview process.  These advanced members must be very
	familiar with AWA and assist in the learning and Academy training
	of AWA members.  In order to maintain a Crest Partner
	Membership, the member must maintain an active annual Premium or
	AWA Plus membership.




	 





	Partner membership-

	this is a lifetime
	membership whereby members assist in the learning and Academy
	training of AWA members.  In order to maintain a Partner
	Membership, the member must maintain an active annual Premium or
	AWA Plus membership.




	 





	Premium membership --

	general annual membership.  The member has access to the basic
	AWA Academy and may participate in the nationwide academy as many
	times as possible.  Premiums members may increase knowledge by
	contacting Partners and Crest partners at various
	locations.




	 





	AWA plus –

	this is the basic
	annual membership level of AWA.  The member has access to the
	basic AWA Academy.




	 





	New memberships sold –

	the below chart shows new
	membership contracts. The number of members is the total of Premium
	and Plus members because Partner and Crest Partners must first have
	a basic annual membership

	New product sales - cash receipts and credit card receipts or
	credit card receivable-

	the below amounts show cash and
	credit card receipts (both received and in transit for the period
	ended September 30, 2016.) Most of these amounts are not reflected
	in revenue recognized for the current period, but are
	recorded  as deferred revenue and recognized over different
	periods of time. Plus and Premium memberships are recognized
	prorata over a twelve month period. The lifetime memberships of
	Partner or Crest levels are recognized over the average length of
	time that these memberships are active. Since this operation is new
	there is no track record to calculate the average length of these
	memberships. The company has chosen to recognize these amounts
	prorata over thirty-six months. This number will be revaluated
	annually to determine if there is a more appropriate period over
	which to recognize revenue from these lifetime
	contracts.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 




	Total assets




	 




	Through
	September 30, 2016 operations had been primarily funded through
	debt and equity financing. During the nine months ended September
	30, 2016, we raised $587,747 through the issuance of notes and
	$917,088 through the sale of our common stock. 




	 




	At
	September 30, 2016, we had $57,718 in cash, prepaid expenses of
	$190,587, $190,961 recorded as a marketable securities in an
	investment and sales receivable (credit card settlements in
	transit) of $181,207.  Total current assets were
	$620,473.




	 




	The
	company also has property and equipment, net of depreciation, in
	the amount $41,522 and a $50,000 investment in a privately held
	company consisting of less than 2% ownership. Total assets were
	$711,995 of September 30, 2016. At December 31, 2015, we had cash
	totaling $10,955.




	 




	Total liabilities




	 




	Current
	liabilities at September 30, 2016 totaled $1,134,339 as compared to
	$2,271,674 at December 31, 2015. Our current liabilities as of
	September 30, 2016 included $132,970 related to current notes
	payable, as well as accrued interest of $3,745. Notes payable for
	related parties for the period ended September 30, 2016 was
	$385,047 compared to $1,175,000 at December 31, 2015. The decrease
	was due to the March 28, 2016 settlement of certain obligations
	with the collective issuance of 858,326 shares to settle a total of
	$1,050,000 related party notes related to the purchase of the
	Company’s intellectual property in connection with a
	lawsuit.  Other current liabilities at September 30, 2016
	were a liability to issue stock of $135,710 and accounts payable of

	from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September
	30, 2016 were $239,004 compared to $232,771 at December 31,
	2015.  We had deferred revenue on sales in the amount of
	$573,465 recorded as a long- term liability at September 30, 2016.
	The Company had no long-term liabilities as of December 31,
	2015.




	 




	We
	believe that our cash on hand at September 30, 2016 plus cash from
	on-going operations will be sufficient to fund our current working
	capital requirements.  We may continue to seek additional
	equity financing. However, there is no assurance that we will be
	successful in our equity private placements or if we are that the
	terms will be beneficial to our shareholders.

	Going Concern Qualifications




	 




	The
	condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a
	going concern basis. The going concern basis of presentation
	assumes that the Company will continue in operation for the
	foreseeable future and be able to realize its assets and discharge
	its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
	The Company has generated net losses from continuing and
	discontinued operations attributable to common shareholders
	totaling $1,014,585 and $7,714,587 for the nine months ended
	September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company’s
	continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, amongst other
	things, developing a new line of business as well as continued
	financial support from its shareholders and lenders, attaining a
	satisfactory revenue level, attainment of profitable operations and
	the generation of cash from operations and the ability to secure
	new financing arrangements and new capital to carry out its
	business plan. These matters are dependent on a number of items
	outside of the Company’s control and there exist material
	uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company
	can give no assurance that it will achieve profitability or be
	capable of sustaining profitable operations in its new business of
	White Fox. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not
	include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
	classification of the carrying amounts of assets or the amount and
	classification of liabilities that might result if the Company is
	unable to continue as a going concern. These factors raise
	substantial doubt regarding the ability of the Company to continue
	as a going concern. The Company recently raised $587,747 in net
	debt proceeds for which full settlement was attained by the
	issuance of common stock of the Company and $917,088 of equity
	proceeds during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, to pay
	for the reorganization costs.

	As of
	the end of the period covered by this quarterly report
	on Form 10-Q, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
	and Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the
	Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
	Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).
	Based upon this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive

	ROCEEDINGS.






	 




	From time to time, we may be involved in various claims, lawsuits,
	and disputes with third parties, actions involving allegations of
	discrimination or breach of contract actions incidental to the
	operation of our business. However, we are not currently involved
	in any litigation which we believe could have a materially adverse
	effect on our financial condition or results of
	operations.

	RISK FACTORS.









	 






	We have limited
	capital and will need to raise additional capital in the
	future.






	 




	White Fox does not
	currently have sufficient capital to fund both our continuing
	operations and its planned growth.  The Company will
	require additional capital to continue to expand its
	operations.  The Company may be unable to obtain
	additional capital when required.  Future business
	development activities, as well as our administrative requirements
	(such as salaries, insurance expenses and general overhead
	expenses, as well as legal compliance costs and accounting
	expenses) will require a substantial amount of additional capital
	and cash flow.




	 




	White Fox may pursue
	sources of additional capital through various financing
	transactions or arrangements, including joint venturing of
	projects, debt financing, equity financing or other
	means.  The Company may not be successful in identifying
	suitable financing transactions in the time period required or at
	all, and we may not obtain the capital we require by other
	means.  If White Fox does not succeed in raising
	additional capital, White Fox’s operations will terminate and
	there is a risk of loss of your entire investment.




	 




	Any additional
	capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute the ownership
	percentage of our stockholders.  Raising any such capital
	could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of your
	equity securities because our assets would be owned by a larger
	pool of outstanding equity.  The terms of securities we
	issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable to our
	new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights
	and the issuance of other derivative securities, and issuances of
	incentive awards under equity employee incentive plans, which may
	have a further dilutive effect.




	 




	The Company’s
	ability to obtain financing may be impaired by such factors as the
	capital markets (both generally and in our industry in particular),
	our limited operating history, national unemployment rates and the
	departure of key employees.  Further, economic downturns
	will likely decrease our revenues may increase our requirements for
	capital.  If the amount of capital we are able to raise
	from financing activities, together with our revenues from
	operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs (even to
	the extent that we reduce our operations), we may be required to
	cease our operations, divest our assets at unattractive prices or
	obtain financing on unattractive terms.




	 






	We may not be
	able to successfully manage our growth, which could lead to our
	inability to implement our business
	plan.






	 




	Our growth is
	expected to place a significant strain on our managerial,
	operational and financial resources, especially considering that we
	currently only have a small number of executive officers, employees
	and advisors. Further, as we enter into various contracts or other
	transactions, we will be required to manage multiple relationships
	with various consultants, businesses and other third parties. There
	can be no assurance that our systems, procedures and/or controls
	will be adequate to support our operations or that our management
	will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to
	successfully implement our business plan. If we are unable to
	manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations
	and financial condition will be adversely affected, which could
	lead to us being forced to abandon or curtail our business plan and
	operations.
