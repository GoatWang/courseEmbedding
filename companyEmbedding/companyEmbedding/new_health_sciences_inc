Red Blood Cell Storage and Clinical Outcomes: new insights
The detrimental effects of red cell storage lesions, and the benefits of oxygen reduction during storage, are highlighted in two thematic volumes published by Blood Transfusion.   The volumes disseminate 28 papers from international experts on the state of research in regards to red blood cell storage, and effects on clinical outcomes. Due to the multiple contributions and editorial constraints, a second volume will be published in the upcoming weeks. Please find Volume 1 for your review.

Anaerobic Storage - New Health Science




























































































  















Technology











Anaerobic Storage
New Health Sciences is developing a technology to enable the storage of RBC under anaerobic conditions. Removing O2 during storage removes the primary “fuel” for oxidative stress1-11. Previous published research has demonstrated that preventing oxidative damage can alleviate many of the signs associated with storage lesion development, including:




Anaerobic storage has been shown to:
Improved maintenance of 2,3-DPG  Reduce donor variability in RBC storage characteristics Improved deformability compared to conventionally stored RBC Decrease iron overload leading to higher proportion of viable RBC per unit transfused 



New Health Sciences continues to invest significant resources in developing the technology and demonstrating both its effect on the characteristics of RBCs during storage, and eventually in clinical usage with patients.

New Health Sciences relaunches manufacturing facility in Avon, MA to support prototype development & the Boston medical technology community - New Health Science






























































































  















News Room









Avon,MA – March 31, 2016 – New Health Sciences, Inc. (NHSi), a medical technology company focused on innovations that improve transfusion therapy, announced the relaunch of its manufacturing facility in Avon, MA under the name NHS Manufacturing (NHSM). NHSi acquired the FDA registered facility from KS Manufacturing in April 2015 to support internal product development and manufacturing needs. But it also recognized that there was a promising contract manufacturing business and a set of core competencies in medical device disposable manufacturing, capital equipment assembly and distribution that could continue to serve the medical technology community in the Boston area.
Since the acquisition, NHSi has made substantial investments in the manufacturing facility, employee training, and process development in preparation for the relaunch. According to Jimmy Devarie, the NHSM Plant Manager, “the experienced team at NHSM is committed to providing the most effective option for medical device manufacturing needs while also emphasizing compliance, cost effectiveness and efficiency.” Major improvements include the expansion of the manufacturing area, updates to the clean room systems, improvements to the warehouse systems, and installation of a new machine shop.
“We are proud to be launching NHS Manufacturing with the goal of providing efficient, responsive medical device prototyping and contract manufacturing capabilities for the vibrant med tech community in Boston.” Stated Martin Cannon, CEO of NHSi. NHSM currently employees 6 people in the Avon facility and looks forward to being a consistent growing employer in the region.
About Us:
New Health Sciences Manufacturing in Avon, Massachusetts is a subsidiary of New Health Sciences Inc. with corporate headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, and a research and development facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. NHSi acquired the assets of KS Manufacturing in 2015 and has continued to provide medical technology companies with customized solutions, competitive pricing and quality product for their manufacturing needs.

              		A company's strength rests on the value of its products. There is only one acceptable standard: excellence. We've taken the time to make our products Certified Kosher, Certified Halal, USDA-certified organic, NSF GMP-registered, and GMP for SportsTM-registered. GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) is the gold standard of the food industry. It means our ingredients are thoroughly tested, contaminant-free, and 100% pure. Every product contains exactly what it says it does on the label.
			THIS IS EXCELLENCE YOU CAN COUNT ON.

OUR CULTURE
			We've built New Earth on three pillars: Live • Give • Grow.
              		Live: To live fully means to be healthy first—healthy in body, mind, and spirit.
              		Give: Giving is such a core part of who we are that we've integrated it into the way we do business. New Earth's vision is to bring the power of Earth's First FoodsTM to every body and every soul on the planet.
			
Grow: The ideal business model offers the opportunity not only to grow financially, but to also grow as a whole person.
			
			These pillars allow us to attract a certain caliber of people: those who are passionate about living in the fullness of whole health, driven by a desire to empower others and serious about growing rewarding lives.
OUR PROMISE
			We understand this business is a partnership. We don't take that lightly. You are looking to grow a sustainable, long-term income stream. We feel the same way. We know our partnership brings real value to you and your family. We deliver support that matches the unparalleled quality of our products.
