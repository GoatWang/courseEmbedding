 Welcome


On December 
			15, 2009 International Drill Guide, Inc. purchased some of the 
			assets of Ben-Tek Products.  Founded in 1963, Ben-Tek Products 
			assisted the precision drilling industry by helping to provide 
			tooling for cleaner, more cost effective drilling.   International 
			Drill Guide, Inc. is now your exclusive source for Ben-Tek Seals and 
			Inserts.  Please see our other products at

Seals
The Ben-Tek Gundrill 
              Seal is the standard by which all other chip box seals are measured. 
              Developed in 1963, our exclusive 7 step process insures a perfect 
              fit for whatever size drill you may be using. Single and two-flute 
              seals are available, as well as any combination of inner/outer dimensions 
              you may require.

 


 
 
 

 


 





 


 


Whip 
              Guide Insert
The Ben-Tek Whip Guide Insert, 
              when snapped into the bore of a bearing and mounted in either the 
              chip box or mid-span support bracket, provides a tight fit over 
              the Gundrill shank to prevent whipping and vibration of a rapidly 
              rotating Gundrill.

 


 



 


 
 

Bearings 
              / Adapters
To complete your mid-span 
              support assembly you'll need a bearing and adapter. Our high quality 
              bearings and adapters are the perfect fit for any series insert. 
 
 


Service
 
            	Our number one concern 
              is making sure you get the parts you need when you need them. All 
              items are in stock and in most cases are shipped the same day.
