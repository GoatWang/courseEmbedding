Van Mieghem, Jan A. and Itai Gurvich. Forthcoming. Collaboration and multitasking in networks: Prioritization and Achievable Capacity. Management Science.Motivated by the trend towards more collaboration in team work, we study networks where some tasks require the simultaneous processing by multiple types of multitasking human or indivisible resources.  The capacity of such networks is generally smaller than the bottleneck capacity. In Gurvich and Van Mieghem (2015) we proved that both capacities are equal in networks with a hierarchical collaboration architecture, which define a collaboration level for each task depending on how many types of resources it requires relative to other network tasks. This paper studies how task prioritization impacts the capacity of such hierarchical networks using a conceptual queuing framework that formalizes coordination and switching idleness. 

To maximize the capacity of a team, highest priority should be given to the tasks that require the most collaboration.  Otherwise, a mismatch between priority levels and collaboration levels inevitably inflicts a capacity loss.  We demonstrate this essential trade-off between task prioritization (quality of service) and capacity (productivity) in a basic collaborative network and in parallel networks.

To manage this trade-off, we present a hierarchical threshold priority policy that balances switching and coordination idleness.
Zhang, J, Eric Park, Itai Gurvich, Jan A. Van Mieghem, Robert S. Young and Mark V. Williams. 2016. Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program: A Financial and Operational Analysis. Management Science. 62(11): 3351-3371.The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP), a part of the US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to penalize payments to hospitals with excess readmissions. We take an economic and operational (patient flow) perspective to ask a simple question: assuming that hospitals are self-interested operating-margin maximizers and are strategically forward-looking, does the structure of the HRRP policy provide economic incentives to all hospitals to reduce readmissions? If not, which hospitals are left behind, and what are the challenges? Since hospitals are benchmarked against their peers under the policy, we use a game-theoretical model to describe hospitals' behavior. While the game is complex, we develop bounds on equilibria that provide insights into the effectiveness of the HRRP policy. We calibrate our model with a dataset of hospitals in California. Our model suggests that in the long term, a significant proportion of hospitals will prefer to pay penalties rather than reduce readmissions. For a broad range of parameters, we find that the policy may be ineffective in inducing some hospitals to reduce readmissions: these are hospitals that either (i) are located in sparsely served areas, (ii) have a low fraction of revenue coming from Medicare, (iii) have currently high readmission rates, or (iv) have a high contribution margin per patient. We also examine the effect of certain changes to the HRRP policy.
Gurvich, Itai and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 2015. Collaboration and multitasking in networks: Architectures, Bottlenecks and Throughput. Manufacturing & Service Operations Management (M&SOM). 17(1): 16-33.Motivated by the trend towards more collaboration in work flows, we study stochastic processing networks where some activities require the simultaneous collaboration of multiple human resources. Collaboration introduces resource synchronization requirements that are not captured in the standard procedure (formalized through a static planning problem) to identify bottlenecks and theoretical capacity. We introduce the notions of collaboration architecture and unavoidable idleness. In general, collaboration architectures may feature unavoidable idleness so that the theoretical capacity exceeds the maximal achievable throughput or actual capacity. This fundamental tradeoff between collaboration and throughput does not disappear in multi-server networks and has important ramifications to service-system staffing. We identify a special class of collaboration architectures that have no unavoidable idleness and present a condition on this architecture that guarantees, regardless of the processing times of the various activities, that the standard bottleneck procedure in fact identifies the actual capacity of the network. In multi-server cases this class of networks guarantees that the theoretical capacity is achievable provided one has the right number of floaters. Finally, we study the subtleties that collaboration introduces to questions of flexibility investment. Unavoidable idleness may limit the ability to materialize the benefits of flexibility. We study the interplay of flexibility and unavoidable idleness and offer remedies derived from collaboration architecture.
Allon, Gad, Achal Bassamboo, Jan A. Van Mieghem and R. Cui. 2015. Information Sharing in Supply Chains: An Empirical and Theoretical Valuation. Management Science. 61(11): 2803-2824.We provide an empirical and theoretical assessment of the value of information sharing in a two-stage supply chain. The value of downstream sales information to the upstream firm stems from improving upstream order fulfillment forecast accuracy. Such an improvement can lead to lower safety stock and better service. Based on the data collected from a CPG company, we empirically show that, if the company includes the downstream sales data to forecast orders, the improvement in the mean squared forecast error ranges from 7.1% to 81.1% across all studied products. Theoretical models in the literature, however, suggest that the value of information sharing should be zero for over half of our studied products. To reconcile the gap between the literature and the empirical observations, we develop a new theoretical model. While the literature assumes that the decision maker strictly adheres to a given inventory policy, our model allows him to deviate, accounting for private information held by the decision maker, yet unobservable to the econometrician. This turns out to reconcile our empirical findings with the literature. These "decision deviations" lead to information losses in the order process, resulting in a strictly positive value of downstream information sharing. Furthermore, we empirically quantify and show the significance of the value of operations knowledge - the value of knowing the downstream replenishment policy.
Van Mieghem, Jan A. and Robert Boute. 2015. Global Dual Sourcing and Order Smoothing: The Impact of  Capacity and Leadtimes. Management Science. 61(9): 2080-2099.After decades of offshoring production across the world, companies are rethinking their global networks. Local sourcing is receiving more attention, but it remains challenging to balance the offshore sourcing cost advantage against the increased inventories, because of its longer lead time, and against the cost and (volume) flexibility of each source’s capacity. To guide strategic allocation in this global network decision, this paper
establishes reasonably simple prescriptions that capture the key drivers. We adopt a conventional discrete-time inventory model with a linear control rule that smoothes orders and allows an exact and analytically tractable analysis of single- and dual-sourcing policies under normal demand. Distinguishing features of our model are that
it captures each source’s lead time, capacity cost, and flexibility to work overtime. We use Lagrange’s inversion theorem to provide exact and simple square-root bound formulae for the strategic sourcing allocations and the value of dual sourcing. The formulae provide structural insight on the impact of financial, operational, and
demand parameters, and a starting point for quantitative decision making. We investigate the robustness of our results by comparing the smoothing policy with existing single- and dual-sourcing models in a simulation study that relaxes model assumptions.
Huang, Tingliang and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 2014. Clickstream Data and Inventory Management: Model and Empirical Analysis. Production and Operations Management. 23(3): 333-347.We consider firms that feature their products on the Internet but take orders offline. Click and order data are disjoint on such non-transactional websites, and their matching is error-prone. Yet, their time separation may allow the firm to react and improve its tactical planning. We introduce a dynamic decision support model that augments the classic inventory planning model with additional clickstream state variables. Using a novel data set of matched online clickstream and offline purchasing data, we identify statistically significant clickstream variables and empirically investigate the value of clickstream tracking on non-transactional websites to improve inventory management. We show that the noisy clickstream data is statistically significant to predict the propensity, amount, and timing of offline orders. A counter-factual analysis shows that using the demand information extracted from the clickstream data can reduce the inventory holding and backordering cost by 3% to 5% in our data set.

Huang, Tingliang and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 2013. The Promise of Strategic Customer Behavior: On the Value of Click Tracking. Production and Operations Management. 22(3): 489-502.Recent Internet clicks-tracking technology has generated the fast growing practice of web analytics and extensive ongoing research in academia. Motivated by empirical evidence, we study whether strategic consumers are willing to click to reveal their advance demand information (ADI and preferences. We show that by embracing clicks tracking technology, operations management can bring significant improvements in firm profit. We compare the new technology to traditional practices such as quantity commitment, availability guarantees, and quick response, and distinguish three different effects:We show that the efficiency effect from better matching uncertain demand and the learning effect from contingent pricing are much more significant than the strategic effect from only relying on strategic instruments. We then study the value of personalized pricing under strategic consumer behavior. To investigate the robustness of our results, we study settings with price-sensitive demand and markdown pricing where the value of the technology can be small. We propose measures, such as price commitment and personalization, to mitigate such negative effects for the firm. Additionally, we show how competition and the quality of ADI affect our results. Finally, we provide managerial guidelines to maximize the value of the technology from an operations management perspective.

Chod, Jiri, Nils Rudi and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 2012. Mix, Time, and Volume Flexibility: Valuation and Corporate Diversification. Review of Business and Economics. 57(3): 262-282.Flexibility measures the ability to adapt to change and often has multiple dimensions that impact value jointly yet differently. We assess this joint impact in a theoretical model of a two-product firm that makes capacity, output and pricing decisions at three points in time with an underlying continuous-time information evolution. The firm's ability to adapt is characterized by three types of flexibility. The cost of switching capacity between the two products measures the firm's mix flexibility. The fraction of product costs that are postponed until demand information is updated measures the firm's volume flexibility. Finally, the relative timing of the output decision measures the firm's time flexibility. We show that mix and volume flexibilities are substitutes in creating firm value but both are complementary to time flexibility. Furthermore, the marginal values of mix and time flexibility are decreasing in demand correlation whereas the marginal value of volume flexibility increases in demand correlation. We discuss the implications of these results to the trade-offs faced by managers when deciding how much to invest in different aspects of flexibility. We also relate these results to corporate strategy and show when different types of flexibility can justify a company to pursue market diversification.
Bassamboo, Achal, Ramandeep S. Randhawa and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 2010. Optimal Flexibility Configurations in Newsvendor Networks: Going Beyond Chaining and Pairing. Management Science. 56(8): 1285-1303.We study the classical problem of capacity and flexible technology selection with a newsvendor network model of resource portfolio investment. The resources differ by their level of flexibility, where level - k flexibility refers to the ability to process  k  different product types. We present an exact set-theoretic methodology to analyze newsvendor networks with multiple products and parallel resources. This simple approach is sufficiently powerful to prove that (i) flexibility exhibits decreasing returns and (ii) the optimal portfolio will invest in at most two, adjacent levels of flexibility in symmetric systems, and to characterize (iii) the optimal flexibility configuration for asymmetric systems as well. The optimal flexibility configuration can serve as a theoretical performance benchmark for other configurations suggested in the literature. For example, although chaining is not optimal in our setting, the gap is small and the inclusion of scale economies quickly favors chaining over pairing. We also demonstrate how this methodology can be applied to other settings such as product substitution and queuing systems with parameter uncertainty.
Allon, Gad and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 2010. The Mexico-China Sourcing Game: Teaching Global Dual Sourcing. Informs Transactions on Education. 10(3): 105-112.We describe a three-hour class on global dual sourcing built around a game that demonstrates the challenges in making operational decisions and transfers recent academic insights to the classroom. Student teams manage a firm with access to a responsive but expensive supply source (Mexico) and a cheap but remote source (China). Each team must determine a sourcing strategy to satisfy random demand that is revealed throughout the game. In each period, teams place orders to both sources and manage two assets: inventory and their bank account. The goal is to maximize each team's value (final bank balance). During the debriefings, we analyze the policies use by different teams along both financial and operational metrics, present the optimal strategy, and summarize the experimental learning points.
Chod, Jiri, Nils Rudi and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 2010. Operational Flexibility and Financial Hedging: Complements or Substitutes?. Management Science. 56(6): 1030-1045.We consider a risk-sensitive firm that invests in capacity under demand uncertainty and thus faces two related but distinct types of risk: mismatch between capacity and demand and profit variability. While mismatch risk can be mitigated with greater operational flexibility, profit variability can be reduced through financial hedging. We show that the relationship between these two risk mitigating strategies depends on the type of flexibility: Product flexibility and financial hedging tend to be complements (substitutes), i.e., product flexibility tends to increase (decrease) the value of financial hedging and, vice versa, financial hedging tends to increase (decrease) the value of product flexibility, when product demands are positively (negatively) correlated. In contrast to product flexibility, postponement flexibility is a substitute to financial hedging as intuitively expected. Our results rely in part on analytical proofs and in part on numerical analysis.
Allon, Gad and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 2010. Global Dual Sourcing: Tailored Base Surge Allocation to Near and Offshore Production. Management Science. 56(1): 110-124.When designing a sourcing strategy in practice, a key task is to determine the average order rates placed to each source because that affects costs and supplier management. We consider a firm that has access to a responsive near-shore source (e.g., Mexico) and a low-cost offshore source (e.g., China). The firm must determine an inventory sourcing policy to satisfy random demand over time. Unfortunately, the optimal policy is too complex to allow a direct answer to our key question. Therefore, we analyze a tailored base-surge (TBS) sourcing policy that is simple, used in practice, and captures the classic tradeoff between cost and responsiveness. The TBS policy replenishes at a constant rate from the offshore source and produces at the near shore plant only when inventory is below a target. The constant base allocation allows the offshore facility to focus on cost efficiency while the nearshore's quick response capability is utilized only dynamically to guarantee high service. The research goals are to i) determine the allocation of random demand into base and surge capacity, ii) estimate corresponding working capital requirements, and iii) identify and value the key drivers of dual sourcing. Given that even this simple TBS policy is not amenable to exact analysis, we investigate a Brownian approximation that yields a simple square root formula that is insightful to answer our questions and sufficiently accurate for practice, as is demonstrated with a validation study.

. 11(2): 254-273.This paper examines how internal competiton and judicious rework allocation can improve qualty and bottom line results. It is motivated by the practive of a service operations firm, Memphis Auto Auctions. MAA uses a non conventional rework allocation process, according to which each team is paid only if the work is of good quality. All payments for units that are reworked are made to the competing (other)team. This internal competition contrasts with the conventional one, that assigns rework back to the original one. In this paper, we investigate quality improvement incentives of the this rework allocation and payment scheme.

Van Mieghem. 2009. The Value of Dynamic Resource Pooling: Should a service network be integrated or Product-focused?. Management Science. 55(1): 115-131.We investigate how network design impacts capacity requirements and responsiveness, which is a natural performance indicator of quality of service. Inspired by the contrasting network design approaches of FedEx and UPS, we study when two service classes (e.g., express or regular) should be served by dedicated resources (e.g., air or ground) or by an integrated network. We present analytic expressions for the delay distributions and the network integration value, which show how the value of network integration depends on the quality of service guarantees (speed and reliability of service) and the demand characteristics (averages volume and variance of each service class and their correlation). Our results suggests that operating dedicated networks is a fine strategy (meaning that network integration is of little value) if the firm primarily serves express requests with high reliability and if the correlation with regular requests is not strongly negative.
Lu, Lauren Xiaoyuan and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 2008. Multimarket Facility Network Design with Offshoring Applications. Manufacturing & Service Operations Management (M&SOM). 11(1): 90-108.Moving production to low-wage countries may reduce manufacturing costs, but increases logistics costs and introduces foreign trade barriers, among others. This paper studies a manufacturer's multi-market facility network design problem and investigates the offshoring decision from a network capacity investment perspective. We analyze a firm that manufactures two products to serve two geographically separated markets using a common component and two localized final assembly. The common part can be transported between the two markets that have different demand and economic characteristics. Two strategic network design questions arise naturally in this context: (1) Should the common part be produced centrally or in two local facilities? (2) If a centralization strategy is adopted for the common component, which market should the facility be located in? We present a transportation cost threshold that captures costs, revenues, and demand risks, and below which centralization is optimal. The optimal location of commonality crucially depends on the relative magnitude of price and manufacturing cost differentials but also on demand size and uncertainty. Incorporating scale economies further enlarges the centralization's optimality region. Finally, we translate our results into managerial insights for assessing the value of offshoring through direct capacity investment.

Management Science. 53(8): 1269-1288.This paper studies how judicious resource allocation in networks mitigates risk. Theory is presented for general utility functions and mean-variance formulations and is illustrated with networks featuring resource diversification, flexibility (e.g., inventory substitution), and sharing (commonality). In contrast to single-resource settings, risk-averse newsvendors may invest more in networks than risk-neutral newsvendors: some resources and even total spending may exceed risk-neutral levels. With normally distributed demand, risk-averse newsvendors change resource levels roughly proportionally to demand variance while risk-neutral agents adjust only proportionally to standard deviation. Two effects explain this operational hedge and suggest rules of thumb for strategic placement of safety capacity and inventory in networks. (1) Risk pooling suggests re-balancing capacity toward inexpensive resources that serve lower profit variance markets. This highlights the role of profit variance (instead of demand variance) in risk-averse network investment. (2) Ex-post revenue maximization suggests re-balancing capacity toward flexible but away from shared capacity when markets differ in profitability. Capacity imbalance and allocation flexibility thus mitigate profit risk and truly are operational hedges.

European Journal of Operational Research. 167(1): 179-207.We study how multi-product queueing systems should be controlled so that sojourn times (or  end-to-end delays) do not exceed specified leadtimes. The network dynamically decides when  to admit new arrivals and how to sequence the jobs in the system. To analyze this difficult  problem, we propose an approach based on fluid model analysis that translates the leadtime  specifications into deterministic constraints on the queue length vector. The main benefit of  this approach is that it is possible (and relatively easy) to construct scheduling and multi-product admission policies for leadtime control. Additional results are: (a) While this approach is simpler than a heavy-traffic approach, the admission policies that emerge from it are also more specific than, but consistent with, those from heavy-traffic analysis, (b) A simulation study gives a first indication that the policies also perform well in stochastic systems, (c) Our approach specifies a "tailored" admission region for any given sequencing policy. Such joint admission and sequencing control is "robust" in the following sense: system performance is relatively insensitive to the particular choice of sequencing rule when used in conjunction with tailored admission control. As an example, we discuss the tailored admission regions for two well-known sequencing policies: Generalized Processor Sharing and Generalized Longest Queue.  (d) While we first focus on the multi-product single server system, we do extend to networks and identify some subtleties.

. 6(1): 23-40.A delay-sensitive customer prefers arriving for service when few or no other customers are in the system.  We consider how such a customer should strategically arrive to a service system.  We present a model in which strategic customers acting in a self-interested fashion give rise to Poisson arrivals.
Van Mieghem, Jan A.. 2004. Commonality Strategies: Value Drivers and Equivalence with Flexible Capacity and Inventory Substitution. Management Science. 50(3): 419-424.Commonality strategies assemble different products from at least one common component and one other product-specific component. The distinguishing feature of commonality, i.e., the presence of dedicated components to be assembled with a common component, is shown to be mathematically inconsequential in the sense that the unified commonality problem for two products can be reduced to an equivalent substitution flexibility problem without those dedicated components. This significant simplification provides the first general, closed-form condition for commonality adoption and identifies its value drivers. Commonality is optimal even for perfectly correlated demands if products have sufficiently different margins. This introduces the "revenue maximization option" of commonality as a second benefit that is independent of the traditional risk pooling benefit. "Pure commonality" strategies are never optimal unless complexity costs are introduced. Dual sourcing, externalities and operational hedging features of commonality are discussed.
Van Mieghem, Jan A.. 2003. Capacity Management, Investment and Hedging: Review and Recent Developments. Manufacturing & Service Operations Management (M&SOM)
. 5(4): 269-302.This article reviews the literature on strategic capacity management concerned with determining the sizes, types, and timing of capacity investments and adjustments under uncertainty. Specific attention is given to recent developments to incorporate multiple decision makers, multiple capacity types, hedging and risk aversion. Capacity is a measure of processing abilities and limitations and is represented as a vector of stocks of various processing resources, while investment is the change of capacity and includes expansion and contraction. After discussing general issues in capacity investment problems, the article reviews models of capacity investment under uncertainty in three settings:  The first reviews optimal capacity investment by single and multiple risk-neutral decision makers in a stationary environment where capacity remains constant. Allowing for multiple capacity types, the associated optimal capacity portfolio specifies the amounts and locations of safety capacity in a processing network. Its key feature is that it is unbalanced, i.e., regardless of how uncertainties are realized, one typically will never fully utilize all capacities. The second setting reviews the adjustment of capacity over time and the structure of optimal investment dynamics. The article ends by reviewing how to incorporate risk-aversion in capacity investment and contrasts hedging strategies involving financial versus operational means.
Van Mieghem, Jan A.. 2003. Due Date Scheduling:  Asymptotic Optimality of Generalized Longest-Queue and Generalized Largest Delay Rules. Operations Research. 51(1): 113-122.Consider the following due-date scheduling problem in a multiclass, acyclic, single-station service system: any class k job arriving at time t must be served by its due date. Equivalently, its delay must not exceed a given delay or lead-time D_{k}. In a stochastic system the constraint must be interpreted in a probabilistic sense. Regardless of the precise probabilistic formulation, however, the associated optimal control problem is intractable with exact analysis. This article proposes a new formulation that incorporates the constraint through a sequence of convex-increasing delay cost functions. This formulation reduces the intractable optimal scheduling problem into one for which the Generalized (Gc rule) scheduling rule is known to be asymptotically optimal. The Gc rule simplifies here to a generalized longest queue (GLQ) or generalized largest delay (GLD) rule, which are defined as follows.
Van Mieghem, Jan A. and Nils Rudi. 2002. Newsvendor Networks: Inventory Management and Capacity Investment with Discretionary Activities. Manufacturing & Service Operations Management (M&SOM)
. 4(4): 313-335.We introduce a class of models, called newsvendor networks, that generalizes the well-known newsven-  dor model along three dimensions. Newsvendor networks model the flow of multiple products through multiple processing and storage points over multiple time periods. Such models provide a parsimonious framework to study various problems of stochastic capacity investment and inventory procurement.  Newsvendor networks can feature commonality, flexibility, substitution or transshipment in addition to assembly and distribution. Newsvendor networks are stochastic models with recourse that are characterized by linear revenue and cost structures and a linear input-output transformation. While capacity  and inventory decisions are locked in before demand uncertainty is resolved as usual, some managerial discretion can remain via ex-post input-output activity decisions. This discretion is captured through non-basic activities that model input- or resource-substitution and that result in subtle pooling effects.  Non-basic activities are never used in a deterministic environment; their value stems from the discre-  tionary flexibility to meet stochastic demand deviations from the operating point.  The optimal capacity and inventory decisions balance overages with underages. Continuing the classic newsvendor analogy, the optimal balancing conditions can be interpreted as specifying multiple "critical  fractiles" of the multivariate demand distribution. This paper shows that the properties of optimal single-period newsvendor network solutions extend to a dynamic setting under plausible conditions. Indeed, we  establishes dynamic optimality of inventory and capacity policies for the lost sales case. Depending on the non-basic activities, this also extends to the backordering case. Analytic and simulation-based solution techniques and graphical interpretations are presented and illustrated by a comprehensive example that  features input substitution and a flexible processing resource.
Van Mieghem, Jan A. and Piet Van Mieghem. 2002. Price-coupled Scheduling for Differentiated Services:  GC-mu vs. GPS. International Journal of Communication Systems. 15(5): 429-452.We present an integrated approach to pricing and scheduling for services that are differentiated in terms of throughput, delay and loss specifications. The key building block to the model are quality value curves that specify a user's value of higher quality levels. From the analysis emerges a pricing rule that charges based on rate and quality grade, and a dynamic scheduling rule, called the Gc-mu rule. The analysis also derives the economically optimal probabilistic QoS guarantee parameters. We compare our model to the deterministic approach of QoS guarantees using burstiness constraints and fair scheduling rules. The scheduling that arises from such deterministic approach is the well-known Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS). A comparative analysis inspires the fair Gc-mu-PS rule as the scheduling rule that combines the unique strengths of GPS and Gc-mu. This Gc-mu-PS rule is proposed as a tailored scheduling solution for both the Expedited Forwarding class and the four Assured Forwarding classes in the IETF's Differentiated Services.
Van Mieghem, Jan A.. 2000. Price and Service Discrimination in Queuing Systems: Incentive Compatibility of Gcmu Scheduling. Management Science. 46(9): 1249-1267.This article studies the optimal prices and service quality grades that a queuing system the firm provides to heterogeneous, utility-maximizing customers who measure quality  by their experienced delay distributions. Results are threefold: First, delay cost curves are introduced that allow for a flexible description of a customer's quality sensitivity. Second, a  comprehensive executable approach is proposed that analytically specifies scheduling, delay  distributions and prices for arbitrary delay sensitivity curves. The tractability of this approach derives from porting heavy-traffic Brownian results into the economic analysis. The generalized c/.t (Gc^t) scheduling rule that emerges is dynamic so that, in general, service grades need not correspond to a static priority ranking. A benchmarking example investigates the value of differentiated service. Third, the notions of grade and rate incentive compatibility (1C) are introduced to study this system under asymmetric information and are established for GC scheduling when service times are homogeneous and customers atomistic. Grade 1C induces correct grade choice resulting in perfect service discrimination; rate 1C additionally induces  centralized-optimal rates. Dynamic GC scheduling exhibits negative feedback that, together  with time-dependent pricing, can also yield rate incentive compatibility with heterogeneous  service times. Finally, multiplan pricing, which offers all customers a menu with a choice of  multiple rate plans, is analyzed.
Chopra, Sunil and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 2000. Which e-business is Right for Your Supply Chain?. Supply Chain Management Review.The Internet is revolutionizing the way companies conduct business. Or is it? We argue that the value of the internet for a firm is strongly dependent on the firm's industry and on the strategy it pursues. A survey of firms with an online presence displays wide disparities in performance. while Dell has succesfully used the internet to boost revenues and earnings, Amazon lost $585 million on revenues of $1.6 billion in 1999. Firms that fully exploit the revenue enhancements and cost reduction opportunities offered by the interent and optimally integrate e-business with existing channels are likely to be the big winners in the internet age.
Van Mieghem, Jan A. and Maqbool Dada. 1999. Price Versus Production Postponement:  Capacity and Competition. Management Science. 45(12): 1631-1649.This article presents a comparative analysis of possible postponement strategies in a two-stage decision model where firms make three decisions: capacity investment, production (inventory) quantity, and price. Typically, investments are made while the demand curve is uncertain. The strategies differ in the timing of the operational decisions relative to the realization of uncertainty. We show how competition, uncertainty, and the timing of operational decisions influence the strategic investment decision of the firm and its value. In contrast to production postponement, price postponement makes the investment and production (inventory) decisions relatively insensitive to uncertainty. This suggests that managers can make optimal capacity decisions by deterministic reasoning if they have some price flexibility. Under price postponement, additional postponement of production has relatively small incremental value. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to consider flexible ex-post pricing before production postponement reengineering. While more postponement increases firm value, it is counterintuitive that this also makes the optimal capacity decision more sensitive to uncertainty. We highlight the different impact of more timely information, which leads to higher investment and inventories, and of reduced demand uncertainty, which decreases investment and inventories. Our analysis suggests appropriateness conditions for simple make-to-stock and make-to-order strategies. We also present technical sufficiency and uniqueness conditions. Under price postponement, these results extend to oligopolistic and perfect competition for which pure equilibria are derived. Interestingly, the relative value of operational postponement techniques seems to increase as the industry becomes more competitive.
Van Mieghem, Jan A.. 1999. Coordinating Investment, Production and Subcontracting. Management Science. 45(7): 954-971.We value the option of subcontracting to improve financial performance and system coordination by analyzing a competitive stochastic investment game with recourse. The manufacturer and subcontractor decide separately on their capacity investment levels. Then demand uncertainty is resolved and both parties have the option to subcontract when deciding on their production and sales. We analyze and present outsourcing conditions for three contract types: (1) price-only contracts where an ex-ante transfer price is set for each unit supplied by the subcontractor; (2) incomplete contracts, where both parties negotiate over the subcontracting transfer; and (3) state-dependent price-only and incomplete contracts for which we show an equivalence result. While subcontracting with these three contract types can coordinate production decisions in the supply system, only state-dependent contracts can eliminate all decentralization costs and coordinate capacity investment decisions. The minimally sufficient price-only contract that  coordinates our supply chain specifies transfer prices for a small number (6 in our model) of contingent scenarios. Our game-theoretic model allows the analysis of the role of transfer prices and of the bargaining power of buyer and supplier. We find that sometimes firms may be better off leaving some contract parameters unspecified ex-ante and agreeing to negotiate ex-post. Also, a price-focused strategy for managing subcontractors can backfire because a lower transfer price may decrease the manufacturer's profit. Finally, as with financial options, the option value of subcontracting increases as markets are more volatile or more negatively correlated.
Harrison, J.Michael and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 1999. Multi-Resource Investment Strategies:  Operational Hedging under Demand Uncertainty. European Journal of Operational Research. 113(1): 17-29.Consider a firm that markets multiple products, each manufactured using several resources representing various types of capital and labor, and a linear production technology. The firm faces uncertain product demand and has the option to dynamically readjust its resource investment levels, thereby changing the capacities of its linear manufacturing process. The cost to adjust a resource level either up or down is assumed  to be linear. The model developed here explicitly incorporates both capacity investment decisions and production decisions, and is general enough to include reversible and irreversible investment. The product demand vectors for successive periods are assumed to be independent and identically distributed. The optimal investment strategy is determined with a multi-dimensional newsvendor model using demand distributions, a technology matrix, prices (product contribution margins), and marginal investment costs. Our analysis highlights an important conceptual distinction between determin-  istic and stochastic environments: the optimal investment strategy in our stochastic model typically involves some degree of capacity imbalance which can never be optimal  when demand is known.
Van Mieghem, Jan A.. 1998. Investment Strategies for Flexible Resources. Management Science. 44(8): 1071-1078.This article studies optimal investment in flexible manufacturing capacity as a function of  product prices (margins), investment costs and multivariate demand uncertainty. We consider a two-product firm that has the option to invest in product-dedicated resources and/or in  a flexible resource that can produce either product, but has to make its investment decision  before demands are observed. The flexible resource provides the firm with a hedge against  demand uncertainty, but at a higher investment cost than the dedicated resources. Our analysis  highlights the important role of price (margin) and cost mix differentials, which, in addition to  the correlation between product demands, significantly affect the investment decision and the value of flexibility. Contrary to the intuition also prevalent in the academic literature, we show that it can be advantageous to invest in flexible resources even with erfectly positively correlated product demands.
Harrison, J.Michael and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 1997. Dynamic Control of Brownian Networks:  State Space Collapse and Equivalent Workload Formulations. Annals of Applied Probability. 7(3): 747-771.Brownian networks are a class of linear stochastic control systems that arise as heavy traffic approximations in queueing theory. Such Brownian system models have been used to approximate problems of dynamic routing, dynamic sequencing and dynamic input control for queueing networks. A number of specific examples have been analyzed in recent years, and in each case the Brownian network has been successfully reduced to an "equivalent workload formulation" of lower dimension. In this article we explain that reduction in general terms, using an orthogonal decomposition that distinguishes between reversible and irreversible controls.
Eberly, Janice C. and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 1997. Multifactor Dynamic Investment Under Uncertainty. Journal of Economic Theory. 75(8): 345-387.We characterize a firm's optimal factor adjustment when any number of factors faced "kinked" linear adjustment costs so that all factor accumulation is costly to reverse. We first consider a general non-stationary case with a concave operating profit function, unrestricted form of uncertainty and a horizon of arbitrary length. We show that the optimal investment strategy follows a control limit policy at each point in time. The state space of the firm's problem is partitioned into various domains, including a continuation region where no adjustment shoudl optimally be made to factor levels. We then consider two specific model classes and exploit their special structure to derive expressions for their continuation regions.Van Mieghem, Jan A.. 1995. Dynamic Scheduling with Convex Delay Costs:  The Generalized c-mu Rule. Annals of Applied Probability. 5(3): 809-833.We consider a general single-server multiclass queueing system that incurs a delay cost Csubk/sub(tsubk/sub) for each class k job that resides tsubk/sub units of time in the system. This paper derives a scheduling policy that minimizes the total cumulative delay cost when the system operates during a finite time horizon. Denote the marginal delay cost function and the (possibly nonstationary) average processing time of class k. We call the scheduling policy that at time t serves the oldest waiting job of that class k with the highest index, the generalized "c" rule. As a dynamic priority rule that depends on very little data, the generalized "c" rule is attractive to implement. We show that, with nondecreasing convex delay costs, the generalized "c" rule is asymptotically optimal if the system operates in heavy traffic and give explicit expressions for the associated performance characteristics: the delay (throughput time) process and the minimum cumulative delay cost. The optimality result is robust in that it holds for a countable number of classes and several homogeneous servers in a nonstationary, deterministic or stochastic environment where arrival and service processes can be general and interdependent.

IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. 17(4): 418-431.This paper addresses a correlation based nearest neighbor pattern recognition problem where each class is given as a collection of subclass templates. The recognition is performed in two stages. In the first stage the class is determined. Templates for this stage are created using the subclass templates. Assignment into subclasses occurs in the second stage. This two stage approach may be used to accelerate template matching. In particular, the second stage may be omitted when only the class needs to be determined. The authors present a method for optimal aggregation of subclass templates into class templates. For each class, the new template is optimal in that it maximizes the worst case (i.e. minimum) correlation with its subclass templates. An algorithm which solves this maximin optimization problem is presented and its correctness is proved. In addition, test results are provided, indicating that the algorithm's execution time is polynomial in the number of subclass templates. The authors show tight bounds on the maximin correlation. The bounds are functions only of the number of original subclass templates and the minimum element in their correlation matrix. The algorithm is demonstrated on a multifont optical character recognition problem

Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation. 6(1): 59-68.In this paper we present a new algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of the parameter extraction of straight lines in a two-dimensional image. The algorithm achieves high accuracy in comparatively less computational time than most traditional methods and is invariant under rotation and translation. The Iterative Total Least Squares (ITLS) method starts from an initial estimate of the line parameters. When no a priori information about the image is available this estimate can be assigned randomly. Alternately, a lower accuracy method can be used to generate an initial estimate which will result in faster convergence. Then, a rectangular window is centered using the current line approximation, and a new line estimate is generated by making a total least squares fit through the pixels contained within the window. This is repeated until convergence is reached. Adaptively adjusting the window size yields the 4D ITLS process. In addition, a pairwise accelerated ITLS method has been developed which substantially increases the convergence rate. We conclude with some examples where the ITLS method has been used successfully.
Schwerer, Elizabeth and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 1994. Brownian Models of Closed Queueing Networks: Explicit Solutions for Balanced Three-Station Systems. Annals of Applied Probability. 4(2): 448-477.We study a closed, three-station queueing network with general service time distributions and balanced workloads (that is, each station has the same relative traffic intensity). If the customer population is large, then the queue length process of such a network can be approximated by driftless reflected Brownian motion (RBM) in a simplex. Building on earlier work by Harrison, Landau ands Shepp, we develop explicit formulas for various quantities associated with the stationary distribution of RBM in a general triangle and use them to derive approximate performance measures for the closed queueing network. In particular, we develop approximations for the throughput rate and for moments and tail fractiles of the throughput time distribution. Also, crude bounds on the throughput rate and mean throughput time are proposed. Finally, we present three examples that test the accuracy of both the Brownian approximation and our performance estimates.

Working PapersSun, Jiankun and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 2017. Robust Dual Sourcing Inventory Management: Optimality of Capped Dual Index Policies.We provide closed-form solutions to a robust optimization model for inventory management with two supply sources or modes with general lead times. The fast source is more expensive than the slow source. While the optimal stochastic policy for non-consecutive lead times has been unknown for over 50 years, we prove that the optimal robust policy is a dual index, dual base-stock policy that constrains or ``caps'' the slow order. Optimality is established in a rolling horizon model that can accommodate non-stationary demand. As the lead time difference grows, the capped dual index policy increasingly smoothes slow orders and, for stationary demand, converges to the tailored base surge policy, which places a constant slow order and has been shown to be asymptotically optimal. In an extensive simulation study, the capped dual index policy performs as well as, and can even outperform, the best heuristics presented in the stochastic inventory literature.

Platform Flexibility Strategies: Investment versus Customization Tradeoff.Product platforms are flexible assets that facilitate cost-efficient product variety. How much investment in platform flexibility is desirable? We study the platform flexibility investment decision: when is it better to develop low-end or high-end platforms (aligned with the functional- ities of a specific product), or to invest in middle-end platforms with cheaper low- and high-end customization, or in ultimate platforms that cover the functionalities of the entire product range at negligible customization? Or is a portfolio of these platforms better? We present a mathemat- ical model of the platform portfolio flexibility decision where each platform comes with its own fixed investment and variable customization cost. We characterize the optimal strategy using an investment-customization tradeoff curve and value the economies of scale and scope embedded in platforms via comparative statics of investment and customization costs, as well as the mean and covariances of the demand forecast.
Kejia, Hu, Jason Acimovic, Francisco Erize, Doug Thomas and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 2017. Forecasting Product Life Cycle Curves: Practical Approach and Empirical Analysis.We present an approach to forecast customer orders of ready-to-launch new products that are similar to past products. The approach fits product life cycle (PLC) curves to historical customer order data, clusters the curves of similar products, and uses the representative curve of the new product's cluster to generate its forecast. 

We propose three families of curves to fit the PLC: Bass diffusion curves, polynomial curves and simple piecewise-linear curves (triangles and trapezoids). Using a large data set of customer orders for 4,037,826 units of 170 Dell computer products sold over three years, we compare goodness-of-fit and complexity for these families of curves. Fourth-order polynomial curves provide the best fit with piecewise-linear curves a close second. Using a trapezoidal fit, we find that the PLCs in our data have very short maturity stages; more than 20% have no maturity stage and are best fit by a triangle. 

The fitted PLC curves of similar products are clustered either by known product characteristics or by data-driven clustering. Our key empirical finding is that data-driven clustering of simple triangles and trapezoids, which are simple-to-estimate and explain, performs best for forecasting. Our conservative out-of-sample forecast evaluation, using data-driven clustering of triangles and trapezoids, results in mean absolute errors approximately 3-4% below Dell's forecasts. We also apply our method to a second data set of a smaller company and find consistent results.

In The Palgrave Encyclopedia of Strategic Management, edited by David Teece and Mie Augier, Springer.Strategy and operations are inextricably connected: strategy is a plan to reach an objective and operations is the means of getting there. Operations management involves the planning and coordination of work. Strategically, this involves the long-term planning and structuring of work. Indeed, the task of operations strategy is to design the operating system, which is the joint configuration of resources and processes, such that its resulting competencies are aligned with the organization’s desired competitive position. Tactically, the task of operations management is to utilize the operating system and provide the best match of supply with demand.

Case 5-310-511 (KEL571).HP sells configure-to-order products. With millions of part combinations going into an order, the challenge is deciding which parts to keep in the portfolio to balance costs with revenues. The case explains how one would approach this problem before product introduction, but focuses on managing the existing portfolio.
Van Mieghem, Jan A. and Gad Allon. 2011. The Mexico-China Dual Sourcing Strategy Simulation. Case 1-212-500.This team-based simulation teaches students how to make strategic and operational decisions about sourcing. Students play the role of sourcing managers who must make strategic allocation decisions as they place day-to-day orders with two suppliers—one that is responsive but expensive (Mexico) and another that is cheaper but more remote (China). Each team must develop a sourcing strategy that will satisfy a random level of demand that is revealed over time. In each period teams place orders with both suppliers while managing inventory and attempting to maximize their bank account. Students experience the operational, financial, and service-related consequences of their sourcing decisions, and instructors have access to the strategies used by different teams along with financial and operational metrics to use as part of the debrief.
Allon, Gad and Jan A. Van Mieghem. 2010. Lean Transformation at Global Connect. Case 5-310-504 (KEL633).Global Connect, a major telecommunications service provider, partners with national cable providers to bundle media and telecom services offered through voice over Internet protocol (VoIP). Global Connect provides the VoIP physical infrastructure that enables cable providers to offer VoIP phone service to their end customers. VoIP cable services are growing at a faster rate than anticipated, leaving Global Connect incapable of meeting contractual agreements with the cable partners and preventing them from capturing substantial VoIP market opportunities. Students are asked to improve the configuration of work at this service organization by identifying the types of waste in the current process. Process improvements use lean tools and their impact is quantified using time and capacity analysis. 

 
								



Teaching Interests
Product, service and supply chain operations with specific interest to link strategy and execution.

Full-Time / Evening & Weekend MBAOperations Strategy (OPNS-454-0) In this course, students learn how operations strategy can add value by tailoring a set of core principles to a specific business setting. The course provides a framework to formulate an operations strategy and analyze, value, and optimize the key decisions involved in operations strategy. The key evaluation metric is how operations strategy impacts the net present value of the firm. The key decisions studied are choosing competitive operational competencies and benchmarking; capacity expansion, timing, flexibility and location; sourcing and contracting; risk management and operational hedging; revenue management; improvement and learning.  
This course builds on the core operations class. Students should also be familiar with the basics of finance, economics and strategy, as the strategic decisions studied in this course require a detailed analysis and understanding of the underlying operations. Thus this course has a greater amount of concreteness and detail than a competitive strategy class, and uses a combination of in-depth case analysis, mini-lectures, presentations and qualitative discussions of other examples. The course is intended for students interested in operations and supply chain management, general management, or management consulting.DoctoralFoundations of Operations Management (OPNS-521-0) This course will introduce PhD students to academic research of operations management.  As such, we will survey a broad array of “research content” (basic models and approaches in the literature) as well as discuss the “process of conducting research” (how to write a paper and deliver a talk).Executive MBAOperations Management (OPNSX-430-0) Operations Management examines the basic principles of managing the production and distribution of goods and services. The course approaches operations as a managerial integration function and provides frameworks and tools to target and implement improvements in business processes.Strategic Decisions in Operations (OPNSX-454-0) This course builds on the core operations management class with an emphasis on strategic level decisions. It emphasizes the long-term, "big" decisions firms face in structuring their operations. Topics covered range from evaluating flexible technologies to designing supply chains.Executive EducationExecutive Development Program For top-performing, high-potential middle and senior managers, this intensive, collaborative and empowering executive development program delivers the knowledge, tools and frameworks required to succeed and lead with confidence in a general management role.View ProgramOperations Management Week This sequential combination of two programs — The Science of Lean Operations and Supply Chain Management — provides an executive-level learning experience focused on the same innovative operations management approach taught in Kellogg’s world-class MBA programs.

Faculty and ResearchThe Kellogg School faculty is an esteemed group of scholars and practitioners, and members provide a rich source of international experience in professional management problems and practices. Faculty members combine real-world and academic knowledge of management problems to augment their theoretical training. Senior faculty members also teach courses to senior executives through the Kellogg School’s executive programs. This approach reinforces faculty research and keeps faculty members abreast of changes in corporate practices. All Kellogg School courses combine theory and practice. Teaching methods include case study, field study, seminars, simulations, and independent work. Faculty members choose the method most appropriate to the material and their individual styles. Research is a vital component of Kellogg’s program, and faculty members have developed groundbreaking theories in many academic fields, such as marketing, banking, strategy, and game theory. There are several research centers, on topics ranging from dispute resolution to banking. Several scholarly journals are edited at Kellogg, two of which—the Journal of Economics and Management Strategy and Games and Economic Behavior—were founded here. The Journal of Financial Intermediation was also founded at Kellogg.
