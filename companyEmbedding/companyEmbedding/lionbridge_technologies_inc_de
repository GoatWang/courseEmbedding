Translation and Localization Services









Neural Machine Translation: What It Is, And How It Impacts Translation Efficiency


A new and more accurate translation method, Neural MT, is changing the game for multilingual communication. View this webinar to understand how Lionbridge is increasing translation and localization efficiency—so you can focus on communicating with customers faster.


View Webinar









Engaging and supporting your customers, suppliers, and employees across all languages is a huge undertaking. Offload translation and localization tasks with high-quality, efficient solutions—and focus on your critical business initiatives.






Enterprise localization services and solutions
Whether you need to reach consumers worldwide, communicate internally with a global workforce, or collaborate with international partners, translation and localization services are a critical element of your strategy. But the translation process can be nuanced and labor intensive.
If you’re looking for a fully outsourced solution, use onDemand Translation  for accurate, culturally-relevant translations. A self-service, cloud-based delivery model, onDemand saves you time and money without sacrificing quality or customer service.
Or, if your organization has the resources to oversee the translation and localization process directly, use our suite of managed language services for a customized, hands-on approach.
Either way, working with Lionbridge can be a smart solution. Our efficiencies of scale will keep costs in check. We have the global presence, technology, and language and cultural expertise to help you reach, engage, and support customers around the world.

Lionbridge complies with the applicable laws and regulations protecting the privacy of Personal Data in the jurisdictions in which Lionbridge operates.








Website Terms of Use
Personal Data (Legal)
Privacy Policy
Secure Data
Lionbridge Cookie Policy


Lionbridge Technologies, Inc.

Global Personal Data Privacy Policy
Overview:
Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. (“Lionbridge”) recognizes and supports the need for reasonable protections regarding the privacy of the personally identifiable information of Personnel and Business Contacts collected by or through Lionbridge, including any such information that is contained in materials provided to Lionbridge for the purpose of obtaining translation, testing or other commercial services. For this reason, Lionbridge has developed and adopted this policy (“Policy”) regarding the protection of personally identifiable information of Personnel and Business Contacts (hereinafter referred to as “Personal Data”). This Policy applies to all Personal Data that is processed by Lionbridge or its subsidiary companies. In addition, all Personnel and Agents working on behalf of Lionbridge whose responsibilities include the processing (e.g. collection or storage) of Personal Data are expected to assist in the protection of that Personal Data by adherence to this Policy, even if local law is less restrictive.

In adopting and complying with this Policy, Lionbridge complies with the applicable laws and regulations protecting the privacy of Personal Data in the jurisdictions in which Lionbridge or its subsidiary companies operate. Where appropriate, laws within specific jurisdictions may require supplemental terms to comply with local laws.
Scope:
PRIVACY PRINCIPLES

This Policy applies to Personal Data about Data Subjects that is Processed by Lionbridge in the course of daily business activity. Nothing in this Policy is intended to form a contract of employment or otherwise.

In furtherance of its commitment to privacy compliance, Lionbridge has executed the EU and Swiss Model Clauses with respect to EEA and Swiss human resource personal data (e.g. data pertaining to employees or temporary workers of Lionbridge or of Lionbridge’s customers or prospective customers) Processed as part of its Human Resources activities, and with respect to EEA and Swiss business contact information (e.g., name, business address, telephone, email address and other social media based contact information) Processed as part of its commercial activities or in connection with services delivered to the Business Contact.


Policy:
GLOBAL POLICY PRINCIPLES

    1. Processing and Notice
    
    Lionbridge Processes Personal Data in a reasonable and lawful manner for relevant and appropriate purposes. Lionbridge notifies all identified Data Subjects regarding the types of Personal Data collected and its intended uses. Lionbridge provides this notice pursuant to this Policy and when Lionbridge collects Personal Data, as well as when Personal Data is Processed for a purpose other than originally or later authorized. Lionbridge does not use Personal Data obtained from Data Subjects for purposes that are incompatible with those purposes stated in Lionbridge notices to Data Subjects.

    From time to time, Lionbridge may analyze or utilize data derived from Data Subjects in an anonymous manner, such that the names of the Data Subjects are not known by data processors within Lionbridge. In these cases, Data Subjects do not need to be notified.

Types of Data Collected

    Lionbridge Processes Personal Data about Personnel which may include but not be limited to the following types of Personal Data: Details about education and training, employment, family, financial matters, personal matters, physical or mental health conditions; racial or ethnic origin; religious or other beliefs of a similar nature; business contact information. As described further below, it is necessary for Lionbridge to Process these types of Personal Data in order to provide insurance and benefits coverage to Personnel and their families as well as to comply with terms of particular customer engagements which require information on workforce composition. The Personal Data relates to all Personnel, as well as relatives and associates of the Data Subject, to the extent that such information is provided to Lionbridge by Personnel. For Contractors and directors, such Personal Data may include business contact data and information necessary for Lionbridge to pay such Contractors and directors for rendered services.

    Lionbridge Processes Personal Data about Business Contacts which may include but not be limited to the following types of Personal Data: name, title, and general business contact information (including business address, telephone, email address and other social media based contact information). As described further below, it is necessary for Lionbridge to Process these types of Personal Data in order to provide services to its Business Contacts and to Process customer materials that may be embedded with Personal Data. The Personal Data relates to all Business Contacts to the extent such information is provided to Lionbridge by the Business Contact or to the extent such information is embedded in materials that are provided to Lionbridge by the Business Contact.

Purposes For Which Personal Data May Be Processed

    Lionbridge Processes such Personnel Personal Data for activities associated with the management of Human Resources including but not limited to recruitment, work planning and management, appraisal, promotion, training, career development, remuneration and other benefits, health and safety, life, health, and medical insurance, administration of defined benefit (401(d) or pension) plans, succession planning and talent management initiatives, disciplinary procedures, compliance with legislation and company policy, transfer, redeployment, references, audit, corporate and business reorganizations, administrative and security functions and any other Human Resources-related activities. For Contractors and directors, Lionbridge Processes Personal Data for activities associated with the provision of services provided by such Contractors and directors to Lionbridge, and the payment for such services.

    Lionbridge Processes such Business Contact Personal Data for activities associated with the procurement and performance of its business activities including but limited to translation, testing, localization, content development and interpretation services.
    

2. Choice
    

Lionbridge gives each Data Subject the opportunity to opt out from (i) allowing Lionbridge to disclose his or her Personal Data to a Third Party unless the disclosure is required by law or for the fulfillment of a contractual obligation (e. g. employment contract) and (ii) allowing Lionbridge to Process Personal Data for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by the Data Subject.

    Personnel can ask questions and effectuate his or her opt-out as applicable, by sending an email to the local HR Representative, or other applicable contact person designated by Lionbridge, or by accessing the appropriate system, as applicable. Business Contacts can ask questions and effectuate his or her opt-out as applicable by sending an email to the applicable business contact at Lionbridge, other applicable contact person designated by Lionbridge, or by accessing the appropriate system.

    With regard to Personal Data that Lionbridge receives in connection with the employment or business relationship, Lionbridge will use such Personal Data only for the purpose for which it was originally collected. If Lionbridge intends to disclose Personnel Personal Data to a Third Party for any purpose other than its original purpose, Lionbridge will provide the Personnel or Business Contact with an opportunity to opt-out of such uses.

    Prior to disclosing Sensitive Data to a Third Party or processing Sensitive Data for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by the Data Subject, Lionbridge will obtain each Data Subject’s explicit consent (opt-in consent).

    Where consent of the Data Subject or a representative of Data Subject for the Processing (mainly collection, use, or disclosure) of Personal Data is required by law or contract, Lionbridge will comply with the law or contract.


    3. Onward Transfer (Transfers to Third Parties)
    

    Lionbridge does not transfer Personal Data provided by Personnel or Business Contacts to Agents or Third Parties unless those Parties commit to provide that Personal Data, at a minimum, with the equivalent level of protection that Lionbridge provides and to refrain from uses or disclosures that are not authorized by Lionbridge. Where local law requires a (written) agreement for the transfer of Personal Data to a Third Party, Lionbridge complies with local law.

    Prior to making Personal Data available to any Agent or Third Party, Lionbridge will first ascertain that the Agents and Third Parties provide sufficient protection of the Personal Data. Specifically, Lionbridge will determine if the Agent or Third Party either subscribes to or complies with this Policy or is subject to the EU Data Protection Directive or another adequacy finding. This requirement may also be satisfied if the Agent or Third Party enters into a written agreement requiring that it provide the same level of privacy protection as required by the relevant Policy Principles articulated in this Policy.

    Disclosure of Personal Data beyond the Personnel or Agents of Lionbridge may be made pursuant to an agreement, for a legitimate business need, as required by law or legal process or for another lawful purpose (e.g. cooperation with local law enforcement authorities).


  4. Security
    

    Lionbridge takes reasonable precautions to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, and from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These precautions include password protections for online information systems and restricted access to Personal Data. Lionbridge may assign different types of data different security levels, with appropriate corresponding security precautions. To the extent feasible, Lionbridge restricts access to Personal Data to those Personnel or Agents of Lionbridge that have a legitimate business need for such access.


    5. Data Integrity
    

    Lionbridge takes reasonable steps to ensure that all applicable Personal Data is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use. All Personnel should help Lionbridge meet this objective by updating their information immediately in the event that Personal Data changes, either by notifying the local HR Representative, or other applicable contact person designated by Lionbridge, or updating the information themselves, if applicable. To the extent feasible, Lionbridge restricts access to Personal Data to those Personnel or Agents of Lionbridge that have a legitimate business need for such access.


    6. Access
    

    Lionbridge will provide Data Subjects with reasonable access to the Personal Data they have provided to Lionbridge and, when appropriate, will allow Data Subjects to review and correct this Personal Data as required by law or by Lionbridge policies. Access by Data Subjects to review this Personal Data will be granted except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Personnel’s privacy or where the rights of others would be violated.


   7. Enforcement
    

    All Personnel whose responsibilities include the Processing of Personal Data are required to adhere to this Policy. Adherence to this Policy will be audited periodically by appropriate resources. Failure to comply with this Policy may be grounds for discipline up to and including termination.

Self-Assessment

    Lionbridge conducts a periodic assessment in order to verify that this Policy is published, accurate, comprehensive, prominently displayed, implemented, accessible and conforms to the principles of the EU Data Directive. Lionbridge maintains procedures for training Personnel in the implementation of the Policy and has in place internal procedures for periodically conducting objective reviews of compliance.

Complaints

    Any Personnel who feels that Lionbridge is not abiding by this Policy or the principles of the EU Data Directive may contact his or her local HR Representative, or other applicable contact person designated by Lionbridge, in order to register complaints, submit access requests, or address any other issues arising under this Policy. Any Business Contact who feels that Lionbridge is not abiding by this Policy or the principles of the EU Data Directive may contact his or her Lionbridge business contact, or other applicable contact person designated by Lionbridge, in order to register complaints, submit access requests, or address any other issues arising under this Policy. Alternatively, any Data Subject may report concerns confidentially and anonymously through the Convercent Anonymous Hotline (see contact information below). The Convercent Anonymous Hotline will address inquiries and disputes that are not addressed by the applicable contact person designated by Lionbridge.



    All complaints and requests submitted pursuant to this Policy will be reviewed promptly. In the event complaints cannot be resolved through the applicable contact person designated by Lionbridge, the complaint must be referred to the General Counsel of Lionbridge. In the event any Data Subject believes a complaint has not been resolved to his or her satisfaction by Lionbridge through the applicable contact person designated by Lionbridge, or the General Counsel of Lionbridge, it may be referred to the appropriate European Data Protection Authority (“DPA”) for resolution at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/files/ussh/complaint_form_20130206_en.pdf. Lionbridge does not retaliate against any Personnel who registers complaints, submits access requests, or addresses any other issues arising under this Policy.



    Lionbridge agrees to cooperate with the DPA where the DPA takes the view that the organization needs to take specific action to comply with the principles of the EU Data Directive. Lionbridge will provide the DPA with written confirmation that such agreed upon actions have been taken.


    8. Amendment
    

    From time to time, Lionbridge may amend this Policy, should it become necessary to do so. Any changes to this Policy will be communicated to you.


    9. Contact Details

Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. Key Developments

Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. Announces Management Changes
Jul 20 17
Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. announced that, following his successful 21-year tenure as Chief Executive Officer, Rory Cowan, Founder of Lionbridge, will retire as CEO. Mr. Cowan will remain as Chairman of the Lionbridge Board of Directors. The Company also announced that John Fennelly was named President and Chief Executive Officer, effective July 24, 2017. Mr. Fennelly has more than 30 years of industry leadership experience, most recently as CEO of HireRight. To ensure a smooth CEO transition, Cowan will work with Fennelly throughout 2017 and remain closely involved with the business. Rich Tobin, Lionbridge's COO of Global Translation and Marketing Services, and Marc Osofsky, Lionbridge's COO of Global Offerings will continue in their current roles. Clemente Cohen has been appointed as the Company's CFO after the planned departure of Lionbridge's CFO Marc Litz following the Company's transition from a publicly-traded company to a private company.


Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. Introduces GeoFluent for Enterprise Service Management
Jun 26 17
Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. announced the availability of GeoFluent for Enterprise Service Management, an omni-channel translation and interpretation solution that enables organizations to provide multilingual helpdesk and service support without hiring or maintaining bilingual staff. By eliminating language barriers across communications channels, from chat and ticketing to voice and knowledge base, GeoFluent for Enterprise Service Management improves productivity and efficiency, while increasing speed of response and resolution. Lionbridge also introduced GeoFluent for ServiceNow®, a certified integration between its customizable real-time translation solution and ServiceNow Connect and Incident Management. Available in the ServiceNow Store, the pre-built connection enables service management staff to chat and support tickets across more than 100 languages using their existing ServiceNow platform. The GeoFluent platform includes three modules that serve each area of service desks' multilingual service desk and service management needs: GeoFluent Virtual Translator™ adds support for over 100 languages to customers' existing self-service and agent-assisted digital communications platforms, including chat, email and ticketing. GeoFluent Virtual Translator includes an AI-based core that is customized and trained specifically for each client, and ensures multilingual consistency and accuracy across languages, channels and use cases, while understanding the context and unique brand, channel, use case acronyms and terminology. GeoFluent Interpreter™ provides over-the-phone (OPI) interpretation support for more than 350 languages, available 24x7x365. Given the prevalence of voice communications in enterprise service desks, Lionbridge is changing the traditional OPI experience to make voice interactions faster, more efficient, use less client staff time, all while reducing effort. GeoFluent Translate™ provides clients a self-service and secure way to quickly translate virtually any file or document type. GeoFluent for Enterprise Service Management is the newest solution in the GeoFluent platform. In 2016, Lionbridge introduced GeoFluent for Contact Centers solution, a suite of applications and services tailored to meet the real-time, multilingual communications needs of customer care organizations. With today's announcement, Lionbridge is bringing the GeoFluent platform to enterprise service management, helping enterprise helpdesks and service desks solve their unique real-time multilingual communications challenges.


Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Notifies Investors of Class Action against Lionbridge Technologies, Inc
Jun 5 17
Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notified investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased Lionbridge securities on January 27, 2017, in connection with an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 12, 2016, by and among Lionbridge, LBT Acquisition, Inc. and LBT Merger Sub, Inc. under which Lionbridge stockholders received $5.75 per share in cash and Lionbridge became a wholly owned subsidiary of H.I.G. Capital L.L.C. This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Complaint alleges that Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding Lionbridge's prospects and value in order encourage shareholders to accept the Merger. The complaint continues to allege that on January 31, 2017, defendants caused the company to file with the SEC a Definitive Proxy Statement in which the members of the Board recommended that stockholders vote their shares in favor of the Merger Agreement. The Proxy Statement disclosed management projections that contemplated revenue growth over the next several years of less than 3.9% per year. Those projections were allegedly inconsistent with Lionbridge's average revenue growth of about 7% per year from 2011 to 2015, and with the defendants' actual strategic plans for the company. On February 28, 2017, majority of the Lionbridge stockholders voted in favor of the Merger Agreement and later that day the company and HIG completed the Merger.

There is a high level of transparency at Lionbridge - even though there are over 6,000 employees, the company communicates promotions and new hires. In addition, from a culture perspective, there was recently a meditation class (we even had a really fun super bowl party!). The employees here are all very friendly and helpful. Honestly, before I interviewed here, I was taken back by some of the poor reviews; however, I realize now that many of them are from contractors who work part-time from home who do translation work (vs. FT employees of Lionbridge). Lionbridge has brought in some new leaders who are eager to bring change to the company - and the company is hungry for it, too.I wasn't too aware of Lionbridge prior to interviewing here, but now that I'm here, it's a pretty cool company that has grown organically and via acquisition. Lionbridge acquired a digital agency called Darwin no too long ago, which has propelled Lionbridge's digital/emotive marketing area.Lionbridge also offers good flexibility to work from home.ConsNot many that I can think of. The benefits are standard with good time off. Corporate office is very nice, but can be quiet at times.Advice to ManagementContinue to innovate.

Within a week I was invited onsite and met with 5 individuals for 45 minute interviews each. They asked relevant and interesting questions and were open to my questions. The recruiter got back to me within a few days to discuss the interview and an offer came immediately afterwards. It was an organized process all the way through. The recruiter was friendly, helpful, and transparent. The best process I went through in my career search.

A United States government agency -- Ad-Ex would not say which one -- asked the company to bid on a project to translate thousands of ordinary English words and phrases into Arabic, Dari, Pashto, Urdu and Uzbek. The proposal offered scant details, but the director of Ad-Ex, Robert L. Addis, thought he knew its purpose. The words to be translated were conversational, which seemed to rule out any technical, legal, financial or medical focus. And Pashto, Dari and Uzbek are spoken in Afghanistan, and the other languages are common in the region.











                    Technology Briefing | Software: Lernout Sells A Unit                
Lionbridge Technologies will buy the Mendez unit of Lernout & Hauspie, the troubled Belgian speech technology company, for $27 million in cash plus an additional $6 million to pay off Mendez debt. Mendez, a translation services and software provider, had been for sale for months as part of Lernout & Hauspie's bankruptcy restructuring. The unit, which is profitable, has about $80 million in annual revenue and was initially valued at $160 million, but the asking price was lowered repeatedly when few interested buyers appeared. Lionbridge, based in Waltham, Mass., provides multilingual content management systems. It said it would finance the purchase by selling preferred stock to institutional investors. The transaction, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter, is subject to approval by courts in the United States and Belgium. Jennifer 8. Lee (NYT)

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
