 Defense attorneys for accused murderer Michael W. Lister Sr. called their only witness this morning, a forensic psychologist who testified Lister suffers from a personality disorder.
Lister is accused of repeatedly shooting Tracie “Missy” Raisner on Oct. 26, 2008, outside his home in the 300 block of North 10th Street in Easton.
Closing arguments in the trial are expected before noon then the jury will receive the lone murder charge against Lister.
Dr. Gerald Cook testified the personality disorder causes Lister not to recognize when things stress him out or when he is angry.“Basically Michael Lister is a man that does not know when things bother him,” Cook said.But Lister does not meet the criteria of being insane, Cook said.“He did know he did something wrong,” Cook said, referring to Raisner’s death.Cook said Lister is rigid and moralistic in his feelings about himself and others, that he feels he is better than other people and “perceives himself as a good person.”
Lister is also cynical and distrustful, Cook said.
Cook said Lister became angry at Raisner prior to the shooting because she sued him for child support for their son, Anthony.
He was also stressed by his living situation with his common-law wife Carol Lister and girlfriend Christina Murawski.

View full sizeExpress-Times File PhotosMichael Lister Sr., left, was on trial for murdering Tracie Raisner, right, the mother of one of his children.Michael W. Lister Sr. claimed he shot Tracie “Missy” Raisner in self-defense because he felt his life was in danger, but a Northampton County jury determined Lister wanted to kill Raisner.
The jury of seven women and five men convicted Lister of first-degree murder, which carries with it an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole. The jury was out for 40 minutes, but also ate lunch during that time.
President Judge F. P. Kimberly McFadden made no comment from the bench when she sentenced Lister and Anthony Lister, Raisner's son, was not allowed to tell his father "rot in hell" like he wanted.
Anthony Raisner smiled after the conviction was read and cried in his grandmother's arms after leaving the courtroom. 
Lister never took the witness stand in his trial, which began Monday afternoon in Northampton County Court.
Lister’s defense attorneys claimed Lister thought Rainser was carrying a gun on Oct. 26, 2008, when she went to his home in the 300 block of North 10th Street in Easton.
But Prosecutor Kelly Lewis said in her closing argument that Lister was upset with Raisner because she had a new boyfriend and recently sued him for child support for their son, Anthony.“Tracie wasn’t going to let him control her anymore…he was angry with her,” Lewis said. “This is malice. This is ill-will.”Raisner was shot six times and a forensic pathologist testified four of the wounds were fatal shots to her heart, lungs, chest and throat.
Defense attorney Mark Minotti said they never disputed that Lister shot Raisner, but that it was not premeditated or done with malice."You're going to have to focus on state of mind," Minotti said. “If he planned this out he didn’t do a good job.”
