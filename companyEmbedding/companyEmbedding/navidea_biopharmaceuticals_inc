	Navidea Biopharmaceuticals Reports
	First Quarter 2017 Financial Results





	 




	Conference call with investment community to be held tomorrow, May
	10, 2017, at 8:00 a.m. ET




	 




	DUBLIN,
	Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)—May 9, 2017-- Navidea
	Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE MKT: NAVB) (“Navidea” or
	“the Company”), a company focused on the development
	and commercialization of precision immunodiagnostic agents, today
	announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2017.
	Navidea reported total revenue (excluding discontinued operations)
	for the quarter of $580,000. Net income attributable to common
	stockholders was $85.6 million.




	 




	“Navidea
	ended the first quarter with strong momentum built upon the
	strategic plan developed over the past two quarters. Our strategy
	is designed to maximize the value of our proprietary
	macrophage-targeting technology by developing and out-licensing
	promising imaging and therapeutic products,” said Michael
	Goldberg, M.D., Navidea’s President and CEO. Dr. Goldberg
	continued, “Our completed sale of the North American rights
	to Lymphoseek® to Cardinal Health 414, LLC ensures that our
	focus remains on product development going forward. We are
	confident that our Manocept platform, properly developed, will
	yield both diagnostics and therapeutics that can generate
	significant value for our stockholders.”




	 




	Product, Pipeline, and Business Updates




	 




	Lymphoseek®




	 






	●




	On March 3, 2017,
	Navidea completed the sale of the North American rights to
	Lymphoseek® to Cardinal Health 414, receiving approximately
	$82 million at closing.








	●




	Navidea will have
	the opportunity to earn up to $227 million of additional
	consideration through 2026, with $17.1 million guaranteed over the
	next three years.








	●




	As a result of this
	closing, all liens on Navidea’s assets have been released,
	all frozen accounts have been transferred to Navidea’s
	control, and the majority of the loan from Platinum Partners has
	been repaid.










	 




	Manocept Immunodiagnostic Pipeline




	 




	The
	flexible and versatile Manocept platform acts as an engine for the
	design of targeted imaging molecules applicable to a range of
	diagnostic modalities, including single photon emission computed
	tomography (“SPECT”), positron emission tomography
	(“PET”), gamma-scanning (both imaging and topical) and
	intra-operative and/or optical-fluorescence detection. We have
	active clinical diagnostic programs in cardiovascular disease,
	rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposi’s sarcoma and colorectal cancer,
	diseases representing both major macrophage activation
	states.




	 




	Cardiovascular
	Disease – The results of a study to evaluate diagnostic
	imaging of emerging atherosclerosis plaque with Tc 99m tilmanocept
	were published in early release in the

	Journal of Infectious Diseases

	on
	January 16, 2017, confirming that the Tc 99m tilmanocept product
	can both quantitatively and qualitatively target non-calcified
	plaque in the aortic arch.




	 




	Colorectal
	Cancer and Synchronous Liver Metastases – During the first
	quarter of 2017, we initiated an imaging study in subjects with
	colorectal cancer and liver metastases via intravenous
	administration of Tc 99m tilmanocept.




	 




	Manocept Immunotherapeutic Development Pipeline (Macrophage
	Therapeutics)




	 




	Navidea’s
	majority-owned subsidiary, Macrophage Therapeutics, Inc.
	(“MT”), has developed processes for producing the first
	two therapeutic Manocept immunoconstructs consisting of a
	therapeutic molecule conjugated to moieties targeting CD206+
	macrophages:




	 






	1.




	MT-1002, designed
	to specifically target and kill activated CD206+ macrophages by
	delivering doxorubicin; and








	2.




	MT-2002, designed
	to inhibit the inflammatory activity of activated CD206+
	macrophages by delivering a potent anti-inflammatory
	agent.






	 




	In the
	first quarter of 2017, MT completed its third vivo study dosing
	either MT-1002 or MT-2002 in a well-established mouse model of
	nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and
	liver fibrosis, in which both compounds significantly reduced key
	disease parameters.




	 




	Also in
	the first quarter of 2017, we completed a series of predictive in
	vitro screening tests of the MT-1002 and MT-2002 therapeutic
	conjugates against the Zika and Dengue viruses and against
	Leishmaniosis. These evaluations were positive and MT will begin in
	vivo testing in the second or third quarter of 2017.




	 




	Financials




	 




	Our
	consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations have been
	reclassified, as required by current accounting standards, for all
	periods presented to reflect the line of business sold to Cardinal
	Health 414 as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, this
	discussion focuses on describing results of our operations as if we
	had not operated the discontinued operation during the periods
	being disclosed.




	 




	 




	We
	recorded a net gain on the sale to Cardinal Health 414 of $88.7
	million for the first quarter of 2017, including $16.5 in
	guaranteed consideration, which was discounted to the present value
	of future cash flows. The proceeds were offset by $3.3 million in
	estimated fair value of warrants issued to Cardinal Health 414,
	$2.0 million in legal and other fees related to the sale, $800,000
	in net balance sheet dispositions and write-offs, and $4.6 million
	in estimated taxes.




	 




	Total
	revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were $580,000
	compared to $948,000 in the first quarter of last year. Total
	operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 were $3.7 million,
	compared to $4.7 million in the first quarter of last year.
	Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2017
	were $705,000, compared to $2.1 million in the first quarter of
	last year. The net decrease from 2016 to 2017 was primarily a
	result of decreases in NAV4694, Tc 99m tilmanocept and NAV5001
	development costs, offset by increases in Manocept and therapeutics
	development costs, coupled with decreased compensation and related
	support costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for
	the first quarter of 2017 were $3.0 million, compared to $2.6
	million in the first quarter of last year. The net increase was
	primarily due to increased legal and professional services, offset
	by decreased investor relations services, compensation and related
	support costs.




	 




	Navidea’s
	net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter
	ended March 31, 2017 was $85.6 million, or $0.53 per share (basic),
	compared to a net loss of $3.7 million, or $0.02 per share, for the
	same period in 2016.




	 




	Navidea
	ended the quarter with $13.4 million in cash.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

America’s biopharmaceutical companies are driving the future of medicine through bold advances in genomics, personalized medicine and immunotherapy. The new era of genomics provides better understanding of the genes that can cause certain diseases and equips researchers with the tools they need to tailor treatments like never before. Personalized medicines are at the center of this revolution, offering patients individualized therapies unique to each patient. Immunotherapy is transforming cancer care in new ways by harnessing the patient’s immune system to eliminate the disease or slow its growth. Together, these advancements are helping patients live longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

Personalized Medicine
Personalized medicine — sometimes referred to as precision or individualized medicine —is an emerging field of medicine that uses diagnostic tools to identify specific biological markers, often genetic, to help assess which medical treatments and procedures will be best for each patient.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
