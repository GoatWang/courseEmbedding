We help businesses manage today and transform tomorrow




























You’ve seen a glimpse into who we are. Find out how we got here and how we’re committed to helping you.















"When I look back at the business, the numbers change, a lot of the tactics change, and the products and services change — and the solutions change. But for me, it’s really about the culture and the people."
Tim Crown





Our story began with a college business plan.
Many great entrepreneurial tales start with two innovators inspired by an initial idea. In 1988, Tim and Eric Crown began their story in this fashion. With a business plan that took root in a college assignment and a cash advance from a credit card, they established Hard Drives International — the company that would become Insight.












Today, we're a global company.
Shaped by the evolution in IT, Insight is now a leading provider of Intelligent Technology Solutions™, helping companies around the world implement innovation and improve business performance.

We deliver expertise.
You need answers more than you need equipment. We provide a team with the experience, intelligence and right IT solutions to help you make strategic business decisions. So you can scale faster, optimize your investments and reach your goals.



"Vendors were starting to work together … and they were going to co-support a solution. And that perfectly fit in with what we had hoped for. But we didn’t know there was a solution out there for it."
 Rob LloydChief Information Officer, City of Avondale, Arizona







We integrate confidence.
Trust and confidence are foundational to your IT strategy. To be up-to-date, up-to-speed and fully informed, you need a team that’s collaborative to the core — keeping you efficient and on track to meet your goals.



"Insight worked with the vendors and engineers to make sure all these applications or different systems worked flawlessly. They are very there for us."
 Wally McMullenIS Project Manager, University Health System, San Antonio, Texas







We connect the world.
Our connections make us stronger. With partnerships, people, services and delivery, we’ll help you improve performance and amplify the impact of Intelligent Technology Solutions in your environment. Our commitment is to help your business run smarter.



"Our relationship with Insight is not just that of a client-vendor relationship; it’s a partnership."

Medical Safety
















Improving Safety In the Medical Workplace
Our mission at L & B Splash Blocker, LLC, is to enhance and improve the personal safety of nurses, health care workers, and caregivers — not only in the United States, but also internationally.  Our revolutionary new product, the SPLASHBLOCKER™­, was invented by an oncology nurse who saw the need for promoting greater workplace safety by reducing the adverse health risks associated with potential exposure when disposing chemotherapeutically-tainted human excreta.  As an innovative form of Personal Protective Equipment, the SPLASHBLOCKER™ acts as a lid when flushing the toilet after disposing hazardous waste and as a shield when cleaning patient urinals, commodes, and bedpans.






















An Indispensable Asset
Protect nurses and health care workers in your hospital, ensure greater workplace safety, and mitigate workers' compensation claims through use of the SPLASHBLOCKER™.
For a wide variety of reasons, such as availability or urgent patient care situations, nurses do not always use Personal Protective Equipment when disposing hazardous waste products in the toilet.  Our SPLASHBLOCKER™ can be easily stored and readily available in all patient bathrooms.  The SPLASHBLOCKER™ is specially designed not only to prohibit hazardous waste backsplash from coming into direct contact with nurses, but also to prevent harmful microorganisms from being directly emitted into the atmosphere. 




















Why Not Just Install a Regular Toilet Lid?
While this may seem like the obvious solution, it isn't. If your facility's toilets are equipped with sprayers, these would need to be removed to install a regular toilet lid.  A lid alone does not protect nurses and healthcare workers when cleaning contaminated patient items such as urinals, commodes, and bedpans. 
Great for Personal Use
Our versatile product can also be used during outpatient therapy.  Families who are taking care of patients at home, for example, may not even know about the dangers of hazardous waste emission. The SPLASHBLOCKER™ provides peace of mind when you're unsure about the health risks you may be dealing with.
Features
The SPLASHBLOCKER™ is made of clear and lightweight plastic and weighing less than 1.5 lbs., the SPLASHBLOCKER'S handle is designed for easy lifting.
How To Store
Store the SPLASHBLOCKER™ in the bathroom at all times to have it readily available when duty calls. The shield features a flat bottom stand for compact upright storage on the floor. You can also hang our product on the wall with a three-pound, 3M Command™ hook when not in use.
Care Instructions
The SPLASHBLOCKER™ can be cleaned and disinfected like all patient bathroom fixtures with regular hospital cleaning solvents.
