		Recovering Losses
		Caused By Investment Misconduct





Meyer Wilson Law Firm Investigating United Development Funding Claims
Were you sold investments in UDF? Call today.



The investment fraud lawyers at the law firm of Meyer Wilson are investigating
	 potential claims on behalf of investors in United Development Funding
	 (UDF) against the brokerage firms who sold the investments to their customers.


		If you invested in United Development Funding at the recommendation of
		 your broker and lost money, we invite you to contact an investment fraud
		 lawyer at Meyer Wilson today for a free review.

About UDF
For several years, UDF, a Texas-based non-traded real estate investment
	 trust (REIT), has marketed itself to retail investors on the premise that
	 it offers “unique and fundamentally sound investments in affordable
	 residential real estate.” According to UDF’s website, all
	 UDF investments are sold through brokerage firms. Under securities industry
	 rules, brokerage firms are required to conduct extensive due diligence
	 on any investment that a firm sells to its customers. It has been reported
	 that UDF has raised approximately $1 billion in funding through brokerage
	 firm sales to retail investors in recent years.
The Raid

	According to
	The
Wall Street Journal, federal agents raided UDF’s offices in February, issuing subpoenas
	 to company executives and removing various materials from the premises.
	 A spokesperson for the FBI said that the agents were conducting “law
	 enforcement activity” but declined further comment. No charges have
	 yet been filed.

News of the FBI raid sent shares of UDF’s largest fund, United Development
	 Funding IV, plummeting 54%.
Potential Problems Revealed

	Just two days before the FBI raid,
	The Wall Street Journal published an article highlighting potential problems with UDF IV’s
	 concentrated lending practices. According to the article, although UDF
	 operates in North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida, 99% of the UDF
	 IV fund’s portfolio consists of loans made to borrowers in Texas.
	 The article further states that 67% of the balance of UDF IV loans was
	 made to a single borrower, Texas-based Centurion American Development,
	 or Centurion’s affiliates.

In December 2015, a Dallas hedge fund publicly raised questions about UDF
	 on an Internet site. Among the allegations raised by the hedge fund was
	 that UDF had used new investor money to repay investors in UDF’s
	 earlier investment vehicles “consistent with a Ponzi scheme.”
What To Do Next
The lawyers at Meyer Wilson have represented approximately 1,000 investors
	 over the last 15 years and have recovered tens of millions of dollars
	 on their behalf. If you invested money in United Development Funding through
	 the recommendation of a brokerage firm and lost money in those investments,
	 contact the lawyers at Meyer Wilson to discuss your potential recovery
	 options. You might be able to recover your losses against the brokerage
	 firm that sold you the investments. Initial consultations are free and
	 all of our cases are handled on a contingency fee basis.

		Recovering Losses
		Caused By Investment Misconduct





Meyer Wilson Law Firm Investigating United Development Funding Claims

The investment fraud lawyers at the law firm of Meyer Wilson are investigating
	 potential claims on behalf of investors in United Development Funding
	 (UDF) against the brokerage firms who sold the investments to their customers.


		If you invested in United Development Funding at the recommendation of
		 your broker and lost money, we invite you to contact an investment fraud
		 lawyer at Meyer Wilson today for a free review.

About UDF
For several years, UDF, a Texas-based non-traded real estate investment
	 trust (REIT), has marketed itself to retail investors on the premise that
	 it offers “unique and fundamentally sound investments in affordable
	 residential real estate.” According to UDF’s website, all
	 UDF investments are sold through brokerage firms. Under securities industry
	 rules, brokerage firms are required to conduct extensive due diligence
	 on any investment that a firm sells to its customers. It has been reported
	 that UDF has raised approximately $1 billion in funding through brokerage
	 firm sales to retail investors in recent years.
The Raid

	According to
	The
Wall Street Journal, federal agents raided UDF’s offices in February, issuing subpoenas
	 to company executives and removing various materials from the premises.
	 A spokesperson for the FBI said that the agents were conducting “law
	 enforcement activity” but declined further comment. No charges have
	 yet been filed.

News of the FBI raid sent shares of UDF’s largest fund, United Development
	 Funding IV, plummeting 54%.
Potential Problems Revealed

	Just two days before the FBI raid,
	The Wall Street Journal published an article highlighting potential problems with UDF IV’s
	 concentrated lending practices. According to the article, although UDF
	 operates in North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida, 99% of the UDF
	 IV fund’s portfolio consists of loans made to borrowers in Texas.
	 The article further states that 67% of the balance of UDF IV loans was
	 made to a single borrower, Texas-based Centurion American Development,
	 or Centurion’s affiliates.

In December 2015, a Dallas hedge fund publicly raised questions about UDF
	 on an Internet site. Among the allegations raised by the hedge fund was
	 that UDF had used new investor money to repay investors in UDF’s
	 earlier investment vehicles “consistent with a Ponzi scheme.”
What To Do Next
The lawyers at Meyer Wilson have represented approximately 1,000 investors
	 over the last 15 years and have recovered tens of millions of dollars
	 on their behalf. If you invested money in United Development Funding through
	 the recommendation of a brokerage firm and lost money in those investments,
	 contact the lawyers at Meyer Wilson to discuss your potential recovery
	 options. You might be able to recover your losses against the brokerage
	 firm that sold you the investments. Initial consultations are free and
	 all of our cases are handled on a contingency fee basis.
