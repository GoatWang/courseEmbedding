Diamondbacks' Patrick Corbin: Navigates around control issues for win
by RotoWire Staff | RotoWire



Corbin (8-9) struggled with his control in Wednesday's start against Atlanta -- he walked four batters, hit one and threw a wild pitch in addition to allowing seven hits -- but limited the damage to two runs, striking out five in a 10-3 victory.
The four bases on balls mark a season high for the lefty, who doesn't usually experience such control issues -- the hit batsman was only his second of the year, the wild pitch his sixth. Nonetheless, Corbin has simply been too hittable for the second straight year, making him more of a streaming option than a regular member of a quality fantasy rotation.

Diamondbacks' Patrick Corbin: Beats Reds for seventh win
by RotoWire Staff | RotoWire



Corbin (7-9) allowed one run on seven hits and one walk while striking out six over 7.1 innings in a win over the Reds on Thursday.
Called upon to replace Taijuan Walker (paternity) on Thursday, Corbin shined in Cincinnati, turning in his eighth straight start with three runs or fewer allowed. He got himself into trouble in the fourth, but Corbin escaped without allowing a run after loading the bases with nobody out. His season numbers are still unsightly, but Corbin's recent run of success has his stock trending upward ahead of an upcoming two-step (vs Braves, at Cardinals).

Diamondbacks' Patrick Corbin: Start moved up to Thursday
by RotoWire Staff | RotoWire



Corbin will take the mound for the Diamondbacks on Thursday against the Reds, as scheduled starter Tajuan Walker has been scratched due to a family emergency.
Corbin faced the Reds in his last start before the All-Star break, turning in a quality start with nine strikeouts across six innings. He'll get a rematch sooner than expected, serving as the last-minute replacement for Walker. The lefty will be opposed by Luis Castillo in the afternoon matchup.

Diamondbacks' Patrick Corbin: Fans six in no-decision
by RotoWire Staff | RotoWire



Corbin (6-9) allowed two runs on six hits and one walk while striking out six across five innings in a no-decision against the Braves on Saturday.
Corbin allowed a home run and RBI double to Brandon Phillips to account for the only runs scored on him, and although he left with a one-run deficit, the offense came back to take him off the hook for a potential loss. He's held opponents to two or fewer earned runs in five of his last six starts to lower his ERA from 5.38 to 4.66, and he's been a reliable fantasy option over the past month. He'll make his next start Friday against the Nationals.

Diamondbacks' Patrick Corbin: Fans nine Reds through six
by RotoWire Staff | RotoWire



Corbin (6-3) allowed two runs on seven hits and two walks while striking out nine batters during Sunday's loss to Cincinnati.
Corbin heads into the All-Star break in solid form. The lefty has surrendered three runs or fewer in each of his past six starts and sports a 4.71 ERA, 1.53 WHIP, 8.4 K/9 and 4.25 FIP for the campaign. His numbers are inflated by a poor six-game stretch where he allowed 32 runs through just 31 innings, but otherwise, he's been a serviceable fantasy asset. Being selective with his opponents is an option, and this might prove to be a buy-low spot for Corbin.
