Broadtree Residential



“A rentership society spells opportunity for savvy investors.”
–Amy Tait, CEO

Broadtree Residential (Broadtree) is a private, diversified residential income REIT (real estate investment trust) designed to provide investors with a simple solution for investment in the residential rental marketplace, without the obligations and headaches of becoming a landlord. Broadtree is uniquely positioned to offer Accredited Investors an opportunity to invest in a professionally managed, diversified portfolio of residential real estate.

Founded by the same principals who previously founded Home Properties¹, a multifamily apartment REIT which went public in 1994 and operated as such until the company’s acquisition for $7.6 billion in October, 2015, Broadtree Residential management team and Board of Directors have invested $27 million of equity capital to seed Broadtree, with an additional $22 million of insider capital committed for investment in the REIT. Broadtree qualified as a REIT during the 2015 tax year, is now accepting investment from accredited individuals and entities (Broadtree has already accepted $13.8 million of non-insider equity capital commitments). Shares are offered via private placement, and new investors are accepted on a monthly basis.
