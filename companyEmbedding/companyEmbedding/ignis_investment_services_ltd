This website contains information on a large number of investment funds which are registered and managed in different jurisdictions. Access to the information contained on this website may be restricted by laws and regulations applicable to you as a user. Truthfully stating your domicile is a mandatory requirement for using this website.
        
This information is not intended for you if you are bound by laws or regulations which prohibit the publication of or access to the information in question by virtue of your nationality, your place of residence or on other grounds. If you are subject to such restrictions, you are not permitted to access this information.
        
An investment in the funds described on this website should be made only after careful study of the most recent sales prospectus and the basic legal information, risks, tax aspects and any offering restrictions and other conditions contained therein. Sales prospectuses, key investor information document (KIID), where available, and annual and semiannual reports may be obtained free of charge from the Credit Suisse branch responsible.
        
According to the UCITS Directive 2009/65/EC, investors shall be provided with a key investor information document (KIID) before subscription to a UCITS fund. KIID is provided on the website of the respective investment company or management company or, where available, on this Fund Lab website, "Documents". You herewith specifically consent to the provision of KIID in that form.
        
Every investment involves risk, especially with regard to fluctuations in value and return, up to a total loss of the amount invested. Historical returns and financial market scenarios are no guarantee of current or future performance. Information on investment fund returns may be stated in a currency other than that of your domicile; accordingly exchange-rate fluctuations should be taken into account.
        
Transactions in investment products are subject to tax laws and provisions under various legal jurisdictions: e.g. in the legal jurisdiction in which the investment products are issued or in which the issuer is domiciled; in the legal jurisdictions in which the investment products have invested; in the legal jurisdictions in which these investment products are held in the safekeeping accounts of investors; in the legal jurisdiction in which the investors are domiciled or resident or are subject to tax obligations.        Potential investors are personally responsible for informing themselves about the applicable tax laws and provisions and for complying with them in connection with the subscription, purchase, holding, sale, redemption or distribution of investments. Statements about transactions in investment products may not be construed as tax advice on the part of Credit Suisse Group AG and/or its affiliates and subsidiaries. It is recommended that investors carefully consider the potential tax consequences of such investments, as needed with the assistance of a tax advisor, and compare them with the tax consequences of investing in other products. It is also important to note that investors must still themselves compile and/or supplement the data for the calculation of taxes even where such data has been automatically prepared on the part of Credit Suisse Group AG and/or its affiliates and subsidiaries. 
        
Units of investment funds of Credit Suisse Group AG's three fund platforms (Switzerland and Liechtenstein) and CS funds that are managed in Germany by SGSS Deutschland Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or any of its territories. Units of these investment funds may not be offered, sold or delivered to US citizens or persons resident or incorporated in the US and/or other natural or legal persons whose income and/or returns, regardless of origin, are subject to US income tax, as well as persons who are considered to be US persons pursuant to Regulation S of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and/or the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, in each case as amended from time to time.
The information on investment funds provided on this website does not represent an offer or a recommendation to enter into a transaction of any kind.
Credit Suisse Group AG and/or its affiliates and subsidiaries may receive from third parties as part of their compensation or otherwise, one-time or recurring remunerations (e.g. issue commissions, trailer fees).

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):

 Career History



Chief Executive Officer

Ignis Investment Services Ltd.


                  Ignis is an active, research and conviction-based manager which employs an investment philosophy called Focus on Change, aiming to capture anomalies and inefficiencies between consensus and non-consensus analysis of companies. Their range of strategies includes equities, bonds, real estate, private equity, multi-asset solutions, fund-of-funds and absolute return. The firm seeks to consistently add value through their equity portfolios, following a bottom-up approach to construct portfolios comprised of opportunities with real potential. Company meetings are the primary source of their non-consensus investment insights. Every investment idea must be justified by the answers to questions about  which dynamics of the key drivers are changing; what expectations are priced in; why the market will change its mind about these expectations and what triggers for a re-pricing exist and are within their investment timeframe.For fixed-income, Ignis  offers segregated and pooled vehicles across a range of fixed-income sub-sectors and geographies through investment grade corporate bonds, high yield corporate bonds, government bonds, emerging market debt, inflation-linked bonds and absolute return bond strategies. The firm also constructs real estate and multi-asset portfolios, aiming to maximize returns and deliver targeted returns within tight risk boundaries..

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
