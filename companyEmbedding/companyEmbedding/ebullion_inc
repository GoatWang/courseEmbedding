 PRECIOUS-Gold turns lower as U.S. data takes pressure off dollar 





Gold switched lower on Thursday, sinking back below $1,100 an oz like a steeper-than-forecast stop by U.S. unemployed claims assisted the dollar get over earlier lows, though prices continued to be pressurized following this week’s plunge.
Gold published its greatest one-day reduction in nearly 2 yrs on Monday, pushing prices through key chart levels and configuring it for more weakness. Affordable prices enticed some purchasers to the marketplace on Wednesday, but gains continued to be moderate.
Place gold was lower .3 % at $1,089.34 an oz at 2:53 p.m. EDT (1853 GMT), off a higher of $1,105.60. U.S. gold futures for August delivery settled up .2 percent at $1,094.10.
“The marketplaces are concentrating on a September rate hike, so presuming that’s if this happens, you need to believe that gold will remain under downward pressure up to that time,Inch Citi analyst David Wilson stated.
Gold continues to be compromised this season by anticipation the U.S. Fed is on the right track to boost rates of interest the very first time in nearly ten years, improving the price of holding non-yielding gold and lifting the dollar.
“If you are taking into consideration the Fed hiking rates in September maybe December, in tangible terms that may be a bigger impact than you might have thought,” stated Bart Melek, mind of commodity technique for TD Investments in Toronto, observing there’s insufficient inflation to draw in purchasing of gold.
Technical experts, who study past cost designs to estimate the near future direction of buying and selling, say once its current bounce from Monday’s slump has ended, the following target for gold below its Wednesday low near $1,087 an oz is $1,044, its 2010 low.
“The bounce in gold is certainly not however a technical trade, since many major momentum indications are showing the recent selloff is overdone,” AvaTrade’s chief market analyst Naeem Aslam stated.
Traders still cut their contact with gold. Holdings within the greatest gold-backed exchange-exchanged fund, SPDR Gold Shares, shrank for any fifth day on Wednesday for their cheapest since 2008.
Some demand emerged for physical metal, however. A retreat within the dollar, which fell .five percent against a currency basket, urged some purchasing in China overnight, sellers stated, while weak gold prices spurred purchasing of gold coins within the U . s . States where Mint sales leaped to some 2013 high.
Silver was lower 1 % at $14.63 an oz. Place platinum fell .8 percent at $971 an oz, while place palladium was lower 1.6 % at $613.75 an oz.

 David Morgan: 2014 Gold and Silver Forecast – $30 Silver and $1,700 Gold by End of 2014 






(Youtube)
David Morgan of Silver-Investor.com says, “The financial system on a global economic scale is in a place that has never ever been established before. So, it is very difficult to forecast how it will unravel.” But, unravel it will. That’s why Morgan says, “This is why I am such an advocate of hard money, gold and physical silver. You want to be early. You don’t want to be late.” What will the price of gold and silver be this time next year? Morgan says, “I think we’ll see $30 to $34 silver and $1,700 gold by the end of 2014.” Join Greg Hunter as he goes One-on-One with silver expert David Morgan.

 Gold heading toward a critical development point: Charts 





As gold finishes out a rocky year, its chart is heading toward critical development point, and the yellow metal may fall below $1,000 an ounce.
The yellow metal started 2014 at around $1,200 an ounce, not too far off its current level of around $1,196, but in between it has hit peaks of nearly $1,400 and a trough around $1,140, after 2013′s long downtrend from opening that year around $1,664.
The downtrend line is the most important trend feature of the weekly Comex gold chart. This starts from the high near $1,799 in October 2012. Recently, the line uses the high of $1,347 in July 2014 as a confirming anchor point for the downtrend line. Any change in the downtrend will require a price breakout above the value of the downtrend line, currently near $1,239. The trend line defines the downtrend.
The second important feature of the gold chart is the historical support level near $1,180. The gold price did move below this level, but the price developed a consolidation pattern near the $1,180 level.
The combination of these two features – the support level and the downtrend line – create a down sloping triangle pattern. The apex of this pattern — when the trend line intersects the support line — is around April 2015.
A sustained move above the value of the trend line will signal a potential change in the trend direction. The first upside target for a successful trend change is near $1,400.
Failure to move above the trend line combined with a sustained move below the support level has a downside target near $970. Between April 2013 and October 2014, gold traded in a broad sideways trading band between $1,180 and $1,390. The width of the trading band is measured and this value is projected below support at $1,180. The band is $210 high and this calculation is used to set a downside target near $970.
The calculated target is a little below the long-term historical support and resistance level near $980. This suggests there is a high probability that gold will fall to around $980 before any new consolidation pattern develops.
Read MoreWhy gold just can’t win
The consolidation near $1,180 may continue for several weeks. Investors will move into the market when the uptrend breakout or the downtrend continuation is clear. The clear trend direction should develop before April 2015.
The combination of the trend line and the Guppy Multiple Moving Average indicator suggest the trend is still bearish. The long term GMMA remains well separated and this shows investors continue to sell gold.
In addition to a move above the value of the downtrend line, the gold price would also need to move above the upper edge of the long term GMMA to confirm that a new uptrend is developing. The separation in the long term GMMA suggests the downtrend in gold will continue. The downside target is near $980.

The retail market for facilitating trades in gold and silver contracts is
fragmented and highly competitive. Our competitors in the retail market can be
grouped into several broad categories based on size, business model, product
offerings, target customers and geographic scope of operations. These include
international retail precious metals brokers, international multi-product
trading firms, other electronic trading firms and international banks and other
financial institutions with significant precious metals operations. We expect
competition to continue to remain competitive and strong for the foreseeable
future.


Company Description
Since April 3, 2013, through our subsidiary Man Loong Bullion Company Limited, a
Hong Kong limited liability company (“Man Loong”), we have been an electronic
trading member of the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society (“CGSE”), a
self-regulatory organization registered in Hong Kong which acts


 as an exchange
for the trading of gold and silver. Man Loong holds a Type AA License with the
CGSE, which it uses to provide an electronic trading platform which customers of
its agents can use to place trades in a CGSE price contract for Kilo Gold and
Loco London Gold and Silver via the electronic trading platform or a telephonic
transaction system. The agents’ customers can access their account to check
their gain/loss on their trading position 24 hours a day 7 days a week through
Man Loong’s electronic trading platform. Man Loong contracts with independent
agents, each with their own customers that seek to place trades for gold and
silver price contracts with the CGSE using Man Loong’s electronic trading
platform, which is linked to the CGSE’s electronic trading platform by reason of
Man Loong’s membership in the CGSE. All transactions and technologies used to
execute trades are consummated and located at Man Loong’s principal offices in
Hong Kong. The various independent sales agents who use Man Loong’s services,
together with the agents’ customer base, are located in Hong Kong and in the
People’s Republic of China. Neither we, nor Man Loong, conducts business in the
United States or has agents, or any agreements with agents, or facilitate trades
with any customers of agents that reside in the United States.
 
The electronic trading platform, which is located in Hong Kong, is licensed by
Man Loong from True Technology Company Limited (“True Technology”), a company
organized under the laws of Hong Kong, and owned by Mr. Choi, our Chief
Executive Officer and 49.5% stockholder and Mr. Wong, one of our directors and
stockholders. The electronic trading platform provides the various independent
sales agents and their customers with CGSE price quotations on gold and silver
price contracts, on a Loco London basis, as well as information updates on the
gold and silver market, based on an evaluation of third-party market pricing
sources such as Reuters or Bloomberg. The electronic trading platform also
provides an agent’s customers with up-to-date market data, trade reports and
gain/ loss reports to assist them in evaluating their portfolio and
effecting trades. In addition, the electronic trading platform communicates and
confirms all of the trades that are placed by Man Loong agents and their
customers with the CGSE and provides the agents and their customers with
confirmation codes which confirm execution of the trades.

Man Loong’s membership in the CGSE allows it to provide its electronic trading
platform to facilitate trades on behalf of the agents’ customers and/or the
agents themselves, who can purchase trading positions in gold and/or silver on
the CGSE, without Man Loong being required to become a counterparty to the trade
or having to purchase or sell, as principal, any of the gold or silver subject
to the price contract being traded. Man Loong merely operates an electronic
trading platform which it licenses from True Technology that allows agents’
customers to directly place trades and become the actual counterparty to the
trade for a price contract, which is a product created by the CGSE for
electronic trading that does not involve the physical transfer or delivery of
any actual gold or silver.
 
The process for effectuating trades on Man Loong’s platform are as follows: (i)
orders are placed by the agents’ customers on the trading platform; (ii) the
platform, which has a direct connection with the GCSE, communicates the order to
the CGSE; (iii) the GCSE matches the trade with a counterparty in the market,
which counterparty is unknown to Man Loong, its agents’ and their customers;
(iv) the CGSE then confirms the trade and returns an official confirmation
number to the customer through Man Loong’s trading platform. The customer can
use the confirmation code to verify on the CGSE website the completion of its
trade. The trading position represented by the gold or silver price contract
remains open until the customer places a trade order using the same procedures
set forth in the preceding sentence, to close the open position. Man Loong,
through its platform helps facilitate the trade as an official member of the
CGSE and earns a commission for its services. Moreover, the gold or silver price
contracts do not involve the physical transfer or delivery of any actual gold or
silver as there is no physical asset securing the price contract.
Man Loong enters into an agency agreement with each agent for which it processes
trades pursuant to which the agent agrees to pay a commission to Man Loong for
each trade that Man Loong processes and the agent acknowledges that Man Loong
has no responsibility for any trading losses suffered by it or its customers for
the trades executed on their behalf. Man Loong does not accept customers
directly without an agent representative and does not enter into agreements
directly with customers for the placement of trades. Although the agent remains
directly responsible to Man Loong for any trading losses, to help ensure that
the respective agent’s customers understand: (i) their assumption of trading
risk; (ii) their obligations to their respective agents and (iii) that Man Loong
does not have any responsibility for any of their trading losses, Man Loong
requires that each agent representative’s client for whom Man Loong is requested
to process a trade to complete and sign a form acknowledging these risks and
obligations prior to commencing trading activity. Any customer that seeks to
open a trading account directly with Man Loong is assigned to an agent and is
required to execute an agreement with an agent prior to placing a trade. Man
Loong receives a commission from the agents ranging from $20 to $40 per trade
processed by it regardless of the purchase price paid or received for the gold
or silver contract and the agent assumes the sole responsibility to Man Loong
and the CGSE for payment of the purchase price of the gold or silver contract
traded by it or its customers and for any loss recognized on those trades.
 
The agents often use Man Loong’s offices and conference rooms as a physical
place to meet with existing and potential customers, and Man Loong provides a
dedicated investment center where agents and their customers can access the
electronic trading platform to place and process price contract orders for gold,
and silver and obtain up-to-date market data, trade reports and gain/ loss
reports to assist them in evaluating their portfolio and effecting trades.
---
 
Our principal offices are located at 80 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004,
(212) 837-7858. Man Loong currently has one office in Hong Kong. Man Loong’s
principal executive offices are located at 8/F, Tower 5, China Hong Kong City,
33 Canton Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong. The telephone number at Man Loong’s
principal executive office is +852-2155-3999. All of Man Loong’s transactions
and the technologies, including the servers that carry out these transactions,
are all processed and located in Hong Kong. Our website address is
