That is 67.50 % of the round of financing. The total private offering amount was $1.00 million. The financing document was filed on 2015-11-12. The reason for the financing was: unspecified. The fundraising still has about $325,000 more and is not closed yet. We have to wait more to see if the offering will be fully taken.
 Roar Athletic Performance is based in Connecticut. The firm’s business is not disclosed. The form was filed by Matthew J Arciuolo President. The company was incorporated in 2014. The filler’s address is: 95 Kozlowski Road, Milford, Ct, Connecticut, 06461. Matthew J.

The average investment floor size for companies in all industries in our database is $3.05 million. The offering was 77.87 % smaller than the average of $3.05 million.

If you know more about the reasons for the financing, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Roar Athletic Performance Also
The Form D signed by Matthew J Arciuolo might help Roar Athletic Performance Corp.’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.
