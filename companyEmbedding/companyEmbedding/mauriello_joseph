Hello



+About




+ This site


I look at my portfolio website as a chance to test new skills and ideas. Many of my projects have their own life on the web and this site is a way to showcase them. Each project is given a vignette with links to more in depth content, including websites, papers, apps, and games.
This iteration doesn't look much different then what I've had up for the past few years.  That's because all of the changes are under the hood.  I built a new backend for the site, and I use Ajax loading for content delivery.
I put a lot of TLC into the construction of this site! I'm quite fond of all of the work but "Whose That! Brooown?" (found under game design) and Fong (Also under game design) stand out as favorites. You also might like to explore "The Masses" (also under game design), and Lobby pet (under Misc). Both of these projects are fun, interesting and have a lot of content spread on the web, all the links are consolidated here. Enjoy!
