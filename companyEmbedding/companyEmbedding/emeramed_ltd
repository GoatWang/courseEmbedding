Molarity Calculator
 
The Adooq molarity calculator is a useful tool which allows you to calculate the:

mass of a compound required to prepare a solution of known volume and concentration
volume of solution required to dissolve a compound of known mass to a desired concentration
concentration of a solution resulting from a known mass of compound in a specific volume






The molarity calculator equation: 








Mass (g) = Concentration (mol/L) x Volume (L) x Molecular Weight (g/mol)

  **When preparing stock solutions, please always use the batch-specific molecular weight of the product found on the via label and MSDS / COA (available on product pages).





















The Dilution Calculator Equation:








Concentration (start) x Volume (start) = Concentration (final) x Volume (final)


This equation is commonly abbreviated as:C1V1 = C2V2

Molecular Weight Calculator

Enter the chemical formula of a compound to calculate its molar mass and elemental composition:


 




Total Molecular Weight: g/mol




Tip: Chemical formula is case sensitive. C10H16N2O2 c10h16n2o2 

Instructions to calculate molar mass (molecular weight) of a chemical compound:
To calculate molar mass of a chemical compound, please enter its chemical formula and click 'Calculate'.
Definitions of molecular mass, molecular weight, molar mass and molar weight:
Molecular mass (molecular weight) is the mass of one molecule of a substance and is expressed in the unified atomic mass units (u). (1 u is equal to 1/12 the mass of one atom of carbon-12) Molar mass (molar weight) is the mass of one mole of a substance and is expressed in g/mol.

			Early Access		


The use of drugs under development can be approved by a regulatory authority on a Named Patient Use basis. This is also called Early Access, Expanded Access, Single Patient Use, Individual Patient IND, or Compassionate Use, depending on the country. The approval is based on whether the condition to be treated is serious enough, whether efficient and safe treatments currently exist, and whether the drug has shown relevant efficacy and safety. An application for the treatment of a condition may be more easily approved if efficacy studies have been performed targeting that condition. Under Named Patient Use the physician is responsible for the treatment, and, in general, only a licensed physician can apply to the regulatory authority. By early 2017, SwissMedic (Switzerland) and FDA (USA) had approved treatments.
Early Access Program – Treatment with Irminix®
Currently, we are allowed to offer a 14-day treatment x 300mg per day. The treatment length and dosing are limited by those used in the completed Phase 1 and Phase 2a clinical studies. We cannot determine whether this treatment will be sufficient to treat a particular patient. In clinical trials on mercury intoxicated gold miners, there were positive effects on those with low, moderate and high mercury levels, while there was no noticeable effect on individuals with extreme urine mercury levels over 100 µg/L, breathing mercury vapor daily.
Selected Country Information
No Approval Required – The following countries do not require for regulatory approval for a physician to use an unapproved medicine:
New Zealand
Approval Not Required In Some Cases:
Austria
Approval Required – The following countries require regulatory approval for a physician to use an unapproved medicine:
Various EU Countries
Sweden
Denmark
United Kingdom
Various Non-EU Countries
Australia
Canada
US
Application Information
If you are interested in participating in the Company’s Early Access Use Program for Irminix®, please complete the following document
 
Early Access Application
and forward it to us by email to EarlyAccess@EmeraMed.com for evaluation (this document is not an application to a regulatory authority, but an application to us for review).

EmeraMed strives to bring cures for diseases faced by animals as well as humans. The Company received veterinary Minor Use for Minor Species (MUMS) designation for Irminix® in December 2012. This is similar to orphan designation for human drugs. The Swedish MPA has since approved compassionate-use treatments for predatory birds. The Company has successfully treated a paralyzed eagle and a dizzy and stumbling owl. Both birds were heavily intoxicated with mercury and after short periods of treatment were up and flying in the Swedish countryside again. The Company will continue to develop veterinary uses for Irminix® in the future.
