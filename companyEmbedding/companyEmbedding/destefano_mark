Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Tonight a king will be born, and all the stars in heaven are competing to see who can shine the brightest for him. But when the stars see the poor family huddling in the shabby stable, they begin to think that this baby couldn’t be a king after all!That is, all the stars except the smallest, loneliest star in the sky, Little Star. He recognizes the baby Jesus as the King of kings and understands His special message of love. Read on to discover the extraordinary way Little Star serves his King on that cold, dark night.Certain to become a Christmas classic, this delightful tale connects the star atop the Christmas tree to the true meaning of Christmasthe birth of Jesus.

Product DescriptionI know you're up in heaven, God, and can hear my voice from there.I'm just a little child.Will you answer my short prayer? Bestselling author Anthony DeStefano believes that prayer is the greatest gift you can give a child. Using simple language and rhyme--written as a heartfelt prayer--this story expresses a child's understanding of our loving, faithful God. It encourages little ones to go beyond asking God for things to trusting Him for courage when feeling afraid, joy when sad or lonely, and guidance when confused or unsure. Mark Elliott's beautiful, photo-realistic illustrations of children in everyday situations keep young readers turning the pages to see what comes next. When the last page has been turned and the amen has been said, little ones will understand that prayer is a simple conversation with God--easy, natural, and everlasting.
