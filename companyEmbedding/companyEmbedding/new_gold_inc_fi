	New Gold Provides Update on El Morro Project












	(All figures are in US dollars unless otherwise indicated)








	January 9, 2012 –

	New Gold Inc. (“New Gold”) (TSX:NGD)(NYSE AMEX:NGD) today provides an update on the El Morro Project where the company is a 30 percent partner, with Goldcorp Inc. (“Goldcorp”), the project developer and operator, holding the remaining 70 percent. El Morro is an advanced stage, world-class copper/gold project in northern Chile, one of the most attractive mining jurisdictions in the world.







	New Gold has been informed that Goldcorp’s Board of Directors has officially approved the decision to commence with construction of the El Morro Project, with the start of construction targeted for the end of the Chilean winter season in September 2012. In total, the development of El Morro is expected to take five years at a capital cost of $3.9 billion (100% basis). Under the terms of New Gold’s agreement with Goldcorp, Goldcorp is responsible for funding New Gold’s 30% share of capital costs, or approximately $1.2 billion. The carried funding will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 4.58%. New Gold will repay its share of capital plus accumulated interest out of 80% of its 30% share of the project’s cash flow with New Gold retaining 20% of its 30% share of cash flow from the time production commences.







	“Our 30 percent interest in El Morro positions us very well as we have a meaningful share of this great project, with a proven mine developer and operator as a partner and a favourable financing arrangement that carries us through production,” stated Randall Oliphant, Executive Chairman.







	Initial production from the mine is expected in 2017 with full production anticipated in 2018. Development activities during 2012 will focus on access road construction, engineering, equipment procurement and exploration. Drilling will be a combination of additional condemnation drilling for infrastructure locations and exploration drilling to test potential extensions of the La Fortuna deposit. La Fortuna, which hosts the current mineral resource, is one of the two principal zones of gold-copper mineralization that have been identified to date. The El Morro zone and several additional targets have also been identified which could become the focus of future exploration efforts. Current open pit proven and probable mineral reserves on a 100% basis total 537 million tonnes at 0.52% copper and 0.49 grams per tonne gold. New Gold’s 30% share of the reserves includes 1.8 billion pounds copper and 2.5 million ounces gold.







	New Gold has recently received the data and analysis supporting Goldcorp’s update of the project’s 2008 feasibility study and has engaged Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. to complete a detailed review of the results on New Gold’s behalf. The results of Goldcorp’s updated study indicate that New Gold’s 30 percent share of annual production is expected to be over 90,000 ounces of gold and 85 million pounds of copper over an initial 17-year mine life. Life-of-mine cash costs are expected to be approximately ($700) per ounce of gold on a by-product basis and approximately $550 per ounce of gold and $1.45 per pound of copper on a co-product basis. Metals price assumptions used to calculate the average life-of-mine El Morro cash costs are $1,200 per ounce of gold and $2.75 per pound of copper.



	 


	 





	 






	 










	 






	 



	The El Morro Project currently contemplates the mining and milling of sulphide copper and gold ore from the La Fortuna mineral deposit through a 90,000 tonne-per-day concentrator.   The plant design includes: a crushing plant, semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) circuit, rougher flotation and regrind circuit, and cleaner and scavenger flotation banks. Additional project-related infrastructure includes: a desalination plant, power plant and concentrate filtration plant. The construction of a new access route from the project to the Pan American highway is also contemplated with the route serving as the concentrate and water pipeline route, and the preferred location for the project power line. Water supply is planned to be sourced from a reverse-osmosis desalination plant that will produce 740 litres per second of agricultural-quality water, which will be conveyed to site along a 193 kilometre-long water pipeline.  Concentrate will be transferred via pipeline to a concentrate filter plant at the port site for overseas shipment.

	Technical Information







	The El Morro Project reserves and resources were prepared by Ms. Maryse Belanger, P. Geo and Ms. Sophie Bergeron, Ing. both of Goldcorp, each a “Qualified Person” under NI 43-101.







	The scientific and technical information in this news release has been reviewed by Mark Petersen, a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101 and employee of New Gold.







	(1) TOTAL CASH COST




	“Total cash cost” per ounce figures are calculated in accordance with a standard developed by The Gold Institute, which was a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold products and included leading North American gold producers. The Gold Institute ceased operations in 2002, but the standard is widely accepted as the standard of reporting cash cost of production in North America. Adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. New Gold reports total cash cost on a sales basis. Total cash cost includes mine site operating costs such as mining, processing, administration, royalties and production taxes, but is exclusive of amortization, reclamation, capital and exploration costs. Total cash cost is reduced by any by-product revenue and is then divided by ounces sold to arrive at the total by-product cash cost of sales. The measure, along with sales, is considered to be a key indicator of a company’s ability to generate operating earnings and cash flow from its mining operations. This data is furnished to provide additional information and is a non-IFRS measure. Total cash cost presented do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other mining companies. It should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and is not necessarily indicative of operating costs presented under IFRS.

	(All dollar figures are in US dollars unless otherwise indicated)

	New Afton mill expansion remains on schedule and on budget for mid-2015
	commissioning





	"2014 was a very important year for our company,"
	stated Randall Oliphant, Executive Chairman. "Our operations achieved the lowest costs in our history. We also successfully
	advanced our portfolio of growth projects. We recently achieved a significant milestone with the receipt of the Rainy River environmental
	permits, we are on schedule for commissioning of the New Afton mill expansion in the middle of this year and we completed a scoping
	study for the C-zone which should extend New Afton's mine life."


	"New Gold is starting 2015 with strong momentum,"
	added Mr. Oliphant. "We are scheduled to increase production of all three metals we produce and, importantly, will do so while
	maintaining our low-cost position.  Our strategy is to move into longer lived, larger scale and lower cost operations. We
	look forward to executing on this strategy through the development of Rainy River and our other projects."



	FINANCIAL UPDATE



	New Gold's 2014 year-end cash and cash equivalents were $371
	million. In addition, the company has a $300 million revolving credit facility of which $54 million has been used to issue letters
	of credit with the balance remaining undrawn. At the end of 2014, the face value of the company's long-term debt was $888 million
	(book value – $874 million). The components of the debt include: $300 million of 7.00% face value senior unsecured notes
	due in April of 2020, $500 million of 6.25% face value senior unsecured notes due in November of 2022, and $88 in El Morro funding
	loans, repayable out of a portion of New Gold's 30% share of El Morro cash flow upon the start of production. The company currently
	has approximately 508 million shares outstanding.


	As part of New Gold's annual year-end review, the company
	assesses the carrying value of its portfolio of assets. This assessment takes into account, among other things, the impact of lower
	commodity prices, the estimated timelines to production for development projects, current mineral reserves and resources and updated
	mine plans. Preliminary analysis indicates a likely reduction in the total carrying value of the company's assets of $350 to $450
	million, with the majority of this related to the company's Blackwater project.



	PRELIMINARY 2014 PRODUCTION AND COST RESULTS




	GOLD PRODUCTION



	The fourth quarter provided the company with its highest quarterly
	production of the year which led to full-year production meeting the company's guidance range of 380,000 to 420,000 ounces. Production
	during the quarter of 105,992 ounces remained consistent with the prior-year quarter, as scheduled increases in production at Mesquite
	and Cerro San Pedro were offset by a decrease in production at the Peak Mines due to unscheduled mill downtime. For the full year,
	increased production at New Afton was offset by an expected decrease in production at Cerro San Pedro, resulting in lower consolidated
	production relative to 2013.



	New Afton



	Gold production at New Afton during the fourth quarter of
	25,301 ounces remained consistent with the prior-year quarter as a 6% increase in tonnes processed offset a slight decrease in
	gold grade and lower recovery from the combination of the higher throughput and lower grade. 2014 full-year gold production of
	104,589 ounces increased by 20% relative to 2013. The increase in production was driven by the combination of a 17% increase in
	throughput and a 4% increase in grade, which was only partially offset by an expected 2% decrease in recovery stemming from the
	higher throughput. New Afton's full-year gold production was in the middle of its guidance range of 102,000 to 112,000 ounces.



	Mesquite



	Mesquite delivered its highest quarterly production of 2014
	in the fourth quarter. Production during the quarter of 36,235 ounces was 10,000 ounces higher than the third quarter of 2014 and
	also increased relative to the prior-year quarter. Fourth quarter production benefitted from a combination of an increase in ore
	tonnes placed on the leach pad and higher grade during the second half of 2014. Production during the year of 106,670 ounces remained
	consistent with 2013 as increased grade offset a 5% decrease in ore tonnes placed resulting from the focus on waste stripping in
	the first half of 2014. Mesquite's full-year production was below its guidance range of 113,000 to 123,000 ounces primarily as
	a result of a large number of recoverable ounces being placed on the leach pad towards the end of the year and thus not having
	sufficient time to fully work through the leach process. This has positively impacted production in early 2015 where Mesquite produced
	11,399 ounces of gold in January.

	Peak Mines



	Fourth quarter production at the Peak Mines was slightly below
	that of the prior-year quarter as a decrease in tonnes processed and grade was only partially offset by increased recovery. The
	13% decrease in tonnes processed was primarily a result of a total of seven days of unscheduled mill downtime during the quarter
	due to the combination of a SAG mill motor failure as well as a belt tear on the SAG mill feed conveyor later in the quarter. 2014
	full-year production of 99,030 ounces remained consistent with 2013, as increased grade and recovery offset a decrease in tonnes
	processed. Peak Mines' full-year gold production was in the middle of its guidance range of 95,000 to 105,000 ounces.



	Cerro San Pedro



	Cerro San Pedro finished 2014 with its strongest production
	quarter of the year. Production of 22,567 ounces increased by over 9,000 ounces relative to the third quarter of 2014 and remained
	consistent with the prior-year quarter. Fourth quarter production benefitted from a combination of an increase in ore tonnes placed
	on the leach pad and higher grade. As scheduled, production in 2014 was below that of 2013 due to a combination of lower ore tonnes
	placed on the leach pad, resulting from a focus on waste stripping, and lower grade. 2014 was a transition year for the mine, as
	the company embarked on a heavy waste stripping initiative through the first eight months of the year to position Cerro San Pedro
	for its final year of active mining in 2015. Cerro San Pedro's full-year gold production was at the low end of its guidance range
	of 70,000 to 80,000 ounces.


	"We are proud of the way our teams adapted to deliver
	gold production within our guidance range, despite the challenges faced at Mesquite with respect to the timing of ounces being
	loaded to the pad and at the Peak Mines with the unexpected mill downtime late in 2014," stated David Schummer, Executive
	Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. "Since joining New Gold in September, I have had the opportunity to gain a solid
	understanding of our portfolio of assets. I look forward to working with our team to unlock the additional opportunities we have
	identified for further operational improvement."



	COPPER PRODUCTION



	Consolidated copper production in the fourth quarter remained
	consistent with the prior-year quarter, driven by continued solid performances from both New Afton and the Peak Mines. On a consolidated
	basis, 2014 full-year copper production of 101.5 million pounds increased by 19% relative to 2013 and exceeded the company's guidance
	range of 92 to 100 million pounds. 2014 full-year copper production at New Afton of 84.5 million pounds increased by 17% as a result
	of higher tonnes processed and exceeded its guidance range of 78 to 84 million pounds. At the same time, production at the Peak
	Mines of 17.0 million pounds increased by 27% as higher copper grade and recovery more than offset lower tonnes processed, which
	resulted in the mine exceeding its guidance range of 14 to 16 million pounds. 



	SILVER PRODUCTION



	Consolidated fourth quarter silver production remained consistent
	with the prior-year quarter. Cerro San Pedro's 2014 full-year silver production of 1.1 million ounces met the low end of its guidance
	range and was slightly below that of the prior year due to a combination of lower ore tonnes placed and lower grade. The small
	silver contributions from New Afton and the Peak Mines were both in line with expectations resulting in consolidated silver production
	of 1.45 million ounces meeting the guidance range of 1.35 to 1.75 million ounces.



	ALL-IN SUSTAINING COSTS

	(1)

	AND TOTAL CASH COSTS

	(2)




	New Gold continued to solidify its position as one of the
	lowest cost producers in the industry during 2014. As a result of New Gold's solid operating performance, 2014 full-year all-in
	sustaining costs

	(1)

	decreased by $120 per ounce relative to 2013, including a $65 per ounce decrease in total cash costs

	(2)

	.
	Importantly, these cost reductions were realized despite the decrease in by-product copper and silver prices relative to 2013.
	The company's 2014 all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	of $779 per ounce were below the guidance range of $815 to $835 per ounce.
	Total cash costs

	(2)

	of $312 per ounce were a record low for New Gold and were also below the guidance range of $320
	to $340 per ounce.



	New Afton



	Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	at New
	Afton decreased relative to the prior-year quarter as a planned $18 million decrease in sustaining capital expenditures more than
	offset the increase in total cash costs

	(2)

	. The increase in total cash costs

	(2)

	relative to the fourth quarter
	of 2013 was primarily attributable to the $5 million decrease in by-product revenue due to the lower copper price. For the full
	year, all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	at New Afton of ($650) per ounce were below the guidance range of ($620) to ($600)
	per ounce while total cash costs

	(2)

	of ($1,248) per ounce were within the guidance range of ($1,260) to ($1,240) per
	ounce as increased copper sales volumes offset the impact of the realized copper price being lower than the price assumed at the
	beginning of 2014. New Afton's 2014 full-year operating cost, including mining, processing and general and administrative costs,
	averaged $17.35 per tonne. New Afton's 2014 sustaining capital expenditures of $61 million were in line with guidance.


	New Afton's fourth quarter co-product cash costs

	(2)

	remained consistent with the prior-year quarter at $395 per ounce of gold and $1.00 per pound of copper. Further, as a result of
	the decrease in quarterly sustaining capital expenditures, the mine's fourth quarter co-product all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	decreased significantly to $603 per ounce of gold and $1.52 per pound of copper from $822 per ounce of gold and $2.27 per pound
	of copper in the prior-year quarter.


	2014 full-year co-product costs were below those of 2013,
	with co-product cash costs

	(2)

	of $409 per ounce of gold and $0.99 per pound of copper coming in below the guidance ranges
	of $440 to $460 per ounce of gold and $1.10 to $1.20 per pound. 2014 full-year co-product all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	were $610 per ounce of gold and $1.48 per pound of copper.



	Mesquite



	Driven by stronger gold production, Mesquite's fourth quarter
	total cash costs

	(2)

	of $852 per ounce were the lowest of 2014 and remained consistent with the prior-year quarter. All-in
	sustaining costs

	(1)

	were down significantly from the second and third quarters of 2014, however, increased relative
	to the fourth quarter of 2013 due to a planned $3 million increase in sustaining capital expenditures. 2014 full-year total cash
	costs

	(2)

	of $909 per ounce were consistent with 2013 and below the guidance range of $930 to $950 per ounce as costs
	benefitted from a combination of lower total tonnes moved and lower diesel prices. All-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	for the
	full year were also below the guidance range of $1,310 to $1,330 per ounce. Full-year sustaining capital expenditures of $33 million
	were $7 million below guidance as a portion of the planned capital for the leach pad expansion was rescheduled to 2015.



	Peak Mines



	Fourth quarter total cash costs

	(2)

	at the Peak
	Mines decreased relative to the prior-year quarter driven by a combination of the depreciation of the Australian dollar and increased
	copper by-product revenue. Quarterly all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	increased when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013
	due to a planned $5 million increase in sustaining capital expenditures.


	For the full year, both all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	of $1,025 per ounce and total cash costs

	(2)

	of $658 per ounce were well below those of 2013 driven by a combination
	of increased productivity, the depreciation of the Australian dollar, a $7 million increase in copper by-product revenue and a
	$13 million decrease in sustaining capital and exploration expenditures. While Peak Mines' 2014 total cash costs

	(2)

	were slightly above the guidance range of $630 to $650 per ounce, all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	were below the range of
	$1,065 to $1,085 per ounce, as 2014 sustaining capital expenditures of $36 million were below the $40 million guidance for 2014.



	Cerro San Pedro



	Total cash costs

	(2)

	in the fourth quarter were
	above the prior-year quarter due to a combination of increased reagent costs, lower silver by-product revenue and lower gold sales
	volumes. Driven by the increase in total cash costs

	(2)

	, all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	were also higher than
	the fourth quarter of 2013 despite a $3 million decrease in sustaining capital expenditures. 2014 full-year costs increased relative
	to 2013 for reasons consistent with those noted above regarding the fourth quarter. Cerro San Pedro's 2014 total cash costs

	(2)

	were above the guidance range of $1,030 to $1,050 per ounce due to the combination of increased reagent costs and lower silver
	by-product revenue. All-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	exceeded the guidance range of $1,125 to $1,145 per ounce driven by total
	cash costs

	(2)

	, which form a component of all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	, being above the guidance. Cerro San
	Pedro's 2014 sustaining capital expenditures of $7 million were in line with guidance.

	CONSOLIDATED PRODUCTION AND COSTS



	In 2015, New Gold is scheduled to deliver production increases
	in all three of the metals that the company produces. Consolidated gold production is expected to increase approximately 8% relative
	to 2014, driven by targeted production increases at three of the company's four operations. At the same time, copper production
	is scheduled to increase by approximately 4% with the benefit of the mill expansion at New Afton, and silver production should
	increase by over 25% as Cerro San Pedro places more ore on the leach pad.


	The company's 2015 all-in sustaining cash costs

	(1)

	are expected to remain among the lowest in the industry and stay consistent with the low costs of $779 per ounce achieved in 2014.
	Total cash costs

	(2)

	, which form a component of all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	, are expected to increase slightly
	when compared to $312 per ounce in 2014. This is driven by the combination of the increased production weighting from the company's
	higher cost mines and the lower by-product pricing assumptions for 2015 of $2.75 per pound of copper and $16.00 per ounce of silver
	relative to the prices of $3.02 per pound of copper and $18.86 per ounce of silver realized in 2014. At the same time, the 2015
	assumptions for the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Mexican peso exchange rates of $1.25, $1.25 and $15.00 to the U.S. dollar,
	as well as a $2.25 per gallon assumption for Mesquite's diesel price, should benefit costs relative to the actual 2014 rates.


	New Gold's 2015 cumulative sustaining capital, exploration,
	general and administrative, and amortization of reclamation expenditures are scheduled to be approximately $65 per ounce below
	those of 2014.


	Consistent with previous years, New Gold's 2015 full-year
	production is not scheduled to be evenly distributed across the four quarters. The first half of 2015 is expected to contribute
	approximately 45% of the full-year production, with the balance of the production scheduled for the second half of the year.

	New Afton



	Gold production at New Afton is expected to increase by approximately
	5% in 2015 and copper production is scheduled to increase by approximately 6%. The targeted increase in production of both metals
	is driven by the planned increase in throughput resulting from the completion of the mill expansion project which remains on schedule
	for commissioning in mid-2015. Gold and copper grades as well as recoveries are expected to remain in line with those realized
	in 2014.


	New Afton's all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	and total
	cash costs

	(2)

	, whether measured on a by-product or co-product basis, are expected to remain among the lowest in the
	industry. The increase in total cash costs

	(1)

	relative to ($1,248) per ounce in 2014 is attributable to the combination
	of the lower copper price assumption and the increase in processing costs per tonne upon completion of the mill expansion. These
	cost impacts are expected to be partially offset by the assumption of a lower Canadian dollar relative to the average 2014 foreign
	exchange rate of C$1.10/US$. 2015 sustaining capital expenditures are estimated to be $55 million, or $500 per ounce, which includes
	$35 million of underground development and $8 million for a tailings lift.


	On a co-product basis, New Afton's targeted 2015 all-in sustaining
	costs

	(1)

	of $575 to $615 per ounce of gold and $1.30 to $1.45 per pound of copper are expected to remain in line with
	those achieved in 2014. Similarly, co-product total cash costs

	(2)

	of $400 to $440 per ounce of gold and $0.90 to $1.05
	per pound of copper also remain comparable to 2014.


	The mill expansion project remains on schedule for a mid-2015
	commissioning. After spending $20 million on the project in 2014, an additional $20 million of capital expenditures are estimated
	for the first half of the year. In total, the expansion project is expected to come in below the original $45 million cost estimate
	driven by the depreciation of the Canadian dollar and the likelihood that the estimated contingency may not be required.


	Looking forward to 2016 and 2017, New Afton should maintain
	its strong performance. Annual gold production is expected to average approximately 90,000 ounces as a scheduled decrease in gold
	grade is partially offset by higher mill throughput. At the same time, copper production should remain at approximately 90 million
	pounds per year.   



	Mesquite



	Production at Mesquite in 2015 is scheduled to increase by
	approximately 8% driven by an expected increase in gold grade. Ore tonnes placed on the leach pad and recovery are expected to
	remain in line with 2014 levels.


	Mesquite's total cash costs

	(2)

	are expected to
	be approximately $35 per ounce above the $909 per ounce achieved in 2014 as the mine is scheduled to move approximately 15% more
	total tonnes than in the prior year. The cost impact of this increased mining activity is expected to be partially offset by the
	diesel price assumption of $2.25 per gallon relative to an average price paid in 2014 of $3.12 per gallon, as well as increased
	production. Sustaining capital expenditures are expected to be $40 million in 2015 which includes $25 million for the expansion
	of the leach pad and $15 million for major equipment components and repairs. As previously noted, $7 million of the 2015 capital
	has been carried forward from 2014. Sustaining capital per ounce is expected to remain consistent with 2014 and, as a result, the
	change in all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	relative to 2014 is primarily attributable to the above-noted increase in total
	cash costs

	(2)

	.


	In 2016 and 2017, Mesquite is expected to average production
	of approximately 150,000 ounces per year at weighted average all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	of $800 per ounce. This improved
	performance is scheduled to be driven by the combination of increases in ore tonnes placed on the leach pad, grade moving to reserve
	grade and sustaining capital expenditures decreasing to an average of $12 million per year.



	Peak Mines



	Gold production at the Peak Mines is expected to be slightly
	below that of 2014, as a scheduled increase in tonnes processed is expected to be more than offset by gold grade moving toward
	reserve grade. Copper production should remain in line with 2014 as the planned increase in mill throughput and decrease in copper
	grade should offset.


	All-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	are scheduled to be
	in line with the $1,025 per ounce achieved in 2014, while total cash costs

	(2)

	are expected to increase slightly relative
	to the prior year as the benefit of the lower Australian dollar assumption only partially offsets the combined unfavourable impact
	of the lower copper price assumption and lower gold production. 2015 sustaining capital expenditures, including exploration expense,
	are expected to be $30 million representing a 17% decrease from 2014.


	In 2016, the company anticipates continued steady performance
	from the Peak Mines. As the mine moves through 2016 into 2017, the current mine plan estimates that an increasing percentage of
	ore could be sourced from the copper-rich ore bodies, resulting in increased copper production with an offsetting decrease in gold
	production. Ultimately, the mine plan in future periods will be re-optimized given the potential for the Peak Mines to continue
	its history of successful underground resource delineation. Annual sustaining capital costs are expected to average approximately
	$25 million over the two-year period.



	Cerro San Pedro



	Cerro San Pedro's final year of active mining is scheduled
	to deliver an approximate 35% increase in gold production coupled with an even greater increase in silver production. The increase
	in production of both metals is driven by a combination of an expected 30% increase in ore tonnes placed on the leach pad and higher
	gold and silver grades. For gold, these benefits are partially offset by the planned processing of ore with lower expected recoveries.


	All-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	of $1,005 to $1,045
	per ounce, as well as total cash costs

	(2)

	, are expected to be well below those of 2014. The decrease in total cash costs

	(2)

	is driven by the combination of the higher silver by-product revenue and increased gold production, while all-in sustaining cash
	costs

	(1)

	are expected to further benefit from sustaining capital expenditures decreasing to $2 million.


	After 2015, Cerro San Pedro is scheduled to transition into
	residual leaching. Gold production from residual leaching in 2016 is expected to be approximately 30% of the targeted 2015 production,
	with 2017 expected to be 30% of 2016 production. At the same time, as silver leaches over a longer time period, 2016 silver production
	is expected to be approximately 75% of the targeted 2015 production, with 2017 expected to be 60% of 2016 production. At today's
	metal prices, the cash flow during the residual leach period is expected to exceed Cerro San Pedro's mine closure costs.



	PROJECTS UPDATE




	RAINY RIVER



	At New Gold's Rainy River project, located in northwestern
	Ontario, two key permitting milestones were achieved on schedule in January 2015. The Federal and Provincial governments approved
	the project's Environmental Assessment which now enables the processing of construction-related permits. Site clearing is expected
	to commence in the coming weeks.

	Though the timing of receipt of Rainy River's environmental
	approvals was consistent with the company's project timeline, to maintain its financial flexibility, New Gold has decided to extend
	the originally planned construction timeline by six months. New Gold now plans to construct Rainy River over a 30-month period,
	instead of the 24-month period contemplated in the January 2014 Feasibility Study, resulting in commissioning being targeted in
	mid-2017.


	In addition to permitting, one of the primary areas of focus
	in 2014 was the advancement of detailed engineering. As of the end of January 2015 detailed engineering was 70% complete. Through
	the detailed engineering process, elements of the project scope and related capital estimates were refined. The key updates include
	the addition of temporary accommodations and related services during the construction period in order to best support project execution
	($39 million), additional access roads and adjustments to the tailings facility construction ($12 million), further strengthening
	construction management support ($11 million) and the addition of an escalation factor to account for any unexpected increases
	to costs of materials or services during the development period ($15 million). In aggregate, the capital cost impact of these adjustments
	has been more than offset by the impact of the continued depreciation of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. At the
	company's assumed exchange rate of C$1.25/US$, Rainy River's development capital cost estimate, inclusive of the $69 million spent
	in 2014, is $877 million. The estimated remaining development capital is $808 million.


	At the end of 2014, the company had made C$225 million of
	capital purchase commitments, including C$71 million for the initial mining fleet and related equipment and C$85 million for process
	plant equipment and motors. In 2015, New Gold's planned capital expenditures at Rainy River are $300 million which is approximately
	$120 million lower than the capital that was estimated for 2015 under the 24-month Feasibility Study construction schedule. Capital
	expenditures in 2015 are scheduled to include: payments upon delivery of the above-noted equipment, land clearing, including power
	line right of way, temporary accommodations, road building, pouring of concrete foundation and erecting steel for the mill building
	as well as the construction of a waterline, pump station and initial tailings dam foundation.


	Under the 30-month construction schedule, the company is targeting
	first production from Rainy River in mid-2017. Over its first nine years of full production, the 21,000 tonne per day, combined
	open pit-underground operation is scheduled to produce an average of 325,000 ounces of gold per year. At the company's assumed
	exchange rate of C$1.25/US$, all-in sustaining costs

	(1)

	average $658 per ounce over the first nine years of the
	project's life.


	"We have made significant progress in the advancement
	of Rainy River over the last year," stated Robert Gallagher, President and Chief Executive Officer. "By working closely
	with our First Nations and Métis partners as well as other local stakeholders, we recently achieved a significant milestone
	with the Federal and Provincial governments' approval of the project's Environmental Assessment. With Rainy River now almost fully
	engineered, we look forward to moving forward and executing on a successful development as we did most recently with New Afton."


	Overall, the Rainy River project enhances New Gold's growth
	pipeline through its manageable capital costs, significant production scale at below current industry average costs and exciting
	regional exploration potential in a great mining jurisdiction. The company looks forward to advancing the Rainy River project and
	providing further updates on its development through the remainder of 2015 and beyond.



	BLACKWATER



	The company's Blackwater project is located in south-central
	British Columbia. Once in production, Blackwater is expected to produce an average of 485,000 ounces of gold per year at below
	industry average costs. Consistent with Rainy River, the depreciation of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar benefits
	both Blackwater's development and operating costs as well as the project's economics.


	In the current commodity price environment, New Gold plans
	to sequence the development of its projects with the near-term focus being on the advancement of the lower capital cost Rainy River
	project. Thereafter, the timing of Blackwater's development will be driven by prevailing market conditions over the coming years.


	Capital expenditures during 2014 were $13 million which primarily
	related to the continued advancement of the environmental assessment process and related environmental and engineering studies.
	2014 spending was more than offset by the receipt of a British Columbia mining and exploration tax credit of C$22 million related
	to exploration work the company completed in 2012. Capital expenditures in 2015 are scheduled to be $8 million with New Gold's
	focus being to advance the project through the permitting phase.

	New Gold is pleased to report the results of the scoping study
	the company completed to evaluate the potential for the New Afton C-zone to extend the mine's life. The C-zone is the down plunge

	The scoping study relates to the economic potential of the
	C-zone mineral resources at the New Afton property and is not part of, and should be distinguished from, the current mining of
	the B-zone reserves. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The reader is
	cautioned that a scoping study is preliminary in nature and accordingly subject to a high degree of uncertainty. A preliminary
	and/or definitive feasibility study will be required to further evaluate the C-zone project's economics.


	The scoping study was prepared by New Gold with Roscoe Postle
	Associates Inc. ("RPA") providing an independent third party review. The independent Qualified Persons who reviewed and
	approved the disclosure contained on the C-zone scoping study included in this news release were David W. Rennie, P.Eng., Principal
	Geologist, RPA; Holger Krutzellmann, P.Eng.  Associate Principal Metallurgist, RPA; and R. Dennis Bergen, P.Eng., Associate
	Principal Mining Engineer, RPA.


	Based on the results of the scoping study, New Gold is targeting
	the completion of a feasibility study in the first quarter of 2016. Subject to the completion of a positive feasibility study,
	a development decision by the company and receipt of the requisite permits, development of the C-zone could begin in 2017, with
	the main access ramps being completed by the end of 2020. Thereafter, development of the block cave production levels would begin.
	The C-zone extraction level would be approximately 550 metres below the current B-zone extraction level. Based on this development
	schedule, production could begin in early 2023 with an 18-month ramp up to full production in mid-2024. One of the opportunities
	that the company will pursue as the access ramps are developed is to further drill test the C-zone to expand and upgrade the resource
	classification of the minable tonnage. The deposit remains open at depth and to the west.


	Operationally, the same development, production and materials
	handling strategies would be used for the C-zone as are currently being used to mine the New Afton B-zone reserve. The majority
	of the mobile mining equipment would be taken from the current operation, with estimated refurbishment and replacement requirements
	factored into the capital cost estimate.


	A first phase metallurgical program that was designed to assess
	the amenability of the C-zone ore to be processed via the current mill flowsheet was successful. The mill recoveries are expected
	to be similar to those achieved since the start of commercial production at New Afton in mid-2012.


	After assessing various tailings storage options for the C-zone,
	it was concluded that the optimal approach would likely involve the expansion of the current New Afton tailings storage facility.


	Beyond the tailings storage plan, one of the key focuses of
	the scoping study was to begin to assess the impact that the surface subsidence from the C-zone underground mine could have on
	surface infrastructure. Detailed modelling was completed to estimate the area of subsidence and it was determined that a portion
	of the tailings dam from the historic Afton mine is located within the predicted area of subsidence. To mitigate the potential
	risk associated with the historic tailings, it is anticipated that the tailings would be stabilized within the existing facility
	through a dewatering and consolidation program. New Gold holds an option to acquire the land on which the historic tailings are
	located. As the company moves towards the completion of a feasibility study, additional studies and testwork will be completed
	on the tailings stabilization plan.


	It is expected that the permits for the C-zone project will
	involve amendments to current permits rather than applications for new permits. The project plan should not result in significant
	additional surface disturbance or environmental impact. In addition, the project would not require additional annual water consumption
	as the mill throughput is not scheduled to change. The currently contemplated closure plan for New Afton would remain in place
	for the C-zone project with an amendment made to incorporate the historic tailings. The incremental costs associated with any amendments
	to the closure plan have been included in the project economics.


	In 2015, the company has planned capital expenditures of $5
	million to further advance the C-zone project toward a feasibility study. Work during the year will include additional subsidence
	modeling, completion of a tailings stabilization test program as well as other supporting studies. New Gold looks forward to providing
	updates on the continued progress of the C-zone project.


	The key parameters and assumptions associated with the C-zone
	scoping study do not impact the current New Afton mining operation or the New Afton B-zone mineral reserves.


	The scoping study discussed above is based on measured, indicated
	and inferred resources and is preliminary in nature. Accordingly, the scoping study is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
	The scoping study includes mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied
	to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves and there is no certainty the scoping study will be realized.



	EL MORRO



	New Gold's share of the El Morro project provides the company
	with a 30% fully-carried interest in a world-class copper-gold project in north-central Chile. Under the terms of New Gold's agreement
	with Goldcorp Inc. ("Goldcorp"), Goldcorp is responsible for funding New Gold's full 30% share of capital costs. The
	carried funding accrues interest at a fixed rate of 4.58%. New Gold will repay its share of capital plus accumulated interest out
	of 80% of its share of the project's cash flow with New Gold retaining 20% of its share of cash flow from the time production commences.


	On November 7, 2014, Goldcorp announced that it had withdrawn
	the Environmental Impact Study ("EIS") for the El Morro project. The decision was made after an October 7, 2014 ruling
	by the Chilean Supreme Court that invalidated the EIS. Since that time, the El Morro project team has continued to progress its
	studies to determine the optimal development plan for the El Morro project.


	El Morro remains one of the highest-grade undeveloped copper-gold
	porphyry deposits in the world. At December 31, 2014, New Gold's 30% share of the project contained proven and probable gold reserves
	of 2.7 million ounces and proven and probable copper reserves of 2.0 billion pounds. In addition, the broader El Morro land package
	totals 417 square kilometres with significant continued exploration potential.

	2014 YEAR-END MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES



	As part of New Gold's estimate of 2014 year-end mineral reserves
	and resources, the company lowered the prices used to estimate mineral reserves by $100 per ounce to $1,200 per ounce of gold for
	all of its assets with the exception of El Morro, and by $4 per ounce to $18 per ounce of silver. The reserve pricing assumption
	for copper was held at $3.00 per pound.


	New Gold has also revised its approach to the reporting of
	Measured and Indicated resources. Measured and Indicated resources are now reported exclusive of mineral reserves and New Gold
	intends to present mineral resources on that basis going forward. For general comparison purposes only, the 2013 year-end Measured
	and Indicated resources, which are exclusive of reserves, were calculated by subtracting the contained metal for 2013 year-end
	mineral reserves from the 2013 year-end measured and indicated resources, inclusive of reserves.


	On a consolidated basis, the 0.9 million ounce, or 5%, decrease
	in gold mineral reserves to 17.6 million ounces is primarily attributable to depletion of over 0.5 million ounces resulting from
	2014 mining activity at the company's four operating mines. The balance of 0.4 million ounces is a result of the combination of
	the lower reserve price assumptions and resulting changes to mineral resource block model estimates and updated mine plans. The
	majority of the change in copper mineral reserves was also driven by depletion. The change in consolidated Measured and Indicated
	gold resources, exclusive of reserves, was primarily attributable to a reduction of Mesquite's mineral resource inventory which
	mostly consisted of transitional and sulphide material.


	The 2014 year-end Proven and Probable mineral reserves for
	New Gold's three projects remained unchanged at 14.6 million ounces of gold, 2.0 billion pounds of copper and 70.2 million ounces
	of silver. In addition, early in 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Bayfield which will add to the company's gold and
	silver mineral resource inventory at Rainy River.


	At New Afton, beyond 2014 mine depletion, approximately two
	million tonnes of marginal low grade material were removed from the reserve as a result of mine plan optimization. New Afton's
	Measured and Indicated mineral resources increased during 2014, driven by a more than 50% increase in the C-zone resource contained
	gold and copper.


	The 0.6 million ounce change in Mesquite's 2014 year-end mineral
	reserves was driven by 0.2 million ounces of mine depletion with the balance due to the combination of lower reserve pricing, the
	results of infill drilling to improve resource confidence and reduced slope angles for certain pit walls. At Cerro San Pedro, the
	majority of the 0.2 million ounce decline in reserves was due to mine depletion with the remaining amount driven by the removal
	of approximately four million tonnes of low grade material from the mine plan.


	At the Peak Mines, the company was once again successful in
	replacing a significant portion of the material that was mined in 2014. Production at the Peak Mines in 2014 was 99,030 ounces
	of gold and 17.0 million pounds of copper and through its exploration efforts the company's 2014 year-end gold and copper mineral
	reserves decreased by less than 10% relative to the end of 2013.



	2015 EXPLORATION PLANS



	New Gold's 2015 exploration program will primarily be focused
	on three assets, Rainy River, the Peak Mines and Blackwater, with scheduled exploration spending totaling up to $17 million, of
	which $11 million is expected to be expensed.


	At Rainy River, one of the successes of the company's 2014
	exploration efforts was the identification of a new prospective volcanic massive sulphide ("VMS") horizon to the south
	of the ODM and Intrepid zones. In 2015, New Gold plans to continue exploring this prospective horizon as well as other discrete
	high-grade VMS-style targets within the greater Rainy River property position.


	Consistent with prior years, the objective at the Peak Mines
	in 2015 is to further the mine's history of mineral reserve and resource replacement. A total of 53,000 metres of underground exploration
	is planned with an additional 7,000 metres of surface exploration drilling scheduled. The surface exploration will test targets
	both along the mine corridor as well as priority regional prospects.


	At Blackwater, the primary focus will be on following up on
	the porphyry and epithermal-style mineralization that was identified in the area immediately to the south of the main Blackwater
	deposit in 2014. Additional surface mapping and geophysical targeting work is planned to further test this area. Depending on the
	results of this targeting, it may be followed by a 3,000 to 5,000 metre reconnaissance drill program.



	WEBCAST AND CONFERENCE CALL



	A webcast and conference call to discuss the 2014 fourth quarter
	and full year operational results as well as 2015 guidance will be held on Thursday, February 5, 2015 beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern
	time. Participants may listen to the webcast by registering here or from our website at www.newgold.com. You may also listen to
	the conference by calling toll-free 1-888-231-8191 or 1-647-427-7450 outside of Canada and the U.S. A recorded playback of the
	call will be available until March 5, 2015 by calling toll-free 1-855-859-2056, or 1-416-849-0833 outside of Canada and the U.S.,

	New Gold reports its Measured and Indicated mineral resources exclusive of mineral reserves. Measured and Indicated mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Inferred mineral resources have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence, economic and legal feasibility, do not have demonstrated economic viability, and are likewise exclusive of mineral reserves.

	Mineral resources are classified as Measured, Indicated and Inferred resources and are reported based on technical and economic parameters consistent with the methods most suitable for their potential commercial exploitation. Where different mining and/or processing methods might be applied to different portions of a mineral resource, the designators 'open pit' and 'underground' have been applied to indicate envisioned mining method. Likewise the designators 'oxide', 'non-oxide' and 'sulphide' have been applied to indicate the type of  mineralization as it relates to appropriate mineral processing method and expected payable metal recoveries. Mineral reserves and mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing and other risks and relevant issues. Additional details regarding mineral reserve and mineral resource estimation, classification, reporting parameters, key assumptions and associated risks for each of New Gold's material properties are provided in the respective NI 43-101 Technical Reports which are available at

	www.sedar.com

	.

	Qualified Person: The preparation of New Gold's mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates has been done by Qualified Persons as defined under NI 43-101, under the oversight and review of Mr. Mark A. Petersen, a Qualified Person under NI 43-101.

	estimates; grades expected to be mined at the company's operations; the expected production, costs, economics and operating parameters
	of the Rainy River project; planned activities for 2015 and beyond at the company's operations and projects, as well as planned
	exploration activities and expenses; the results of the C-zone study, including operating parameters and expected mine life, production,
	costs and project economics; plans to advance the C-zone project, including permitting requirements, impact on the historic tailings

	All forward-looking statements in this news release are based
	on the opinions and estimates of management as of the date such statements are made and are subject to important risk factors and
	uncertainties, many of which are beyond New Gold's ability to control or predict. Certain material assumptions regarding such forward-looking
	statements are discussed in this news release, New Gold's annual and quarterly management's discussion and analysis ("MD&A"),
	its Annual Information Form and its Technical Reports filed at www.sedar.com. In addition to, and subject to, such assumptions
	discussed in more detail elsewhere, the forward-looking statements in this news release are also subject to the following assumptions:
	(1) there being no significant disruptions affecting New Gold's operations; (2) political and legal developments in jurisdictions
	where New Gold operates, or may in the future operate, being consistent with New Gold's current expectations; (3) the accuracy
	of New Gold's current mineral reserve and resource estimates; (4) the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar,
	Mexican peso and U.S. dollar being approximately consistent with current levels; (5) prices for diesel, natural gas, fuel oil,
	electricity and other key supplies being approximately consistent with current levels; (6) equipment, labour and materials costs
	increasing on a basis consistent with New Gold's current expectations; (7) arrangements with First Nations and other Aboriginal
	groups in respect of Rainy River and Blackwater being consistent with New Gold's current expectations; (8) all required permits,
	licenses and authorizations being obtained from the relevant governments and other relevant stakeholders within the expected timelines;
	(9) the results of the feasibility studies for the Rainy River and Blackwater projects being realized; and (10) in the case of
	production, cost and expenditure outlooks at operating mines for 2016 and 2017, additionally, commodity prices and exchange rates
	being consistent with those estimated for purposes of 2015 guidance.


	Forward-looking statements are necessarily based on estimates
	and assumptions that are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results,
	level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking
	statements. Such factors include, without limitation: significant capital requirements and the availability and management of capital
	resources; additional funding requirements; price volatility in the spot and forward markets for metals and other commodities;
	fluctuations in the international currency markets and in the rates of exchange of the currencies of Canada, the United States,
	Australia, Mexico and Chile; discrepancies between actual and estimated production, between actual and estimated reserves and resources
	and between actual and estimated metallurgical recoveries; changes in national and local government legislation in Canada, the
	United States, Australia, Mexico and Chile or any other country in which New Gold currently or may in the future carry on business;
	taxation; controls, regulations and political or economic developments in the countries in which New Gold does or may carry on
	business; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development, including the risks of obtaining and maintaining the validity
	and enforceability of the necessary licenses and permits and complying with the permitting requirements of each jurisdiction in
	which New Gold operates, including, but not limited to: in Canada, obtaining the necessary permits for the Rainy River and Blackwater
	projects; in Mexico, where Cerro San Pedro has a history of ongoing legal challenges related to our environmental authorization
	(EIS); and in Chile, where certain activities at El Morro have been delayed due to litigation relating to its environmental permit;
	the lack of certainty with respect to foreign legal systems, which may not be immune from the influence of political pressure,
	corruption or other factors that are inconsistent with the rule of law; the uncertainties inherent to current and future legal
	challenges New Gold is or may become a party to; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves and resources; competition; loss
	of key employees; rising costs of labour, supplies, fuel and equipment; actual results of current exploration or reclamation activities;
	uncertainties inherent to mining economic studies including the feasibility studies for Rainy River and Blackwater and the C-zone
	study; the uncertainty with respect to prevailing market conditions necessary for a positive development decision at Blackwater;
	changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined; accidents; labour disputes; defective title to mineral claims or
	property or contests over claims to mineral properties; unexpected delays and costs inherent to consulting and accommodating rights
	of First Nations and other Aboriginal groups; uncertainties with respect to obtaining all necessary surface and other land use
	rights or tenure for Rainy River; risks, uncertainties and unanticipated delays associated with obtaining and maintaining necessary
	licenses, permits and authorizations and complying with permitting requirements, including those associated with the environmental
	assessment process for Blackwater. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration,
	development and mining, including environmental events and hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures,
	cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance or inability to obtain insurance to cover these
	risks) as well as "Risk Factors" included in New Gold's disclosure documents filed on and available at www.sedar.com.


	Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance,
	and actual results and future events could materially differ from those anticipated in such statements. All of the forward-looking
	statements contained in this news release are qualified by these cautionary statements. New Gold expressly disclaims any intention
	or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, events or otherwise, except
	in accordance with applicable securities laws.



	CAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. READERS CONCERNING ESTIMATES OF
	MINERAL RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES



	Information concerning the properties and operations of New
	Gold has been prepared in accordance with Canadian standards under applicable Canadian securities laws, and may not be comparable
	to similar information for United States companies. The terms "Mineral Resource", "Measured Mineral Resource",
	"Indicated Mineral Resource" and "Inferred Mineral Resource" used in this news release are Canadian mining
	terms as defined in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM") Definition Standards for Mineral
	Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted by CIM Council on May 10, 2014 and incorporated by reference in National Instrument 43-101
	("NI 43-101").  While the terms "Mineral Resource", "Measured Mineral Resource", "Indicated
	Mineral Resource" and "Inferred Mineral Resource" are recognized and required by Canadian securities regulations,
	they are not defined terms under standards of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.  As such, certain information
	contained in this news release concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources under Canadian standards is not comparable
	to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the United
	States Securities and Exchange Commission.


	An "Inferred Mineral Resource" has a great amount
	of uncertainty as to its existence and as to its economic and legal feasibility.  Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred
	mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility of pre-feasibility studies.  It cannot be assumed that all or any
	part of an "Inferred Mineral Resource" will ever be upgraded to a higher confidence category.   Readers are
	cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an "Inferred Mineral Resource" exists or is economically or legally mineable.


	Under United States standards, mineralization may not be classified
	as a "Reserve" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced
	or extracted at the time the reserve estimation is made.  Readers are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the
	measured or indicated mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves. In addition, the definitions of "Proven
	Mineral Reserves" and "Probable Mineral Reserves" under CIM standards differ in certain respects from the standards
	of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.



	TECHNICAL INFORMATION



	The scientific and technical information in this news release
	has been reviewed and approved by Mark A. Petersen, Vice President, Exploration of New Gold. Mr. Petersen is an AIPG Certified
	Professional Geologist and a "Qualified Person" under National Instrument 43-101.



	NON-GAAP MEASURES



	(1) ALL-IN SUSTAINING COSTS

	Consistent with guidance announced in 2013 by the World Gold Council, an association of various gold mining companies from around
	the world of which New Gold is a member, New Gold defines "all-in sustaining costs" per ounce as the sum of total cash
	costs, capital expenditures that are sustaining in nature, corporate general and administrative costs, capitalized and expensed
	exploration that is sustaining in nature and environmental reclamation costs, all divided by the ounces of gold sold to arrive
	at a per ounce figure. New Gold believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides further transparency into costs associated with
	producing gold and will assist analysts, investors and other stakeholders of the company in assessing the company's operating performance,
	its ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and its overall value. This data is furnished to provide additional
	information and is a non-GAAP financial measure. All-in sustaining costs presented do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS
	and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other mining companies. It should not be considered in isolation or
	as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow from
	operations under IFRS or operating costs presented under IFRS. Further details regarding historical all-in sustaining costs and
	a reconciliation to the nearest IFRS measures are provided in the MD&A accompanying New Gold's financial statements filed from
	time to time on www.sedar.com.


	(2) TOTAL CASH COSTS

	"Total cash costs" per ounce figures are non-GAAP measures which are calculated in accordance with a standard developed
	by The Gold Institute, a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold products that ceased operations in 2002. Adoption
	of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
	companies. New Gold reports total cash costs on a sales basis. The company believes that certain investors use this information
	to evaluate the company's performance and ability to generate liquidity through operating cash flow to fund future capital expenditures
	and working capital needs.  This measure, along with sales, is considered to be a key indicator of the company's ability to
	generate operating earnings and cash flow from its mining operations. Total cash costs include mine site operating costs such as
	mining, processing and administration costs, royalties, production taxes, and realized gains and losses on fuel contracts, but
	are exclusive of amortization, reclamation, capital and exploration costs and net of by-product sales. Total cash costs are then
	divided by ounces of gold sold to arrive at a per ounce figure. Co-product cash costs remove the impact of other metal sales that
	are produced as a by-product of gold production and apportion the cash costs to each metal produced on a percentage of revenue
	basis, and subsequently divides the amount by the total ounces of gold or silver or pounds of copper sold, as the case may be,
	to arrive at per ounce or per pound figures. Unless otherwise indicated, all total cash cost information in this news release is
	net of by-product sales. This data is furnished to provide additional information and is a non-GAAP financial measure. Total cash
	costs and co-product cash costs presented do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures
	presented by other mining companies. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared
	in accordance with IFRS and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow from operations under IFRS or operating costs presented
	under GAAP. Further details regarding historical total cash costs and a reconciliation to the nearest IFRS measures are provided
	in the MD&A accompanying New Gold's financial statements filed from time to time on www.sedar.com.


	(3) AVERAGE REALIZED PRICE

	"Average realized price per ounce or pound sold" is a non-GAAP financial measure with no standard meaning under IFRS.
	Management uses this measure to better understand the price realized in each reporting period for gold, silver, and copper sales.
	Average realized price includes realized gains and losses from gold hedge settlements up until May 15, 2013 but excludes from revenues
	unrealized gains and losses on non-hedged derivative contracts and the revenue reduction related to the non-cash accounting charge
	as the loss incurred on the monetization of the company's legacy hedge position is realized into income over the original term
	of the hedge contract. Average realized price is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standardized
	definition under IFRS; it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance
	with IFRS. Other companies may calculate this measure differently and this measure is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures
	presented by other companies.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FORM 51-102F3
Material Change Report
 
Item 1.                                                         Name and Address of Company
 
New Gold Inc. (New Gold or the Company)  Suite 3510, 181 Bay Street
Toronto, Ontario M5J 2T3
 
Item 2.                                                         Date of Material Change
 
February 22, 2017
 
Item 3.                                                         News Release
 
A news release was issued by the Company on February 22, 2017 through the facilities of Canada News Wire and was subsequently filed on SEDAR.
 
Item 4.                                                         Summary of Material Change
 
On February 22, 2017, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters led by RBC Capital Markets and Scotiabank (collectively, the Underwriters), pursuant to which they agreed to purchase, on a bought deal basis, 53,600,000 common shares (Common Shares) of New Gold at a price of US$2.80 per share (the Offering), for aggregate gross proceeds to New Gold of approximately US$150 million.
 
Item 5.                                                         Full Description of Material Change
 
On February 22, 2017, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters led by RBC Capital Markets and Scotiabank, pursuant to which they agreed to purchase, on a bought deal basis, 53,600,000 Common Shares at a price of US$2.80 per Common Share for aggregate gross proceeds to New Gold of approximately US$150 million.
 
In addition, New Gold agreed to grant the Underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 8,040,000 Common Shares at a price of US$2.80 per share, on the same terms and conditions as the Offering, exercisable at any time, in whole or in part, until the date that is 30 days following the closing of the Offering (the Over-Allotment Option). On February 23, 2017, the Underwriters exercised the Over-Allotment Option and, as a result, the aggregate gross proceeds of the Offering to New Gold will be approximately US$172.6 million.
 
On February 23, 2017, the Company filed an amended and restated preliminary prospectus with securities regulatory authorities in all provinces and territories of Canada and in the United States with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as part of a registration statement on Form F-10.
 
New Gold intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering to finance the completion of the construction of the Rainy River gold project in Ontario, Canada. 
 





 
New Golds cash and cash equivalents balance and the net proceeds from the sale of New Golds gold stream on the El Morro project and the Offering, together with funds available for draw under New Golds secured revolving credit facility, are sufficient to complete construction of the Rainy River project based on current cost estimates.
 
The following directors and officers of New Gold, or associates thereof, have expressed an intention to participate in the Offering on the same terms as other investors, and are expected to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately 571,050 Common Shares, representing less than 1% of the aggregate Common Shares issuable pursuant to the Offering including the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option: David Emerson; James Estey; Vahan Kololian; Martyn Konig; Randall Oliphant; Ian Pearce; Kay Priestly; Raymond Threlkeld; Cory Atiyeh; Lisa Damiani; Brett Gagnon; Barry OShea; Brian Penny; Mark Petersen; Hannes Portmann; and Martin Wallace (the Board and Management Participation). The Board and Management Participation in the Offering will constitute related party transactions as defined in Multilateral Instrument 61-101  Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (MI 61-101).  However, the Board and Management Participation is not subject to the minority approval and formal valuation requirements under MI 61-101 as neither the fair market value of the Common Shares, nor the fair market value of the consideration for the Common Shares, insofar as it involves interested parties, exceeds 25% of New Golds market capitalization. The Company did not file a material change report 21 days prior to the expected closing date of the Offering as the details of the Board and Management Participation in the Offering were not known at that time. The Offering has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of the Company.
 
The Offering is scheduled to close on or about March 10, 2017, and is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary approvals including the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the NYSE-MKT and securities regulatory authorities.
 
Item 6.                                                         Reliance on subsection 7.1(2) of National Instrument 51-102
 
The report is not being field on a confidential basis.
 
Item 7.                                                         Omitted Information
 
No information has been omitted.
 
Item 8.                                                         Executive Officer
 
Lisa Damiani, Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary
(416) 324-6000
 
Item 9.                                                         Date of Report
 
March 2, 2017.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
 
Certain information contained in this material change report, including any information relating to New Golds future financial or operating performance are forward looking. All statements in this material change report, other than statements of historical fact, which address events, results, outcomes or developments that New Gold expects to occur are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts and are generally, but not always, identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as plans, expects, is expected, budget, scheduled, targeted, estimates, forecasts, intends, anticipates, projects, potential, believes or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results may, could, would, should, might or will be taken, occur or be achieved or the negative connotation of such terms. Forward- looking statements in this material change report include, among others, statements with respect to the use of the proceeds of the Offering, the anticipated benefits of the Offering, the completion of the Rainy River project, the sufficiency of funding to complete construction of the Rainy River project and  the ability of the parties to satisfy the conditions of and complete the Offering.
 
All forward-looking statements in this material change report are based on the opinions and estimates of management as of the date such statements are made and are subject to important risk factors and uncertainties, many of which are beyond New Golds ability to control or predict. The forward-looking statements in this material change report are based on certain key assumptions, including without limitation, the assumption that all conditions to closing of the Offering will be satisfied in a timely manner; all regulatory approvals will be obtained, no events will occur requiring the redirecting of the proceeds of the Offering or other sources of funding described herein towards other uses and that the cost estimates for the Rainy River project will be accurate. Certain other material assumptions regarding such forward-looking statements  are discussed in this material change report, New Golds annual and quarterly managements discussion and analysis, its Annual Information Form and its Technical Reports filed at www.sedar.com.
 
Forward-looking statements are necessarily based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, without limitation: not realizing the potential benefits of the Offering; all regulatory approvals not being obtained; the occurrence of events requiring the redirecting of the proceeds of the Offering or other sources of funding towards other uses; significant capital requirements and the availability and management of capital resources; additional funding requirements; price volatility in the spot and forward markets for metals and other commodities; fluctuations in the international currency markets and in the rates of exchange of the currencies of Canada, the United States, Australia and Mexico; discrepancies between actual and estimated production, between actual and estimated mineral reserves and mineral resources and between actual and estimated metallurgical recoveries; fluctuation in treatment and refining charges; changes in national and local government legislation; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development, including the risks of obtaining and maintaining the validity and enforceability of the necessary licenses and permits and complying with the permitting requirements of each jurisdiction in which New Gold operates, including, but not limited to: in Canada, obtaining the necessary permits for the Rainy River project; the uncertainties inherent to current and future legal challenges New Gold is or may become a party to; inherent uncertainties with cost estimates

and estimated schedule for the construction and commencement of production at Rainy River as contemplated; loss of key employees; rising costs of labour, supplies, fuel and equipment; actual results of current exploration or reclamation activities; uncertainties inherent to mining economic studies including the feasibility studies for the Rainy River project; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined; accidents; labour disputes; defective title to mineral claims or property or contests over claims to mineral properties; unexpected delays and costs inherent to consulting and accommodating rights of indigenous groups; risks, uncertainties and unanticipated delays associated with obtaining and maintaining necessary licenses, permits and authorizations and complying with permitting requirements, including those associated with the amendment to Schedule 2 of the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations for the Rainy River project. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental events and hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion losses and risks associated with the start of production of a mine, such as Rainy River, (and the risk of inadequate insurance or inability to obtain insurance to cover these risks) as well as Risk Factors included in New Golds disclosure documents filed on and available at www.sedar.com. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future events could materially differ from those anticipated in such statements. All of the forward-looking statements contained in this material change report are qualified by these cautionary statements. New Gold expressly disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, events or otherwise, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

						FAQ
					

Why should I invest in Gold?
There are many reasons, but there are 3 very important reasons why:
#1) All paper currencies always fail. There has never been a paper currency that has never failed. To the contrary, Gold has never failed and has been a consistent store of value throughout history.
#2) Countries and governments are buying Gold like crazy.
#3) Billionaires are buying Gold. There is a reason Billionaires are Billionaires and that is because they know how to invest. They are investing for their future with Gold.


Are there any other ways to invest in Gold other than owning physical Gold?
Yes! You could invest in exploration or mining companies. These companies do the hard work of exploring for Gold and producing Gold. They actually own physical Gold & Silver in the ground. So their share prices are directly correlated to the spot prices of Gold & Silver.
Here are the Stock ticker symbols which US investors may want to consider:
						   
Northern Dynasty Minerals (NAK) *** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ***
First Mining Finance Corp (FFMGF)
First Majestic Silver Corp (AG)
Callinex Mines Inc (CLLXF)
Brazil Minerals Inc (BMIX)
Gold Lakes Corp (GLLK)



How easy will it be to sell my physical Gold?
Very Easy! Gold is very liquid. That is, it is very easy to sell Gold to a buyer. Below are some of the places someone will be able to sell their physical Gold at.
Most reputable bullion dealers offer "buy back" programs. In other words, they will buy back whatever they have sold you. You would simply deliver the Gold to them, either in person or through insured mail, and they would pay you near spot price for your Gold.
Local pawn shops
Local classified ads (eg. Craigslist)
Local auctions
Local precious metals dealers & coin collecting shops
Online auctions (eg. Ebay, Ebid)
Depending on your location, even some banks may buy your Gold from you near spot price.


How can I safely store my physical Gold?
There are a few ways investors can do this:
Gold Depository - This is the most recommended method. Some examples are Delaware Depository and Transcontinental Depository Services. You could even get an overseas vault of your choice if buying your Gold online through BullionVault. Their vaults are audited daily, are anonymous, have low fees, and come with free insurance.
Home safe - A dual combination/key safe is recommended. Most electronic safes can be hacked too easily. And most combination safes can be opened by a professional quickly too. You want a heavy one. It would make little sense to have a light safe which someone could just run off with quickly. Also, it would make little sense to have a cheap safe that someone could crack open with a crow bar. So a sturdy, heavy, dual combination/key safe is recommended. You could even bolt it to the wall or floor for extra security. Or better yet, have it hidden inside your home somewhere. The idea is to make it as difficult as possible for a potential thief to take your Gold.
Local storage rental - You could keep your Gold inside a safe located inside your own storage unit at a local storage company. As long as you pay the fees and purchase renter's insurance, all should go well. Make sure they are a registered company, have 24/7 security cameras, and have restricted access (eg. fully fenced, locked doors). This method has 3 layers of protection. A potential thief would first need to get into the storage facility. Then they would need to get into your unit, which would be locked. Then they would need to get inside your safe which would be inside your unit. So a potential thief would have 3 layers of protection to get through until they get to your Gold.
Bank safety deposit box - These are secure and cheap. They typically cost around $100 per year. Disclosure requirements of contents is typically minimal or none. You could visit your bank during the week to check on your Gold too.
It is recommended you diversify your Gold into multiple locations. For example, you could keep 50% of your Gold in a Depository or Vault. And the other 50% can be split up between a home safe and a local storage unit. If you ever heard the saying, "Don't put all your eggs in one basket", this is exactly the time to apply this advice.


Should I invest in a Gold ETF instead of physical Gold?
There are certainly some advantages of investing in a Gold ETF. For example, they can be invested in just as easily as stocks can. Also, with an ETF there is no physical Gold that needs stored. However, investing in real physical Gold instead of an ETF is recommended. Here is why:
#1) Anything electronic can be hacked. Banks and companies get hacked on a daily basis nowadays. With enough experience and enough time, a hacker could possibly change or remove your ownership of the ETF. Real Gold in your possession cannot be hacked.
#2) During a major financial calamity, the stock exchanges can be suspended. This has happened in history. If this were to happen, you would not be able to do anything with your ETF investment. However, if you owned real physical Gold, you would be able to do whatever you want with your Gold!
#3) Your privacy is compromised. Any ETF must be traded through a registered broker-dealer who is required by law to know everything about you. They are required to report all trades to the government also. Which includes any profit you have made. Buying real Gold, whether it be allocated Gold held in a depository through BullionVault or a Bullion dealer such as Provident Metals, is more anonymous. They are not required to report anything to the government unless certain rare circumstances are met.
#4) Not all ETFs are even backed by real Gold. You would just be investing in something tied to the price of Gold, but not actual Gold itself.


What is better to invest in - bars or coins?
There are advantages to both and it just depends on your preference.
Bars are cheaper. So if you are looking to get more Gold for your money, bars are what you want. Bars usually will be encapsulated inside a plastic holder which will show information about the bar (eg. assayer, weight, serial number), but coins will not unless they have been certified. So if you want a more professional looking investment, bars are what you want.
Bars also are not mixed with other metals. Unlike coins which are sometimes mixed with other metals. So for the sake of efficiency and space, bars are the best choice.
The reason why coins are more expensive is because they not only have value from the Gold content, but because they also have numismatic value. In other words, people buy them as collectibles. Since they are more expensive upfront, they also have a potential to increase in value more than a bar would. If a certain coin becomes more in demand, the value of that coin will go up regardless of the metal content. So the potential to profit increases with coins.
Since coins are also collectibles, they are more liquid than bars. Which means you would have even less of a problem selling them later than you would with bars.
People already use coins to purchase things. Everybody knows what coins are and what can be done with them. So if there is ever a major catastrophe, coins would naturally be used to barter with before bars would.
If the government ever decides to ban ownership of Gold, there will a good chance there will be a loophole which would allow for people to own coins. Especially rare or old coins. Coins are minted by governments and are legal tender. So they have less of a chance of being banned later.
Coins have the potential to be graded and certified. When this is done, they are encapsulated inside a sturdy container which shows the coin information. When this is done, the coin increases in value and becomes a better investment. Nobody ever grades bars though.


In what economic conditions does Gold perform well?
It does well in ANY economic condition. 
Gold has historically risen during inflation, because it's price tends to rise as the cost of living increases.
Gold has historically done well even during deflation. Take the 'Great Depression' in the US during the 1930's as an example. During that time, the relative purchasing power of Gold soared while other prices sharply dropped.
Gold does well even when other investments do poorly. For example, during the past 50 years at times when the US stock market plunged, Gold soared higher.
Everybody knows what Gold is and it always maintains purchasing power. Even during a complete economic collapse, Gold can be used to barter with.


How can I keep my Gold overseas out of the USA?
We highly recommened BullionVault for this. You would be able to choose the location of your overseas vault. Or you could even store your Gold in multiple vaults. There are daily audits and the results are published daily right on their website. The vaults are secure and insurance is included. All Gold is real and fully allocated!


How do I set up a retirement account based on Gold?
It is an easy process. 
		                   Just contact AMERICAN BULLION.

Are there tax penalties for moving my existing retirement account into Gold?
No. The process you are referring to is usually called a "rollover" or "transfer". With this process, you will not incur any tax penalties.


What are the benefits of a self-directed IRA?
First, this is a great step in protecting your future! Secondly, depending on the type of IRA, there could be tax advantages (eg. tax-deferred or tax-free growth). We would recommend

What Gold Stocks do you recommend?
You could invest in exploration or mining companies. These companies do the hard work of exploring for Gold and producing Gold. They actually own physical Gold & Silver in the ground.
Here are the Stock ticker symbols which US investors may want to consider:
						   
Northern Dynasty Minerals (NAK) *** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ***
First Mining Finance Corp (FFMGF)
First Majestic Silver Corp (AG)
Callinex Mines Inc (CLLXF)
Brazil Minerals Inc (BMIX)
Gold Lakes Corp (GLLK)



Why is Northern Dynasty Minerals (NYSE MKT: NAK) recommended on your site?
The NAK Stock was added in early 2017 because it has been identified as a stock with a serious upside potential.
Below are several reasons to consider Northern Dynasty Minerals (NAK):
						   
They have the world's largest undeveloped copper & gold resource.
They have massive known resources - 6.44 Billion tonnes of Measured/Indicated and 4.46 Billion tonnes of Inferred.
They not only have Gold & Copper, but they also have massive reserves of Silver & Molybdenum.
The current value of one of their resources alone (eg. Silver) is worth many times their current market cap (as of July 2017).
They reached a settlement with the EPA and are their way to permitting, which ends the unfair treatment against them from the Obama era.
We now have an administration who understands and wants a fair, normal, and predictable permitting process for companies.
The state of Alaska, and the USA as a whole, needs the jobs and extra revenue that will be generated from their Pebble mine.
They are led by a professional and proven management team.
There is large institutional ownership (around 30% as of June 2017). When institutions invest, it is a good sign of things to come.
They have large insider ownership. When management invests in their own company, it is in their best interest to make the company succeed.
They will be finding partner(s) anytime now. It is planned to happen by end of Q3 2017. This will be a major catalyst for bullish stock movement.

						FAQ
					

Why should I invest in Gold?
There are many reasons, but there are 3 very important reasons why:
#1) All paper currencies always fail. There has never been a paper currency that has never failed. To the contrary, Gold has never failed and has been a consistent store of value throughout history.
#2) Countries and governments are buying Gold like crazy.
#3) Billionaires are buying Gold. There is a reason Billionaires are Billionaires and that is because they know how to invest. They are investing for their future with Gold.


Are there any other ways to invest in Gold other than owning physical Gold?
Yes! You could invest in exploration or mining companies. These companies do the hard work of exploring for Gold and producing Gold. They actually own physical Gold & Silver in the ground. So their share prices are directly correlated to the spot prices of Gold & Silver.
Here are the Stock ticker symbols which US investors may want to consider:
						   
Northern Dynasty Minerals (NAK) *** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ***
First Mining Finance Corp (FFMGF)
First Majestic Silver Corp (AG)
Callinex Mines Inc (CLLXF)
Brazil Minerals Inc (BMIX)
Gold Lakes Corp (GLLK)



How easy will it be to sell my physical Gold?
Very Easy! Gold is very liquid. That is, it is very easy to sell Gold to a buyer. Below are some of the places someone will be able to sell their physical Gold at.
Most reputable bullion dealers offer "buy back" programs. In other words, they will buy back whatever they have sold you. You would simply deliver the Gold to them, either in person or through insured mail, and they would pay you near spot price for your Gold.
Local pawn shops
Local classified ads (eg. Craigslist)
Local auctions
Local precious metals dealers & coin collecting shops
Online auctions (eg. Ebay, Ebid)
Depending on your location, even some banks may buy your Gold from you near spot price.


How can I safely store my physical Gold?
There are a few ways investors can do this:
Gold Depository - This is the most recommended method. Some examples are Delaware Depository and Transcontinental Depository Services. You could even get an overseas vault of your choice if buying your Gold online through BullionVault. Their vaults are audited daily, are anonymous, have low fees, and come with free insurance.
Home safe - A dual combination/key safe is recommended. Most electronic safes can be hacked too easily. And most combination safes can be opened by a professional quickly too. You want a heavy one. It would make little sense to have a light safe which someone could just run off with quickly. Also, it would make little sense to have a cheap safe that someone could crack open with a crow bar. So a sturdy, heavy, dual combination/key safe is recommended. You could even bolt it to the wall or floor for extra security. Or better yet, have it hidden inside your home somewhere. The idea is to make it as difficult as possible for a potential thief to take your Gold.
Local storage rental - You could keep your Gold inside a safe located inside your own storage unit at a local storage company. As long as you pay the fees and purchase renter's insurance, all should go well. Make sure they are a registered company, have 24/7 security cameras, and have restricted access (eg. fully fenced, locked doors). This method has 3 layers of protection. A potential thief would first need to get into the storage facility. Then they would need to get into your unit, which would be locked. Then they would need to get inside your safe which would be inside your unit. So a potential thief would have 3 layers of protection to get through until they get to your Gold.
Bank safety deposit box - These are secure and cheap. They typically cost around $100 per year. Disclosure requirements of contents is typically minimal or none. You could visit your bank during the week to check on your Gold too.
It is recommended you diversify your Gold into multiple locations. For example, you could keep 50% of your Gold in a Depository or Vault. And the other 50% can be split up between a home safe and a local storage unit. If you ever heard the saying, "Don't put all your eggs in one basket", this is exactly the time to apply this advice.


Should I invest in a Gold ETF instead of physical Gold?
There are certainly some advantages of investing in a Gold ETF. For example, they can be invested in just as easily as stocks can. Also, with an ETF there is no physical Gold that needs stored. However, investing in real physical Gold instead of an ETF is recommended. Here is why:
#1) Anything electronic can be hacked. Banks and companies get hacked on a daily basis nowadays. With enough experience and enough time, a hacker could possibly change or remove your ownership of the ETF. Real Gold in your possession cannot be hacked.
#2) During a major financial calamity, the stock exchanges can be suspended. This has happened in history. If this were to happen, you would not be able to do anything with your ETF investment. However, if you owned real physical Gold, you would be able to do whatever you want with your Gold!
#3) Your privacy is compromised. Any ETF must be traded through a registered broker-dealer who is required by law to know everything about you. They are required to report all trades to the government also. Which includes any profit you have made. Buying real Gold, whether it be allocated Gold held in a depository through BullionVault or a Bullion dealer such as Provident Metals, is more anonymous. They are not required to report anything to the government unless certain rare circumstances are met.
#4) Not all ETFs are even backed by real Gold. You would just be investing in something tied to the price of Gold, but not actual Gold itself.


What is better to invest in - bars or coins?
There are advantages to both and it just depends on your preference.
Bars are cheaper. So if you are looking to get more Gold for your money, bars are what you want. Bars usually will be encapsulated inside a plastic holder which will show information about the bar (eg. assayer, weight, serial number), but coins will not unless they have been certified. So if you want a more professional looking investment, bars are what you want.
Bars also are not mixed with other metals. Unlike coins which are sometimes mixed with other metals. So for the sake of efficiency and space, bars are the best choice.
The reason why coins are more expensive is because they not only have value from the Gold content, but because they also have numismatic value. In other words, people buy them as collectibles. Since they are more expensive upfront, they also have a potential to increase in value more than a bar would. If a certain coin becomes more in demand, the value of that coin will go up regardless of the metal content. So the potential to profit increases with coins.
Since coins are also collectibles, they are more liquid than bars. Which means you would have even less of a problem selling them later than you would with bars.
People already use coins to purchase things. Everybody knows what coins are and what can be done with them. So if there is ever a major catastrophe, coins would naturally be used to barter with before bars would.
If the government ever decides to ban ownership of Gold, there will a good chance there will be a loophole which would allow for people to own coins. Especially rare or old coins. Coins are minted by governments and are legal tender. So they have less of a chance of being banned later.
Coins have the potential to be graded and certified. When this is done, they are encapsulated inside a sturdy container which shows the coin information. When this is done, the coin increases in value and becomes a better investment. Nobody ever grades bars though.


In what economic conditions does Gold perform well?
It does well in ANY economic condition. 
Gold has historically risen during inflation, because it's price tends to rise as the cost of living increases.
Gold has historically done well even during deflation. Take the 'Great Depression' in the US during the 1930's as an example. During that time, the relative purchasing power of Gold soared while other prices sharply dropped.
Gold does well even when other investments do poorly. For example, during the past 50 years at times when the US stock market plunged, Gold soared higher.
Everybody knows what Gold is and it always maintains purchasing power. Even during a complete economic collapse, Gold can be used to barter with.


How can I keep my Gold overseas out of the USA?
We highly recommened BullionVault for this. You would be able to choose the location of your overseas vault. Or you could even store your Gold in multiple vaults. There are daily audits and the results are published daily right on their website. The vaults are secure and insurance is included. All Gold is real and fully allocated!


How do I set up a retirement account based on Gold?
It is an easy process. 
		                   Just contact AMERICAN BULLION. 
						       You can also contact them from the USA by calling (888) 779-9890 toll-free. An account retirement team would help you every step of the way. It is much easier than you think. Before you know it, everything will be done. We highly recommend American Bullion for this.


Are there tax penalties for moving my existing retirement account into Gold?
No. The process you are referring to is usually called a "rollover" or "transfer". With this process, you will not incur any tax penalties.


What are the benefits of a self-directed IRA?
First, this is a great step in protecting your future! Secondly, depending on the type of IRA, there could be tax advantages (eg. tax-deferred or tax-free growth). We would recommend 
						AMERICAN BULLION for this. 
					     You can also contact them from the USA by calling (888) 779-9890 toll-free.


What Gold Stocks do you recommend?
You could invest in exploration or mining companies. These companies do the hard work of exploring for Gold and producing Gold. They actually own physical Gold & Silver in the ground.
Here are the Stock ticker symbols which US investors may want to consider:
						   
Northern Dynasty Minerals (NAK) *** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ***
First Mining Finance Corp (FFMGF)
First Majestic Silver Corp (AG)
Callinex Mines Inc (CLLXF)
Brazil Minerals Inc (BMIX)
Gold Lakes Corp (GLLK)



Why is Northern Dynasty Minerals (NYSE MKT: NAK) recommended on your site?
The NAK Stock was added in early 2017 because it has been identified as a stock with a serious upside potential.
Below are several reasons to consider Northern Dynasty Minerals (NAK):
						   
They have the world's largest undeveloped copper & gold resource.
They have massive known resources - 6.44 Billion tonnes of Measured/Indicated and 4.46 Billion tonnes of Inferred.
They not only have Gold & Copper, but they also have massive reserves of Silver & Molybdenum.
The current value of one of their resources alone (eg. Silver) is worth many times their current market cap (as of July 2017).
They reached a settlement with the EPA and are their way to permitting, which ends the unfair treatment against them from the Obama era.
We now have an administration who understands and wants a fair, normal, and predictable permitting process for companies.
The state of Alaska, and the USA as a whole, needs the jobs and extra revenue that will be generated from their Pebble mine.
They are led by a professional and proven management team.
There is large institutional ownership (around 30% as of June 2017). When institutions invest, it is a good sign of things to come.
They have large insider ownership. When management invests in their own company, it is in their best interest to make the company succeed.
They will be finding partner(s) anytime now. It is planned to happen by end of Q3 2017. This will be a major catalyst for bullish stock movement.

For Sale By Inventor Inventor Disclosure Your ideas are safe.



The purpose of the Inventor Disclosure is to inform inventors that the process of creating a new product/concept and developing it into a commercial success is extremely difficult, time consuming, often frustrating, confusing and usually costly. To succeed, inventors normally must accomplish, at a high level: the legal process (patents, copyrights, trademarks, etc); engineering, scientific or technical factors; production concerns; and, market distribution.  For an individual inventor, this can be a daunting task and should be carefully considered before risking talents, time, energies and capital.
Although an inventor can always represent themselves, inventors are strongly encouraged to seek advice and assistance only from licensed professionals. For Sale By Inventor’s mission is to provide coordinated, professional services for inventors to help launch their invention ideas into new products onto the market.
For Sale By Inventor specializes in consulting, researching and educating small and micro entity inventors. For Sale By Inventor never evaluates an invention in terms of potential marketability.
For Sale By Inventor refers all patent and engineering work to Montgomery Patent & Design on behalf of inventor clients. Advertising, virtual prototypes, websites and representation services are provided by Advertising – Generation, LLC through their proprietary website ForSaleByInventor.com.  This process ensures a coordinated effort and complete confidentiality.
For Sale By Inventor and any related entities neither singularly nor collectively, considers itself to be an invention promoter or developer; regardless, the following is disclosed in the spirit of full disclosure.
The total number of inventors who contacted For Sale By Inventor and any related entities over the past 5 years is approximately 125,000; from that total, approximately 60,000 submitted ideas for review with about 12,000 offered contracts for research services; resulting in 3,974 contracting for professional research services. Following research, 2,162 received positive professional opinions of patentability and feasibility and were proffered development agreements. 1,127 inventors contracted for some combination of our patent, engineering and marketing services.
Of the total clients contracting for our services, 53 received licensing agreements and 27 have reported a net financial profit while hundreds of cases still remain active. Licensing is just one option that an inventor can pursue to commercialize their invention and was not pursued by clients who only contracted for legal, engineering or sales representation services. An additional 182 inventions have reported commercial success meaning that they either have been or are currently available for sale. Since these clients have no obligation to report their specific financial records to us, we are not aware of how many of these have made more than they spent on their invention.
DISCLAIMER: Past performance of professional services can provide no guarantee of future profits or that anyone will agree to purchase, license, produce or distribute any invention idea. Bringing an invention from an idea to marketed product is a high risk venture.

Customer Agreement




 In order to finish processing, please submit a physical copy of this signed customer agreement along with your payment.


	This Customer Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between Rosland Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business located at 11766 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1200, Los Angeles, California 90025 ("Rosland Capital"), and the person(s) or entity identified on the signature page hereof ("Customer") for the purchase, sale and delivery of precious metals, coins and other products offered by Rosland Capital (collectively, the "Products"). The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to all transactions between Customer and Rosland Capital. Download PDF
1. Purchases and Payments.
	1.1 Customer may place an order (each, a "Purchase Order") with a Rosland Capital representative (each, a "Rosland Capital Representative") by telephone for the purchase, sale and delivery of Products which shall have the same effect as if the Purchase Order was made in writing. Customer's Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative to ensure the details of the Purchase Order are correct and will include the price, quantity, method of payment and delivery and other material terms of the Purchase Order. Purchase Orders for bullion cannot be accepted prior to Rosland’s receipt of good funds, and after receipt of such funds the final terms of the Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative.

	1.2 Rosland Capital will send Customer a written confirmation of each Purchase Order (the "Confirmation") at the address provided by Customer to Rosland Capital. The amount due under the Purchase Order (the "Purchase Price") shall be due and payable in full to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving proof, semi-numismatic, numismatic or premium coins, and on or before the date of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving bullion (in either case, the "Payment Period"). Failure to pay the Purchase Price within the Payment Period shall constitute a default by Customer. Upon such default, Rosland Capital will be relieved of all its obligations under the Purchase Order and may recover from Customer the difference between the Purchase Price agreed to by Customer for the Products and Rosland Capital's actual resale price for the Products at the time of default, up to four percent (4%) of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 1.1 and 1.2, purchases made on-line at www.RoslandCapital.com shall be subject to the payment provisions set forth on-line by Rosland Capital from time to time.
	1.3 Customer agrees to pay the Purchase Price by personal check, credit card or bank wire (except that any payments for bullion shall be made by check or bank wire only). The Purchase Price specified in a Purchase Order shall include, without limitation, all shipping, handling, storage, delivery, taxes, assessments and other fees imposed on transactions involving the Products. All amounts stated in a Purchase Order are in U.S. Dollars and all payments made by Customer to Rosland Capital under a Purchase Order shall be made in the U.S. and in U.S. Dollars.
2. Delivery. Rosland Capital shall ship the Products to Customer, or Customer’s appointed agent or designee, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Purchase Order, within fourteen (14) business days (or such lesser period as required by law) of Rosland Capital’s actual receipt of the full Purchase Price from Customer. Title to the Products purchased by Customer and risk of loss thereto shall pass to Customer upon Customer’s, or Customer’s appointed agent's or designee's, actual receipt of the Products. Customer shall be responsible for all shipping and handling charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the Products and Customer acknowledges that shipping and handling charges will vary depending on the weight, value, destination and method of shipment of the Products.
  
3. Buy-Back Policy and Customer Service. If in the future you decide that you would like to sell any precious metal or coin products purchased from Rosland Capital, as a service to our customers, Rosland Capital will provide you the opportunity to sell such products back to us at the current market value determined by Rosland Capital for such products on the day the sale to us is completed. You are, of course, free to sell to others, but we believe that you may receive a higher net price by selling to Rosland Capital because we are familiar with the products we have sold you, and do not charge any additional fees or commissions when making such purchases. Due to market conditions and other factors, you may receive less than what you originally paid. Rosland Capital will make payment for any purchased Product within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the Products from Customer.Our buy-back policy is a voluntary service to our customers and is subject to withdrawal or change without notice. We may also purchase products not originally sold by Rosland Capital; however, such purchases are subject to additional fees and/or commissions at current market rates.Rosland Capital maintains a dedicated customer service department that handles all customer services, including liquidation requests, refund requests and complaints. Rosland Capital’s Chief Compliance Officer can be reached by phone at (800) 967-5151 or by email at services@RoslandCapital.com.
 
4. Refunds and Returns. Rosland Capital provides Customer the right to receive a full refund of the Purchase Price for the return of undamaged and unused Products; provided, however, that Rosland Capital receives written notice of Customer's intention to return the Products within seven (7) days after the date that Customer receives the Products, and provided, further, that such Products are returned to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days following receipt by Rosland Capital of notice of cancellation from Customer. Customer’s “receipt” of the Products is deemed to occur at the earliest of: (a) the date that Customer receives actual possession of the Products or (b) the date that Customer receives written confirmation from Rosland Capital that the Products have been deposited on Customer’s behalf in an independent depository. Rosland Capital shall, upon written notice of cancellation and receipt of the Products in the same condition as delivered, issue a full refund of the Purchase Price to Customer within thirty (30) days of the date of Rosland Capital's receipt of the returned Products from Customer.
 
5. Classifications. Rosland Capital's classification of a particular Product as bullion, numismatic, semi-numismatic or premium expresses Rosland Capital's opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same Product differently. The classification of a particular Product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time. Rosland Capital's spread and prices are based on Rosland Capital's classification determinations. Bullion may be in bar or coin form, and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content. Its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal, which is its current market price. Numismatic coins (including proof coins) are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand, scarcity, dates, condition and grades, and less so on precious metal content. Semi-numismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain, as well as other factors such as supply and demand. Premium coins include numismatic and semi-numismatic coins, as well as proof coins and Exclusive Specialty coins of limited mintage, whose value derives from their quality and limited supply, as well as their precious metal content. Exclusive Specialty coins are typically of high quality, limited mintage, high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source; Rosland Capital determines which products are designated Exclusive Specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors. Precious metals that have lower precious metal content, which may include some numismatics, will have a lower “melt value”, which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price. For example, if the spot price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of $1,000.6. Spread. The difference between the Purchase Price Customer pays for Products under a Purchase Order and the price that Rosland Capital actually pays for the Products purchased by Customer under such Purchase Order is known as the "spread" and it is stated as a percentage of the Purchase Price paid by the Customer.  Spreads charged to Customer under a particular transaction may differ significantly from spreads charged to other customers in similar transactions or spreads charged to Customer in other transactions. The spread on Rosland Capital's premium, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins typically ranges between 17% and 33%. The spread on Rosland Capital's bullion typically ranges between 4% and 21%. (For example, if Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a numismatic coin was $300 and included a 20% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $240. If Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a bullion coin was $300 and included a 5% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $285.) The spread on Rosland Capital's IRA (as defined below) transactions typically ranges between 17% and 25%. The foregoing spreads are approximations and the spreads at any time and for any given transaction may be significantly different. Exclusive Specialty coins designated by Rosland Capital are only sold by Rosland Capital from sources and based on designs exclusive to Rosland Capital at prices set by Rosland Capital based on their quality, limited mintage, precious metal content and branded or unique source, without any reference to any “spread,” which does not apply to this classification of coins.
 7. Pricing. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are established by Rosland Capital upon its analysis of each item and may change many times during the day. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are not tied to prices quoted by any other organization and there are no established daily limits on the amount those prices may change. Rosland Capital reserves the right to increase or decrease its prices at its sole discretion at any time. Customer is encouraged to compare Rosland Capital’s prices with those offered by other dealers. 
 8. Taxes. Tax consequences of transactions with Rosland Capital are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer shall pay to Rosland Capital any sales, use or other tax applicable to transactions involving the Products.
 9. Security. Customer hereby grants Rosland Capital a lien and security interest in the Products in Rosland Capital's possession or control that Customer orders pursuant to a Purchase Order as collateral for any amounts owed by Customer to Rosland Capital under this Agreement, any Purchase Order or otherwise. Customer agrees to execute such additional documents as may be necessary to perfect or evidence this security interest.
 
10. Electronic Recordation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Rosland Capital may choose, in its sole discretion, to monitor or record Customer's telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Rosland Capital in writing, Rosland Capital does not consent to the recording of telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative by Customer or any third party. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital will not record all telephone conversations and that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that any recordings of any particular telephone conversation will be retained or are capable of being retrieved.
  
11. Customer Representations. Customer hereby represents to Rosland Capital that (i) Customer is of legal age and capacity and has the requisite powers, authority, and rights necessary to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) Customer is not a party, and will not become a party, to any agree­ment, obligation, or understanding that is inconsistent with this Agreement or mightlimit or impair Customer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) Customer is an experienced investor who understands the risks and obligations involved under this Agreement; and (iv) Customer's transactions under this Agreement shall be for investment or other commercial purposes and not for any personal, family, household or other consumer purposes.
 
12. Acknowledgements.12.1 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital is a dealer in precious metals, coins and other related products. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is not an exchange or brokerage house or a financial or investment advisor and that neither Rosland Capital nor any Rosland Capital Representative acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of Rosland Capital's Customers.12.2 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products involve substantial risks. Market prices are volatile and unpredictable and may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, political events, mon­etary policies of various countries, and fluctuations in production and demand. It is impossible to forecast accurately how or to what degree the foregoing or other factors will affect market prices. What is suitable for one customer with a given financial means may not be suitable for other customers with the same financial means.12.3 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products are speculative and volatile, and prices may rise and fall over time. Customer acknowledges that profit can only be made if prices for the Products rise in an amount over the Purchase Price paid by Customer for the Products and that Customer may still incur a loss despite favorable price movements.12.4 Customer acknowledges that Customer is financially and emotionally able to enter into transactions which are contemplated by this Agreement and is sensitive to and able to accept the risks and to meet the financial commitments being made under this Agreement.  12.5 Customer acknowledges that grades and descriptions of Products are opinions and not statements of fact, and are based on standards and interpretations that change over time. Rosland Capital uses contemporary grading standards and inter­pretations to grade its Products or relies upon the opinions of third party grading services such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and Professional Coin Grading Service. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that its Products will achieve the same grades from any third party grading service in the future.12.6 Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all purchases made on Customer's account. If Customer believes that a Purchase Order has been entered into for Customer's account without Customer's authorization, Customer shall immedi­ately notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department at: compliance@RoslandCapital.com. Similarly, if Customer believes that any Rosland Capital Representative has made a verbal or written representation that is inconsistent with the terms or risks set forth herein or is unprofessional or offensive in nature, Customer will notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department immediately. Customer further acknowledges that if Customer fails to make the required notification within ten (10) business days following the date on which the event first became known to Customer, Customer waives all rights to contest such mat­ter.12.7 Rosland Capital Representatives may from time to time discuss the general direction of various financial markets. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives cannot guarantee any market movement. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives are not licensed as investment advisors and are not making any specific recommendations concerning any forms of investment. Rosland Capital and the Rosland Capital Representatives are not agents for Customer, have different financial interests and incentives from Customer and owe no fiduciary duty to Customer. Rosland Capital Representatives are commissioned salespersons whose commissions are greatest on numismatic, semi-numismatic and premium items and least on bullion. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital believes precious metals and coins are appropriate for 5% to 20% of a portfolio, although certain individuals or organizations might recommend a different percentage. Customer agrees to independently determine what percentage is appropriate for Customer based upon Customer’s individual circumstance. 12.8 Customer acknowledges that Customer has conducted and will conduct Customer's own research and analysis regarding the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital and Customer will not rely upon any statements made by a Rosland Capital Representative concerning the future value of the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital. Rosland Capital does not provide investment or financial advice. Customer acknowledges that precious metals and coins do not earn interest or current income.12.9 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the 1930’s gold recall by the Government is as follows: “In 1933, the U.S. Government, by Executive Order, prohibited the private ownership of certain quantities of gold bars and coins.  There were several exceptions to this ban, including allowing people to own “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.”  At the time the United States was on the gold standard.  Since 1971 the United States has not been on the gold standard.  The Executive Order prohibiting private ownership was repealed in 1974.  Currently, there are no restrictions on gold ownership, and the ability of the U.S. Government to recall gold is limited to times of war and requires action by the President or Congress.  No one can say with certainty if or how the U.S. Government might prohibit ownership of gold in the future, or whether any particular gold product might be exempt from any future prohibitions.”12.10 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the reportability of precious metals is as follows: “Many of our customers are concerned about personal privacy or disclosing that they own precious metals.  Accordingly, they often choose to purchase precious metals that do not require disclosure of personal information such as name, address and social security number when they sell such precious metals. Currently, certain bullion, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins do not require disclosure of such personal information when a customer sells them.”12.11 Customer acknowledges that Customer has read Rosland Capital’s brochure, which provides additional information about the risks of buying and selling precious metals and coins. This brochure is updated period­ically and it is Customer's responsibility to remain up to date by requesting a copy of the most recent version at Rosland Capital's website, www.RoslandCapital.com.12.12 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital may provide information about companies which provide trustee and custodian services for Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA) as a convenience to its customers.  Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is independent from and not affiliated with any of the companies which may provide those services. It is Customer's responsibility to independently select the IRA service company suitable for Customer. Rosland Capital shall have no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from Customer's dealings with any IRA service company.13. DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS.13.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. ROSLAND CAPITAL PROVIDES THE PRODUCTS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. ROSLAND CAPITAL MAKES NO WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FUTURE VALUE, OTHER THAN THOSE MADE EXPRESSLY IN THIS AGREEMENT AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND MERCHANTABILITY.13.2 EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL ROSLAND CAPITAL BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES RELATING TO LOST PROFITS), WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR CONNECTED WITH THE PRODUCTS OR THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION ON WHICH THEY ARE BASED, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OCCURRING.13.3 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL ROSLAND CAPITAL'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING FROM, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRODUCTS OR THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT THAT CUSTOMER PAID FOR THE PRODUCTS, LESS THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF SUCH PRODUCTS.
	 

	14.  Miscellaneous/Arbitration.14.1 Customer expressly authorizes Rosland Capital to contact Customer at the telephone numbers provided in this Agreement regardless of whether these numbers are listed on any state or federal Do Not Call list.

Customer Agreement




 In order to finish processing, please submit a physical copy of this signed customer agreement along with your payment.


	This Customer Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between Rosland Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business located at 11766 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1200, Los Angeles, California 90025 ("Rosland Capital"), and the person(s) or entity identified on the signature page hereof ("Customer") for the purchase, sale and delivery of precious metals, coins and other products offered by Rosland Capital (collectively, the "Products"). The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to all transactions between Customer and Rosland Capital. Download PDF
1. Purchases and Payments.
	1.1 Customer may place an order (each, a "Purchase Order") with a Rosland Capital representative (each, a "Rosland Capital Representative") by telephone for the purchase, sale and delivery of Products which shall have the same effect as if the Purchase Order was made in writing. Customer's Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative to ensure the details of the Purchase Order are correct and will include the price, quantity, method of payment and delivery and other material terms of the Purchase Order. Purchase Orders for bullion cannot be accepted prior to Rosland’s receipt of good funds, and after receipt of such funds the final terms of the Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative.

	1.2 Rosland Capital will send Customer a written confirmation of each Purchase Order (the "Confirmation") at the address provided by Customer to Rosland Capital. The amount due under the Purchase Order (the "Purchase Price") shall be due and payable in full to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving proof, semi-numismatic, numismatic or premium coins, and on or before the date of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving bullion (in either case, the "Payment Period"). Failure to pay the Purchase Price within the Payment Period shall constitute a default by Customer. Upon such default, Rosland Capital will be relieved of all its obligations under the Purchase Order and may recover from Customer the difference between the Purchase Price agreed to by Customer for the Products and Rosland Capital's actual resale price for the Products at the time of default, up to four percent (4%) of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 1.1 and 1.2, purchases made on-line at www.RoslandCapital.com shall be subject to the payment provisions set forth on-line by Rosland Capital from time to time.
	1.3 Customer agrees to pay the Purchase Price by personal check, credit card or bank wire (except that any payments for bullion shall be made by check or bank wire only). The Purchase Price specified in a Purchase Order shall include, without limitation, all shipping, handling, storage, delivery, taxes, assessments and other fees imposed on transactions involving the Products. All amounts stated in a Purchase Order are in U.S. Dollars and all payments made by Customer to Rosland Capital under a Purchase Order shall be made in the U.S. and in U.S. Dollars.
2. Delivery. Rosland Capital shall ship the Products to Customer, or Customer’s appointed agent or designee, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Purchase Order, within fourteen (14) business days (or such lesser period as required by law) of Rosland Capital’s actual receipt of the full Purchase Price from Customer. Title to the Products purchased by Customer and risk of loss thereto shall pass to Customer upon Customer’s, or Customer’s appointed agent's or designee's, actual receipt of the Products. Customer shall be responsible for all shipping and handling charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the Products and Customer acknowledges that shipping and handling charges will vary depending on the weight, value, destination and method of shipment of the Products.
  
3. Buy-Back Policy and Customer Service. If in the future you decide that you would like to sell any precious metal or coin products purchased from Rosland Capital, as a service to our customers, Rosland Capital will provide you the opportunity to sell such products back to us at the current market value determined by Rosland Capital for such products on the day the sale to us is completed. You are, of course, free to sell to others, but we believe that you may receive a higher net price by selling to Rosland Capital because we are familiar with the products we have sold you, and do not charge any additional fees or commissions when making such purchases. Due to market conditions and other factors, you may receive less than what you originally paid. Rosland Capital will make payment for any purchased Product within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the Products from Customer.Our buy-back policy is a voluntary service to our customers and is subject to withdrawal or change without notice. We may also purchase products not originally sold by Rosland Capital; however, such purchases are subject to additional fees and/or commissions at current market rates.Rosland Capital maintains a dedicated customer service department that handles all customer services, including liquidation requests, refund requests and complaints. Rosland Capital’s Chief Compliance Officer can be reached by phone at (800) 967-5151 or by email at services@RoslandCapital.com.
 
4. Refunds and Returns. Rosland Capital provides Customer the right to receive a full refund of the Purchase Price for the return of undamaged and unused Products; provided, however, that Rosland Capital receives written notice of Customer's intention to return the Products within seven (7) days after the date that Customer receives the Products, and provided, further, that such Products are returned to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days following receipt by Rosland Capital of notice of cancellation from Customer. Customer’s “receipt” of the Products is deemed to occur at the earliest of: (a) the date that Customer receives actual possession of the Products or (b) the date that Customer receives written confirmation from Rosland Capital that the Products have been deposited on Customer’s behalf in an independent depository. Rosland Capital shall, upon written notice of cancellation and receipt of the Products in the same condition as delivered, issue a full refund of the Purchase Price to Customer within thirty (30) days of the date of Rosland Capital's receipt of the returned Products from Customer.
 
5. Classifications. Rosland Capital's classification of a particular Product as bullion, numismatic, semi-numismatic or premium expresses Rosland Capital's opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same Product differently. The classification of a particular Product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time. Rosland Capital's spread and prices are based on Rosland Capital's classification determinations. Bullion may be in bar or coin form, and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content. Its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal, which is its current market price. Numismatic coins (including proof coins) are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand, scarcity, dates, condition and grades, and less so on precious metal content. Semi-numismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain, as well as other factors such as supply and demand. Premium coins include numismatic and semi-numismatic coins, as well as proof coins and Exclusive Specialty coins of limited mintage, whose value derives from their quality and limited supply, as well as their precious metal content. Exclusive Specialty coins are typically of high quality, limited mintage, high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source; Rosland Capital determines which products are designated Exclusive Specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors. Precious metals that have lower precious metal content, which may include some numismatics, will have a lower “melt value”, which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price. For example, if the spot price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of $1,000.6. Spread. The difference between the Purchase Price Customer pays for Products under a Purchase Order and the price that Rosland Capital actually pays for the Products purchased by Customer under such Purchase Order is known as the "spread" and it is stated as a percentage of the Purchase Price paid by the Customer.  Spreads charged to Customer under a particular transaction may differ significantly from spreads charged to other customers in similar transactions or spreads charged to Customer in other transactions. The spread on Rosland Capital's premium, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins typically ranges between 17% and 33%. The spread on Rosland Capital's bullion typically ranges between 4% and 21%. (For example, if Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a numismatic coin was $300 and included a 20% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $240. If Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a bullion coin was $300 and included a 5% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $285.) The spread on Rosland Capital's IRA (as defined below) transactions typically ranges between 17% and 25%. The foregoing spreads are approximations and the spreads at any time and for any given transaction may be significantly different. Exclusive Specialty coins designated by Rosland Capital are only sold by Rosland Capital from sources and based on designs exclusive to Rosland Capital at prices set by Rosland Capital based on their quality, limited mintage, precious metal content and branded or unique source, without any reference to any “spread,” which does not apply to this classification of coins.
 7. Pricing. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are established by Rosland Capital upon its analysis of each item and may change many times during the day. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are not tied to prices quoted by any other organization and there are no established daily limits on the amount those prices may change. Rosland Capital reserves the right to increase or decrease its prices at its sole discretion at any time. Customer is encouraged to compare Rosland Capital’s prices with those offered by other dealers. 
 8. Taxes. Tax consequences of transactions with Rosland Capital are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer shall pay to Rosland Capital any sales, use or other tax applicable to transactions involving the Products.
 9. Security. Customer hereby grants Rosland Capital a lien and security interest in the Products in Rosland Capital's possession or control that Customer orders pursuant to a Purchase Order as collateral for any amounts owed by Customer to Rosland Capital under this Agreement, any Purchase Order or otherwise. Customer agrees to execute such additional documents as may be necessary to perfect or evidence this security interest.
 
10. Electronic Recordation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Rosland Capital may choose, in its sole discretion, to monitor or record Customer's telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Rosland Capital in writing, Rosland Capital does not consent to the recording of telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative by Customer or any third party. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital will not record all telephone conversations and that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that any recordings of any particular telephone conversation will be retained or are capable of being retrieved.
  
11. Customer Representations. Customer hereby represents to Rosland Capital that (i) Customer is of legal age and capacity and has the requisite powers, authority, and rights necessary to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) Customer is not a party, and will not become a party, to any agree­ment, obligation, or understanding that is inconsistent with this Agreement or mightlimit or impair Customer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) Customer is an experienced investor who understands the risks and obligations involved under this Agreement; and (iv) Customer's transactions under this Agreement shall be for investment or other commercial purposes and not for any personal, family, household or other consumer purposes.
 
12. Acknowledgements.12.1 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital is a dealer in precious metals, coins and other related products. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is not an exchange or brokerage house or a financial or investment advisor and that neither Rosland Capital nor any Rosland Capital Representative acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of Rosland Capital's Customers.12.2 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products involve substantial risks. Market prices are volatile and unpredictable and may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, political events, mon­etary policies of various countries, and fluctuations in production and demand. It is impossible to forecast accurately how or to what degree the foregoing or other factors will affect market prices. What is suitable for one customer with a given financial means may not be suitable for other customers with the same financial means.12.3 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products are speculative and volatile, and prices may rise and fall over time. Customer acknowledges that profit can only be made if prices for the Products rise in an amount over the Purchase Price paid by Customer for the Products and that Customer may still incur a loss despite favorable price movements.12.4 Customer acknowledges that Customer is financially and emotionally able to enter into transactions which are contemplated by this Agreement and is sensitive to and able to accept the risks and to meet the financial commitments being made under this Agreement.  12.5 Customer acknowledges that grades and descriptions of Products are opinions and not statements of fact, and are based on standards and interpretations that change over time. Rosland Capital uses contemporary grading standards and inter­pretations to grade its Products or relies upon the opinions of third party grading services such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and Professional Coin Grading Service. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that its Products will achieve the same grades from any third party grading service in the future.12.6 Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all purchases made on Customer's account. If Customer believes that a Purchase Order has been entered into for Customer's account without Customer's authorization, Customer shall immedi­ately notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department at: compliance@RoslandCapital.com. Similarly, if Customer believes that any Rosland Capital Representative has made a verbal or written representation that is inconsistent with the terms or risks set forth herein or is unprofessional or offensive in nature, Customer will notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department immediately. Customer further acknowledges that if Customer fails to make the required notification within ten (10) business days following the date on which the event first became known to Customer, Customer waives all rights to contest such mat­ter.12.7 Rosland Capital Representatives may from time to time discuss the general direction of various financial markets. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives cannot guarantee any market movement. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives are not licensed as investment advisors and are not making any specific recommendations concerning any forms of investment. Rosland Capital and the Rosland Capital Representatives are not agents for Customer, have different financial interests and incentives from Customer and owe no fiduciary duty to Customer. Rosland Capital Representatives are commissioned salespersons whose commissions are greatest on numismatic, semi-numismatic and premium items and least on bullion. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital believes precious metals and coins are appropriate for 5% to 20% of a portfolio, although certain individuals or organizations might recommend a different percentage. Customer agrees to independently determine what percentage is appropriate for Customer based upon Customer’s individual circumstance. 12.8 Customer acknowledges that Customer has conducted and will conduct Customer's own research and analysis regarding the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital and Customer will not rely upon any statements made by a Rosland Capital Representative concerning the future value of the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital. Rosland Capital does not provide investment or financial advice. Customer acknowledges that precious metals and coins do not earn interest or current income.12.9 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the 1930’s gold recall by the Government is as follows: “In 1933, the U.S. Government, by Executive Order, prohibited the private ownership of certain quantities of gold bars and coins.  There were several exceptions to this ban, including allowing people to own “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.”  At the time the United States was on the gold standard.  Since 1971 the United States has not been on the gold standard.  The Executive Order prohibiting private ownership was repealed in 1974.  Currently, there are no restrictions on gold ownership, and the ability of the U.S. Government to recall gold is limited to times of war and requires action by the President or Congress.  No one can say with certainty if or how the U.S. Government might prohibit ownership of gold in the future, or whether any particular gold product might be exempt from any future prohibitions.”12.10 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the reportability of precious metals is as follows: “Many of our customers are concerned about personal privacy or disclosing that they own precious metals.  Accordingly, they often choose to purchase precious metals that do not require disclosure of personal information such as name, address and social security number when they sell such precious metals. Currently, certain bullion, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins do not require disclosure of such personal information when a customer sells them.”12.11 Customer acknowledges that Customer has read Rosland Capital’s brochure, which provides additional information about the risks of buying and selling precious metals and coins. This brochure is updated period­ically and it is Customer's responsibility to remain up to date by requesting a copy of the most recent version at Rosland Capital's website, www.RoslandCapital.com.12.12 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital may provide information about companies which provide trustee and custodian services for Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA) as a convenience to its customers.  Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is independent from and not affiliated with any of the companies which may provide those services. It is Customer's responsibility to independently select the IRA service company suitable for Customer. Rosland Capital shall have no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from Customer's dealings with any IRA service company.13. DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS.13.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. ROSLAND CAPITAL PROVIDES THE PRODUCTS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS.

Customer Agreement




 In order to finish processing, please submit a physical copy of this signed customer agreement along with your payment.


	This Customer Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between Rosland Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business located at 11766 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1200, Los Angeles, California 90025 ("Rosland Capital"), and the person(s) or entity identified on the signature page hereof ("Customer") for the purchase, sale and delivery of precious metals, coins and other products offered by Rosland Capital (collectively, the "Products"). The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to all transactions between Customer and Rosland Capital. Download PDF
1. Purchases and Payments.
	1.1 Customer may place an order (each, a "Purchase Order") with a Rosland Capital representative (each, a "Rosland Capital Representative") by telephone for the purchase, sale and delivery of Products which shall have the same effect as if the Purchase Order was made in writing. Customer's Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative to ensure the details of the Purchase Order are correct and will include the price, quantity, method of payment and delivery and other material terms of the Purchase Order. Purchase Orders for bullion cannot be accepted prior to Rosland’s receipt of good funds, and after receipt of such funds the final terms of the Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative.

	1.2 Rosland Capital will send Customer a written confirmation of each Purchase Order (the "Confirmation") at the address provided by Customer to Rosland Capital. The amount due under the Purchase Order (the "Purchase Price") shall be due and payable in full to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving proof, semi-numismatic, numismatic or premium coins, and on or before the date of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving bullion (in either case, the "Payment Period"). Failure to pay the Purchase Price within the Payment Period shall constitute a default by Customer. Upon such default, Rosland Capital will be relieved of all its obligations under the Purchase Order and may recover from Customer the difference between the Purchase Price agreed to by Customer for the Products and Rosland Capital's actual resale price for the Products at the time of default, up to four percent (4%) of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 1.1 and 1.2, purchases made on-line at www.RoslandCapital.com shall be subject to the payment provisions set forth on-line by Rosland Capital from time to time.
	1.3 Customer agrees to pay the Purchase Price by personal check, credit card or bank wire (except that any payments for bullion shall be made by check or bank wire only). The Purchase Price specified in a Purchase Order shall include, without limitation, all shipping, handling, storage, delivery, taxes, assessments and other fees imposed on transactions involving the Products. All amounts stated in a Purchase Order are in U.S. Dollars and all payments made by Customer to Rosland Capital under a Purchase Order shall be made in the U.S. and in U.S. Dollars.
2. Delivery. Rosland Capital shall ship the Products to Customer, or Customer’s appointed agent or designee, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Purchase Order, within fourteen (14) business days (or such lesser period as required by law) of Rosland Capital’s actual receipt of the full Purchase Price from Customer. Title to the Products purchased by Customer and risk of loss thereto shall pass to Customer upon Customer’s, or Customer’s appointed agent's or designee's, actual receipt of the Products. Customer shall be responsible for all shipping and handling charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the Products and Customer acknowledges that shipping and handling charges will vary depending on the weight, value, destination and method of shipment of the Products.
  
3. Buy-Back Policy and Customer Service. If in the future you decide that you would like to sell any precious metal or coin products purchased from Rosland Capital, as a service to our customers, Rosland Capital will provide you the opportunity to sell such products back to us at the current market value determined by Rosland Capital for such products on the day the sale to us is completed. You are, of course, free to sell to others, but we believe that you may receive a higher net price by selling to Rosland Capital because we are familiar with the products we have sold you, and do not charge any additional fees or commissions when making such purchases. Due to market conditions and other factors, you may receive less than what you originally paid. Rosland Capital will make payment for any purchased Product within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the Products from Customer.Our buy-back policy is a voluntary service to our customers and is subject to withdrawal or change without notice. We may also purchase products not originally sold by Rosland Capital; however, such purchases are subject to additional fees and/or commissions at current market rates.Rosland Capital maintains a dedicated customer service department that handles all customer services, including liquidation requests, refund requests and complaints. Rosland Capital’s Chief Compliance Officer can be reached by phone at (800) 967-5151 or by email at services@RoslandCapital.com.
 
4. Refunds and Returns. Rosland Capital provides Customer the right to receive a full refund of the Purchase Price for the return of undamaged and unused Products; provided, however, that Rosland Capital receives written notice of Customer's intention to return the Products within seven (7) days after the date that Customer receives the Products, and provided, further, that such Products are returned to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days following receipt by Rosland Capital of notice of cancellation from Customer. Customer’s “receipt” of the Products is deemed to occur at the earliest of: (a) the date that Customer receives actual possession of the Products or (b) the date that Customer receives written confirmation from Rosland Capital that the Products have been deposited on Customer’s behalf in an independent depository. Rosland Capital shall, upon written notice of cancellation and receipt of the Products in the same condition as delivered, issue a full refund of the Purchase Price to Customer within thirty (30) days of the date of Rosland Capital's receipt of the returned Products from Customer.
 
5. Classifications. Rosland Capital's classification of a particular Product as bullion, numismatic, semi-numismatic or premium expresses Rosland Capital's opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same Product differently. The classification of a particular Product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time. Rosland Capital's spread and prices are based on Rosland Capital's classification determinations. Bullion may be in bar or coin form, and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content. Its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal, which is its current market price. Numismatic coins (including proof coins) are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand, scarcity, dates, condition and grades, and less so on precious metal content. Semi-numismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain, as well as other factors such as supply and demand. Premium coins include numismatic and semi-numismatic coins, as well as proof coins and Exclusive Specialty coins of limited mintage, whose value derives from their quality and limited supply, as well as their precious metal content. Exclusive Specialty coins are typically of high quality, limited mintage, high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source; Rosland Capital determines which products are designated Exclusive Specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors. Precious metals that have lower precious metal content, which may include some numismatics, will have a lower “melt value”, which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price. For example, if the spot price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of $1,000.6. Spread. The difference between the Purchase Price Customer pays for Products under a Purchase Order and the price that Rosland Capital actually pays for the Products purchased by Customer under such Purchase Order is known as the "spread" and it is stated as a percentage of the Purchase Price paid by the Customer.  Spreads charged to Customer under a particular transaction may differ significantly from spreads charged to other customers in similar transactions or spreads charged to Customer in other transactions. The spread on Rosland Capital's premium, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins typically ranges between 17% and 33%. The spread on Rosland Capital's bullion typically ranges between 4% and 21%. (For example, if Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a numismatic coin was $300 and included a 20% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $240. If Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a bullion coin was $300 and included a 5% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $285.) The spread on Rosland Capital's IRA (as defined below) transactions typically ranges between 17% and 25%. The foregoing spreads are approximations and the spreads at any time and for any given transaction may be significantly different. Exclusive Specialty coins designated by Rosland Capital are only sold by Rosland Capital from sources and based on designs exclusive to Rosland Capital at prices set by Rosland Capital based on their quality, limited mintage, precious metal content and branded or unique source, without any reference to any “spread,” which does not apply to this classification of coins.
 7. Pricing. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are established by Rosland Capital upon its analysis of each item and may change many times during the day. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are not tied to prices quoted by any other organization and there are no established daily limits on the amount those prices may change. Rosland Capital reserves the right to increase or decrease its prices at its sole discretion at any time. Customer is encouraged to compare Rosland Capital’s prices with those offered by other dealers. 
 8. Taxes. Tax consequences of transactions with Rosland Capital are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer shall pay to Rosland Capital any sales, use or other tax applicable to transactions involving the Products.
 9. Security. Customer hereby grants Rosland Capital a lien and security interest in the Products in Rosland Capital's possession or control that Customer orders pursuant to a Purchase Order as collateral for any amounts owed by Customer to Rosland Capital under this Agreement, any Purchase Order or otherwise. Customer agrees to execute such additional documents as may be necessary to perfect or evidence this security interest.
 
10. Electronic Recordation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Rosland Capital may choose, in its sole discretion, to monitor or record Customer's telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Rosland Capital in writing, Rosland Capital does not consent to the recording of telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative by Customer or any third party. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital will not record all telephone conversations and that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that any recordings of any particular telephone conversation will be retained or are capable of being retrieved.
  
11. Customer Representations. Customer hereby represents to Rosland Capital that (i) Customer is of legal age and capacity and has the requisite powers, authority, and rights necessary to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) Customer is not a party, and will not become a party, to any agree­ment, obligation, or understanding that is inconsistent with this Agreement or mightlimit or impair Customer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) Customer is an experienced investor who understands the risks and obligations involved under this Agreement; and (iv) Customer's transactions under this Agreement shall be for investment or other commercial purposes and not for any personal, family, household or other consumer purposes.
 
12. Acknowledgements.12.1 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital is a dealer in precious metals, coins and other related products. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is not an exchange or brokerage house or a financial or investment advisor and that neither Rosland Capital nor any Rosland Capital Representative acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of Rosland Capital's Customers.12.2 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products involve substantial risks. Market prices are volatile and unpredictable and may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, political events, mon­etary policies of various countries, and fluctuations in production and demand. It is impossible to forecast accurately how or to what degree the foregoing or other factors will affect market prices. What is suitable for one customer with a given financial means may not be suitable for other customers with the same financial means.12.3 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products are speculative and volatile, and prices may rise and fall over time. Customer acknowledges that profit can only be made if prices for the Products rise in an amount over the Purchase Price paid by Customer for the Products and that Customer may still incur a loss despite favorable price movements.12.4 Customer acknowledges that Customer is financially and emotionally able to enter into transactions which are contemplated by this Agreement and is sensitive to and able to accept the risks and to meet the financial commitments being made under this Agreement.  12.5 Customer acknowledges that grades and descriptions of Products are opinions and not statements of fact, and are based on standards and interpretations that change over time. Rosland Capital uses contemporary grading standards and inter­pretations to grade its Products or relies upon the opinions of third party grading services such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and Professional Coin Grading Service. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that its Products will achieve the same grades from any third party grading service in the future.12.6 Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all purchases made on Customer's account. If Customer believes that a Purchase Order has been entered into for Customer's account without Customer's authorization, Customer shall immedi­ately notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department at: compliance@RoslandCapital.com. Similarly, if Customer believes that any Rosland Capital Representative has made a verbal or written representation that is inconsistent with the terms or risks set forth herein or is unprofessional or offensive in nature, Customer will notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department immediately. Customer further acknowledges that if Customer fails to make the required notification within ten (10) business days following the date on which the event first became known to Customer, Customer waives all rights to contest such mat­ter.12.7 Rosland Capital Representatives may from time to time discuss the general direction of various financial markets. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives cannot guarantee any market movement. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives are not licensed as investment advisors and are not making any specific recommendations concerning any forms of investment. Rosland Capital and the Rosland Capital Representatives are not agents for Customer, have different financial interests and incentives from Customer and owe no fiduciary duty to Customer. Rosland Capital Representatives are commissioned salespersons whose commissions are greatest on numismatic, semi-numismatic and premium items and least on bullion. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital believes precious metals and coins are appropriate for 5% to 20% of a portfolio, although certain individuals or organizations might recommend a different percentage. Customer agrees to independently determine what percentage is appropriate for Customer based upon Customer’s individual circumstance. 12.8 Customer acknowledges that Customer has conducted and will conduct Customer's own research and analysis regarding the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital and Customer will not rely upon any statements made by a Rosland Capital Representative concerning the future value of the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital. Rosland Capital does not provide investment or financial advice. Customer acknowledges that precious metals and coins do not earn interest or current income.12.9 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the 1930’s gold recall by the Government is as follows: “In 1933, the U.S. Government, by Executive Order, prohibited the private ownership of certain quantities of gold bars and coins.  There were several exceptions to this ban, including allowing people to own “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.”  At the time the United States was on the gold standard.  Since 1971 the United States has not been on the gold standard.  The Executive Order prohibiting private ownership was repealed in 1974.  Currently, there are no restrictions on gold ownership, and the ability of the U.S. Government to recall gold is limited to times of war and requires action by the President or Congress.  No one can say with certainty if or how the U.S. Government might prohibit ownership of gold in the future, or whether any particular gold product might be exempt from any future prohibitions.”12.10 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the reportability of precious metals is as follows: “Many of our customers are concerned about personal privacy or disclosing that they own precious metals.  Accordingly, they often choose to purchase precious metals that do not require disclosure of personal information such as name, address and social security number when they sell such precious metals. Currently, certain bullion, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins do not require disclosure of such personal information when a customer sells them.”12.11 Customer acknowledges that Customer has read Rosland Capital’s brochure, which provides additional information about the risks of buying and selling precious metals and coins. This brochure is updated period­ically and it is Customer's responsibility to remain up to date by requesting a copy of the most recent version at Rosland Capital's website, www.RoslandCapital.com.12.12 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital may provide information about companies which provide trustee and custodian services for Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA) as a convenience to its customers.  Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is independent from and not affiliated with any of the companies which may provide those services. It is Customer's responsibility to independently select the IRA service company suitable for Customer. Rosland Capital shall have no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from Customer's dealings with any IRA service company.13. DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS.13.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. ROSLAND CAPITAL PROVIDES THE PRODUCTS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS.

Customer Agreement




 In order to finish processing, please submit a physical copy of this signed customer agreement along with your payment.


	This Customer Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between Rosland Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business located at 11766 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1200, Los Angeles, California 90025 ("Rosland Capital"), and the person(s) or entity identified on the signature page hereof ("Customer") for the purchase, sale and delivery of precious metals, coins and other products offered by Rosland Capital (collectively, the "Products"). The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to all transactions between Customer and Rosland Capital. Download PDF
1. Purchases and Payments.
	1.1 Customer may place an order (each, a "Purchase Order") with a Rosland Capital representative (each, a "Rosland Capital Representative") by telephone for the purchase, sale and delivery of Products which shall have the same effect as if the Purchase Order was made in writing. Customer's Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative to ensure the details of the Purchase Order are correct and will include the price, quantity, method of payment and delivery and other material terms of the Purchase Order. Purchase Orders for bullion cannot be accepted prior to Rosland’s receipt of good funds, and after receipt of such funds the final terms of the Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative.

	1.2 Rosland Capital will send Customer a written confirmation of each Purchase Order (the "Confirmation") at the address provided by Customer to Rosland Capital. The amount due under the Purchase Order (the "Purchase Price") shall be due and payable in full to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving proof, semi-numismatic, numismatic or premium coins, and on or before the date of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving bullion (in either case, the "Payment Period"). Failure to pay the Purchase Price within the Payment Period shall constitute a default by Customer. Upon such default, Rosland Capital will be relieved of all its obligations under the Purchase Order and may recover from Customer the difference between the Purchase Price agreed to by Customer for the Products and Rosland Capital's actual resale price for the Products at the time of default, up to four percent (4%) of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 1.1 and 1.2, purchases made on-line at www.RoslandCapital.com shall be subject to the payment provisions set forth on-line by Rosland Capital from time to time.
	1.3 Customer agrees to pay the Purchase Price by personal check, credit card or bank wire (except that any payments for bullion shall be made by check or bank wire only). The Purchase Price specified in a Purchase Order shall include, without limitation, all shipping, handling, storage, delivery, taxes, assessments and other fees imposed on transactions involving the Products. All amounts stated in a Purchase Order are in U.S. Dollars and all payments made by Customer to Rosland Capital under a Purchase Order shall be made in the U.S. and in U.S. Dollars.
2. Delivery. Rosland Capital shall ship the Products to Customer, or Customer’s appointed agent or designee, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Purchase Order, within fourteen (14) business days (or such lesser period as required by law) of Rosland Capital’s actual receipt of the full Purchase Price from Customer. Title to the Products purchased by Customer and risk of loss thereto shall pass to Customer upon Customer’s, or Customer’s appointed agent's or designee's, actual receipt of the Products. Customer shall be responsible for all shipping and handling charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the Products and Customer acknowledges that shipping and handling charges will vary depending on the weight, value, destination and method of shipment of the Products.
  
3. Buy-Back Policy and Customer Service. If in the future you decide that you would like to sell any precious metal or coin products purchased from Rosland Capital, as a service to our customers, Rosland Capital will provide you the opportunity to sell such products back to us at the current market value determined by Rosland Capital for such products on the day the sale to us is completed. You are, of course, free to sell to others, but we believe that you may receive a higher net price by selling to Rosland Capital because we are familiar with the products we have sold you, and do not charge any additional fees or commissions when making such purchases. Due to market conditions and other factors, you may receive less than what you originally paid. Rosland Capital will make payment for any purchased Product within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the Products from Customer.Our buy-back policy is a voluntary service to our customers and is subject to withdrawal or change without notice. We may also purchase products not originally sold by Rosland Capital; however, such purchases are subject to additional fees and/or commissions at current market rates.Rosland Capital maintains a dedicated customer service department that handles all customer services, including liquidation requests, refund requests and complaints. Rosland Capital’s Chief Compliance Officer can be reached by phone at (800) 967-5151 or by email at services@RoslandCapital.com.
 
4. Refunds and Returns. Rosland Capital provides Customer the right to receive a full refund of the Purchase Price for the return of undamaged and unused Products; provided, however, that Rosland Capital receives written notice of Customer's intention to return the Products within seven (7) days after the date that Customer receives the Products, and provided, further, that such Products are returned to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days following receipt by Rosland Capital of notice of cancellation from Customer. Customer’s “receipt” of the Products is deemed to occur at the earliest of: (a) the date that Customer receives actual possession of the Products or (b) the date that Customer receives written confirmation from Rosland Capital that the Products have been deposited on Customer’s behalf in an independent depository. Rosland Capital shall, upon written notice of cancellation and receipt of the Products in the same condition as delivered, issue a full refund of the Purchase Price to Customer within thirty (30) days of the date of Rosland Capital's receipt of the returned Products from Customer.
 
5. Classifications. Rosland Capital's classification of a particular Product as bullion, numismatic, semi-numismatic or premium expresses Rosland Capital's opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same Product differently. The classification of a particular Product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time. Rosland Capital's spread and prices are based on Rosland Capital's classification determinations. Bullion may be in bar or coin form, and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content. Its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal, which is its current market price. Numismatic coins (including proof coins) are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand, scarcity, dates, condition and grades, and less so on precious metal content. Semi-numismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain, as well as other factors such as supply and demand. Premium coins include numismatic and semi-numismatic coins, as well as proof coins and Exclusive Specialty coins of limited mintage, whose value derives from their quality and limited supply, as well as their precious metal content. Exclusive Specialty coins are typically of high quality, limited mintage, high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source; Rosland Capital determines which products are designated Exclusive Specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors. Precious metals that have lower precious metal content, which may include some numismatics, will have a lower “melt value”, which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price. For example, if the spot price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of $1,000.6. Spread. The difference between the Purchase Price Customer pays for Products under a Purchase Order and the price that Rosland Capital actually pays for the Products purchased by Customer under such Purchase Order is known as the "spread" and it is stated as a percentage of the Purchase Price paid by the Customer.  Spreads charged to Customer under a particular transaction may differ significantly from spreads charged to other customers in similar transactions or spreads charged to Customer in other transactions. The spread on Rosland Capital's premium, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins typically ranges between 17% and 33%. The spread on Rosland Capital's bullion typically ranges between 4% and 21%. (For example, if Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a numismatic coin was $300 and included a 20% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $240. If Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a bullion coin was $300 and included a 5% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $285.) The spread on Rosland Capital's IRA (as defined below) transactions typically ranges between 17% and 25%. The foregoing spreads are approximations and the spreads at any time and for any given transaction may be significantly different. Exclusive Specialty coins designated by Rosland Capital are only sold by Rosland Capital from sources and based on designs exclusive to Rosland Capital at prices set by Rosland Capital based on their quality, limited mintage, precious metal content and branded or unique source, without any reference to any “spread,” which does not apply to this classification of coins.
 7. Pricing. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are established by Rosland Capital upon its analysis of each item and may change many times during the day. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are not tied to prices quoted by any other organization and there are no established daily limits on the amount those prices may change. Rosland Capital reserves the right to increase or decrease its prices at its sole discretion at any time. Customer is encouraged to compare Rosland Capital’s prices with those offered by other dealers. 
 8. Taxes. Tax consequences of transactions with Rosland Capital are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer shall pay to Rosland Capital any sales, use or other tax applicable to transactions involving the Products.
 9. Security. Customer hereby grants Rosland Capital a lien and security interest in the Products in Rosland Capital's possession or control that Customer orders pursuant to a Purchase Order as collateral for any amounts owed by Customer to Rosland Capital under this Agreement, any Purchase Order or otherwise. Customer agrees to execute such additional documents as may be necessary to perfect or evidence this security interest.
 
10. Electronic Recordation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Rosland Capital may choose, in its sole discretion, to monitor or record Customer's telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Rosland Capital in writing, Rosland Capital does not consent to the recording of telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative by Customer or any third party. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital will not record all telephone conversations and that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that any recordings of any particular telephone conversation will be retained or are capable of being retrieved.
  
11. Customer Representations. Customer hereby represents to Rosland Capital that (i) Customer is of legal age and capacity and has the requisite powers, authority, and rights necessary to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) Customer is not a party, and will not become a party, to any agree­ment, obligation, or understanding that is inconsistent with this Agreement or mightlimit or impair Customer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) Customer is an experienced investor who understands the risks and obligations involved under this Agreement; and (iv) Customer's transactions under this Agreement shall be for investment or other commercial purposes and not for any personal, family, household or other consumer purposes.
 
12. Acknowledgements.12.1 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital is a dealer in precious metals, coins and other related products. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is not an exchange or brokerage house or a financial or investment advisor and that neither Rosland Capital nor any Rosland Capital Representative acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of Rosland Capital's Customers.12.2 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products involve substantial risks. Market prices are volatile and unpredictable and may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, political events, mon­etary policies of various countries, and fluctuations in production and demand. It is impossible to forecast accurately how or to what degree the foregoing or other factors will affect market prices. What is suitable for one customer with a given financial means may not be suitable for other customers with the same financial means.12.3 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products are speculative and volatile, and prices may rise and fall over time. Customer acknowledges that profit can only be made if prices for the Products rise in an amount over the Purchase Price paid by Customer for the Products and that Customer may still incur a loss despite favorable price movements.12.4 Customer acknowledges that Customer is financially and emotionally able to enter into transactions which are contemplated by this Agreement and is sensitive to and able to accept the risks and to meet the financial commitments being made under this Agreement.  12.5 Customer acknowledges that grades and descriptions of Products are opinions and not statements of fact, and are based on standards and interpretations that change over time. Rosland Capital uses contemporary grading standards and inter­pretations to grade its Products or relies upon the opinions of third party grading services such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and Professional Coin Grading Service. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that its Products will achieve the same grades from any third party grading service in the future.12.6 Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all purchases made on Customer's account. If Customer believes that a Purchase Order has been entered into for Customer's account without Customer's authorization, Customer shall immedi­ately notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department at: compliance@RoslandCapital.com. Similarly, if Customer believes that any Rosland Capital Representative has made a verbal or written representation that is inconsistent with the terms or risks set forth herein or is unprofessional or offensive in nature, Customer will notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department immediately. Customer further acknowledges that if Customer fails to make the required notification within ten (10) business days following the date on which the event first became known to Customer, Customer waives all rights to contest such mat­ter.12.7 Rosland Capital Representatives may from time to time discuss the general direction of various financial markets. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives cannot guarantee any market movement. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives are not licensed as investment advisors and are not making any specific recommendations concerning any forms of investment. Rosland Capital and the Rosland Capital Representatives are not agents for Customer, have different financial interests and incentives from Customer and owe no fiduciary duty to Customer. Rosland Capital Representatives are commissioned salespersons whose commissions are greatest on numismatic, semi-numismatic and premium items and least on bullion. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital believes precious metals and coins are appropriate for 5% to 20% of a portfolio, although certain individuals or organizations might recommend a different percentage. Customer agrees to independently determine what percentage is appropriate for Customer based upon Customer’s individual circumstance. 12.8 Customer acknowledges that Customer has conducted and will conduct Customer's own research and analysis regarding the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital and Customer will not rely upon any statements made by a Rosland Capital Representative concerning the future value of the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital. Rosland Capital does not provide investment or financial advice. Customer acknowledges that precious metals and coins do not earn interest or current income.12.9 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the 1930’s gold recall by the Government is as follows: “In 1933, the U.S. Government, by Executive Order, prohibited the private ownership of certain quantities of gold bars and coins.  There were several exceptions to this ban, including allowing people to own “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.”  At the time the United States was on the gold standard.  Since 1971 the United States has not been on the gold standard.  The Executive Order prohibiting private ownership was repealed in 1974.  Currently, there are no restrictions on gold ownership, and the ability of the U.S. Government to recall gold is limited to times of war and requires action by the President or Congress.  No one can say with certainty if or how the U.S. Government might prohibit ownership of gold in the future, or whether any particular gold product might be exempt from any future prohibitions.”12.10 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the reportability of precious metals is as follows: “Many of our customers are concerned about personal privacy or disclosing that they own precious metals.  Accordingly, they often choose to purchase precious metals that do not require disclosure of personal information such as name, address and social security number when they sell such precious metals. Currently, certain bullion, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins do not require disclosure of such personal information when a customer sells them.”12.11 Customer acknowledges that Customer has read Rosland Capital’s brochure, which provides additional information about the risks of buying and selling precious metals and coins. This brochure is updated period­ically and it is Customer's responsibility to remain up to date by requesting a copy of the most recent version at Rosland Capital's website, www.RoslandCapital.com.12.12 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital may provide information about companies which provide trustee and custodian services for Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA) as a convenience to its customers.  Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is independent from and not affiliated with any of the companies which may provide those services. It is Customer's responsibility to independently select the IRA service company suitable for Customer. Rosland Capital shall have no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from Customer's dealings with any IRA service company.13.

Upon proof of death, Rosland Capital will recognize the account as the sole property of the estate or lawful heirs, as substantiated in documents provided to Rosland Capital. Customer agrees to hold Rosland Capital harmless and defend against any loss, liability, cost or expense, including reasonable attorney fees, resulting from any action taken by Rosland Capital in reliance upon the foregoing.

 In order to finish processing, please submit a physical copy of this signed customer agreement along with your payment.


	This Customer Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between Rosland Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business located at 11766 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1200, Los Angeles, California 90025 ("Rosland Capital"), and the person(s) or entity identified on the signature page hereof ("Customer") for the purchase, sale and delivery of precious metals, coins and other products offered by Rosland Capital (collectively, the "Products"). The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to all transactions between Customer and Rosland Capital. Download PDF
1. Purchases and Payments.
	1.1 Customer may place an order (each, a "Purchase Order") with a Rosland Capital representative (each, a "Rosland Capital Representative") by telephone for the purchase, sale and delivery of Products which shall have the same effect as if the Purchase Order was made in writing. Customer's Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative to ensure the details of the Purchase Order are correct and will include the price, quantity, method of payment and delivery and other material terms of the Purchase Order. Purchase Orders for bullion cannot be accepted prior to Rosland’s receipt of good funds, and after receipt of such funds the final terms of the Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative.

	1.2 Rosland Capital will send Customer a written confirmation of each Purchase Order (the "Confirmation") at the address provided by Customer to Rosland Capital. The amount due under the Purchase Order (the "Purchase Price") shall be due and payable in full to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving proof, semi-numismatic, numismatic or premium coins, and on or before the date of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving bullion (in either case, the "Payment Period"). Failure to pay the Purchase Price within the Payment Period shall constitute a default by Customer. Upon such default, Rosland Capital will be relieved of all its obligations under the Purchase Order and may recover from Customer the difference between the Purchase Price agreed to by Customer for the Products and Rosland Capital's actual resale price for the Products at the time of default, up to four percent (4%) of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 1.1 and 1.2, purchases made on-line at www.RoslandCapital.com shall be subject to the payment provisions set forth on-line by Rosland Capital from time to time.
	1.3 Customer agrees to pay the Purchase Price by personal check, credit card or bank wire (except that any payments for bullion shall be made by check or bank wire only). The Purchase Price specified in a Purchase Order shall include, without limitation, all shipping, handling, storage, delivery, taxes, assessments and other fees imposed on transactions involving the Products. All amounts stated in a Purchase Order are in U.S. Dollars and all payments made by Customer to Rosland Capital under a Purchase Order shall be made in the U.S. and in U.S. Dollars.
2. Delivery. Rosland Capital shall ship the Products to Customer, or Customer’s appointed agent or designee, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Purchase Order, within fourteen (14) business days (or such lesser period as required by law) of Rosland Capital’s actual receipt of the full Purchase Price from Customer. Title to the Products purchased by Customer and risk of loss thereto shall pass to Customer upon Customer’s, or Customer’s appointed agent's or designee's, actual receipt of the Products. Customer shall be responsible for all shipping and handling charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the Products and Customer acknowledges that shipping and handling charges will vary depending on the weight, value, destination and method of shipment of the Products.
  
3. Buy-Back Policy and Customer Service. If in the future you decide that you would like to sell any precious metal or coin products purchased from Rosland Capital, as a service to our customers, Rosland Capital will provide you the opportunity to sell such products back to us at the current market value determined by Rosland Capital for such products on the day the sale to us is completed. You are, of course, free to sell to others, but we believe that you may receive a higher net price by selling to Rosland Capital because we are familiar with the products we have sold you, and do not charge any additional fees or commissions when making such purchases. Due to market conditions and other factors, you may receive less than what you originally paid. Rosland Capital will make payment for any purchased Product within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the Products from Customer.Our buy-back policy is a voluntary service to our customers and is subject to withdrawal or change without notice. We may also purchase products not originally sold by Rosland Capital; however, such purchases are subject to additional fees and/or commissions at current market rates.Rosland Capital maintains a dedicated customer service department that handles all customer services, including liquidation requests, refund requests and complaints. Rosland Capital’s Chief Compliance Officer can be reached by phone at (800) 967-5151 or by email at services@RoslandCapital.com.
 
4. Refunds and Returns. Rosland Capital provides Customer the right to receive a full refund of the Purchase Price for the return of undamaged and unused Products; provided, however, that Rosland Capital receives written notice of Customer's intention to return the Products within seven (7) days after the date that Customer receives the Products, and provided, further, that such Products are returned to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days following receipt by Rosland Capital of notice of cancellation from Customer. Customer’s “receipt” of the Products is deemed to occur at the earliest of: (a) the date that Customer receives actual possession of the Products or (b) the date that Customer receives written confirmation from Rosland Capital that the Products have been deposited on Customer’s behalf in an independent depository. Rosland Capital shall, upon written notice of cancellation and receipt of the Products in the same condition as delivered, issue a full refund of the Purchase Price to Customer within thirty (30) days of the date of Rosland Capital's receipt of the returned Products from Customer.
 
5. Classifications. Rosland Capital's classification of a particular Product as bullion, numismatic, semi-numismatic or premium expresses Rosland Capital's opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same Product differently. The classification of a particular Product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time. Rosland Capital's spread and prices are based on Rosland Capital's classification determinations. Bullion may be in bar or coin form, and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content. Its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal, which is its current market price. Numismatic coins (including proof coins) are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand, scarcity, dates, condition and grades, and less so on precious metal content. Semi-numismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain, as well as other factors such as supply and demand. Premium coins include numismatic and semi-numismatic coins, as well as proof coins and Exclusive Specialty coins of limited mintage, whose value derives from their quality and limited supply, as well as their precious metal content. Exclusive Specialty coins are typically of high quality, limited mintage, high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source; Rosland Capital determines which products are designated Exclusive Specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors. Precious metals that have lower precious metal content, which may include some numismatics, will have a lower “melt value”, which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price. For example, if the spot price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of $1,000.6. Spread. The difference between the Purchase Price Customer pays for Products under a Purchase Order and the price that Rosland Capital actually pays for the Products purchased by Customer under such Purchase Order is known as the "spread" and it is stated as a percentage of the Purchase Price paid by the Customer.  Spreads charged to Customer under a particular transaction may differ significantly from spreads charged to other customers in similar transactions or spreads charged to Customer in other transactions. The spread on Rosland Capital's premium, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins typically ranges between 17% and 33%. The spread on Rosland Capital's bullion typically ranges between 4% and 21%. (For example, if Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a numismatic coin was $300 and included a 20% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $240. If Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a bullion coin was $300 and included a 5% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $285.) The spread on Rosland Capital's IRA (as defined below) transactions typically ranges between 17% and 25%. The foregoing spreads are approximations and the spreads at any time and for any given transaction may be significantly different. Exclusive Specialty coins designated by Rosland Capital are only sold by Rosland Capital from sources and based on designs exclusive to Rosland Capital at prices set by Rosland Capital based on their quality, limited mintage, precious metal content and branded or unique source, without any reference to any “spread,” which does not apply to this classification of coins.
 7. Pricing. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are established by Rosland Capital upon its analysis of each item and may change many times during the day. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are not tied to prices quoted by any other organization and there are no established daily limits on the amount those prices may change. Rosland Capital reserves the right to increase or decrease its prices at its sole discretion at any time. Customer is encouraged to compare Rosland Capital’s prices with those offered by other dealers. 
 8. Taxes. Tax consequences of transactions with Rosland Capital are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer shall pay to Rosland Capital any sales, use or other tax applicable to transactions involving the Products.
 9. Security. Customer hereby grants Rosland Capital a lien and security interest in the Products in Rosland Capital's possession or control that Customer orders pursuant to a Purchase Order as collateral for any amounts owed by Customer to Rosland Capital under this Agreement, any Purchase Order or otherwise. Customer agrees to execute such additional documents as may be necessary to perfect or evidence this security interest.
 
10. Electronic Recordation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Rosland Capital may choose, in its sole discretion, to monitor or record Customer's telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Rosland Capital in writing, Rosland Capital does not consent to the recording of telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative by Customer or any third party. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital will not record all telephone conversations and that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that any recordings of any particular telephone conversation will be retained or are capable of being retrieved.
  
11. Customer Representations. Customer hereby represents to Rosland Capital that (i) Customer is of legal age and capacity and has the requisite powers, authority, and rights necessary to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) Customer is not a party, and will not become a party, to any agree­ment, obligation, or understanding that is inconsistent with this Agreement or mightlimit or impair Customer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) Customer is an experienced investor who understands the risks and obligations involved under this Agreement; and (iv) Customer's transactions under this Agreement shall be for investment or other commercial purposes and not for any personal, family, household or other consumer purposes.
 
12. Acknowledgements.12.1 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital is a dealer in precious metals, coins and other related products. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is not an exchange or brokerage house or a financial or investment advisor and that neither Rosland Capital nor any Rosland Capital Representative acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of Rosland Capital's Customers.12.2 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products involve substantial risks. Market prices are volatile and unpredictable and may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, political events, mon­etary policies of various countries, and fluctuations in production and demand. It is impossible to forecast accurately how or to what degree the foregoing or other factors will affect market prices. What is suitable for one customer with a given financial means may not be suitable for other customers with the same financial means.12.3 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products are speculative and volatile, and prices may rise and fall over time. Customer acknowledges that profit can only be made if prices for the Products rise in an amount over the Purchase Price paid by Customer for the Products and that Customer may still incur a loss despite favorable price movements.12.4 Customer acknowledges that Customer is financially and emotionally able to enter into transactions which are contemplated by this Agreement and is sensitive to and able to accept the risks and to meet the financial commitments being made under this Agreement.  12.5 Customer acknowledges that grades and descriptions of Products are opinions and not statements of fact, and are based on standards and interpretations that change over time. Rosland Capital uses contemporary grading standards and inter­pretations to grade its Products or relies upon the opinions of third party grading services such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and Professional Coin Grading Service. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that its Products will achieve the same grades from any third party grading service in the future.12.6 Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all purchases made on Customer's account. If Customer believes that a Purchase Order has been entered into for Customer's account without Customer's authorization, Customer shall immedi­ately notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department at: compliance@RoslandCapital.com. Similarly, if Customer believes that any Rosland Capital Representative has made a verbal or written representation that is inconsistent with the terms or risks set forth herein or is unprofessional or offensive in nature, Customer will notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department immediately. Customer further acknowledges that if Customer fails to make the required notification within ten (10) business days following the date on which the event first became known to Customer, Customer waives all rights to contest such mat­ter.12.7 Rosland Capital Representatives may from time to time discuss the general direction of various financial markets. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives cannot guarantee any market movement. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives are not licensed as investment advisors and are not making any specific recommendations concerning any forms of investment. Rosland Capital and the Rosland Capital Representatives are not agents for Customer, have different financial interests and incentives from Customer and owe no fiduciary duty to Customer. Rosland Capital Representatives are commissioned salespersons whose commissions are greatest on numismatic, semi-numismatic and premium items and least on bullion. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital believes precious metals and coins are appropriate for 5% to 20% of a portfolio, although certain individuals or organizations might recommend a different percentage. Customer agrees to independently determine what percentage is appropriate for Customer based upon Customer’s individual circumstance. 12.8 Customer acknowledges that Customer has conducted and will conduct Customer's own research and analysis regarding the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital and Customer will not rely upon any statements made by a Rosland Capital Representative concerning the future value of the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital. Rosland Capital does not provide investment or financial advice. Customer acknowledges that precious metals and coins do not earn interest or current income.12.9 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the 1930’s gold recall by the Government is as follows: “In 1933, the U.S. Government, by Executive Order, prohibited the private ownership of certain quantities of gold bars and coins.  There were several exceptions to this ban, including allowing people to own “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.”  At the time the United States was on the gold standard.  Since 1971 the United States has not been on the gold standard.  The Executive Order prohibiting private ownership was repealed in 1974.  Currently, there are no restrictions on gold ownership, and the ability of the U.S. Government to recall gold is limited to times of war and requires action by the President or Congress.  No one can say with certainty if or how the U.S. Government might prohibit ownership of gold in the future, or whether any particular gold product might be exempt from any future prohibitions.”12.10 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the reportability of precious metals is as follows: “Many of our customers are concerned about personal privacy or disclosing that they own precious metals.  Accordingly, they often choose to purchase precious metals that do not require disclosure of personal information such as name, address and social security number when they sell such precious metals. Currently, certain bullion, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins do not require disclosure of such personal information when a customer sells them.”12.11 Customer acknowledges that Customer has read Rosland Capital’s brochure, which provides additional information about the risks of buying and selling precious metals and coins. This brochure is updated period­ically and it is Customer's responsibility to remain up to date by requesting a copy of the most recent version at Rosland Capital's website, www.RoslandCapital.com.12.12 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital may provide information about companies which provide trustee and custodian services for Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA) as a convenience to its customers.  Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is independent from and not affiliated with any of the companies which may provide those services. It is Customer's responsibility to independently select the IRA service company suitable for Customer. Rosland Capital shall have no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from Customer's dealings with any IRA service company.13.
