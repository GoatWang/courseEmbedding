Irving Resources Inc. Commences 2017 Exploration Program, Hokkaido, Japan
Jun 13 17
Irving Resources Inc. announced it has recently commenced its 2017 field program exploring for high-grade epithermal precious metal vein mineralization on the island of Hokkaido, Japan. Initial work will focus on Irving's 100% controlled Omui mining concession and prospecting license applications. As detailed in a news release dated December 13, 2016, Irving identified high-grade gold and silver vein mineralization at Omui through a first phase sampling program conducted shortly after acquiring the property. To better understand the mineralized system, Irving plans a comprehensive exploration program including: 1) a detailed soil grid across the mining concession and surrounding areas looking for gold, silver and pathfinder element anomalism, 2) a close-spaced gravity and ground magnetics program to help identify potential mineralized faults, and 3) various ground electrical surveys to better evaluate alteration and structure. Mitsui Mineral Development Engineering Co. Ltd. ("MINDECO") is conducting this work which is expected to take approximately three months. Data from these surveys will drive future drill targeting. Specialized stream sediment sampling using a technique called bulk leach extractable gold ("BLEG") is being conducted over the greater prospecting license area. BLEG sampling produces highly sensitive results that can help identify new mineralized areas. Accompanying reconnaissance BLEG sampling, a team of Irving geologists is undertaking reconnaissance mapping and prospecting. This team has already identified several new areas of hot spring silica deposits, called sinter, and collected rock chip samples to determine if they are gold-bearing. Irving plans similar prospecting activities at its Utanobori, Rubeshibe, Eniwa and Sado projects later this year.

Tanzania

Project Overiview 

Irving’s subsidiary, Spring Take Limited was granted two prospecting licenses in Mpwapwa District of the Dodoma Region in east-central Tanzania. These prospecting licenses were granted on September 18th and on October 6th, 2015 for a period of 48 months. The targeted commodity on these prospecting licenses is copper and associated metals. Small artisinal copper mines, both active and inactive, are scattered throughout this area.  Supergene enriched copper mineralization occurs within weathered, high rank metamorphic rocks.  Underlying hypogene copper mineralization may be of iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) type or highly metamorphosed volcanogenic and/or sedimentary-hosted copper sulfide deposits.The exploration team formed by the Joint Venture with JOGMEC commenced the Phase I field program on November 24th, 2015. The program encompasses local community consultations as well as soil geochemical sampling is expected to take three weeks.  Multi-element results from soil samples are expected back in early 2016 at which time a decision will be made on future exploration on the property.
