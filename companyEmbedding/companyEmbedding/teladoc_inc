These are the most common questions we get asked.
General Medical
How much does it cost?
The cost of a Teladoc visit varies, depending on your plan design.
Do I talk to “real doctors”?
Yes. Teladoc members only talk to actual doctors who are U.S. board-certified internists, state-licensed family practitioners, and pediatricians licensed to practice medicine in the U.S. and living in the U.S. When you request a visit, Teladoc will connect you with a doctor licensed in your state.
What are some of the common conditions Teladoc treats?
Common conditions include sinus problems, respiratory infection, allergies, urinary tract infection, cold and flu symptoms and many other non-emergency illnesses.
Can Teladoc handle my emergency situations?
Teladoc is designed to handle non-emergent medical problems. You should NOT use it if you are experiencing a medical emergency.
Can I request a particular doctor?
You cannot request a particular doctor. Teladoc is designed to support your relationship with your existing doctor. It is not a means of establishing an exclusive relationship with one of our doctors. All Teladoc doctors are board-certified, state-licensed and go through rigorous training and credentialing.
Can I use it for my family?
This varies depending on your specific plan. Most plan designs allow you to use the Teladoc service for you, your spouse and your dependents.
Can I get a prescription?
Teladoc does not guarantee prescriptions. It is up to the doctor to recommend the best treatment. Teladoc doctors do not issue prescriptions for substances controlled by the DEA, non-therapeutic, and/or certain other drugs which may be harmful because of their potential for abuse. Also, non-therapeutic drugs such as Viagra and Cialis are not prescribed by Teladoc doctors.

The physician will send you a message through your Message Center asking for further clarification. You can choose how you are alerted that a new message is in your Message Center (i.e. text or email).
Do I have to have online access to have a Dermatology visit?
Yes.  Because of the nature of the Dermatology visit (required images and additional health information), you must have online access.

Yes.  A member can choose to see the same specialist or a different one.  It’s your choice.
How secure is the communication line and who retains my medical records?

You will need a telephone for telephonic visits.  For video visits, you will need to have internet connectivity and webcam. Video visits are strongly encouraged by our specialists.
What if I need a medication?
Psychiatrists are able to prescribe from a limited formulary.  If the Behavioral Health specialist determines a different/higher level medication is appropriate, they may refer you for an in-person visit.
Can I select my doctor based on preferences such as specialty, gender, language?
Our specialist profiles display information about each Teladoc professional, including gender, language and specialty.  This information will display when making your specialist selection online.

For patients whose test results are positive or require further explanation, you are able to request a visit with one of our doctors. If appropriate, the doctor will write a prescription for treatment or provide linkage to further care.
How quickly can I get my test results?
Test results are typically ready in 3 business days or less.
