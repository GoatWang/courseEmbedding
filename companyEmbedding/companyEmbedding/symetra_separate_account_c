First Symetra National Life Insurance Company of New York ( First Symetra, we, and us ), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Symetra Life Insurance Company which engages primarily in insurance and financial services businesses. First Symetra National Life Insurance Company of New York was incorporated as a stock life insurance company under New York law on April 23, 1987 under the name First Safeco National Life Insurance Company of New York. On September 1, 2004, First Safeco National Life Insurance Company of New York changed its name to First Symetra National Life Insurance Company of New York. We established First Symetra Separate Account S (the Separate Account ) to hold assets that underlie Contract Values invested in the Sub-accounts. The Separate Account meets the definition of separate account under New York State law and under the federal securities laws. The Separate Account is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) as a unit investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. We maintain records of all Separate Account purchases and redemptions of the shares of the Sub-accounts. Accumulation Units will reflect the investment performance of the Separate Account with respect to amounts allocated to it. Since the Separate Account is always fully invested in the shares of the Sub-accounts, its investment performance reflects the investment performance of those entities. The values of such shares held by the Separate Account fluctuate and are subject to the risks of changing economic conditions. The Contract Owner bears the entire investment risk. There can be no assurance that the aggregate value in the Contract will equal or exceed the Purchase Payments made under the Contract. SERVICES Experts The statutory-basis financial statements and schedules of First Symetra National Life Insurance Company of New York as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, and the financial statements of First Symetra Separate Account S as of December 31, 2012, and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2012, appearing in the SAI of the Registration Statement have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, as set forth in their reports thereon appearing elsewhere herein, and are included in reliance upon such reports given on the authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing.

Subsequent Events6 First Symetra Separate Account S Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors of First Symetra National Life Insurance Company of New York and Participants of First Symetra Separate Account S We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of First Symetra Separate Account S ( Separate Account ) comprised of the sub-accounts described in Note 1, as of December 31, 2012, and the related statements of operations for the year then ended, and the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, or for those sub-accounts operating for portions of such periods as disclosed in the financial statements. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Separate Account s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Separate Account s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Separate Account s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2012, by correspondence with the custodian. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each of the respective sub-accounts constituting First Symetra Separate Account S at December 31, 2012, the results of their operations for the year then ended, and the changes in their net assets for the periods described above, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Seattle, Washington April 30,7 First Symetra Separate Account S Statements of Assets and Liabilities As of December 31, 2012 Sub-Accounts FIDELITY VIP ING MONEY JP MORGAN AMERICAN FEDERATED MARKET ING EMERGING CENTURY MANAGED SERVICE GLOBAL MARKETS BALANCED VOLATILITY II CLASS RESOURCES EQUITY I ASSETS: Investments in Underlying: Investments, at Cost $ 33,084 $ 11,687 $ 12,893 $ 3,735 $ 8,264 Shares Owned 4,657 1,069 12, Investments, at Fair Value $ 33,204 $ 10,235 $ 12,893 $ 3,722 $ 9,112 Total Assets 33,204 10,235 12,893 3,722 9,112 LIABILITIES: Total Liabilities NET ASSETS $ 33,204 $ 10,235 $ 12,893 $ 3,722 $ 9,112 Spinnaker Net Assets $ 2,133 $ 3,254 $ 6,953 $ 3,722 $ 9,112 Accumulation Units Outstanding Accumulation Unit Value $ $ $ $ $ Spinnaker Plus Net Assets $ 31,071 $ 6,981 $ 5,940 $ - $ - Accumulation Units Outstanding 2, Accumulation Unit Value $ $ $ $ - $ - Sub-Accounts PIONEER PIONEER PIONEER GROWTH MID CAP FUND VCT OPPORTUNITIES VALUE CLASS I VCT CLASS I VCT CLASS I ASSETS: Investments in Underlying: Investments, at Cost $ 38,714 $ 53,928 $ 6,560 Shares Owned 1,774 2, Investments, at Fair Value $ 37,079 $ 58,828 $ 8,276 Total Assets 37,079 58,828 8,276 LIABILITIES: Total Liabilities NET ASSETS $ 37,079 $ 58,828 $ 8,276 Spinnaker Net Assets $ 21,681 $ 58,828 $ 8,276 Accumulation Units Outstanding 381 1, Accumulation Unit Value $ $ $ Spinnaker Plus Net Assets $ 15,398 $ - $ - Accumulation Units Outstanding Accumulation Unit Value $ $ - $ - Sub-accounts with no amounts reported (left blank) are not offered in the product.

Expenses and Related Party Tranactions for additional information pertaining to the funds. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND USE OF ESTIMATES The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), including the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The preparation of the Separate Account financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Separate Account to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts reported in the audited financial statements and accompanying notes. INVESTMENT VALUATION Investments in portfolio shares are valued at fair value based on the net asset value (NAV) as reported by the underlying Mutual Fund on the last trading day of the year. The Separate Account determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize its use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. This fair value hierarchy prioritizes fair value measurements into the three levels based on the nature of the inputs. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities have the highest priority ( Level 1 ), followed by significant observable inputs other than quoted market prices, including prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities ( Level 2 ) and significant unobservable inputs, including the reporting entity s estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use, having the lowest priority ( Level 3 ). The availability of observable market information is the principal factor in determining the level to which the Separate Account s investments are assigned in the fair value hierarchy. As such, all Separate Account investments have been classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. 915 First Symetra Separate Account S Notes to Financial Statements 2.

which such broker-dealers would be authorized to participate in the sale of the 
Contracts.

C.  The parties to this Agreement desire that Broker-Dealer and   
Insurance Agency be authorized to solicit applications for the sale of the      
Contracts subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

2.  AUTHORIZATION OF BROKER-DEALER AND INSURANCE AGENCY                         

(a)      Pursuant to the authority granted to it in the Distribution            
      Agreements, SSI hereby authorizes Broker-Dealer under the securities
    laws, and SAFECO Life hereby authorizes Insurance Agency under the
insurance laws, each in a non-exclusive capacity, to sell the 
Contracts.  Broker-Dealer and Insurance Agency accept such    
authorization.                                                

(b)      Broker-Dealer and Insurance Agency acknowledge that no territory is    
      exclusively assigned hereunder, and SAFECO reserves the right in its
     sole discretion to establish or appoint one or more agencies in any
      jurisdiction in which Insurance Agency transacts business hereunder.

(c)      Insurance Agency is vested under this Agreement with power and         
authority to select and recommend individuals associated with 
     Insurance Agency for appointment as Agents of SAFECO Life, and only
     individuals so recommended by Insurance Agency shall become Agents,
        provided that SAFECO Life reserves the right in its sole discretion to
       refuse to appoint any proposed agent or, once appointed, to terminate
the same at any time with or without cause.                   

(d)      Neither Broker-Dealer nor Insurance Agency shall expend or contract    
        for the expenditure of the funds of SSI or SAFECO Life.  Broker-Dealer
      and Insurance Agency each shall pay all expenses incurred by each of
them in the performance of this Agreement, unless otherwise   
    specifically provided for in this Agreement or unless SAFECO shall
 have agreed in advance in writing to share the cost of any such
     expenses.  Initial and renewal state appointment fees for Insurance
    Agency and appointees of Insurance Agency as Agents of SAFECO Life
    will be paid by SAFECO Life or Insurance Agency in accordance with
       SAFECO Life's policies and procedures, which may be changed by SAFECO
  Life in its sole discretion at any time without notice.  Neither
  Broker-Dealer nor Insurance Agency shall possess or exercise any
        authority on behalf of SAFECO Life other than that expressly conferred
on Broker-Dealer or Insurance Agency by this Agreement.  In   
       particular, and without limiting the foregoing, neither Broker-Dealer
       nor Insurance Agency shall have any authority, nor shall either grant
       such authority to any Agent, on behalf of SAFECO Life: to make, alter
        or discharge any Contract or other contract entered into pursuant to a
  Contract; to waive any Contract provision; to extend the time of
   paying any Premiums; to endorse checks or money orders payable to
       SAFECO Life; or to receive any monies or Premiums from applicants for
or purchasers of the Contracts (except for the sole purpose of
forwarding monies or Premiums to SAFECO Life).                

(e)      Broker-Dealer and Insurance Agency acknowledge that, to the extent     
       permitted by law, SAFECO Life has the right in its sole discretion to
     reject any applications or Premiums received by it and to return or
refund to an applicant such applicant's Premium.              

(f)      Schedule 1 to this Agreement may be amended upon notice by SAFECO Life 
      in its sole discretion from time to time to include other classes of
      variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance contracts. The
       provisions of this Agreement shall be equally applicable to each such
       class of Contracts unless the context otherwise requires.  Schedule 1
to this Agreement

delete classes of variable annuity contracts or variable life 
insurance contracts.                                          

(g)      SAFECO acknowledges that Broker-Dealer and Insurance Agency are each   
      an independent contractor.  Accordingly, Broker-Dealer and Insurance
      Agency are not obliged or expected to give full time and energies to
       the performance of their obligations hereunder, nor are Broker-Dealer
     and Insurance Agency obliged or expected to represent SSI or SAFECO
Life exclusively.  Nothing herein contained shall constitute  
Broker-Dealer, Insurance Agency, the Agents or any agents or  
      representatives of Broker-Dealer or Insurance Agency as employees of
        SSI or SAFECO Life in connection with the solicitation of applications
for the Contracts.                                            

3.  LICENSING AND REGISTRATION OF BROKER-DEALER, INSURANCE AGENCY AND AGENTS    

(a)      Broker-Dealer represents that it is a broker-dealer registered with    
the SEC under the 1934 Act, and is a member of the NASD.      
    Broker-Dealer must, at all times when performing its functions and
        fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement, be duly registered as
a broker-dealer under the 1934 Act and in each state or other 
      jurisdiction in which Broker-Dealer intends to perform its functions
and fulfill its obligations hereunder, and be a member in good
standing of the NASD.                                         

(b)      Insurance Agency represents that it is a licensed life insurance agent 
  where required to solicit applications, except that if Insurance
        Agency cannot be qualified to be a licensed life insurance agent until
 appointed by an insurer, Insurance Agency represents that it is
       qualified to be a licensed insurance agent but for the appointment by
      an insurer.  Insurance Agency must, at all times when performing its
        functions and fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement, be duly
       licensed to sell the Contracts in each state or other jurisdiction in
     which Insurance Agency intends to perform its functions and fulfill
its obligations hereunder.                                    

(c)      Broker-Dealer shall ensure that no individual shall offer or sell the  
Contracts on behalf of Broker-Dealer in any state or other    
      jurisdiction in which the Contracts may lawfully be sold unless such
       individual is an associated person of Broker- Dealer (as that term is
       defined in section 3(a)(18) of the 1934 Act) and duly registered with
        the NASD and any applicable state securities regulatory authority as a
       registered person of Broker-Dealer qualified to sell the Contracts in
such state or jurisdiction.                                   

(d)      Insurance Agency shall ensure that no individual shall offer or sell   
   the Contracts on behalf of Insurance Agency in any state or other
       jurisdiction unless such individual is duly licensed and appointed as
    an agent of SAFECO Life, and appropriately licensed, registered or
       otherwise qualified to offer and sell the Contracts to be offered and
   sold by such individual under the insurance laws of such state or
      jurisdiction.  Insurance Agency shall furnish SAFECO Life with proof
        of proper licensing of Agents or other proof, reasonably acceptable to
      SAFECO, of satisfaction by Agents of licensing requirements prior to
        SAFECO Life appointing any such individual as an Agent of SAFECO Life.

with the Commission; and    

             (B)      are complying and will continue to comply with the

              securities-related activities of licensed insurance agencies
             involved in the distribution of variable insurance products
               and agree that during the term of the Agreement Broker-Dealer

                meaning of Section 3(a)(18) of the 1934 Act;

               (C)      Insurance Agency will engage in the offer or sale of
                         the Contracts only through persons who are registered
persons of Broker-Dealer;   

               (D)      Insurance Agency will not receive or handle customer
                     funds or securities except through Agents who are
        registered persons of Broker-Dealer;

              (E)      Broker-Dealer will be responsible for the training,
                 supervision and control of registered persons
                     engaging in the offer or sale of the Contracts on
                     behalf of Insurance Agency, as required under the

rules thereunder; and       

              (G)      Commissions and fees relating to the Contracts will
                       be reflected in the quarterly FOCUS reports and the

        which the Contracts may not be lawfully sold or offered for sale.  For
purposes of determining where the Contracts may be offered and

(f)      In addition to any other provisions of this Agreement applicable to    
   Agents, Broker-Dealer and Insurance Agency shall ensure that each
      Agent shall comply with a standard of conduct applicable to licensed
insurance agents including, but not limited to, the following:

   (i)     An Agent shall recommend the purchase of a Contract to an
               applicant only if he or she has reasonable grounds to believe
                that such purchase is suitable for the applicant in accordance
               with, among other things, applicable regulations of any state
       insurance regulatory authority, the SEC and the NASD.

       (ii)    An Agent shall accept initial Premiums in the form of a check
               or money order only if made payable to "SAFECO Life Insurance
Company" and signed by the applicant for the Contract.  An
       Agent shall not accept third-party checks or cash for
Premiums.                                     

        (iii)   All checks and money orders and applications for the Contracts
             received by an Agent shall be remitted promptly, and in any

 (iv)    An Agent shall not encourage a prospective purchaser to
                surrender or exchange an insurance policy or contract in order
        to purchase a Contract, or conversely, to surrender or
            exchange a Contract in order to purchase another insurance
             policy or contract unless proper state required replacement
procedures are adhered to.                    

(g)      Upon issuance of a Contract, SAFECO Life shall, in accordance with its 
    procedures with respect to each class of Contracts, either deliver
     such Contract directly to the purchaser or deliver such Contract to
   Insurance Agency or the Agent for delivery to the purchaser. Upon
        issuance of a Contract by SAFECO Life and delivery of such Contract to
        Insurance Agency or the Agent, Insurance Agency shall promptly deliver
        such Contract, or ensure prompt delivery by Agent of such Contract, to
        its purchaser.  Insurance Agency or the Agent shall return promptly to
   SAFECO Life all receipts for delivered Contracts, all undelivered
     Contracts and all receipts for cancellation, in accordance with the
instructions provided by SAFECO Life.                         

(h)      In the event that Premiums are sent to Insurance Agency or             
        Broker-Dealer, rather than to the Service Center, Insurance Agency and
  Broker-Dealer shall promptly (and in any event, not later than 2
  business days) remit such Premiums to SAFECO Life at the Service
     Center.  Insurance Agency and Broker-Dealer acknowledge that if any
      Premium is held at any time by either of them, such Premium shall be
       held on behalf of the customer, and Insurance Agency or Broker-Dealer
        shall segregate such Premium from their own funds and promptly (and in
any

times be the property of SAFECO Life.                         

(i)      Neither Broker-Dealer, Insurance Agency nor any Agent, in connection   
        with the offer or sale of the Contracts, shall give any information or
     make any representations or statements, written or oral, concerning
 the Contracts, a Fund or Fund Shares, other than information or
representations which are in accordance with the Prospectuses,
      statements of additional information and Registration Statements for
        the Contracts, or a Fund, or in reports or proxy statements therefore,
       or in promotional, sales or advertising material or other information
supplied and approved in writing by SAFECO.                   

(j)      Neither Broker-Dealer, Insurance Agency nor any Agent shall use or     
      implement any promotional, sales or advertising material relating to
the Contracts without the prior written approval of SAFECO.   

(k)      Broker-Dealer and Insurance Agency shall be solely responsible under   
       applicable tax laws for the reporting of compensation paid to Agents.

(l)      Insurance Agency represents that it maintains and shall maintain such  
     books and records concerning the activities of the Agents as may be
     required by the appropriate insurance regulatory agencies that have
jurisdiction and that may be reasonably required by SAFECO to 
       adequately reflect the Contracts business processed through Insurance
       Agency.  Insurance Agency shall make such books and records available
  to SAFECO at any reasonable time upon written request by SAFECO.

(m)      Broker-Dealer represents that it maintains and shall maintain          
       appropriate books and records concerning the activities of the Agents
as are required by the SEC, the NASD and other agencies having
       jurisdiction and that may be reasonably required by SAFECO to reflect
       adequately the Contracts business processed through Insurance Agency.
        Broker-Dealer shall make such books and records available to SAFECO at
any reasonable time upon written request by SAFECO.           

(n)      Each party shall promptly furnish to any other party, or its           
        authorized agent any reports and information that the requesting party
may reasonably request for the purpose of meeting such party's
      reporting and recordkeeping requirements under the insurance laws of
    any state, under any applicable federal and state securities laws,
rules and regulations, and the rules of the NASD.             

5.  SALES MATERIALS

      provisions of this Agreement.  Any amendment to Schedules 2 and/or 3
        will be applicable to any Contract for which an application or premium
     is received by the Service Center on or after the effective date of
       such amendment or which is in effect after the effective date of such
        amendment.  Compensation with respect to any Contract shall be paid to
Insurance Agency only for so long as Insurance Agency is the  
       Broker-of-Record for such Contract. When the balance due to Insurance
 Agency is less than a reasonable minimum established by SAFECO,
    payments to Insurance Agency may be paid only when such minimum is
reached.                                                      

(b)      Broker-Dealer and Insurance Agency recognize that all compensation     
   payable to Insurance Agency hereunder will be disbursed by SAFECO
     after Premiums are received and accepted by SAFECO Life and that no
      compensation of any kind other than that described in this Agreement
is payable to Insurance Agency.                               

(c)      Chargebacks:  The commissions payable pursuant to Schedules 2 and/or 3 
      may be adjusted, and any commission already paid, returned to SAFECO
   by Insurance Agency on request as provided therein.  If repayment
       and/or payment under any of the provisions of Schedules 2 and/or 3 is
not promptly made following receipt of a notice of request for
       repayment, Insurance Agency authorizes SAFECO, at its sole option and
        to the extent permitted by applicable law, to deduct any such unrepaid
     compensation or unpaid payment from any future compensation owed by
     SAFECO or any affiliate of SAFECO to Insurance Agency as it becomes
      due; provided, however, that this option on the part of SAFECO shall
       not prevent it from pursuing any other means or remedies available to
it to recover such compensation and/or payment.               

(d)      Broker-Dealer or Insurance Agency shall immediately remit to SAFECO    
  Life any premium retained in error by Broker-Dealer or Insurance
Agency.

          Agreement, or breach in a material respect, any of their
       respective representations or warranties made in this
              Agreement, any non-defaulting or non-breaching party may, at
           their option, cancel and terminate this Agreement without

          received by SAFECO Life prior to termination or Premiums
              received on such Contracts subsequent to termination of this
        Agreement provided, however, that if this Agreement is

(a)      Broker-Dealer and Insurance Agency, jointly and severally, shall       
       indemnify and hold harmless SAFECO and each person who controls or is
   associated with SAFECO within the meaning of such terms under the
       federal securities laws, and any officer, director, employee or agent
  of the foregoing, against any and all losses, claims, damages or
       liabilities, joint or several (including any investigative, legal and
        other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with, and any amounts
    paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claim
      asserted), to which they or any of them may become subject under any
    statute or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such
        losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of or are based upon:

      (i)     violation(s) by Broker-Dealer, Insurance Agency, or an Agent
                of federal or state securities law or regulation(s), insurance
               law or regulation(s), or any rule or requirement of the NASD;

    (ii)    any unauthorized use of sales or advertising material, any
           oral or written misrepresentations, or any unlawful sales
       practices concerning the Contracts, by Broker-Dealer,
Insurance Agency or an Agent;                 

    (iii)   claims by the Agents or other agents or representatives of
            Insurance Agency or Broker-Dealer for commissions or other
compensation or remuneration of any type;     

  (iv)    any action or inaction by a clearing broker through whom
             Broker-Dealer or Insurance Agency processes any transaction
pursuant to this Agreement;                   

        (v)     any failure on the part of Broker-Dealer, Insurance Agency, or
                an Agent to submit Premiums or applications to SAFECO Life, or
              to submit the correct amount of a Premium, on a timely basis
         and in accordance with Section 4 of this Agreement;  or

        (vi)    a breach by Broker-Dealer or Insurance Agency of any provision
of this Agreement.                            

 This indemnification will be in addition to any liability which
Broker-Dealer and Insurance Agency may otherwise have.        

    (b)     SAFECO shall indemnify and hold harmless Broker-Dealer and
                Insurance Agency and each person who controls or is associated
              with Broker-Dealer or Insurance Agency within the meaning of
                such terms under the federal securities laws, and any officer,
               director, employee or agent of the foregoing, against any and
              all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several
        (including any investigative, legal and other expenses
              reasonably incurred in connection with, and any amounts paid
               in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claim
            asserted), to which they or any of them may become subject
              under any statute or regulation, at common law or otherwise,
              insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise
out of or are based upon:                     

                (i)       any breach by SSI or SAFECO Life of any provision of
this Agreement;           

-12-

P-->EX-3.(II)13thÂ PageÂ ofÂ 27TOC1stPreviousNextâBottomJustÂ 13th

               (ii)     any untrue statement of a material fact contained in
                        the Registration Statement or Prospectus relating to
any Contract;               

                (iii)    the omission therefrom of a material fact required to
                         be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading;     

                (iv)     violation(s) by SAFECO of federal or state securities
                         law or regulation(s), insurance law or regulation(s),
              or any rule or requirement of the NASD; or

                (v)      any breach of a fiduciary duty owed by SAFECO Life to
                a contractholder with respect to a Contract.

        This indemnification will be in addition to any liability which SAFECO
may otherwise have.                                           

(c)     After receipt by a party entitled to indemnification  
              ("indemnified party") under this Section 13 of notice of the
              commencement of any action, if a claim in respect thereof is
    to be made against any person obligated to provide
               indemnification under this Section 13 ("indemnifying party"),
              such indemnified party will notify the indemnifying party in
            writing of the commencement thereof as soon as practicable
         thereafter, provided that the omission to so notify the
           indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability
               under this Section 13, except to the extent that the omission
           results in a failure of actual notice to the indemnifying
          party and such indemnifying party is damaged solely as a
              result of the failure to give such notice.  The indemnifying
                party, upon the request of the indemnified party, shall retain
             counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to
    represent the indemnified party and any others the
               indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall
                pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such
            proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party
              shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees
              and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
             indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the
               indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention
       of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such
               proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the
  indemnifying party and the indemnified party and
             representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
              inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests
               between them.  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for
               any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written
              consent, but if such proceeding is settled with such consent
            or if final judgment is entered in such proceeding for the
       plaintiff, the indemnifying party shall indemnify the
             indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by
reason of such settlement or judgment.

14.  RIGHTS, REMEDIES, ETC., ARE CUMULATIVE.  The rights, remedies and          
obligations contained in this Agreement are cumulative and are in addition to   
any and all rights, remedies and obligations, at law or in equity, which the    
parties hereto are entitled to under state and federal laws.  Failure of a      
party to insist upon strict compliance with any of the conditions of this       
Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any of the conditions, but the  
same shall remain in full force and effect.  No waiver of any of the provisions 
of this Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other   
provisions, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute a           
continuing waiver.

18.  HEADINGS.  The headings in this Agreement are included for convenience of  
reference only and in no way define or delineate any of the provisions hereof   
or otherwise affect their construction or effect.                               

19.  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, 
each of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.      

20.  SEVERABILITY.  This is a severable Agreement.  In the event that any       
provision of this Agreement would require a party to take action prohibited by  
applicable federal or state law or prohibit a party from taking action required 
by applicable federal or state law, then it is the intention of the parties     
hereto that such provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted under the  
law, and, in any event, that all other provisions of this Agreement shall       
remain valid and duly enforceable as if the provision at issue had never been a 
part hereof.                                                                    

21.  AUDIT OF RECORDS. To the extent not otherwise provided herein, each party  
hereto (the "Requesting Party") shall have the right at its expense, upon       
reasonable notice to any other party hereto (the "Other Party"), during regular 
business hours, to audit all the records and practices of the Other Party       
relating to the business contemplated hereunder in order to determine whether   
such Other Party is complying with the terms of this Agreement, including the   
payment of commissions and fees.  The Requesting Party shall have the right to  
copy any of such records at its expense.  At its option, such audit may be      
conducted by the Requesting Party's own personnel or by a qualified independent 
auditor selected by it.  The Requesting Party shall make reasonable efforts to  
conduct each such audit in a manner that avoids any material disruption of the  
Other Party's business.                                                         

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to

TERMS                                                                           
1.       VARIABLE ANNUITY PRODUCTS                                              

    Spinnaker Q, Spinnaker Group, Spinnaker NQ Flex and Spinnaker Plus
   shall be referred to herein as the Spinnaker Series. The MainSail
        Variable Annuity shall be referred to herein as MainSail. The Resource
       Variable Account B annuity shall be referred to herein as Resource B.
    For the purposes of this Schedule, the term "deposit" shall mean a
    payment under a Contract to purchase benefits under such Contract.

2.       BASE COMMISSIONS                                                       

     Commissions for deposits shall be limited to those specified by the
 most current Schedule 2-A in effect at the time the business is
approved by the Pension Department. The right to receive the  
         commissions set forth in this Schedule is conditioned upon satisfactory
service by Insurance Agent and Agents to Contract owners.     

3.       CHANGE OF SERVICING AGENT                                              

       Requests for a change of servicing Agent may be granted if it appears
      to be in the best interests of the Contract owner and SAFECO Life. A
        change of servicing Agent may result in transfer of the rights to base
    commissions to the broker/dealer and/or insurance agent of the new
         servicing Agent. Contracts for which an Agent cannot be located, within
         a reasonable amount of time, will be converted to SAFECO Life accounts.

4.       TERMINATION OF SALES AGREEMENT                                         

         If the Sales Agreement is terminated, SAFECO shall continue to pay base
    commissions on additional deposits to existing Contracts for which
      Agent is Broker-of-Record subject to all terms and conditions of the
 most current Schedule 2-A in effect, regardless of whether such
      schedule was part of the Sales Agreement at the time of termination.

5.       AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS

         Spinnaker Series and Resource B. New sales to individuals over attained
age 80 are not allowed for MainSail.                          

6.       SINGLE SUM DEPOSITS                                                    

  Single Sum Deposits shall mean deposits which are not ongoing in
nature.

     Continuing Deposits shall mean ongoing deposits expected to be made
        each contract year. Increases in continuing deposits are determined by
 comparing continuing deposits with the highest prior continuing
deposits received for a contract year.                        

    Renewals of continuing deposits are those received after the first
contract year, excluding any increases.                       

8.       ATTAINED AGES

CONDITIONS                                                                      
A.    RECALL OF BASE COMMISSIONS                                                

     Insurance Agent will repay SAFECO base commissions, not to exceed amounts
paid to Insurance Agent, under the following conditions:            

1.  Withdrawals during the first Contract year (all products)       

         If withdrawals in excess of 10% of the contract value are made during
     the first 12 months from any variable annuity products, Insurance
         Agent will repay SAFECO base commission on the amount withdrawn, less
applicable distribution charges.                            

2.  Withdrawals during the second certificate year                  

     If withdrawals in excess of 10% of the certificate value are made
     during the second 12 months, Insurance Agent will repay SAFECO an
      amount equal to the renewal rate for base commission on the amount
          withdrawn. This provision will apply only to withdrawals attributed to
Resource B first year Continuing Deposits and Increases for 
    individuals under attained age 59 1/2 at certificate issue date.

3.  Withdrawals after the expiration of CDSCP                       

        If withdrawals in excess of 10% of the Contract value are made after
  the expiration of CDSCP, Insurance Agent will repay SAFECO the
     following base commissions generated in the current and prior two
contract years on the amount withdrawn:                     

    (i)  Resource B, Spinnaker Q and Spinnaker Group first-year base
              commissions due to Increases in Continuing Deposits which are in
           excess of commissions which would been payable at the renewal
commission rate;                                  

      (ii) Resource B,  Spinnaker Q  and Spinnaker Group Single Sum base
commissions; and                                  

       (iii) MainSail and Spinnaker NQ Flex base commissions on Continuing
         and Single Sum deposits. If transfers are made between QPA Series III
          and Resource B, or between QPA Series V and Spinnaker Q in the current
          and prior two contract years, then the two products will be considered
together for purposes of recall provision A. 3.

P-->EX-3.(II)23rdÂ PageÂ ofÂ 27TOC1stPreviousNextâBottomJustÂ 23rd

     For purposes of tracking deposits for which recalls are processed
        under Provisions A.1., 2. and 3., first-year Continuing Deposits and
        Increases are considered first, followed by Single Sum Deposits, and
finally commissionable transfers.                           

Provisions A.1., 2., and 3 will not apply to:               

-    Annuity payments;                                      
 -    Non-commissionable transfers between SAFECO Life Company
products;                                         
-    Death benefit payments;                                
          -    Systematic withdrawals made according to IRC Section 72(t), 72(q)
or 401(a)(9);                                     
   -    Systematic  withdrawals from nonqualified  plans which are
        calculated in the same manner as IRC Section 401(a)(9); or
-    Payments for long term care.                           

4.  Nonrecurring Resource B Deposits in the Second Certificate Year 

   Compensation for First-Year Continuing Deposits is based on the
        certificateholder depositing in the second certificate year at least
      50% of the First-Year Continuing Deposits. If that does not occur,
        Insurance Agent will reimburse SAFECO compensation at the Single Sum
       rate on the difference between the first and second year Continuing
        Deposits. If annual deposits to existing SAFECO Life pension annuity
     products cease with subsequent deposits going to Resource B, base
commissions will be paid at the renewal rate only. If a     
        certificateholder has both QPA III and Resource B products, deposits
will be combined for application of this Provision A.4.     

 5.  Nonrecurring Spinnaker Q and Spinnaker Group Deposits under Trail
Commissions Options B and C, in the Second Contract Year.   

        Base commissions for First-Year Continuing Deposits are based on the
         Contractowners depositing in the second Contract year at least 50% of
         the First-Year Continuing Deposits. If that does not occur, Insurance
          Agent will reimburse SAFECO base commissions at a rate of 2.75% on the
     difference between the first and second year Continuing Deposits.

B.    NON-COMMISSIONABLE TRANSACTIONS & EXCEPTIONS                              

     No commissions will be paid on any deposit resulting from the withdrawal,
    re-deposit and/or transfer of funds from one SAFECO Life Company product
to another or between variable annuity sub-accounts except for:     

1.  Proceeds from any matured GIC or GRA; or                        

     2.  Transfers including 10% penalty-free amounts and amounts after paying
       any distribution charges from Resource B to QPA Series V, V Plus or
VI, where the sucessor contract is not backdated.           

 No other transactions between SAFECO Life Company products other than
those listed herein will generate any base commissions.

1.       PAYMENT OF EXPENSE ALLOWANCE                                           

      For each calendar year, the expense allowance will be calculated and
         accumulated based on the schedule set forth herein. Accumulated expense
       allowance will be paid on the commission statement following the date
         Minimum Production Requirements (MPR) are met during the calendar year.
     Expense allowance for deposits during the remainder of the calendar
       year will be paid to the Insurance Agent as deposits are received and
applied by SAFECO Life.                                       

         Expense allowance for commissionable deposits shall be limited to those
      specified by the most current Schedule 2-B in effect at the time the

       The expense allowance will be paid when the Insurance Agent meets the
      MPR as announced by SAFECO Life. Selected MPR restrictions may apply
    for the first three years. MPR will be measured on a calendar year
         basis and pro-rated for partial years, based on the number of remaining
    months in the year, for agent appointments made during the current
calendar year.

      Attained ages are determined as of the date deposits are received by
    SAFECO Life. For products with joint owners, attained age shall be
