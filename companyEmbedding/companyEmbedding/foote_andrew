Engraved CDV of Commodore Andrew Hull Foote 

- (September 12, 1806 – June 26, 1863) was an American naval officer
who was noted for his service in the American Civil War and also for his
contributions to several naval reforms in the years prior to the war. When the
war came, he was appointed to command of the Western Gunboat Flotilla, predecessor
of the Mississippi River Squadron. In that position, he led the gunboats in the
Battle of Fort Henry. For his services with the Western Gunboat Flotilla, Foote
was among the first naval officers to be promoted to the then-new rank of rear
admiral.
When
the American Civil War began in 1861, Foote was in command of the New York Navy
Yard. On June 29, 1861 Foote was promoted to Captain. From 1861 to 1862, Foote
commanded the Mississippi River Squadron with distinction, organizing and
leading the gunboat flotilla in many of the early battles of the Western
Theater of the American Civil War. Even though Foote was an officer in the
United State Navy, the Western Flotilla was under the jurisdiction of the Union
Army. In early February 1862, now holding the rank of Flag Officer (equivalent
to the modern Commodore), he cooperated with General Ulysses S. Grant against
Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. Despite heavy damage to one of the gunboats,
Foote was able to quickly subdue the fort. Several days later Grant and Foote
moved against Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River. Hoping for a repeat of the
success at Fort Henry, General Grant urged Foote to attack the fort's river
batteries. Fort Donelson's guns, however, were better placed than Fort Henry's
were. Three of Foote's gunboats were damaged including the flagship, USS St.
Louis. Foote himself received a wound in his foot. For his service at Forts
Henry and Donelson, Foote received the Thanks of Congress. After repairing his
flotilla, Foote joined with General John Pope in a campaign against Island
Number Ten on the Mississippi River. In July 1862 Foote received a second
Thanks of Congress, this time for the battles of Fort Henry, Fort Donelson and
Island Number Ten.
Later
in 1862, Foote was promoted to rear admiral. In 1863, on his way to take
command of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, he suddenly died. His
untimely death in New York shocked the nation. He was interred at Grove Street
Cemetery in New Haven.
