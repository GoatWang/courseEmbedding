    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

History[edit]
The company was founded as Fidelity Management & Research (FMR) by Edward C. Johnson II in 1946.[1] In 1969, the company formed Fidelity International Limited (FIL) to serve non-U.S. markets.[3] It was spun off in 1980.[3] In 2010, it was rebranded as 'Fidelity Worldwide Investment'.[4] In 1982, the company started offering 401(k) products.[1] In 1984, the company offered computerized stock trading.[1]
In 1997, Robert Pozen was named CEO.[5] In 2010, Fidelity Ventures, its venture capital arm, was shut down, and many of the employees created Volition Capital.[6] In 2011, Fidelity changed the name of its international division from Fidelity International to Fidelity Worldwide Investment and a new logo was introduced.[7] In 2012, the company moved its Boston headquarters to 245 Summer Street.[8]
Current operations[edit]
Mutual funds[edit]
FMR has three fund divisions: Equity (headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts), High-Income (headquartered in Boston) and Fixed-Income (headquartered in Merrimack, New Hampshire). The company's largest equity mutual fund is Fidelity Contrafund, which has $107.4 billion in assets,[9] making it the largest non-indexed fund in the US. The current manager of Contrafund is William Danoff.
Fidelity Magellan is another large equity fund, with $15.5 billion in assets.[10] Its current manager is Jeffrey Feingold, who also manages the Fidelity Trend Fund. It was previously managed by Ned Johnson from May 2, 1963 to Dec. 31, 1971, Peter Lynch from May 31, 1977 to May 31, 1990 and Harry W. Lange from 2005 to 2012.
Brokerage[edit]
Fidelity Investments operates a major brokerage firm and has investor centers in over 140 locations throughout the US. Through its subsidiary, National Financial Services LLC, Fidelity Investments provides services to its correspondent broker-dealers, institutional investment firms and registered investment advisors including brokerage clearing and back office support and a suite of software products for financial services firms. National Financial was the custodian for over $443 billion in assets, in 4.3 million accounts as of September 30, 2010.[11]
Benefits outsourcing[edit]
Fidelity Personal, Workplace and Institutional Services (PWIS) is the largest provider of 401(k) retirement plan services with $1.4 trillion under administration[12] and $32 billion in total defined contribution assets, as of 2015.[13] Other services provided include pension administration, health & welfare administration, stock plan administration as well as payroll and other record-keeping services.
Devonshire Investors[edit]
The company's Devonshire Investors arm is a division that gives the owners of the company the ability to make other investments outside its funds.[14]
Assets include Veritude, an employment agency for jobs at Fidelity.[15] The company has been a major investor of real estate, owning the Seaport Center and 2.5 million square feet of office space in Boston.[16] It formerly owned Community Newspaper Company, the largest chain of newspapers in suburban Boston, Massachusetts, sold to the Boston Herald in 2000[17] and now owned by GateHouse Media. Fidelity has also strategically invested in the telecom/managed services/data center industries, including COLT Telecom Group in Europe,[18] MetroRED in South America, and KVH Co. Ltd. in Japan. Since 2008, all MetroRED ownership has been completely divested.
It was formerly heavily invested in commercial lumber and building materials.[19] In 2013, they sold Boston Coach, a limousine and black-car service, founded in 1985 by Ned Johnson after waiting too long for a taxi, to Harrison Global.[20] It formed ProBuild Holdings in 2006 and sold it to Builders FirstSource in 2015.[21]
Donor-advised fund[edit]
Fidelity manages a donor-advised fund, Fidelity Charitable, in 1991, becoming the first commercial DAF provider. As of 2017, Fidelity Charitable is currently the largest charity by donations from the public, surpassing the United Way. Tax donations to a DAF can be registered in the year of the donation, when the beneficiary may be being chosen. In a 2015 survey by Fidelity Charitable, 90% of donors who responded stated this benefit as the main reason for starting donations using a DAF. Donors also cite that this allows them to give more to charity. Investments in a DAF register interest until the distribution is given to a beneficiary.[22] Fidelity Charitable produces a report "Women and Giving" that examines differences in giving attitudes, strategies and priorities across generations and gender.[23]
In 2016, Fidelity Charitable raised nearly $7 million in bitcoin. As of June 2017, the organization's annual report said that nearly $2 billion had been committed by all funding methods, with almost $9 million in bitcoin.[24]
Legal issues[edit]
Document retention fines[edit]
In February 2007, the NASD, a division of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fined 4 FMR-affiliated broker-dealers $3.75 million for alleged registration, supervision and e-mail retention violations. The broker-dealers settled without admitting or denying the charges.[25]
In 2004, Fidelity Brokerage paid $2 million to settle charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that employees altered and destroyed documents in 21 of its 88 branch offices between January 2001 and July 2002. Fidelity has internal inspections every year to make sure it is complying with federal regulations. Management was accused of pressuring branch employees to have perfect inspections and gave notice of the inspections and that at least 62 employees destroyed or altered potentially improper documents maintained at branch offices including new account applications, letters of authorization and variable annuity forms.[26]
Misrepresentations[edit]
In May 2007, NASD fined two Fidelity broker-dealers $400,000 for preparing and distributing misleading sales literature promoting Fidelity's Destiny I and II Systematic Investment Plans, which were sold primarily to U.S. military personnel. As part of the settlement, the FMR affiliates were required to notify Destiny Plan holders who want to increase their investments in existing Destiny Plans that additional shares of the underlying fund can be purchased outside the Destiny Plans without paying the additional sales charges.[27]
Ownership and management[edit]




Fidelity Investments Investor Center on Boylston Street in Boston


Johnson Family[edit]
The founding Johnson family, individually and through various trusts, owns stock representing a 49% voting interest in FMR, and have signed agreements pledging to vote all their shares as a bloc. Edward Johnson III was chairman of the group, but was replaced by his daughter, Abigail Johnson. Abigail was once the largest single shareholder with about 25% ownership, but in October 2005, it was reported that she had sold a "significant" portion of her shares to family trusts, and that there were doubts as to whether she was still in line to succeed her father.[28]
Employees and ex-employees[edit]
Most of the remaining 51% of the company is held by various Fidelity employees and ex-employees, including fund managers and ex-managers, such as Peter Lynch.[29]
Offices[edit]
FMR's corporate headquarters are in Boston, Massachusetts, with the largest U.S. operations located in Merrimack, New Hampshire; Smithfield, Rhode Island; Westlake, Texas; Covington, Kentucky; Durham, North Carolina; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Cincinnati, Ohio; Salt Lake City, Utah; Jacksonville, Florida; Greenwood Village, Colorado; and American Fork, Utah. It also has offices in Canada in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver. Fidelity Management and Research in 2009 opened offices in both Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan to add capabilities to its small cap research.
In 2004, Fidelity established its first presence in India by opening an office in Mumbai. However, their offices in India mostly serve back-office function and do not make any investments related decisions.[1] The company has over 4,000 employees in India. Its second largest software development facility (after the United States) is in Bangalore and Chennai.
Fidelity Investments Ireland was established in 1996 as the European offshore development centre for Fidelity Investments and now employs over 1,000 people with offices in Dublin and Galway. Fidelity also has offices in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Switzerland and London for its HR Solution business HR Access.
Marketing[edit]
Paul McCartney marketing campaign[edit]
Fidelity has experimented with marketing techniques directed to the baby boomer demographic, releasing Never Stop Doing What You Love, a compilation of songs by Paul McCartney. McCartney became the firm's spokesman in 2005 in a campaign entitled "This Is Paul." On the day of the disc's release, company employees were treated to a special recorded message by Paul himself informing them that "Fidelity and [he] have a lot in common" and urging them to "never stop doing what you love".[30]

History[edit]
The company was founded as Fidelity Management & Research (FMR) by Edward C. Johnson II in 1946.[1] In 1969, the company formed Fidelity International Limited (FIL) to serve non-U.S. markets.[3] It was spun off in 1980.[3] In 2010, it was rebranded as 'Fidelity Worldwide Investment'.[4] In 1982, the company started offering 401(k) products.[1] In 1984, the company offered computerized stock trading.[1]
In 1997, Robert Pozen was named CEO.[5] In 2010, Fidelity Ventures, its venture capital arm, was shut down, and many of the employees created Volition Capital.[6] In 2011, Fidelity changed the name of its international division from Fidelity International to Fidelity Worldwide Investment and a new logo was introduced.[7] In 2012, the company moved its Boston headquarters to 245 Summer Street.[8]
Current operations[edit]
Mutual funds[edit]
FMR has three fund divisions: Equity (headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts), High-Income (headquartered in Boston) and Fixed-Income (headquartered in Merrimack, New Hampshire). The company's largest equity mutual fund is Fidelity Contrafund, which has $107.4 billion in assets,[9] making it the largest non-indexed fund in the US. The current manager of Contrafund is William Danoff.
Fidelity Magellan is another large equity fund, with $15.5 billion in assets.[10] Its current manager is Jeffrey Feingold, who also manages the Fidelity Trend Fund. It was previously managed by Ned Johnson from May 2, 1963 to Dec. 31, 1971, Peter Lynch from May 31, 1977 to May 31, 1990 and Harry W. Lange from 2005 to 2012.
Brokerage[edit]
Fidelity Investments operates a major brokerage firm and has investor centers in over 140 locations throughout the US. Through its subsidiary, National Financial Services LLC, Fidelity Investments provides services to its correspondent broker-dealers, institutional investment firms and registered investment advisors including brokerage clearing and back office support and a suite of software products for financial services firms. National Financial was the custodian for over $443 billion in assets, in 4.3 million accounts as of September 30, 2010.[11]
Benefits outsourcing[edit]
Fidelity Personal, Workplace and Institutional Services (PWIS) is the largest provider of 401(k) retirement plan services with $1.4 trillion under administration[12] and $32 billion in total defined contribution assets, as of 2015.[13] Other services provided include pension administration, health & welfare administration, stock plan administration as well as payroll and other record-keeping services.
Devonshire Investors[edit]
The company's Devonshire Investors arm is a division that gives the owners of the company the ability to make other investments outside its funds.[14]
Assets include Veritude, an employment agency for jobs at Fidelity.[15] The company has been a major investor of real estate, owning the Seaport Center and 2.5 million square feet of office space in Boston.[16] It formerly owned Community Newspaper Company, the largest chain of newspapers in suburban Boston, Massachusetts, sold to the Boston Herald in 2000[17] and now owned by GateHouse Media. Fidelity has also strategically invested in the telecom/managed services/data center industries, including COLT Telecom Group in Europe,[18] MetroRED in South America, and KVH Co. Ltd. in Japan. Since 2008, all MetroRED ownership has been completely divested.
It was formerly heavily invested in commercial lumber and building materials.[19] In 2013, they sold Boston Coach, a limousine and black-car service, founded in 1985 by Ned Johnson after waiting too long for a taxi, to Harrison Global.[20] It formed ProBuild Holdings in 2006 and sold it to Builders FirstSource in 2015.[21]
Donor-advised fund[edit]
Fidelity manages a donor-advised fund, Fidelity Charitable, in 1991, becoming the first commercial DAF provider. As of 2017, Fidelity Charitable is currently the largest charity by donations from the public, surpassing the United Way. Tax donations to a DAF can be registered in the year of the donation, when the beneficiary may be being chosen. In a 2015 survey by Fidelity Charitable, 90% of donors who responded stated this benefit as the main reason for starting donations using a DAF. Donors also cite that this allows them to give more to charity. Investments in a DAF register interest until the distribution is given to a beneficiary.[22] Fidelity Charitable produces a report "Women and Giving" that examines differences in giving attitudes, strategies and priorities across generations and gender.[23]
In 2016, Fidelity Charitable raised nearly $7 million in bitcoin. As of June 2017, the organization's annual report said that nearly $2 billion had been committed by all funding methods, with almost $9 million in bitcoin.[24]
Legal issues[edit]
Document retention fines[edit]
In February 2007, the NASD, a division of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fined 4 FMR-affiliated broker-dealers $3.75 million for alleged registration, supervision and e-mail retention violations. The broker-dealers settled without admitting or denying the charges.[25]
In 2004, Fidelity Brokerage paid $2 million to settle charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that employees altered and destroyed documents in 21 of its 88 branch offices between January 2001 and July 2002. Fidelity has internal inspections every year to make sure it is complying with federal regulations. Management was accused of pressuring branch employees to have perfect inspections and gave notice of the inspections and that at least 62 employees destroyed or altered potentially improper documents maintained at branch offices including new account applications, letters of authorization and variable annuity forms.[26]
Misrepresentations[edit]
In May 2007, NASD fined two Fidelity broker-dealers $400,000 for preparing and distributing misleading sales literature promoting Fidelity's Destiny I and II Systematic Investment Plans, which were sold primarily to U.S. military personnel. As part of the settlement, the FMR affiliates were required to notify Destiny Plan holders who want to increase their investments in existing Destiny Plans that additional shares of the underlying fund can be purchased outside the Destiny Plans without paying the additional sales charges.[27]
Ownership and management[edit]




Fidelity Investments Investor Center on Boylston Street in Boston


Johnson Family[edit]
The founding Johnson family, individually and through various trusts, owns stock representing a 49% voting interest in FMR, and have signed agreements pledging to vote all their shares as a bloc. Edward Johnson III was chairman of the group, but was replaced by his daughter, Abigail Johnson. Abigail was once the largest single shareholder with about 25% ownership, but in October 2005, it was reported that she had sold a "significant" portion of her shares to family trusts, and that there were doubts as to whether she was still in line to succeed her father.[28]
Employees and ex-employees[edit]
Most of the remaining 51% of the company is held by various Fidelity employees and ex-employees, including fund managers and ex-managers, such as Peter Lynch.[29]
Offices[edit]
FMR's corporate headquarters are in Boston, Massachusetts, with the largest U.S. operations located in Merrimack, New Hampshire; Smithfield, Rhode Island; Westlake, Texas; Covington, Kentucky; Durham, North Carolina; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Cincinnati, Ohio; Salt Lake City, Utah; Jacksonville, Florida; Greenwood Village, Colorado; and American Fork, Utah. It also has offices in Canada in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver. Fidelity Management and Research in 2009 opened offices in both Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan to add capabilities to its small cap research.
In 2004, Fidelity established its first presence in India by opening an office in Mumbai. However, their offices in India mostly serve back-office function and do not make any investments related decisions.[1] The company has over 4,000 employees in India. Its second largest software development facility (after the United States) is in Bangalore and Chennai.
Fidelity Investments Ireland was established in 1996 as the European offshore development centre for Fidelity Investments and now employs over 1,000 people with offices in Dublin and Galway. Fidelity also has offices in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Switzerland and London for its HR Solution business HR Access.
Marketing[edit]
Paul McCartney marketing campaign[edit]
Fidelity has experimented with marketing techniques directed to the baby boomer demographic, releasing Never Stop Doing What You Love, a compilation of songs by Paul McCartney. McCartney became the firm's spokesman in 2005 in a campaign entitled "This Is Paul." On the day of the disc's release, company employees were treated to a special recorded message by Paul himself informing them that "Fidelity and [he] have a lot in common" and urging them to "never stop doing what you love".[30]

Featured reviews have been selected based on subjective criteria and have been reviewed by Fidelity Investments. The average rating is determined by calculating the mathematical average of all ratings that are approved for posting per the Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use, and does not include any ratings that did not meet the guidelines and were therefore not posted).

History[edit]
The company was founded as Fidelity Management & Research (FMR) by Edward C. Johnson II in 1946.[1] In 1969, the company formed Fidelity International Limited (FIL) to serve non-U.S. markets.[3] It was spun off in 1980.[3] In 2010, it was rebranded as 'Fidelity Worldwide Investment'.[4] In 1982, the company started offering 401(k) products.[1] In 1984, the company offered computerized stock trading.[1]
In 1997, Robert Pozen was named CEO.[5] In 2010, Fidelity Ventures, its venture capital arm, was shut down, and many of the employees created Volition Capital.[6] In 2011, Fidelity changed the name of its international division from Fidelity International to Fidelity Worldwide Investment and a new logo was introduced.[7] In 2012, the company moved its Boston headquarters to 245 Summer Street.[8]
Current operations[edit]
Mutual funds[edit]
FMR has three fund divisions: Equity (headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts), High-Income (headquartered in Boston) and Fixed-Income (headquartered in Merrimack, New Hampshire). The company's largest equity mutual fund is Fidelity Contrafund, which has $107.4 billion in assets,[9] making it the largest non-indexed fund in the US. The current manager of Contrafund is William Danoff.
Fidelity Magellan is another large equity fund, with $15.5 billion in assets.[10] Its current manager is Jeffrey Feingold, who also manages the Fidelity Trend Fund. It was previously managed by Ned Johnson from May 2, 1963 to Dec. 31, 1971, Peter Lynch from May 31, 1977 to May 31, 1990 and Harry W. Lange from 2005 to 2012.
Brokerage[edit]
Fidelity Investments operates a major brokerage firm and has investor centers in over 140 locations throughout the US. Through its subsidiary, National Financial Services LLC, Fidelity Investments provides services to its correspondent broker-dealers, institutional investment firms and registered investment advisors including brokerage clearing and back office support and a suite of software products for financial services firms. National Financial was the custodian for over $443 billion in assets, in 4.3 million accounts as of September 30, 2010.[11]
Benefits outsourcing[edit]
Fidelity Personal, Workplace and Institutional Services (PWIS) is the largest provider of 401(k) retirement plan services with $1.4 trillion under administration[12] and $32 billion in total defined contribution assets, as of 2015.[13] Other services provided include pension administration, health & welfare administration, stock plan administration as well as payroll and other record-keeping services.
Devonshire Investors[edit]
The company's Devonshire Investors arm is a division that gives the owners of the company the ability to make other investments outside its funds.[14]
Assets include Veritude, an employment agency for jobs at Fidelity.[15] The company has been a major investor of real estate, owning the Seaport Center and 2.5 million square feet of office space in Boston.[16] It formerly owned Community Newspaper Company, the largest chain of newspapers in suburban Boston, Massachusetts, sold to the Boston Herald in 2000[17] and now owned by GateHouse Media. Fidelity has also strategically invested in the telecom/managed services/data center industries, including COLT Telecom Group in Europe,[18] MetroRED in South America, and KVH Co. Ltd. in Japan. Since 2008, all MetroRED ownership has been completely divested.
It was formerly heavily invested in commercial lumber and building materials.[19] In 2013, they sold Boston Coach, a limousine and black-car service, founded in 1985 by Ned Johnson after waiting too long for a taxi, to Harrison Global.[20] It formed ProBuild Holdings in 2006 and sold it to Builders FirstSource in 2015.[21]
Donor-advised fund[edit]
Fidelity manages a donor-advised fund, Fidelity Charitable, in 1991, becoming the first commercial DAF provider. As of 2017, Fidelity Charitable is currently the largest charity by donations from the public, surpassing the United Way. Tax donations to a DAF can be registered in the year of the donation, when the beneficiary may be being chosen. In a 2015 survey by Fidelity Charitable, 90% of donors who responded stated this benefit as the main reason for starting donations using a DAF. Donors also cite that this allows them to give more to charity. Investments in a DAF register interest until the distribution is given to a beneficiary.[22] Fidelity Charitable produces a report "Women and Giving" that examines differences in giving attitudes, strategies and priorities across generations and gender.[23]
In 2016, Fidelity Charitable raised nearly $7 million in bitcoin. As of June 2017, the organization's annual report said that nearly $2 billion had been committed by all funding methods, with almost $9 million in bitcoin.[24]
Legal issues[edit]
Document retention fines[edit]
In February 2007, the NASD, a division of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fined 4 FMR-affiliated broker-dealers $3.75 million for alleged registration, supervision and e-mail retention violations. The broker-dealers settled without admitting or denying the charges.[25]
In 2004, Fidelity Brokerage paid $2 million to settle charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that employees altered and destroyed documents in 21 of its 88 branch offices between January 2001 and July 2002. Fidelity has internal inspections every year to make sure it is complying with federal regulations. Management was accused of pressuring branch employees to have perfect inspections and gave notice of the inspections and that at least 62 employees destroyed or altered potentially improper documents maintained at branch offices including new account applications, letters of authorization and variable annuity forms.[26]
Misrepresentations[edit]
In May 2007, NASD fined two Fidelity broker-dealers $400,000 for preparing and distributing misleading sales literature promoting Fidelity's Destiny I and II Systematic Investment Plans, which were sold primarily to U.S. military personnel. As part of the settlement, the FMR affiliates were required to notify Destiny Plan holders who want to increase their investments in existing Destiny Plans that additional shares of the underlying fund can be purchased outside the Destiny Plans without paying the additional sales charges.[27]
Ownership and management[edit]




Fidelity Investments Investor Center on Boylston Street in Boston


Johnson Family[edit]
The founding Johnson family, individually and through various trusts, owns stock representing a 49% voting interest in FMR, and have signed agreements pledging to vote all their shares as a bloc. Edward Johnson III was chairman of the group, but was replaced by his daughter, Abigail Johnson. Abigail was once the largest single shareholder with about 25% ownership, but in October 2005, it was reported that she had sold a "significant" portion of her shares to family trusts, and that there were doubts as to whether she was still in line to succeed her father.[28]
Employees and ex-employees[edit]
Most of the remaining 51% of the company is held by various Fidelity employees and ex-employees, including fund managers and ex-managers, such as Peter Lynch.[29]
Offices[edit]
FMR's corporate headquarters are in Boston, Massachusetts, with the largest U.S. operations located in Merrimack, New Hampshire; Smithfield, Rhode Island; Westlake, Texas; Covington, Kentucky; Durham, North Carolina; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Cincinnati, Ohio; Salt Lake City, Utah; Jacksonville, Florida; Greenwood Village, Colorado; and American Fork, Utah. It also has offices in Canada in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver. Fidelity Management and Research in 2009 opened offices in both Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan to add capabilities to its small cap research.
In 2004, Fidelity established its first presence in India by opening an office in Mumbai. However, their offices in India mostly serve back-office function and do not make any investments related decisions.[1] The company has over 4,000 employees in India. Its second largest software development facility (after the United States) is in Bangalore and Chennai.
Fidelity Investments Ireland was established in 1996 as the European offshore development centre for Fidelity Investments and now employs over 1,000 people with offices in Dublin and Galway. Fidelity also has offices in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Switzerland and London for its HR Solution business HR Access.
Marketing[edit]
Paul McCartney marketing campaign[edit]
Fidelity has experimented with marketing techniques directed to the baby boomer demographic, releasing Never Stop Doing What You Love, a compilation of songs by Paul McCartney. McCartney became the firm's spokesman in 2005 in a campaign entitled "This Is Paul." On the day of the disc's release, company employees were treated to a special recorded message by Paul himself informing them that "Fidelity and [he] have a lot in common" and urging them to "never stop doing what you love".[30]

Fund Basics
Investment Details
Investment Objective

International Equity Central Fund seeks capital appreciation.

Principal Investment Strategies

FMR Co., Inc. (FMRC) normally invests the fund's assets primarily in non-U.S. securities, including securities of issuers
located in emerging markets. FMRC normally invests at least 80% of the fund's assets in equity securities. FMR normally
invests the fund's assets primarily in common stocks.

FMRC allocates the fund's assets to provide exposure to different sectors of the international market. At present, these
sectors include consumer discretionary, consumer staples, energy, financials, health care, industrials, information technology,
materials, telecom services, and utilities.

FMRC expects the fund's investments in each sector will approximate the sector weightings of the Morgan Stanley Capital
InternationalSM  Europe, Australasia, Far East (MSCI® EAFE®) Index, a market capitalization-weighted index of equity
securities of companies domiciled in various countries. The index is designed to represent the performance of developed
stock markets outside the United States and Canada and excludes certain market segments unavailable to U.S. based
investors. While FMRC may overweight or underweight one or more sectors from time to time, FMRC expects the returns
of the fund to be driven primarily by security selection.

FMRC is not constrained by any particular investment style for the fund. At any given time, the fund may buy "growth" stocks
or "value" stocks, or a combination of both. Additionally, the fund is not limited to investing in securities of a specific market
capitalization and may hold securities of large, medium and/or small capitalization companies.

FMRC normally diversifies the fund's investments across different countries and regions.

In buying and selling securities for the fund, FMRC relies on fundamental analysis of each issuer and its potential for success
in light of its current financial condition, its industry position, and economic and market conditions. Factors considered
include growth potential, earnings estimates, and management.

In addition to the principal investment strategies discussed above, FMRC may lend the fund's securities to broker-dealers or
other institutions to earn income for the fund.

FMRC may also use various techniques, such as buying and selling futures contracts and exchange traded funds, to increase
or decrease the fund's exposure to changing security prices or other factors that affect security values. If FMRC's strategies
do not work as intended, the fund may not achieve its objective.

Description of Principal Security Types

Equity securities represent an ownership interest, or the right to acquire an ownership interest, in an issuer. Different types
of equity securities provide different voting and dividend rights and priority in the event of the bankruptcy of the issuer.
Equity securities include common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible securities, and warrants.

Principal Investment Risks

Many factors affect the fund's performance. The fund's share price changes daily based on changes in market conditions and
interest rates and in response to other economic, political, or financial developments. The fund's reaction to these events will
be affected by the types of securities in which the fund invests, the financial condition, industry and economic sector,
geographic location of an issuer, and the fund's level of investment in the securities of that issuer. Because FMRC may
concentrate the fund's investments in a particular industry or group of related industries, the fund's performance could
depend heavily on the performance of that industry or group of industries and could be more volatile than the performance
of less concentrated funds. When you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you paid for them, which
means that you could lose money.

Prospectus

Fund Basics - continued

The following factors can significantly affect the fund's performance:

Stock Market Volatility. The value of equity securities fluctuates in response to issuer, political, market, and economic
developments. In the short term, equity prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to these developments. Different parts
of the market and different types of equity securities can react differently to these developments. For example, large cap
stocks can react differently from small cap stocks, and "growth" stocks can react differently from "value" stocks. Issuer,
political, or economic developments can affect a single issuer, issuers within an industry or economic sector or geographic
region, or the market as a whole. Terrorism and related geo-political risks have led, and may in the future lead, to increased
short-term market volatility and may have adverse long-term effects on world economies and markets generally.

Foreign Exposure. Foreign securities, foreign currencies, and securities issued by U.S. entities with substantial foreign
operations can involve additional risks relating to political, economic, or regulatory conditions in foreign countries. These
risks include fluctuations in foreign currencies; withholding or other taxes; trading, settlement, custodial, and other
operational risks; and the less stringent investor protection and disclosure standards of some foreign markets. All of these
factors can make foreign investments, especially those in emerging markets, more volatile and potentially less liquid than
U.S. investments. In addition, foreign markets can perform differently from the U.S. market.

Investing in emerging markets can involve risks in addition to and greater than those generally associated with investing in
more developed foreign markets. The extent of economic development; political stability; market depth, infrastructure, and
capitalization; and regulatory oversight can be less than in more developed markets. Emerging market economies can be
subject to greater social, economic, regulatory, and political uncertainties. All of these factors can make emerging market
securities more volatile and potentially less liquid than securities issued in more developed markets.

Industry Concentration. Market conditions, interest rates, and economic, regulatory, or financial developments could
significantly affect a single industry or a group of related industries, and the securities of companies in that industry or group
of industries could react similarly to these or other developments.

The consumer discretionary industries can be significantly affected by the performance of the overall economy, interest
rates, competition, and consumer confidence. Success can depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer
spending. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for, and success of, consumer products.

The industrials industries can be significantly affected by general economic trends, including employment, economic growth,
and interest rates, changes in consumer sentiment and spending, commodity prices, legislation, government regulation and
spending, import controls, and worldwide competition. For example, commodity price declines and unit volume reductions
resulting from an over-supply of materials used in cyclical industries can adversely affect those industries. Furthermore, a
company in the cyclical industries can be subject to liability for environmental damage, depletion of resources, and mandated
expenditures for safety and pollution control.

The energy industry can be significantly affected by fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of energy fuels
caused by events relating to international politics, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects, weather or
meteorological events, and tax and other government regulations.

The financials industries are subject to extensive government regulation which can limit both the amounts and types of loans
and other financial commitments they can make, and the interest rates and fees they can charge. Profitability can be largely
dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and the rate of corporate and consumer debt defaults, and can fluctuate
significantly when interest rates change. Credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers can negatively affect the
financial services industries. Insurance companies can be subject to severe price competition. The financial services industries
are currently undergoing relatively rapid change as existing distinctions between financial service segments become less clear.
For example, recent business combinations have included insurance, finance, and securities brokerage under single ownership.
Some primarily retail corporations have expanded into securities and insurance industries.

Prospectus

The consumer staples industry can be significantly affected by demographic and product trends, competitive pricing, food
fads, marketing campaigns, and environmental factors. In the United States, the agricultural products industry is subject to
regulation by numerous federal and state government agencies.

The health care industries are subject to government regulation and reimbursement rates, as well as government approval of
products and services, which could have a significant effect on price and availability. Furthermore, the types of products or
services produced or provided by health care companies quickly can become obsolete. In addition, pharmaceutical companies
and other companies in the health care industries can be significantly affected by patent expirations.

The materials industry can be significantly affected by the level and volatility of commodity prices, the exchange value of the
dollar, import controls, and worldwide competition. At times, worldwide production of industrial materials has exceeded
demand as a result of over-building or economic downturns, which has led to commodity price declines and unit price
reductions. Companies in the industry can also be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage, depletion of
resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.

The information technology industries can be significantly affected by obsolescence of existing technology, short product
cycles, falling prices and profits, competition from new market entrants, and general economic conditions.

The telecom services industry, particularly telephone operating companies, is subject to both federal and state government
regulations of rates of return and services that may be offered. Many telecommunications companies fiercely compete for
market share.

The utilities industries can be significantly affected by government regulation, financing difficulties, supply and demand of
services or fuel, changes in taxation, and natural resource conservation.

Issuer-Specific Changes. Changes in the financial condition of an issuer or counterparty, changes in specific economic or
political conditions that affect a particular type of security or issuer, and changes in general economic or political conditions
can affect a security's or instrument's value. The value of securities of smaller, less well-known issuers can be more volatile
than that of larger issuers. Smaller issuers can have more limited product lines, markets, or financial resources.

In response to market, economic, political, or other conditions, FMRC may temporarily use a different investment strategy for
defensive purposes. If FMRC does so, different factors could affect the fund's performance and the fund may not achieve its
investment objective.

Fundamental Investment Policies

The policy discussed below is fundamental, that is, subject to change only by shareholder approval.

International Equity Central Fund seeks capital appreciation.

Shareholder Notice

The following policy is subject to change only upon 60 days' prior notice to shareholders:

International Equity Central Fund normally invests at least 80% of its assets in equity securities.

Valuing Shares
The fund is open for business each day the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open.

The fund's net asset value per share (NAV) is the value of a single share. Fidelity normally calculates the fund's NAV as of the
close of business of the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. The fund's assets normally are valued as of this time for the
purpose of computing the fund's NAV. To the extent that the fund's assets are traded in other markets on days when the
fund is not open for business, the value of the fund's assets may be affected on those days. In addition, trading in some of
the fund's assets may not occur on days when the fund is open for business.

Prospectus

Fund Basics - continued

The fund's assets are valued primarily on the basis of market quotations or official closing prices. Certain short-term
securities are valued on the basis of amortized cost. If market quotations or official closing prices are not readily available or
does not accurately reflect fair value for a security or if a security's value has been materially affected by events occurring
before the fund's pricing time but after the close of the exchange or market on which the security is principally traded, that
security will be valued by another method that the Board of Directors (Board of Trustees) believes accurately reflects fair
value in accordance with the Board's fair value pricing policies. For example, arbitrage opportunities may exist when trading
in a portfolio security or securities is halted and does not resume before the fund calculates its NAV. These arbitrage
opportunities may enable short-term traders to dilute the NAV of long-term investors. Securities trading in overseas markets
present time zone arbitrage opportunities when events affecting portfolio security values occur after the close of the
overseas market but prior to the close of the U.S. market. Fair value pricing will be used for high yield debt and floating
rate loans when available pricing information is determined to be stale or for other reasons not to accurately reflect fair
value. To the extent the fund invests in other open-end funds, the fund will calculate its NAV using the NAV of the
underlying funds in which it invests as described in the underlying funds' prospectuses. The fund may invest in other
Fidelity funds that use the same fair value pricing policies as the fund or in Fidelity money market funds. A security's
valuation may differ depending on the method used for determining value. Fair valuation of a fund's portfolio securities
can serve to reduce arbitrage opportunities available to short-term traders, but there is no assurance that fair value
pricing policies will prevent dilution of the fund's NAV by short-term traders.

Prospectus

Shareholder Information
Buying and Selling Shares
The fund may reject for any reason, or cancel as permitted or required by law, any purchase orders, including transactions
deemed to represent excessive trading, at any time.

Excessive trading of fund shares can harm shareholders in various ways, including reducing the returns to long-term
shareholders by increasing costs to the fund (such as spreads paid to dealers who sell debt instruments), disrupting portfolio
management strategies, and diluting the value of the shares in cases in which fluctuations in markets are not fully priced
into the fund's NAV.

Because the fund is only offered for investment to certain other registered investment companies managed by Fidelity
Management Research Company (FMR) or an affiliate, the potential for excessive or short-term disruptive purchases and
sales is reduced. Accordingly, the Board of Trustees has not adopted policies and procedures designed to discourage
excessive trading of fund shares and the fund accommodates frequent trading.

The fund may in its discretion restrict, reject, or cancel any purchases that, in FMRC's opinion, may be disruptive to the
management of the fund or otherwise not be in the fund's interests.

The fund has no exchange privilege with any other fund. The fund has no limit on purchase transactions, but is only offered
for investment to certain other registered investment companies managed by FMR or an affiliate, which in turn have in place
FMR's policies and procedures concerning frequent trading. The fund reserves the right at any time to restrict purchases or
impose conditions that are more restrictive on excessive or disruptive trading than those stated in this prospectus.

Buying Shares

The fund offers its shares to certain other registered investment companies managed by FMR or an affiliate. Shares of the
fund are issued solely in private placement transactions that do not involve any "public offering" within the meaning of
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act). Investments in the fund may be made only by a limited number of
institutional investors including certain other registered investment companies managed by FMR or an affiliate and certain
other "accredited investors" within the meaning of Regulation D under the 1933 Act. Each shareholder is deemed to agree to,
and be bound by, the terms of Fidelity Central Investment Portfolios LLC's limited liability company agreement. This
registration statement does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any shares of the fund.

The price to buy one share of the fund is the fund's NAV. The fund's shares are sold without a sales charge.

Your shares will be bought at the next NAV calculated after your order is received in proper form.

The fund has authorized certain intermediaries and mutual funds for which FMR or an affiliate serves as investment
manager to accept orders to buy shares on its behalf. When authorized intermediaries or mutual funds receive an order in
proper form, the order is considered as being placed with the fund, and shares will be bought at the next NAV calculated
after the order is received by the authorized intermediary or mutual fund.

The fund may stop offering shares completely or may offer shares only on a limited basis, for a period of time or permanently.

When you place an order to buy shares, note the following:


All of your cash purchases must be made by federal funds wire; checks and Automated Clearing House System (ACH)
payments will not be accepted.
All wires must be received in proper form by Fidelity at the fund's designated wire bank before the close of the Federal
Reserve Wire System on the day of purchase or you could be liable for any losses or fees the fund or Fidelity has incurred or
for interest and penalties.
Investments in the fund may be made in cash or by contributing securities that are acceptable to the fund and FMRC and
that are consistent with the fund's investment objective and policies.

Shareholder Information - continued


Under applicable anti-money laundering regulations and other federal regulations, purchase orders may be suspended,
restricted, or canceled and the monies may be withheld.

Selling Shares 

The price to sell one share of the fund is the fund's NAV.

Your shares will be sold at the next NAV calculated after your order is received in proper form. Normally, redemptions will be
processed by the next business day, but it may take up to seven days to pay the redemption proceeds if making immediate
payment would adversely affect the fund.

The fund has authorized certain intermediaries to accept orders to sell shares on its behalf. When authorized intermediaries
receive an order in proper form, the order is considered as being placed with the fund, and shares will be sold at the next NAV
calculated after the order is received by the authorized intermediary. Orders by funds of funds for which FMR or an affiliate
serves as investment manager will be treated as received by the fund at the same time that the corresponding orders are
received in proper form by the funds of funds.

When you place an order to sell shares, note the following:


Redemptions may be suspended or payment dates postponed when the NYSE is closed (other than weekends or holidays),
when trading on the NYSE is restricted, or as permitted by the SEC.
Redemption proceeds may be paid in securities or other property rather than in cash if FMRC determines it is in the best
interests of the fund. The securities the fund distributes in kind may not be representative of the fund as a whole and may
include those that FMRC believes are least disruptive from a tax perspective.
Under applicable anti-money laundering regulations and other federal regulations, redemption requests may be suspended,
restricted, canceled, or processed and the proceeds may be withheld.

Account Policies
Policies

The following policy applies to you as a shareholder.

Statements and reports that Fidelity sends to you include the following:


Fidelity will send monthly account statements detailing account balances and all transactions completed during the prior
month.

You may be asked to provide additional information in order for Fidelity to verify your identity in accordance with
requirements under anti-money laundering regulations. Accounts may be restricted and/or closed, and the monies withheld,
pending verification of this information or as otherwise required under these and other federal regulations.

Distributions
The fund effectively declares a daily distribution of its net income, which is included in the shareholder's book capital
account until it is paid to the shareholder.

Distributions will be paid in cash or, at your election, automatically reinvested in additional shares of the fund.

Tax Consequences
As with any investment, your investment in the fund could have tax consequences for you.

The fund intends to operate as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the fund will not be subject to any
federal income tax. Based upon the status of the fund as a partnership, you will take into account your share of the fund's
ordinary income and losses and capital gains and losses in determining your income tax liability and, for investors that are
regulated investment companies, your qualification as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). The determination of your share of the fund's ordinary income and losses
and capital gains and losses will be made in accordance with the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

The statement of additional information (SAI) provides additional information about the compensation of, any other
accounts managed by, and any fund shares held by Matthew Torrey.

From time to time a manager, analyst, or other Fidelity employee may express views regarding a particular company, security,
industry, or market sector. The views expressed by any such person are the views of only that individual as of the time
expressed and do not necessarily represent the views of Fidelity or any other person in the Fidelity organization. Any such
views are subject to change at any time based upon market or other conditions and Fidelity disclaims any responsibility to
update such views. These views may not be relied on as investment advice and, because investment decisions for a Fidelity
fund are based on numerous factors, may not be relied on as an indication of trading intent on behalf of any Fidelity fund.

Pursuant to the fund's management contract with FMRC, FMR, on behalf of the fund, pays FMRC a management fee. The
management fee is calculated and paid to FMRC every month.

For each fund (other than a fund for which FMRC serves as sub-adviser) that invests in the fund in a given month, FMR pays
FMRC a fee equal to 50% of the monthly management fee rate (including performance adjustments, if any) that FMR
receives from the investing fund, multiplied by the average net assets invested by that fund in the fund for the month. The
fee is reduced to reflect any expenses paid by FMR on behalf of an investing fund pursuant to an all-inclusive fee
management contract, but is not reduced to reflect any fee waivers or expense reimbursements made by FMR.

INVESTMENT POLICIES AND LIMITATIONS

The following policies and limitations supplement those set forth in Part A of the registration statement. Unless
otherwise noted, whenever an investment policy or limitation states a maximum percentage of the fund's assets that may be
invested in any security or other asset, or sets forth a policy regarding quality standards, such standard or percentage
limitation will be determined immediately after and as a result of the fund's acquisition of such security or other asset.
Accordingly, any subsequent change in values, net assets, or other circumstances will not be considered when determining
whether the investment complies with the fund's investment policies and limitations.

The fund's fundamental investment policies and limitations cannot be changed without approval by a "majority of the
outstanding voting securities" (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act)) of the fund. However, except
for the fundamental investment limitations listed below, the investment policies and limitations described in this Part B of
the registration statement are not fundamental and may be changed without shareholder approval.

The following are the fund's fundamental investment limitations set forth in their entirety.

Diversification

The fund may not with respect to 75% of the fund's total assets, purchase the securities of any issuer (other than
securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities, or securities of other
investment companies) if, as a result, (a) more than 5% of the fund's total assets would be invested in the securities of that
issuer, or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer.

Senior Securities

The fund may not issue senior securities, except in connection with the insurance program established by the fund
pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission or as otherwise permitted under the
Investment Company Act of 1940.

Borrowing

The fund may not borrow money, except that the fund may borrow money for temporary or emergency purposes (not
for leveraging or investment) in an amount not exceeding 33 1/3% of its total assets (including the amount borrowed) less
liabilities (other than borrowings). Any borrowings that come to exceed this amount will be reduced within three days
(not including Sundays and holidays) to the extent necessary to comply with the 33 1/3% limitation.

Underwriting

The fund may not underwrite securities issued by others, except to the extent that the fund may be considered an
underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 in the disposition of restricted securities or in connection
with investments in other investment companies.

Concentration

The fund may not purchase the securities of any issuer (other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
Government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities) if, as a result, more than 25% of the fund's total assets would be
invested in the securities of companies whose principal business activities are in the same industry.

For purposes of the fund's concentration limitation discussed above, with respect to any investment in Fidelity®
Money Market Central Fund and/or any non-money market central fund, FMR Co., Inc. (FMRC) looks through to the
holdings of the central fund.

For purposes of the fund's concentration limitation discussed above, FMRC may analyze the characteristics of a
particular issuer and security and assign an industry or sector classification consistent with those characteristics in the
event that the third party classification provider used by FMRC does not assign a classification.

Real Estate

The fund may not purchase or sell real estate unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments
(but this shall not prevent the fund from investing in securities or other instruments backed by real estate or securities of
companies engaged in the real estate business).

Commodities

The fund may not purchase or sell physical commodities unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other
instruments (but this shall not prevent the fund from purchasing or selling options and futures contracts or from investing
in securities or other instruments backed by physical commodities).

Loans

The fund may not lend any security or make any other loan if, as a result, more than 33 1/3% of its total assets would be
lent to other parties, but this limitation does not apply to purchases of debt securities or to repurchase agreements, or to
acquisitions of loans, loan participations or other forms of debt instruments.

The following investment limitations are not fundamental and may be changed without shareholder approval.

Short Sales

The fund does not currently intend to sell securities short, unless it owns or has the right to obtain securities equivalent
in kind and amount to the securities sold short, and provided that transactions in futures contracts and options are not
deemed to constitute selling securities short.

Margin Purchases

The fund does not currently intend to purchase securities on margin, except that the fund may obtain such short-term
credits as are necessary for the clearance of transactions, and provided that margin payments in connection with futures
contracts and options on futures contracts shall not constitute purchasing securities on margin.

Borrowing

The fund may borrow money only (a) from a bank or from a registered investment company or portfolio for which
FMR or an affiliate serves as investment adviser or (b) by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements with any party
(reverse repurchase agreements are treated as borrowings for purposes of the fundamental borrowing investment
limitation).

Illiquid Securities

The fund does not currently intend to purchase any security if, as a result, more than 10% of its net assets would be
invested in securities that are deemed to be illiquid because they are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale or
because they cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the prices at which they are
valued.

For purposes of the fund's illiquid securities limitation discussed above, if through a change in values, net assets,
or other circumstances, the fund were in a position where more than 10% of its net assets were invested in illiquid
securities, it would consider appropriate steps to protect liquidity.

Loans

The fund does not currently intend to lend assets other than securities to other parties, except by (a) lending money (up
to 15% of the fund's net assets) to a registered investment company or portfolio for which FMR or an affiliate serves as
investment adviser or (b) assuming any unfunded commitments in connection with the acquisition of loans, loan
participations, or other forms of debt instruments. (This limitation does not apply to purchases of debt securities, to
repurchase agreements, or to acquisitions of loans, loan participations or other forms of debt instruments.)

In addition to the fund's fundamental and non-fundamental limitations discussed above:

For the fund's limitations on futures, options, and swap transactions, see the section entitled "Futures, Options, and Swaps"
on page <Click Here>.

The following pages contain more detailed information about types of instruments in which the fund may invest,
strategies FMRC may employ in pursuit of the fund's investment objective, and a summary of related risks. FMRC may not
buy all of these instruments or use all of these techniques unless it believes that doing so will help the fund achieve its goal.

Affiliated Bank Transactions. A fund may engage in transactions with financial institutions that are, or may be
considered to be, "affiliated persons" of the fund under the 1940 Act. These transactions may involve repurchase agreements
with custodian banks; short-term obligations of, and repurchase agreements with, the 50 largest U.S. banks (measured by
deposits); municipal securities; U.S. Government securities with affiliated financial institutions that are primary dealers in
these securities; short-term currency transactions; and short-term borrowings. In accordance with exemptive orders issued by
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Board of Trustees has established and periodically reviews procedures
applicable to transactions involving affiliated financial institutions.

Asset-Backed Securities represent interests in pools of mortgages, loans, receivables, or other assets. Payment of
interest and repayment of principal may be largely dependent upon the cash flows generated by the assets backing the
securities and, in certain cases, supported by letters of credit, surety bonds, or other credit enhancements. Asset-backed
security values may also be affected by other factors including changes in interest rates, the availability of information
concerning the pool and its structure, the creditworthiness of the servicing agent for the pool, the originator of the loans or
receivables, or the entities providing the credit enhancement. In addition, these securities may be subject to prepayment risk.

Borrowing. The fund may borrow from banks or from other funds advised by Fidelity Management & Research
Company (FMR) or its affiliates, or through reverse repurchase agreements. If the fund borrows money, its share price may
be subject to greater fluctuation until the borrowing is paid off. If the fund makes additional investments while borrowings
are outstanding, this may be considered a form of leverage.

Cash Management. A fund can hold uninvested cash or can invest it in cash equivalents such as money market
securities, repurchase agreements, or shares of money market or short-term bond funds. Generally, these securities offer less
potential for gains than other types of securities.

Central Funds are special types of investment vehicles created by Fidelity for use by the Fidelity funds and other
advisory clients. FMR uses central funds to invest in particular security types or investment disciplines, or for cash
management. Central funds incur certain costs related to their investment activity (such as custodial fees and expenses), but
do not pay additional management fees to Fidelity. The investment results of the portions of the fund's assets invested in the
central funds will be based upon the investment results of those funds.

Common Stock represents an equity or ownership interest in an issuer. In the event an issuer is liquidated or declares
bankruptcy, the claims of owners of bonds and preferred stock take precedence over the claims of those who own
common stock.

Convertible Securities are bonds, debentures, notes, or other securities that may be converted or exchanged (by the
holder or by the issuer) into shares of the underlying common stock (or cash or securities of equivalent value) at a stated
exchange ratio. A convertible security may also be called for redemption or conversion by the issuer after a particular date
and under certain circumstances (including a specified price) established upon issue. If a convertible security held by a fund
is called for redemption or conversion, the fund could be required to tender it for redemption, convert it into the underlying
common stock, or sell it to a third party.

Convertible securities generally have less potential for gain or loss than common stocks. Convertible securities
generally provide yields higher than the underlying common stocks, but generally lower than comparable non-convertible
securities. Because of this higher yield, convertible securities generally sell at prices above their "conversion value," which
is the current market value of the stock to be received upon conversion. The difference between this conversion value and
the price of convertible securities will vary over time depending on changes in the value of the underlying common stocks
and interest rates. When the underlying common stocks decline in value, convertible securities will tend not to decline to the
same extent because of the interest or dividend payments and the repayment of principal at maturity for certain types of
convertible securities. However, securities that are convertible other than at the option of the holder generally do not limit
the potential for loss to the same extent as securities convertible at the option of the holder. When the underlying common
stocks rise in value, the value of convertible securities may also be expected to increase. At the same time, however, the
difference between the market value of convertible securities and their conversion value will narrow, which means that the
value of convertible securities will generally not increase to the same extent as the value of the underlying common stocks.
Because convertible securities may also be interest-rate sensitive, their value may increase as interest rates fall and decrease
as interest rates rise. Convertible securities are also subject to credit risk, and are often lower-quality securities.

Country or Geographic Region. FMR considers a number of factors to determine whether an investment is tied
economically to a particular country or region including: whether the investment is issued or guaranteed by a particular
government or any of its agencies, political subdivisions, or instrumentalities; whether the investment has its primary
trading market in a particular country or region; whether the issuer is organized under the laws of, derives at least 50% of its
revenues from, or has at least 50% of its assets in a particular country or region; whether the investment is included in an
index representative of a particular country or region; and whether the investment is exposed to the economic fortunes and
risks of a particular country or region.

Debt Securities are used by issuers to borrow money. The issuer usually pays a fixed, variable, or floating rate of
interest, and must repay the amount borrowed, usually at the maturity of the security. Some debt securities, such as zero
coupon bonds, do not pay interest but are sold at a deep discount from their face values. Debt securities include corporate
bonds, government securities, repurchase agreements, and mortgage and other asset-backed securities.

Exposure to Foreign Markets. Foreign securities, foreign currencies, and securities issued by U.S. entities with
substantial foreign operations may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments.

Foreign investments involve risks relating to local political, economic, regulatory, or social instability, military action or
unrest, or adverse diplomatic developments, and may be affected by actions of foreign governments adverse to the interests
of U.S. investors. Such actions may include expropriation or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on
U.S. investment or on the ability to repatriate assets or convert currency into U.S. dollars, or other government intervention.
Additionally, governmental issuers of foreign debt securities may be unwilling to pay interest and repay principal when due
and may require that the conditions for payment be renegotiated. There is no assurance that FMRC will be able to anticipate
these potential events or counter their effects. In addition, the value of securities denominated in foreign currencies and of
dividends and interest paid with respect to such securities will fluctuate based on the relative strength of the U.S. dollar.

It is anticipated that in most cases the best available market for foreign securities will be on an exchange or in
over-the-counter (OTC) markets located outside of the United States. Foreign stock markets, while growing in volume and
sophistication, are generally not as developed as those in the United States, and securities of some foreign issuers may be
less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. issuers. Foreign security trading, settlement and custodial
practices (including those involving securities settlement where fund assets may be released prior to receipt of payment) are
often less developed than those in U.S. markets, and may result in increased risk or substantial delays in the event of a failed
trade or the insolvency of, or breach of duty by, a foreign broker-dealer, securities depository, or foreign subcustodian. In
addition, the costs associated with foreign investments, including withholding taxes, brokerage commissions, and custodial
costs, are generally higher than with U.S. investments.

Foreign markets may offer less protection to investors than U.S. markets. Foreign issuers are generally not bound by
uniform accounting, auditing, and financial reporting requirements and standards of practice comparable to those
applicable to U.S. issuers. Adequate public information on foreign issuers may not be available, and it may be difficult to
secure dividends and information regarding corporate actions on a timely basis. In general, there is less overall
governmental supervision and regulation of securities exchanges, brokers, and listed companies than in the United States.
OTC markets tend to be less regulated than stock exchange markets and, in certain countries, may be totally unregulated.
Regulatory enforcement may be influenced by economic or political concerns, and investors may have difficulty enforcing
their legal rights in foreign countries.

Some foreign securities impose restrictions on transfer within the United States or to U.S. persons. Although securities
subject to such transfer restrictions may be marketable abroad, they may be less liquid than foreign securities of the same
class that are not subject to such restrictions.

American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) as well as other "hybrid" forms of ADRs, including European Depositary
Receipts (EDRs) and Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs), are certificates evidencing ownership of shares of a foreign
issuer. These certificates are issued by depository banks and generally trade on an established market in the United States or
elsewhere. The underlying shares are held in trust by a custodian bank or similar financial institution in the issuer's home
country. The depository bank may not have physical custody of the underlying securities at all times and may charge fees for
various services, including forwarding dividends and interest and corporate actions. ADRs are alternatives to directly
purchasing the underlying foreign securities in their national markets and currencies. However, ADRs continue to be
subject to many of the risks associated with investing directly in foreign securities. These risks include foreign exchange
risk as well as the political and economic risks of the underlying issuer's country.

The risks of foreign investing may be magnified for investments in emerging markets. Security prices in emerging
markets can be significantly more volatile than those in more developed markets, reflecting the greater uncertainties of
investing in less established markets and economies. In particular, countries with emerging markets may have relatively
unstable governments, may present the risks of nationalization of businesses, restrictions on foreign ownership and
prohibitions on the repatriation of assets, and may have less protection of property rights than more developed countries.
The economies of countries with emerging markets may be based on only a few industries, may be highly vulnerable to
changes in local or global trade conditions, and may suffer from extreme and volatile debt burdens or inflation rates. Local
securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to increases in trading
volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times.

Foreign Currency Transactions. A fund may conduct foreign currency transactions on a spot (i.e., cash) or forward
basis (i.e., by entering into forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies). Although foreign exchange dealers
generally do not charge a fee for such conversions, they do realize a profit based on the difference between the prices at
which they are buying and selling various currencies. Thus, a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency at one rate, while
offering a lesser rate of exchange should the counterparty desire to resell that currency to the dealer. Forward contracts are
customized transactions that require a specific amount of a currency to be delivered at a specific exchange rate on a specific
date or range of dates in the future. Forward contracts are generally traded in an interbank market directly between currency
traders (usually large commercial banks) and their customers. The parties to a forward contract may agree to offset or
terminate the contract before its maturity, or may hold the contract to maturity and complete the contemplated currency
exchange.

The following discussion summarizes the principal currency management strategies involving forward contracts that
could be used by a fund. A fund may also use swap agreements, indexed securities, and options and futures contracts
relating to foreign currencies for the same purposes.

A "settlement hedge" or "transaction hedge" is designed to protect a fund against an adverse change in foreign currency
values between the date a security is purchased or sold and the date on which payment is made or received. Entering into a
forward contract for the purchase or sale of the amount of foreign currency involved in an underlying security transaction
for a fixed amount of U.S. dollars "locks in" the U.S. dollar price of the security. Forward contracts to purchase or sell a
foreign currency may also be used by a fund in anticipation of future purchases or sales of securities denominated in foreign
currency, even if the specific investments have not yet been selected by FMRC.

A fund may also use forward contracts to hedge against a decline in the value of existing investments denominated in
foreign currency. For example, if a fund owned securities denominated in pounds sterling, it could enter into a forward
contract to sell pounds sterling in return for U.S. dollars to hedge against possible declines in the pound's value. Such a
hedge, sometimes referred to as a "position hedge," would tend to offset both positive and negative currency fluctuations,
but would not offset changes in security values caused by other factors. A fund could also hedge the position by selling
another currency expected to perform similarly to the pound sterling. This type of hedge, sometimes referred to as a "proxy
hedge," could offer advantages in terms of cost, yield, or efficiency, but generally would not hedge currency exposure as
effectively as a direct hedge into U.S. dollars. Proxy hedges may result in losses if the currency used to hedge does not
perform similarly to the currency in which the hedged securities are denominated.

A fund may enter into forward contracts to shift its investment exposure from one currency into another. This may
include shifting exposure from U.S. dollars to a foreign currency, or from one foreign currency to another foreign currency.
This type of strategy, sometimes known as a "cross-hedge," will tend to reduce or eliminate exposure to the currency that is
sold, and increase exposure to the currency that is purchased, much as if a fund had sold a security denominated in one
currency and purchased an equivalent security denominated in another. A fund may cross-hedge its U.S. dollar exposure in
order to achieve a representative weighted mix of the major currencies in its benchmark index and/or to cover an
underweight country or region exposure in its portfolio. Cross-hedges protect against losses resulting from a decline in the
hedged currency, but will cause a fund to assume the risk of fluctuations in the value of the currency it purchases.

Successful use of currency management strategies will depend on FMRC's skill in analyzing currency values. Currency
management strategies may substantially change a fund's investment exposure to changes in currency exchange rates and
could result in losses to a fund if currencies do not perform as FMRC anticipates. For example, if a currency's value rose at a
time when FMRC had hedged a fund by selling that currency in exchange for dollars, a fund would not participate in the
currency's appreciation. If FMRC hedges currency exposure through proxy hedges, a fund could realize currency losses
from both the hedge and the security position if the two currencies do not move in tandem. Similarly, if FMRC increases a
fund's exposure to a foreign currency and that currency's value declines, a fund will realize a loss. A fund may be required to
limit its hedging transactions in foreign currency forwards, futures, and options in order to maintain its classification as a
"regulated investment company" under the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Hedging transactions could result in the
application of the mark-to-market provisions of the Code, which may cause an increase (or decrease) in the amount of
taxable dividends paid by a fund and could affect whether dividends paid by a fund are classified as capital gains or ordinary
income. There is no assurance that FMRC's use of currency management strategies will be advantageous to a fund or that it
will employ currency management strategies at appropriate times.

Options and Futures Relating to Foreign Currencies. Currency futures contracts are similar to forward currency
exchange contracts, except that they are traded on exchanges (and have margin requirements) and are standardized as to
contract size and delivery date. Most currency futures contracts call for payment or delivery in U.S. dollars. The underlying
instrument of a currency option may be a foreign currency, which generally is purchased or delivered in exchange for U.S.
dollars, or may be a futures contract. The purchaser of a currency call obtains the right to purchase the underlying currency,
and the purchaser of a currency put obtains the right to sell the underlying currency.

The uses and risks of currency options and futures are similar to options and futures relating to securities or indices, as
discussed above. A fund may purchase and sell currency futures and may purchase and write currency options to increase or
decrease its exposure to different foreign currencies. Currency options may also be purchased or written in conjunction with
each other or with currency futures or forward contracts. Currency futures and options values can be expected to correlate
with exchange rates, but may not reflect other factors that affect the value of a fund's investments. A currency hedge, for
example, should protect a Yen-denominated security from a decline in the Yen, but will not protect a fund against a price
decline resulting from deterioration in the issuer's creditworthiness. Because the value of a fund's foreign-denominated
investments changes in response to many factors other than exchange rates, it may not be possible to match the amount of
currency options and futures to the value of the fund's investments exactly over time.

Foreign Repurchase Agreements. Foreign repurchase agreements involve an agreement to purchase a foreign
security and to sell that security back to the original seller at an agreed-upon price in either U.S. dollars or foreign currency.
Unlike typical U.S. repurchase agreements, foreign repurchase agreements may not be fully collateralized at all times. The
value of a security purchased by a fund may be more or less than the price at which the counterparty has agreed to repurchase
the security. In the event of default by the counterparty, the fund may suffer a loss if the value of the security purchased is less
than the agreed-upon repurchase price, or if the fund is unable to successfully assert a claim to the collateral under foreign
laws. As a result, foreign repurchase agreements may involve higher credit risks than repurchase agreements in U.S.
markets, as well as risks associated with currency fluctuations. In addition, as with other emerging market investments,
repurchase agreements with counterparties located in emerging markets or relating to emerging markets may involve
issuers or counterparties with lower credit ratings than typical U.S. repurchase agreements.

Fund's Rights as an Investor. The fund does not intend to direct or administer the day-to-day operations of any
company. A fund, however, may exercise its rights as a shareholder or lender and may communicate its views on important
matters of policy to management, the Board of Directors, shareholders of a company, and holders of other securities of the
company when FMRC determines that such matters could have a significant effect on the value of the fund's investment in
the company. The activities in which a fund may engage, either individually or in conjunction with others, may include,
among others, supporting or opposing proposed changes in a company's corporate structure or business activities; seeking
changes in a company's directors or management; seeking changes in a company's direction or policies; seeking the sale or
reorganization of the company or a portion of its assets; supporting or opposing third-party takeover efforts; supporting the
filing of a bankruptcy petition; or foreclosing on collateral securing a security. This area of corporate activity is increasingly
prone to litigation and it is possible that a fund could be involved in lawsuits related to such activities. FMRC will monitor
such activities with a view to mitigating, to the extent possible, the risk of litigation against a fund and the risk of actual
liability if a fund is involved in litigation. No guarantee can be made, however, that litigation against a fund will not be
undertaken or liabilities incurred. The fund's proxy voting guidelines are included in this SAI.

Futures, Options, and Swaps. The success of any strategy involving futures, options, and swaps depends on an
adviser's analysis of many economic and mathematical factors and a fund's return may be higher if it never invested in such
instruments. Additionally, some of the contracts discussed below are new instruments without a trading history and there
can be no assurance that a market for the instruments will continue to exist.

Futures Contracts. In purchasing a futures contract, the buyer agrees to purchase a specified underlying instrument at a
specified future date. In selling a futures contract, the seller agrees to sell a specified underlying instrument at a specified
future date. The price at which the purchase and sale will take place is fixed when the buyer and seller enter into the contract.
Some currently available futures contracts are based on specific securities and some are based on indices of securities prices.
Futures can be held until their delivery dates, or can be closed out before then if a liquid market is available.

Futures may be based on foreign indexes such as the Compagnie des Agents de Change 40 Index (CAC 40) in France,
the Deutscher Aktienindex (DAX 30) in Germany, the Financial Times Stock Exchange Eurotop 100 Index (FTSE Eurotop
100) in Europe, the IBEX 35 Index (IBEX 35) in Spain, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE 100) in the
United Kingdom, the Australian Stock Exchange All Ordinaries Index (ASX All Ordinaries) in Australia, the Hang Seng
Index in Hong Kong, and the Nikkei Stock Average (Nikkei 225), the Nikkei Stock Index 300 (Nikkei 300), and the Tokyo
Stock Exchange Stock Price Index (TOPIX) in Japan.

The value of a futures contract tends to increase and decrease in tandem with the value of its underlying instrument.
Therefore, purchasing futures contracts will tend to increase a fund's exposure to positive and negative price fluctuations in
the underlying instrument, much as if it had purchased the underlying instrument directly. When a fund sells a futures
contract, by contrast, the value of its futures position will tend to move in a direction contrary to the market. Selling futures
contracts, therefore, will tend to offset both positive and negative market price changes, much as if the underlying
instrument had been sold.

The purchaser or seller of a futures contract or an option for a futures contract is not required to deliver or pay for the
underlying instrument unless the contract is held until the delivery date. However, both the purchaser and seller are required
to deposit "initial margin" with a futures broker, known as a futures commission merchant (FCM), when the contract is
entered into. If the value of either party's position declines, that party will be required to make additional "variation margin"
payments to settle the change in value on a daily basis. This process of "marking to market" will be reflected in the daily
calculation of open positions computed in a fund's NAV. The party that has a gain is entitled to receive all or a portion of this
amount. Initial and variation margin payments do not constitute purchasing securities on margin for purposes of a fund's
investment limitations. In the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of an FCM that holds margin on behalf of a fund, the
fund may be entitled to return of margin owed to it only in proportion to the amount received by the FCM's other customers,
potentially resulting in losses to the fund. A fund is required to segregate liquid assets equivalent to the fund's outstanding
obligations under the contract in excess of the initial margin and variation margin, if any.

Although futures exchanges generally operate similarly in the United States and abroad, foreign futures exchanges may
follow trading, settlement, and margin procedures that are different from those for U.S. exchanges. Futures contracts traded
outside the United States may involve greater risk of loss than U.S.-traded contracts, including potentially greater risk of
losses due to insolvency of a futures broker, exchange member, or other party that may owe initial or variation margin to a
fund. Because initial and variation margin payments may be measured in foreign currency, a futures contract traded outside
the United States may also involve the risk of foreign currency fluctuation.

The fund will not: (a) sell futures contracts, purchase put options, or write call options if, as a result, more than 25% of the
fund's total assets would be hedged with futures and options under normal conditions; (b) purchase futures contracts or
write put options if, as a result, the fund's total obligations upon settlement or exercise of purchased futures contracts and
written put options would exceed 25% of its total assets under normal conditions; or (c) purchase call options if, as a result,
the current value of option premiums for call options purchased by the fund would exceed 5% of the fund's total assets.
These limitations do not apply to options attached to or acquired or traded together with their underlying securities, and do
not apply to Structured Notes.

The requirements for qualification as a regulated investment company also may limit the extent to which a fund may
enter into futures, options on futures and forward contracts. See "Distributions and Taxes".

The above limitations on the fund's investments in futures contracts, options, and swaps, and the fund's policies
regarding futures contracts, options, and swaps discussed elsewhere herein this SAI may be changed as regulatory agencies
permit.

There is no assurance a liquid market will exist for any particular futures contract at any particular time. Exchanges may
establish daily price fluctuation limits for futures contracts, and may halt trading if a contract's price moves upward or
downward more than the limit in a given day. On volatile trading days when the price fluctuation limit is reached or a trading
halt is imposed, it may be impossible to enter into new positions or close out existing positions. If the market for a contract is
not liquid because of price fluctuation limits or other market conditions, it could prevent prompt liquidation of unfavorable
positions, and potentially could require a fund to continue to hold a position until delivery or expiration regardless of
changes in its value. As a result, a fund's access to other assets held to cover its futures positions could also be impaired.

Because there are a limited number of types of exchange-traded futures contracts, it is likely that the standardized
contracts available will not match a fund's current or anticipated investments exactly. A fund may invest in futures contracts
based on securities with different issuers, maturities, or other characteristics from the securities in which the fund typically
invests, which involves a risk that the futures position will not track the performance of the fund's other investments.

Futures prices can also diverge from the prices of their underlying instruments, even if the underlying instruments
match a fund's investments well. Futures prices are affected by such factors as current and anticipated short-term interest
rates, changes in volatility of the underlying instrument, and the time remaining until expiration of the contract, which
may not affect security prices the same way. Imperfect correlation may also result from differing levels of demand in the
futures markets and the securities markets, from structural differences in how futures and securities are traded, or from
imposition of daily price fluctuation limits or trading halts. A fund may purchase or sell futures contracts with a greater or
lesser value than the securities it wishes to hedge or intends to purchase in order to attempt to compensate for differences
in volatility between the contract and the securities, although this may not be successful in all cases. If price changes in a
fund's futures positions are poorly correlated with its other investments, the positions may fail to produce anticipated
gains or result in losses that are not offset by gains in other investments.

Options. By purchasing a put option, the purchaser obtains the right (but not the obligation) to sell the option's
underlying instrument at a fixed strike price. In return for this right, the purchaser pays the current market price for the
option (known as the option premium). Options have various types of underlying instruments, including specific securities,
indices of securities prices, and futures contracts. The purchaser may terminate its position in a put option by allowing it to
expire or by exercising the option. If the option is allowed to expire, the purchaser will lose the entire premium. If the option
is exercised, the purchaser completes the sale of the underlying instrument at the strike price. A purchaser may also
terminate a put option position by closing it out in the secondary market at its current price, if a liquid secondary market
exists.

The buyer of a typical put option can expect to realize a gain if security prices fall substantially. However, if the
underlying instrument's price does not fall enough to offset the cost of purchasing the option, a put buyer can expect to suffer
a loss (limited to the amount of the premium, plus related transaction costs).

The features of call options are essentially the same as those of put options, except that the purchaser of a call option
obtains the right to purchase, rather than sell, the underlying instrument at the option's strike price. A call buyer typically
attempts to participate in potential price increases of the underlying instrument with risk limited to the cost of the option if
security prices fall. At the same time, the buyer can expect to suffer a loss if security prices do not rise sufficiently to offset
the cost of the option.

The writer of a put or call option takes the opposite side of the transaction from the option's purchaser. In return for
receipt of the premium, the writer assumes the obligation to pay or receive the strike price for the option's underlying
instrument if the other party to the option chooses to exercise it. The writer may seek to terminate a position in a put option
before exercise by closing out the option in the secondary market at its current price. If the secondary market is not liquid for
a put option, however, the writer must continue to be prepared to pay the strike price while the option is outstanding,
regardless of price changes. When writing an option on a futures contract, a fund will be required to make margin payments
to an FCM as described above for futures contracts.

If security prices rise, a put writer would generally expect to profit, although its gain would be limited to the amount of
the premium it received. If security prices remain the same over time, it is likely that the writer will also profit, because it
should be able to close out the option at a lower price. If security prices fall, the put writer would expect to suffer a loss. This
loss should be less than the loss from purchasing the underlying instrument directly, however, because the premium
received for writing the option should mitigate the effects of the decline.

Writing a call option obligates the writer to sell or deliver the option's underlying instrument, in return for the strike
price, upon exercise of the option. The characteristics of writing call options are similar to those of writing put options,
except that writing calls generally is a profitable strategy if prices remain the same or fall. Through receipt of the option
premium, a call writer mitigates the effects of a price decline. At the same time, because a call writer must be prepared to
deliver the underlying instrument in return for the strike price, even if its current value is greater, a call writer gives up some
ability to participate in security price increases.

The fund will not: (a) sell futures contracts, purchase put options, or write call options if, as a result, more than 25% of the
fund's total assets would be hedged with futures and options under normal conditions; (b) purchase futures contracts or
write put options if, as a result, the fund's total obligations upon settlement or exercise of purchased futures contracts and
written put options would exceed 25% of its total assets under normal conditions; or (c) purchase call options if, as a result,
the current value of option premiums for call options purchased by the fund would exceed 5% of the fund's total assets.
These limitations do not apply to options attached to or acquired or traded together with their underlying securities, and do
not apply to Structured Notes.

The requirements for qualification as a regulated investment company also may limit the extent to which a fund may
enter into futures, options on futures and forward contracts. See "Distributions and Taxes".

The above limitations on the fund's investments in futures contracts, options, and swaps, and the fund's policies
regarding futures contracts, options, and swaps discussed elsewhere herein this SAI may be changed as regulatory agencies
permit.

There is no assurance a liquid market will exist for any particular options contract at any particular time. Options may
have relatively low trading volume and liquidity if their strike prices are not close to the underlying instrument's current
price. In addition, exchanges may establish daily price fluctuation limits for options contracts, and may halt trading if a
contract's price moves upward or downward more than the limit in a given day. On volatile trading days when the price
fluctuation limit is reached or a trading halt is imposed, it may be impossible to enter into new positions or close out existing
positions. If the market for a contract is not liquid because of price fluctuation limits or otherwise, it could prevent prompt
liquidation of unfavorable positions, and potentially could require a fund to continue to hold a position until delivery or
expiration regardless of changes in its value. As a result, a fund's access to other assets held to cover its options positions
could also be impaired.

Unlike exchange-traded options, which are standardized with respect to the underlying instrument, expiration date,
contract size, and strike price, the terms of OTC options (options not traded on exchanges) generally are established through
negotiation with the other party to the option contract. While this type of arrangement allows the purchaser or writer greater
flexibility to tailor an option to its needs, OTC options generally are less liquid and involve greater credit risk than
exchange-traded options, which are backed by the clearing organization of the exchanges where they are traded.

Combined positions involve purchasing and writing options in combination with each other, or in combination with
futures or forward contracts, to adjust the risk and return characteristics of the overall position. For example, purchasing a
put option and writing a call option on the same underlying instrument would construct a combined position whose risk and
return characteristics are similar to selling a futures contract. Another possible combined position would involve writing a
call option at one strike price and buying a call option at a lower price, to reduce the risk of the written call option in the event
of a substantial price increase. Because combined options positions involve multiple trades, they result in higher transaction
costs and may be more difficult to open and close out.

A fund may also buy and sell options on swaps. Options on interest rate swaps are known as swaptions. An option on a
swap gives a party the right to enter into a new swap agreement or to extend, shorten, cancel or modify an existing swap
contract at a specific date in the future in exchange for a premium.

Because there are a limited number of types of exchange-traded options contracts, it is likely that the standardized
contracts available will not match a fund's current or anticipated investments exactly. A fund may invest in options contracts
based on securities with different issuers, maturities, or other characteristics from the securities in which the fund typically
invests, which involves a risk that the options position will not track the performance of the fund's other investments.

Options prices can also diverge from the prices of their underlying instruments, even if the underlying instruments
match a fund's investments well. Options prices are affected by such factors as current and anticipated short-term interest
rates, changes in volatility of the underlying instrument, and the time remaining until expiration of the contract, which may
not affect security prices the same way. Imperfect correlation may also result from differing levels of demand in the options
and futures markets and the securities markets, from structural differences in how options and futures and securities are
traded, or from imposition of daily price fluctuation limits or trading halts. A fund may purchase or sell options contracts
with a greater or lesser value than the securities it wishes to hedge or intends to purchase in order to attempt to compensate
for differences in volatility between the contract and the securities, although this may not be successful in all cases. If price
changes in a fund's options positions are poorly correlated with its other investments, the positions may fail to produce
anticipated gains or result in losses that are not offset by gains in other investments.

Swap Agreements. Swaps are individually negotiated and structured to include exposure to a variety of different types
of investments or market factors. Swap agreements are two party contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors.
Swap agreements can vary in term like other fixed-income investments. Most swap agreements are traded over-the-counter.
In a standard "swap" transaction, two parties agree to exchange the returns (or differentials in rates of return) earned or
realized on particular predetermined investments or instruments. The gross returns to be exchanged or swapped between the
parties are calculated with respect to a notional amount, which is the predetermined dollar principal of the trade representing
the hypothetical underlying quantity upon which payment obligations are computed.

Swap agreements can take many different forms and are known by a variety of names. Depending on how they are used,
swap agreements may increase or decrease the overall volatility of a fund's investments and its share price.

In a credit default swap, the credit default protection buyer makes periodic payments, known as premiums, to the credit
default protection seller. In return the credit default protection seller will make a payment to the credit default protection
buyer upon the occurrence of a specified credit event. A credit default swap can refer to a single issuer or asset, a basket of
issuers or assets or index of assets, each known as the reference entity or underlying asset. A fund may act as either the buyer
or the seller of a credit default swap. A fund may buy or sell credit default protection on a basket of issuers or assets, even if a
number of the underlying assets referenced in the basket are lower-quality debt securities. In an unhedged credit default
swap, a fund buys credit default protection on a single issuer or asset, a basket of issuers or assets or index of assets without
owning the underlying asset or debt issued by the reference entity. Credit default swaps involve greater and different risks
than investing directly in the referenced asset, because, in addition to market risk, credit default swaps include liquidity,
counterparty and operational risk.

Credit default swaps allow a fund to acquire or reduce credit exposure to a particular issuer, asset or basket of assets. If a
swap agreement calls for payments by the fund, the fund must be prepared to make such payments when due. If the fund is
the credit default protection seller, the fund will experience a loss if a credit event occurs and the credit of the reference
entity or underlying asset has deteriorated. If the fund is the credit default protection buyer, the fund will be required to
pay premiums to the credit default protection seller.

If the creditworthiness of the fund's swap counterparty declines, the risk that the counterparty may not perform could
increase, potentially resulting in a loss to the fund. To limit the counterparty risk involved in swap agreements, the funds
will only enter into swap agreements with counterparties that meet certain standards of creditworthiness.

Swap agreements generally are entered into by "eligible participants" and in compliance with certain other criteria
necessary to render them excluded from regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act ("CEA") and, therefore not subject
to regulation as futures or commodity option transactions under the CEA.

Illiquid Securities cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the prices at which
they are valued. Difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or may be costly to a fund. Under the supervision of the
Board of Trustees, FMRC determines the liquidity of a fund's investments and, through reports from FMRC, the Board
monitors investments in illiquid securities. In determining the liquidity of a fund's investments, various factors may be
considered, including (1) the frequency and volume of trades and quotations, (2) the number of dealers and prospective
purchasers in the marketplace, (3) dealer undertakings to make a market, and (4) the nature of the security and the market in
which it trades (including any demand, put or tender features, the mechanics and other requirements for transfer, any letters
of credit or other credit enhancement features, any ratings, the number of holders, the method of soliciting offers, the time
required to dispose of the security, and the ability to assign or offset the rights and obligations of the security).

Indexed Securities are instruments whose prices are indexed to the prices of other securities, securities indices,
currencies, or other financial indicators. Indexed securities typically, but not always, are debt securities or deposits whose
value at maturity or coupon rate is determined by reference to a specific instrument or statistic.

Currency-indexed securities typically are short-term to intermediate-term debt securities whose maturity values or
interest rates are determined by reference to the values of one or more specified foreign currencies, and may offer higher
yields than U.S. dollar-denominated securities. Currency-indexed securities may be positively or negatively indexed; that
is, their maturity value may increase when the specified currency value increases, resulting in a security that performs
similarly to a foreign-denominated instrument, or their maturity value may decline when foreign currencies increase,
resulting in a security whose price characteristics are similar to a put on the underlying currency. Currency-indexed
securities may also have prices that depend on the values of a number of different foreign currencies relative to each other.

The performance of indexed securities depends to a great extent on the performance of the security, currency, or other
instrument to which they are indexed, and may also be influenced by interest rate changes in the United States and abroad.
Indexed securities may be more volatile than the underlying instruments. Indexed securities are also subject to the credit
risks associated with the issuer of the security, and their values may decline substantially if the issuer's creditworthiness
deteriorates. Recent issuers of indexed securities have included banks, corporations, and certain U.S. Government agencies.

Interfund Borrowing and Lending Program. Pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC, a fund may lend
money to, and borrow money from, other funds advised by FMR or its affiliates. A fund will borrow through the program
only when the costs are equal to or lower than the cost of bank loans, and will lend through the program only when the
returns are higher than those available from an investment in repurchase agreements. Interfund loans and borrowings
normally extend overnight, but can have a maximum duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one day's notice. A
fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed. Any delay in
repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional borrowing costs.

Investment-Grade Debt Securities. Investment-grade debt securities include all types of debt instruments that are of
medium and high-quality. Investment-grade debt securities include repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government
securities as well as repurchase agreements collateralized by equity securities, non-investment-grade debt, and all other
instruments in which a fund can perfect a security interest, provided the repurchase agreement counterparty has an
investment-grade rating. Some investment-grade debt securities may possess speculative characteristics and may be more
sensitive to economic changes and to changes in the financial conditions of issuers. An investment-grade rating means the
security or issuer is rated investment-grade by Moody's® Investors Service, Standard & Poor's® (S&P®), Fitch Inc.,
Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited, or another credit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating
organization (NRSRO) by the SEC, or is unrated but considered to be of equivalent quality by FMRC.

Loans and Other Direct Debt Instruments. Direct debt instruments are interests in amounts owed by a corporate,
governmental, or other borrower to lenders or lending syndicates (loans and loan participations), to suppliers of goods or
services (trade claims or other receivables), or to other parties. Direct debt instruments involve a risk of loss in case of
default or insolvency of the borrower and may offer less legal protection to the purchaser in the event of fraud or
misrepresentation, or there may be a requirement that a fund supply additional cash to a borrower on demand.

Purchasers of loans and other forms of direct indebtedness depend primarily upon the creditworthiness of the borrower
for payment of interest and repayment of principal. If scheduled interest or principal payments are not made, the value of the
instrument may be adversely affected. Loans that are fully secured provide more protections than an unsecured loan in the
event of failure to make scheduled interest or principal payments. However, there is no assurance that the liquidation of
collateral from a secured loan would satisfy the borrower's obligation, or that the collateral could be liquidated.
Indebtedness of borrowers whose creditworthiness is poor involves substantially greater risks and may be highly
speculative. Borrowers that are in bankruptcy or restructuring may never pay off their indebtedness, or may pay only a small
fraction of the amount owed. Direct indebtedness of developing countries also involves a risk that the governmental entities
responsible for the repayment of the debt may be unable, or unwilling, to pay interest and repay principal when due.

Investments in loans through direct assignment of a financial institution's interests with respect to a loan may involve
additional risks. For example, if a loan is foreclosed, the purchaser could become part owner of any collateral, and would
bear the costs and liabilities associated with owning and disposing of the collateral. In addition, it is conceivable that under
emerging legal theories of lender liability, a purchaser could be held liable as a co-lender. Direct debt instruments may also
involve a risk of insolvency of the lending bank or other intermediary.

A loan is often administered by a bank or other financial institution that acts as agent for all holders. The agent
administers the terms of the loan, as specified in the loan agreement. Unless, under the terms of the loan or other
indebtedness, the purchaser has direct recourse against the borrower, the purchaser may have to rely on the agent to apply
appropriate credit remedies against a borrower. If assets held by the agent for the benefit of a purchaser were determined to
be subject to the claims of the agent's general creditors, the purchaser might incur certain costs and delays in realizing
payment on the loan or loan participation and could suffer a loss of principal or interest.

Direct indebtedness may include letters of credit, revolving credit facilities, or other standby financing commitments
that obligate purchasers to make additional cash payments on demand. These commitments may have the effect of requiring
a purchaser to increase its investment in a borrower at a time when it would not otherwise have done so, even if the
borrower's condition makes it unlikely that the amount will ever be repaid.

The fund limits the amount of total assets that it will invest in any one issuer or in issuers within the same industry (see
the fund's investment limitations). For purposes of these limitations, a fund generally will treat the borrower as the "issuer"
of indebtedness held by the fund. In the case of loan participations where a bank or other lending institution serves as
financial intermediary between a fund and the borrower, if the participation does not shift to the fund the direct
debtor-creditor relationship with the borrower, SEC interpretations require a fund, in appropriate circumstances, to treat
both the lending bank or other lending institution and the borrower as "issuers" for these purposes. Treating a financial
intermediary as an issuer of indebtedness may restrict a fund's ability to invest in indebtedness related to a single financial
intermediary, or a group of intermediaries engaged in the same industry, even if the underlying borrowers represent many
different companies and industries.

Lower-Quality Debt Securities. Lower-quality debt securities include all types of debt instruments that have poor
protection with respect to the payment of interest and repayment of principal, or may be in default. These securities are often
considered to be speculative and involve greater risk of loss or price changes due to changes in the issuer's capacity to pay.
The market prices of lower-quality debt securities may fluctuate more than those of higher-quality debt securities and may
decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty, which may follow periods of rising interest rates.

The market for lower-quality debt securities may be thinner and less active than that for higher-quality debt securities,
which can adversely affect the prices at which the former are sold. Adverse publicity and changing investor perceptions may
affect the liquidity of lower-quality debt securities and the ability of outside pricing services to value lower-quality debt
securities.

Because the risk of default is higher for lower-quality debt securities, FMRC's research and credit analysis are an
especially important part of managing securities of this type. FMRC will attempt to identify those issuers of high-yielding
securities whose financial condition is adequate to meet future obligations, has improved, or is expected to improve in the
future. FMRC's analysis focuses on relative values based on such factors as interest or dividend coverage, asset coverage,
earnings prospects, and the experience and managerial strength of the issuer.

A fund may choose, at its expense or in conjunction with others, to pursue litigation or otherwise to exercise its rights as a
security holder to seek to protect the interests of security holders if it determines this to be in the best interest of the fund's
shareholders.

Preferred Stock represents an equity or ownership interest in an issuer that pays dividends at a specified rate and that
has precedence over common stock in the payment of dividends. In the event an issuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy,
the claims of owners of bonds take precedence over the claims of those who own preferred and common stock.

Real Estate Investment Trusts. Equity real estate investment trusts own real estate properties, while mortgage real
estate investment trusts make construction, development, and long-term mortgage loans. Their value may be affected by
changes in the value of the underlying property of the trusts, the creditworthiness of the issuer, property taxes, interest rates,
and tax and regulatory requirements, such as those relating to the environment. Both types of trusts are dependent upon
management skill, are not diversified, and are subject to heavy cash flow dependency, defaults by borrowers,
self-liquidation, and the possibility of failing to qualify for tax-free status of income under the Internal Revenue Code and
failing to maintain exemption from the 1940 Act.

Repurchase Agreements involve an agreement to purchase a security and to sell that security back to the original seller
at an agreed-upon price. The resale price reflects the purchase price plus an agreed-upon incremental amount which is
unrelated to the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased security. As protection against the risk that the original seller will
not fulfill its obligation, the securities are held in a separate account at a bank, marked-to-market daily, and maintained at a
value at least equal to the sale price plus the accrued incremental amount. The value of the security purchased may be more
or less than the price at which the counterparty has agreed to purchase the security. In addition, delays or losses could result
if the other party to the agreement defaults or becomes insolvent. The fund will engage in repurchase agreement transactions
with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by FMRC.

Restricted Securities are subject to legal restrictions on their sale. Difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or
be costly to a fund. Restricted securities generally can be sold in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to an exemption
from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act), or in a registered public offering. Where registration is
required, the holder of a registered security may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expense and a considerable
period may elapse between the time it decides to seek registration and the time it may be permitted to sell a security under an
effective registration statement. If, during such a period, adverse market conditions were to develop, the holder might obtain
a less favorable price than prevailed when it decided to seek registration of the security.

Reverse Repurchase Agreements. In a reverse repurchase agreement, a fund sells a security to another party, such as a
bank or broker-dealer, in return for cash and agrees to repurchase that security at an agreed-upon price and time. The fund
will enter into reverse repurchase agreements with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory
by FMRC. Such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of fund assets and may be viewed as a form of
leverage.

Securities Lending. A fund may lend securities to parties such as broker-dealers or other institutions, including Fidelity
Brokerage Services LLC (FBS LLC). FBS LLC is a member of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and an indirect
subsidiary of FMR LLC.

Securities lending allows a fund to retain ownership of the securities loaned and, at the same time, earn additional
income. The borrower provides the fund with collateral in an amount at least equal to the value of the securities loaned. The
fund seeks to maintain the ability to obtain the right to vote or consent on proxy proposals involving material events
affecting securities loaned. If the borrower defaults on its obligation to return the securities loaned because of insolvency or
other reasons, a fund could experience delays and costs in recovering the securities loaned or in gaining access to the
collateral. These delays and costs could be greater for foreign securities. If a fund is not able to recover the securities loaned,
a fund may sell the collateral and purchase a replacement investment in the market. The value of the collateral could
decrease below the value of the replacement investment by the time the replacement investment is purchased. Loans will be
made only to parties deemed by FMRC to be in good standing and when, in FMRC's judgment, the income earned would
justify the risks.

Cash received as collateral through loan transactions may be invested in other eligible securities, including shares of a
money market fund. Investing this cash subjects that investment, as well as the securities loaned, to market appreciation or
depreciation.

Securities of Other Investment Companies, including shares of closed-end investment companies, unit investment
trusts, and open-end investment companies, represent interests in professionally managed portfolios that may invest in any
type of instrument. Investing in other investment companies involves substantially the same risks as investing directly in the
underlying instruments, but may involve additional expenses at the investment company-level, such as portfolio
management fees and operating expenses. Certain types of investment companies, such as closed-end investment
companies, issue a fixed number of shares that trade on a stock exchange or over-the-counter at a premium or a discount to
their net asset value per share (NAV). Others are continuously offered at NAV, but may also be traded in the secondary
market.

The extent to which a fund can invest in securities of other investment companies is limited by federal securities laws.

Short Sales "Against the Box" are short sales of securities that a fund owns or has the right to obtain (equivalent in kind
or amount to the securities sold short). If a fund enters into a short sale against the box, it will be required to set aside
securities equivalent in kind and amount to the securities sold short (or securities convertible or exchangeable into such
securities) and will be required to hold such securities while the short sale is outstanding. The fund will incur transaction
costs, including interest expenses, in connection with opening, maintaining, and closing short sales against the box.

Sovereign Debt Obligations are issued or guaranteed by foreign governments or their agencies, including debt of Latin
American nations or other developing countries. Sovereign debt may be in the form of conventional securities or other types
of debt instruments such as loans or loan participations. Sovereign debt of developing countries may involve a high degree
of risk, and may be in default or present the risk of default. Governmental entities responsible for repayment of the debt may
be unable or unwilling to repay principal and pay interest when due, and may require renegotiation or rescheduling of debt
payments. In addition, prospects for repayment of principal and payment of interest may depend on political as well as
economic factors. Although some sovereign debt, such as Brady Bonds, is collateralized by U.S. Government securities,
repayment of principal and payment of interest is not guaranteed by the U.S. Government.

Structured Notes are derivative debt securities, the interest rate or principal of which is determined by an unrelated
indicator. A structured note may be positively, negatively or both positively and negatively indexed; that is, its value or
interest rate may increase or decrease if the value of the reference instrument increases. Similarly, its value may increase or
decrease if the value of the reference instrument decreases. Further, the change in the principal amount payable with respect
to, or the interest rate of, a structured note may be a multiple of the percentage change (positive or negative) in the value of
the underlying reference instrument(s). Structured or indexed securities may also be more volatile, less liquid, and more
difficult to accurately price than less complex securities or more traditional debt securities.

Temporary Defensive Policies. The fund reserves the right to invest without limitation in preferred stocks and
investment-grade debt instruments for temporary, defensive purposes.

Warrants. Warrants are instruments which entitle the holder to buy an equity security at a specific price for a specific
period of time. Changes in the value of a warrant do not necessarily correspond to changes in the value of its underlying
security. The price of a warrant may be more volatile than the price of its underlying security, and a warrant may offer greater
potential for capital appreciation as well as capital loss.

Warrants do not entitle a holder to dividends or voting rights with respect to the underlying security and do not represent
any rights in the assets of the issuing company. A warrant ceases to have value if it is not exercised prior to its expiration date.
These factors can make warrants more speculative than other types of investments.

Zero Coupon Bonds do not make interest payments; instead, they are sold at a discount from their face value and are
redeemed at face value when they mature. Because zero coupon bonds do not pay current income, their prices can be more
volatile than other types of fixed-income securities when interest rates change. In calculating a fund's dividend, a portion of
the difference between a zero coupon bond's purchase price and its face value is considered income.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING CANADA

Political. Canada's parliamentary system of government is, in general, stable. One of the provinces, Quebec, which has
a predominantly French-speaking population, does have a "separatist" opposition party whose objective is to achieve
sovereignty and increased self-governing legal and financial powers. To date, referendums on Quebec sovereignty have
been defeated, but the issue remains unresolved. In case a referendum about the independence of Quebec were successful,
then the Canadian federal government may be obliged to negotiate with Quebec.

Economic. Canada is a major producer of commodities such as forest products, metals, agricultural products, and energy
related products like oil, gas, and hydroelectricity. Accordingly, changes in the supply and demand of base commodity
resources and industrial and precious metals and materials, both domestically and internationally, can have a significant effect
on Canadian market performance.

The United States is Canada's largest trading partner and developments in economic policy do have a significant impact
on the Canadian economy. The expanding economic and financial integration of the United States, Canada, and Mexico
through the NAFTA Agreement may make the Canadian economy and securities market more sensitive to North American
trade patterns. Growth in developing nations overseas, particularly China, may change the composition of Canada's trade
and foreign investment composition in the near future.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING EUROPE

The European Union (EU) is an intergovernmental and supranational union of most Western European countries and a
growing number of Eastern European countries, each known as a member state. One of the key activities of the EU is the
establishment and administration of a common single market, consisting of, among other things, a single currency and a
common trade policy. In order to pursue this goal, member states established, among other things, the European Economic
and Monetary Union (EMU) which sets out different stages and commitments that member states need to follow to achieve
greater economic policy coordination and monetary cooperation, including the adoption of a single currency, the euro.
Many member states have adopted, and other member states are generally expected to eventually adopt, the euro as their
single currency. When a member state adopts the euro as its currency, the member state no longer controls its own monetary
policies. Instead, the authority to direct monetary policy is exercised by the European Central Bank. However, certain
countries do not qualify for the euro and thus risk being left behind.

While economic and monetary convergence in the EU may offer new opportunities for those investing in the region,
investors should be aware that the success of the EU is not wholly assured. European countries can be significantly affected
by the tight fiscal and monetary controls that the EMU imposes on its members or requires candidates for EMU membership
to comply with. Europe must grapple with a number of challenges, any one of which could threaten the survival of this
monumental undertaking. The countries adopting the euro must adjust to a unified monetary system, the absence of
exchange rate flexibility, and the loss of economic sovereignty. Europe's economies are diverse, its governments are
decentralized, and its cultures differ widely. Unemployment in some European countries has historically been higher than in
the United States and could pose political risk. One or more member states might exit the EU, placing its currency and
banking system in jeopardy. Major issues currently facing the EU cover its membership, structure, procedures and policies;
they include the adoption, abandonment or adjustment of the new constitutional treaty, the EU's enlargement to the south
and east, and resolving the EU's problematic fiscal and democratic accountability. Efforts of the member states to continue
to unify their economic and monetary policies may increase the potential for similarities in the movements of European
markets and reduce the benefit of diversification within the region.

Political. The EU has been extending its influence to the east. It has accepted several Eastern European countries as new
members, and has plans to accept several more in the medium-term. It is hoped that membership for these states will help
cement economic and political stability. For these countries, membership serves as a strong political impetus to employ tight
fiscal and monetary policies. Nevertheless, new member states which were former Soviet satellites remain burdened to
various extents by the inherited inefficiencies of centrally planned economies similar to what existed under the old Soviet
Union. Further expansion of the EU has long-term economic benefits, but certain European countries are not viewed as
currently suitable for membership, especially the troubled economies of countries further east. Also, as the EU continues to
enlarge, the candidate countries' accessions may grow more controversial. Some member states may repudiate certain
candidate countries joining the EU upon concerns about the possible economic, immigration, and cultural implications that
may result from such enlargement. The current and future status of the EU therefore continues to be the subject of political
controversy, with widely differing views both within and between member states. For example, a large segment of the
population in the United Kingdom may be indifferent or opposed to the EU, while other countries are generally more in
favor of European integration.

It is possible that the gap between rich and poor within the EU's member countries, and particularly among new
members that have not met the requirements for joining the EMU may increase, and that realigning traditional alliances
could alter trading relationships and potentially provoke divisive socioeconomic splits.

In the transition to the single economic system, significant political decisions will be made which may affect the market
regulation, subsidization, and privatization across all industries, from agricultural products to telecommunications.

Economic. The EU economy is expected to grow further over the next decade as more countries join the EU - especially
considering that the new member states are usually poorer than the EU average, and hence the expected fast GDP growth
will help achieve the dynamic of the united Europe. The EU's economic growth has been below that of the United States
most years since 1990, and the economic performance of several of its key members, including Germany and Italy, is a
matter of serious concern to policy makers.

As economic conditions across member states vary from robust to dismal, there is continued concern about
national-level support for the euro and the accompanying coordination of fiscal and wage policy among EMU member
countries. According to the Maastricht treaty, member countries must maintain tight control over inflation, public debt, and
budget deficit in order to qualify for participation in the euro. These requirements severely limit EMU member countries'
ability to implement monetary policy to address regional economic conditions.

Currency. Investing in euro-denominated securities entails risk of being exposed to a currency that may not fully reflect
the strengths and weaknesses of the disparate European economies. Many European countries rely heavily upon
export-dependent businesses and any strength in the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar can have either a
positive or a negative effect upon corporate profits.

Nordic Countries. Faced with stronger global competition, the Nordic countries - Denmark, Finland, Norway, and
Sweden - have had to scale down their historically generous welfare programs, resulting in drops in domestic demand and
increased unemployment. Major industries in the region, such as forestry, agriculture, and oil, are heavily
resource-dependent and face pressure as a result of high labor costs. Pension reform, union regulation, and further cuts in
liberal social programs will likely need to be addressed as the Nordic countries face increased international competition.

Eastern Europe. Investing in the securities of Eastern European issuers is highly speculative and involves risks not
usually associated with investing in the more developed markets of Western Europe. Political and economic reforms are too
recent to establish a definite trend away from centrally planned economies and state-owned industries.

Many Eastern European countries continue to move towards market economies at different paces with appropriately
different characteristics. Most Eastern European markets suffer from thin trading activity, dubious investor protections, and
often a dearth of reliable corporate information. Information and transaction costs, differential taxes, and sometimes
political or transfer risk give a comparative advantage to the domestic investor rather than the foreign investor. In addition,
these markets are particularly sensitive to social, political, economic, and currency events in Russia and may suffer heavy
losses as a result of their trading and investment links to the Russian economy and currency.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING JAPAN

Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, mastery of high technology, emphasis on education, and a
comparatively small defense allocation have helped Japan advance with extraordinary speed to become one of the largest
economic powers along with the United States and the EU. Despite its impressive history, investors face special risks when
investing in Japan.

Economic. For three decades from the 1960s through the 1980s, Japan's overall real economic growth had been
spectacular. However, growth slowed markedly in the 1990s and Japan's economy fell into a long recession. At present, the
Japanese economy could be recovering from this long recession, although uncertainties about its recovery remain. Japan's
huge government debt, the aging of the population, an unstable financial sector, low domestic consumption, and certain
corporate structural weaknesses are some of the major long-term problems.

Overseas trade is important to Japan's economy. Japan has few natural resources and must export to pay for its imports of
these basic requirements. Japan's economic growth is significantly driven by its exports. Domestic or foreign trade
sanctions or other protectionist measures could adversely impact Japan's economy. Japan has experienced earthquakes and
tidal waves of varying degrees of severity, and the risks of such phenomena and the resulting damage continue to exist.

A pressing need to sustain Japan's economic recovery and improve its economic growth is the task of overhauling the
nation's financial institutions and securing public support for taxpayer-funded bailouts. Banks, in particular, may have to
reform themselves to become more competitive. Successful financial sector reform would contribute to Japan's economic
recovery at home and would benefit other economies in Asia. Internal conflict over the proper way to reform the banking
system exists.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING ASIA PACIFIC REGION (EX JAPAN)

Many countries in the region have historically faced political uncertainty, corruption, military intervention, and social
unrest. Examples include the ethnic, sectarian, and separatist violence found in Indonesia, and the nuclear arms threats
between India and Pakistan. To the extent that such events continue in the future, they can be expected to have a negative
effect on economic and securities market conditions in the region.

Economic. The economies of many countries in the region are heavily dependent on international trade and are
accordingly affected by protective trade barriers and the economic conditions of their trading partners, principally, the U.S.,
Japan, China, and the European Union.

Korea. Investors should be aware that investing in Korea involves risks not typically associated with investing in the
U.S. securities markets. Relations between North Korea and South Korea remain tense and the possibility of military action
between two countries still exists. Corporate and financial sector restructuring initiated by the Korean government, in
conjunction with the IMF, after the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis can be expected to continue but its full impact cannot be
predicted yet. Korean economy's reliance on international trade and other Asian economies makes it highly sensitive to
fluctuations in international commodity prices, currency exchange rates and government regulation.

China Region. As with all transition economies, China's ability to develop and sustain a credible legal, regulatory,
monetary, and socioeconomic system could influence the course of outside investment. Hong Kong is closely tied to China,
economically and through China's 1997 acquisition of the country as a Special Autonomous Region (SAR). Hong Kong's
success depends, in large part, on its ability to retain the legal, financial, and monetary systems that allow economic freedom
and market expansion. Although many Taiwanese companies heavily invest in China, a state of hostility continues to exist
between China and Taiwan, which Beijing has long deemed a part of China and has made a nationalist cause of recovering it.
Taiwan's political stability and ability to sustain its economic growth could be significantly affected by its political and
economic relationship with China.

Southeast Asia. In addition to the risks inherent in investing in the emerging markets, the risks of investing in Southeast
Asia merit special consideration. Indonesia has restored financial stability and pursued sober fiscal policies since the
1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, but many economic development problems remain, including high unemployment, a
fragile banking sector, endemic corruption, inadequate infrastructure, a poor investment climate, and unequal resource
distribution among regions. In addition, Indonesia continues to be at risk of ethnic, sectarian, and separatist violence. Keys
to future growth remain internal reform, peaceful resolution of internal conflicts, building up the confidence of international
and domestic investors, and strong global economic growth. In late December 2004, a major tsunami took nearly 127,000
lives, left more than 93,000 people missing and nearly 441,000 people displaced, and destroyed $4.5 to $5.0 billion worth of
property. The negative effects of the tsunami are still felt today, and similar natural disasters could happen again.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING LATIN AMERICA

As an emerging market, Latin America historically suffered from social, political, and economic instability. For
investors, this has meant additional risk caused by periods of regional conflict, political corruption, totalitarianism,
protectionist measures, nationalization, hyperinflation, debt crises, sudden and large currency devaluation, and intervention
by the military in civilian and economic spheres. However, in some Latin American countries, a move to sustainable
democracy and a more mature and accountable political environment is under way. Domestic economies have been
deregulated, privatization of state-owned companies is almost completed and foreign trade restrictions have been relaxed.
Nonetheless, to the extent that events such as those listed above continue in the future, they could reverse favorable trends
toward market and economic reform, privatization, and removal of trade barriers, and result in significant disruption in
securities markets in the region. Investors in the region continue to face a number of potential risks.

A number of Latin American countries are among the largest debtors of developing countries and have a long history of
foreign debt and default. The majority of the region's economies have become highly dependent upon foreign credit and
loans from external sources to fuel their state-sponsored economic plans. Historically, government profligacy and
ill-conceived plans for modernization have exhausted these resources with little benefit accruing to the economy. Most
countries have been forced to restructure their loans or risk default on their debt obligations. In addition, interest on the debt
is subject to market conditions and may reach levels that would impair economic activity and create a difficult and costly
environment for borrowers. Accordingly, these governments may be forced to reschedule or freeze their debt repayment,
which could negatively affect local markets.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING EMERGING MARKETS

Investing in companies domiciled in emerging market countries may be subject to potentially higher risks than
investments in developed countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater
illiquidity and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent
trading volumes; (iii) foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and regulation by local
authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors and/or local
governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local
governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be
subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on dollar or euro payments imposed
by local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii)
investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the
interests of the issuer over those of foreign investors; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the
local currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market
valuations of the securities, and (xi) lax financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure, and differences in
accounting standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING RUSSIA

Investing in Russian securities is highly speculative and involves significant risks and special considerations not
typically associated with investing in the securities markets of the U.S. and most other developed countries.

Political. Over the past century, Russia has experienced political and economic turbulence and has endured decades of
communist rule under which tens of millions of its citizens were collectivized into state agricultural and industrial
enterprises. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia's government has been faced with the daunting task of stabilizing
its domestic economy, while transforming it into a modern and efficient structure able to compete in international markets
and respond to the needs of its citizens. However, to date, many of the country's economic reform initiatives have
floundered as the proceeds of IMF and other economic assistance have been squandered or stolen. In this environment, there
is always the risk that the nation's government will abandon the current program of economic reform and replace it with
radically different political and economic policies that would be detrimental to the interests of foreign and private investors.

Economic. Many of Russia's businesses have failed to mobilize the available factors of production because the
country's privatization program virtually ensured the predominance of the old management teams that are largely
non-market-oriented in their management approach. Poor accounting standards, inept management, pervasive corruption,
insider trading and crime, and inadequate regulatory protection for the rights of investors all pose a significant risk,
particularly to foreign investors. In addition, there is the risk that the Russian tax system will not be reformed to prevent
inconsistent, retroactive, and/or exorbitant taxation, or, in the alternative, the risk that a reformed tax system may result in
the inconsistent and unpredictable enforcement of the new tax laws.

Compared to most national stock markets, the Russian securities market suffers from a variety of problems not
encountered in more developed markets. There is little long-term historical data on the Russian securities market because it
is relatively new and a substantial proportion of securities transactions in Russia are privately negotiated outside of stock
exchanges. The inexperience of the Russian securities market and the limited volume of trading in securities in the market
may make obtaining accurate prices on portfolio securities from independent sources more difficult than in more developed
markets. Additionally, there is little solid corporate information available to investors. As a result, it may be difficult to
assess the value or prospects of an investment in Russian companies.

Because of the recent formation of the Russian securities market as well as the underdeveloped state of the banking and
telecommunications systems, settlement, clearing and registration of securities transactions are subject to significant risks.
Ownership of shares (except where shares are held through depositories that meet the requirements of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act)) is defined according to entries in the company's share register and normally evidenced
by extracts from the register or by formal share certificates. However, there is no central registration system for shareholders
and these services are carried out by the companies themselves or by registrars located throughout Russia. These registrars
are not necessarily subject to effective state supervision nor are they licensed with any governmental entity and it is possible
for a fund to lose its registration through fraud, negligence, or even mere oversight. While a fund will endeavor to ensure that
its interest continues to be appropriately recorded either itself or through a custodian or other agent inspecting the share
register and by obtaining extracts of share registers through regular confirmations, these extracts have no legal
enforceability and it is possible that subsequent illegal amendment or other fraudulent act may deprive a fund of its
ownership rights or improperly dilute its interests. In addition, while applicable Russian regulations impose liability on
registrars for losses resulting from their errors, it may be difficult for a fund to enforce any rights it may have against the
registrar or issuer of the securities in the event of loss of share registration. Furthermore, significant delays or problems may
occur in registering the transfer of securities, which could cause a fund to incur losses due to a counterparty's failure to pay
for securities the fund has delivered or the fund's inability to complete its contractual obligations because of theft or other
reasons.

The Russian economy is heavily dependent upon the export of a range of commodities including most industrial metals,
forestry products, oil, and gas. Accordingly, it is strongly affected by international commodity prices and is particularly
vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products.

Currency. Foreign investors also face a high degree of currency risk when investing in Russian securities and a lack of
available currency hedging instruments. In a surprise move in August 1998, Russia devalued the ruble, defaulted on
short-term domestic bonds, and imposed a moratorium on the repayment of its international debt and the restructuring of the
repayment terms. These actions have negatively affected Russian borrowers' ability to access international capital markets
and have had a damaging impact on the Russian economy. In light of these and other government actions, foreign investors
could face the possibility of further devaluations. In addition, there is the risk the government may impose capital controls
on foreign portfolio investments in the event of extreme financial or political crisis. Such capital controls would prevent the
sale of a portfolio of foreign assets and the repatriation of investment income and capital.

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS

All orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities are placed on behalf of the fund by FMRC pursuant to authority
contained in the management contract. FMRC may also be responsible for the placement of portfolio transactions for other
investment companies and investment accounts for which it has or its affiliates have investment discretion.

Purchases and sales of equity securities on a securities exchange or OTC are effected through brokers who receive
compensation for their services. Generally, compensation relating to securities traded on foreign exchanges will be higher
than compensation relating to securities traded on U.S. exchanges and may not be subject to negotiation. Compensation
may also be paid in connection with principal transactions (in both OTC securities and securities listed on an exchange) and
agency OTC transactions executed with an electronic communications network (ECN) or an alternative trading system.
Equity securities may be purchased from underwriters at prices that include underwriting fees.

Purchases and sales of fixed-income securities are generally made with an issuer or a primary market-maker acting as
principal. Although there is no stated brokerage commission paid by the fund for any fixed-income security, the price paid
by the fund to an underwriter includes the disclosed underwriting fee and prices in secondary trades usually include an
undisclosed dealer commission or markup reflecting the spread between the bid and ask prices of the fixed-income security.

The Trustees of the fund periodically review FMRC's performance of its responsibilities in connection with the
placement of portfolio transactions on behalf of the fund. The Trustees also review the compensation paid by the fund over
representative periods of time to determine if it was reasonable in relation to the benefits to the fund.

The Selection of Brokers

In selecting brokers or dealers (including affiliates of FMRC) to execute the fund's portfolio transactions, FMRC
considers factors deemed relevant in the context of a particular trade and in regard to FMRC's overall responsibilities with
respect to the fund and other investment accounts, including any instructions from the fund's portfolio manager, which may
emphasize, for example, speed of execution over other factors. The factors considered will influence whether it is
appropriate to execute an order using ECNs, electronic channels including algorithmic trading, or by actively working an
order. Other factors deemed relevant may include, but are not limited to: price; the size and type of the transaction; the
reasonableness of compensation to be paid, including spreads and commission rates; the speed and certainty of trade
executions, including broker willingness to commit capital; the nature and characteristics of the markets for the security to
be purchased or sold, including the degree of specialization of the broker in such markets or securities; the availability of
liquidity in the security, including the liquidity and depth afforded by a market center or market-maker; the reliability of a
market center or broker; the broker's overall trading relationship with FMRC; the trader's assessment of whether and how
closely the broker likely will follow the trader's instructions to the broker; the degree of anonymity that a particular broker
or market can provide; the potential for avoiding market impact; the execution services rendered on a continuing basis; the
execution efficiency, settlement capability, and financial condition of the firm; and the provision of additional brokerage
and research products and services, if applicable. In seeking best execution, FMRC may select a broker using a trading
method for which the broker may charge a higher commission than its lowest available commission rate. FMRC also may
select a broker that charges more than the lowest available commission rate available from another broker. For futures
transactions, the selection of an FCM is generally based on the overall quality of execution and other services provided by
the FCM.

The Acquisition of Brokerage and Research Products and Services

Brokers (who are not affiliates of FMRC) that execute transactions for the fund may receive higher compensation from
the fund than other brokers might have charged the fund, in recognition of the value of the brokerage or research products
and services they provide to FMRC or its affiliates.

Research Products and Services. These products and services may include: economic, industry, company, municipal,
sovereign (U.S. and non-U.S.), legal, or political research reports; market color; company meeting facilitation; and
investment recommendations. FMRC may request that a broker provide a specific proprietary or third-party product or
service. Some of these products and services supplement FMRC's own research activities in providing investment advice to
the fund.

Execution Services. In addition, products and services may include those that assist in the execution, clearing, and
settlement of securities transactions, as well as other incidental functions (including but not limited to communication
services related to trade execution, order routing and algorithmic trading, post-trade matching, exchange of messages
among brokers or dealers, custodians and institutions, and the use of electronic confirmation and affirmation of institutional
trades).

Mixed-Use Products and Services. In addition to receiving brokerage and research products and services via written
reports and computer-delivered services, such reports may also be provided by telephone and in personal meetings with
securities analysts, corporate and industry spokespersons, economists, academicians and government representatives and
others with relevant professional expertise. FMRC and its affiliates may use commission dollars to obtain certain products
or services that are not used exclusively in FMRC's or its affiliates' investment decision-making process (mixed-use
products or services). In those circumstances, FMRC or its affiliates will make a good faith judgment to evaluate the various
benefits and uses to which they intend to put the mixed-use product or service, and will pay for that portion of the mixed-use
product or service that does not qualify as brokerage and research products and services with their own resources (referred
to as "hard dollars").

Benefit to FMRC. FMRC's expenses would likely be increased if it attempted to generate these additional products and
services through its own efforts, or if it paid for these products or services itself. Certain of the brokerage and research
products and services FMRC receives from brokers are furnished by brokers on their own initiative, either in connection
with a particular transaction or as part of their overall services. Some of these products or services may not have an explicit
cost associated with such product or service.

FMRC's Decision-Making Process. Before causing the fund to pay a particular level of compensation, FMRC will
make a good faith determination that the compensation is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and/or research
products and services provided to FMRC, viewed in terms of the particular transaction for the fund or FMRC's overall
responsibilities to the fund or other investment companies and investment accounts. While FMRC may take into account
the brokerage and/or research products and services provided by a broker in determining whether compensation paid is
reasonable, neither FMRC nor the fund incurs an obligation to any broker, dealer, or third party to pay for any product or
service (or portion thereof) by generating a specific amount of compensation or otherwise. Typically, these products and
services assist FMRC and its affiliates in terms of its overall investment responsibilities to the fund and other investment
companies and investment accounts; however, each product or service received may not benefit the fund. Certain funds or
investment accounts may use brokerage commissions to acquire brokerage and research products and services that may also
benefit other funds or accounts managed by FMRC or its affiliates.

Hard Dollar Research Contracts. FMRC has arrangements with certain third-party research providers and brokers
through whom FMRC effects fund trades, whereby FMRC may pay with hard dollars for all or a portion of the cost of
research products and services purchased from such research providers or brokers. Even with such hard dollar payments,
FMRC may cause the fund to pay more for execution than the lowest commission rate available from the broker providing
research products and services to FMRC, or that may be available from another broker. FMRC views its hard dollar
payments for research products and services as likely to reduce the fund's total commission costs even though it is expected
that in such hard dollar arrangements the commissions available for recapture and to pay fund expenses, as described below,
will decrease. FMRC's determination to pay for research products and services separately, rather than bundled with fund
commissions, is wholly voluntary on FMRC's part and may be extended to additional brokers or discontinued with any
broker participating in this arrangement.

Commission Recapture

FMRC may allocate brokerage transactions to brokers (who are not affiliates of FMRC) who have entered into
arrangements with FMR under which the broker, using predetermined methodology, rebates a portion of the compensation
paid by a fund to offset that fund's expenses, which may be paid to FMRC or its affiliates. Not all brokers with whom the
fund trades have agreed to participate in brokerage commission recapture. FMRC expects that brokers from whom FMRC
purchases research products and services with hard dollars are unlikely to participate in commission recapture.

Affiliated Transactions

FMRC may place trades with certain brokers, including National Financial Services LLC (NFS), with whom FMRC is
under common control provided FMRC determines that these affiliates' trade execution abilities and costs are comparable to
those of non-affiliated, qualified brokerage firms.

The Trustees of the fund have approved procedures whereby a fund may purchase securities that are offered in
underwritings in which an affiliate of FMR participates. In addition, for underwritings where an FMR affiliate participates as a
principal underwriter, certain restrictions may apply that could, among other things, limit the amount of securities that the fund
could purchase in the underwritings.

Trade Allocation

Although the Trustees and officers of the fund are substantially the same as those of other funds managed by FMR or its
affiliates, investment decisions for the fund are made independently from those of other funds or investment accounts
(including proprietary accounts) managed by FMR or its affiliates. The same security is often held in the portfolio of more
than one of these funds or investment accounts. Simultaneous transactions are inevitable when several funds and
investment accounts are managed by the same investment adviser, particularly when the same security is suitable for the
investment objective of more than one fund or investment account.

When two or more funds or investment accounts are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of the same security,
including a futures contract, the prices and amounts are allocated in accordance with procedures believed by FMRC to be
appropriate and equitable to each fund or investment account. In some cases adherence to these procedures could have a
detrimental effect on the price or value of the security as far as the fund is concerned. In other cases, however, the ability of
the fund to participate in volume transactions will produce better executions and prices for the fund.

Commissions Paid

A fund may pay compensation including both commissions and spreads in connection with the placement of portfolio
transactions. The amount of brokerage commissions paid by a fund may change from year to year because of, among other
things, changing asset levels, shareholder activity, and/or portfolio turnover.

VALUATION

The fund's NAV is the value of a single share. The NAV of the fund is computed by adding the value of the fund's
investments, cash, and other assets, subtracting its liabilities, and dividing the result by the number of shares outstanding.

Portfolio securities are valued by various methods depending on the primary market or exchange on which they trade.
Most equity securities for which the primary market is the United States are valued at the official closing price, last sale price
or, if no sale has occurred, at the closing bid price. Most equity securities for which the primary market is outside the United
States are valued using the official closing price or the last sale price in the principal market in which they are traded. If the
last sale price (on the local exchange) is unavailable, the last evaluated quote or closing bid price normally is used. Securities
of other open-end investment companies are valued at their respective NAVs.

Debt securities and other assets for which market quotations are readily available may be valued at market values
determined by such securities' most recent bid prices (sales prices if the principal market is an exchange) in the principal
market in which they normally are traded, as furnished by recognized dealers in such securities or assets. Or, debt securities
and convertible securities may be valued on the basis of information furnished by a pricing service that uses a valuation
matrix which incorporates both dealer-supplied valuations and electronic data processing techniques. Use of pricing
services has been approved by the Board of Trustees. A number of pricing services are available, and the fund may use
various pricing services or discontinue the use of any pricing service.

Futures contracts and options are valued on the basis of market quotations, if available.

Independent brokers or quotation services provide prices of foreign securities in their local currency. Fidelity Service
Company, Inc. (FSC) gathers all exchange rates daily at the close of the NYSE using the last quoted price on the local
currency and then translates the value of foreign securities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars. Any changes in the
value of forward contracts due to exchange rate fluctuations and days to maturity are included in the calculation of NAV. If
an event that is expected to materially affect the value of a portfolio security occurs after the close of an exchange or market
on which that security is traded, then that security will be valued in good faith by a committee appointed by the Board of
Trustees.

Short-term securities with remaining maturities of sixty days or less for which market quotations and information
furnished by a pricing service are not readily available are valued either at amortized cost or at original cost plus accrued
interest, both of which approximate current value.

The procedures set forth above need not be used to determine the value of the securities owned by the fund if, in the opinion
of a committee appointed by the Board of Trustees, some other method would more accurately reflect the fair value of such
securities. For example, securities and other assets for which there is no readily available market value may be valued in good
faith by a committee appointed by the Board of Trustees. In making a good faith determination of the value of a security, the
committee may review price movements in futures contracts and ADRs, market and trading trends, the bid/ask quotes of
brokers and off-exchange institutional trading.

BUYING AND SELLING INFORMATION

Shares of the fund are not offered to the public and are issued solely in private placement transactions that do not involve
any "public offering" within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act. Investments in the fund may be made only by a
limited number of institutional investors, including certain other registered investment companies managed by FMR or an
affiliate and certain other entities that are "accredited investors" within the meaning of Regulation D under the 1933 Act.
This registration statement does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any "security" within the
meaning of the 1933 Act.

The fund may make redemption payments in whole or in part in readily marketable securities or other property pursuant
to procedures approved by the Trustees if FMRC determines it is in the best interests of the fund. Such securities or other
property will be valued for this purpose as they are valued in computing the fund's NAV. Shareholders that receive securities
or other property will realize, upon receipt, a gain or loss for tax purposes, and will incur additional costs and be exposed to
market risk prior to and upon sale of such securities or other property.

The fund, in its discretion, may determine to issue its shares in kind in exchange for securities held by the purchaser
having a value, determined in accordance with the fund's policies for valuation of portfolio securities, equal to the purchase
price of the fund shares issued. The fund will accept for in-kind purchases only securities or other instruments that are
appropriate under its investment objective and policies. In addition, the fund generally will not accept securities of any
issuer unless they are liquid, have a readily ascertainable market value, and are not subject to restrictions on resale. All
dividends, distributions, and subscription or other rights associated with the securities become the property of the fund,
along with the securities. Shares purchased in exchange for securities in kind generally cannot be redeemed for fifteen days
following the exchange to allow time for the transfer to settle.

TAXES

Because the fund intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the fund should not be subject to
any federal income tax. Based upon the status of the fund as a partnership, an investor that is a "regulated investment
company" will take into account its share of the fund's assets, ordinary income and losses and capital gains and losses in
determining its income tax liability and qualification as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the
Code. The determination of an investor's share of the fund's ordinary income and losses and capital gains and losses will be
made in accordance with the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

The fund's taxable year-end is September 30. Although the fund will not be subject to federal income tax, it will file
appropriate federal income tax returns.

Each prospective investor that is a "regulated investment company" agrees that, for purposes of determining its required
distribution under Code Section 4982(a), it will account for its share of items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of
the fund as they are taken into account by the fund.

Investors are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences of an investment in the fund.

Standing Committees of the Fund's Trustees. The Board of Trustees has established various committees to support
the Independent Trustees in acting independently in pursuing the best interests of the Fidelity funds and their shareholders.
The committees facilitate the timely and efficient consideration of all matters of importance to Independent Trustees, the
fund, and fund shareholders and to facilitate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Currently, the Board of
Trustees has 12 standing committees. The members of each committee are Independent Trustees.

The Operations Committee is composed of all of the Independent Trustees, with Mr. Lautenbach currently serving as
Chair. The committee normally meets monthly (except August), or more frequently as called by the Chair, and serves as a
forum for consideration of issues of importance to, or calling for particular determinations by, the Independent Trustees.
The committee also considers matters involving potential conflicts of interest between the funds and FMR and its affiliates
and reviews proposed contracts and the proposed continuation of contracts between the Fidelity funds and FMR and its
affiliates, and annually reviews and makes recommendations regarding contracts with third parties unaffiliated with FMR,
including insurance coverage and custody agreements. The committee also monitors additional issues including the nature,
levels and quality of services provided to shareholders, significant litigation, and the voting of proxies of portfolio
companies. The committee also has oversight of compliance issues not specifically within the scope of any other
committee. The committee is also responsible for definitive action on all compliance matters involving the potential for
significant reimbursement by FMR. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, the committee held 16 meetings.

The Fair Value Oversight Committee is composed of all of the Independent Trustees, with Mr. Lautenbach currently
serving as Chair. The committee normally meets quarterly, or more frequently as called by the Chair. The Fair Value
Oversight Committee monitors and establishes policies concerning procedures and controls regarding the valuation of fund
investments and monitors matters of disclosure to the extent required to fulfill its statutory responsibilities. The committee
also reviews actions taken by FMR's Fair Value Committee. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, the
committee held four meetings.

The Board of Trustees has established three Fund Oversight Committees: the Equity Committee (composed of Messrs.
Stavropoulos (Chair), Gamper, and Lautenbach), the Fixed-Income, International, and Special Committee (composed of
Ms. Small (Chair), Ms. Knowles, and Mr. Dirks), and the Select and Asset Allocation Committee (composed of Dr.
Heilmeier (Chair), Messrs. Keyes and Wolfe). Each committee normally meets in conjunction with in-person meetings of
the Board of Trustees, or more frequently as called by the Chair of the respective committee. Each committee develops an
understanding of and reviews the investment objectives, policies, and practices of each fund under its oversight. Each
committee also monitors investment performance, compliance by each relevant Fidelity fund with its investment policies
and restrictions and reviews appropriate benchmarks, competitive universes, unusual or exceptional investment matters,
the personnel and other resources devoted to the management of each fund and all other matters bearing on each fund's
investment results. The Fixed-Income, International, and Special Committee also receives reports required under Rule 2a-7
of the 1940 Act and has oversight of research bearing on credit quality, investment structures and other fixed-income issues,
and of international research. The Select and Asset Allocation Committee has oversight of FMR's equity investment
research. Each committee will review and recommend any required action to the Board in respect of specific funds,
including new funds, changes in fundamental and non-fundamental investment policies and restrictions, partial or full
closing to new investors, fund mergers, fund name changes, and liquidations of funds. The members of each committee may
organize working groups to make recommendations concerning issues related to funds that are within the scope of the
committee's review. These working groups report to the committee or to the Independent Trustees, or both, as appropriate.
Each working group may request from FMR such information from FMR as may be appropriate to the working group's
deliberations. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, the Equity Committee held 10 meetings, the Fixed-Income,
International, and Special Committee held 13 meetings, and the Select and Asset Allocation Committee held 11 meetings.

The Board of Trustees has established two Fund Contract Committees: the Equity Contract Committee (composed of
Messrs. Stavropoulos (Chair), Gamper, and Lautenbach, Dr. Heilmeier, and Ms. Small) and the Fixed-Income Contract
Committee (composed of Ms. Small (Chair), Mr. Dirks, and Ms. Knowles). Each committee will ordinarily meet as
needed to consider matters related to the renewal of fund investment advisory agreements. The committees will assist the
Independent Trustees in their consideration of investment advisory agreements of each fund. Each committee receives
information on and makes recommendations concerning the approval of investment advisory agreements between the
Fidelity funds and FMR and its affiliates and any non-FMR affiliate that serves as a sub-adviser to a Fidelity fund
(collectively, investment advisers) and the annual review of these contracts. The Fixed-Income Contract Committee will
be responsible for investment advisory agreements of the fixed-income funds. The Equity Contract Committee will be
responsible for the investment advisory agreements of all other funds. With respect to each fund under its purview, each
committee: requests and receives information on the nature, extent, and quality of services provided to the shareholders
of the Fidelity funds by the investment advisers and their respective affiliates, fund performance, the investment
performance of the investment adviser, and such other information as the committee determines to be reasonably
necessary to evaluate the terms of the investment advisory agreements; considers the cost of the services to be provided
and the profitability and other benefits that the investment advisers and their respective affiliates derive or will derive
from their contractual arrangements with each of the funds (including tangible and intangible "fall-out benefits");
considers the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the funds grow and whether fee levels reflect those
economies of scale for the benefit of fund investors; considers methodologies for determining the extent to which the
funds benefit from economies of scale and refinements to these methodologies; considers information comparing the
services to be rendered and the amount to be paid under the funds' contracts with those under other investment advisory
contracts entered into with FMR and its affiliates and other investment advisers, such as contracts with other registered
investment companies or other types of clients; considers such other matters and information as may be necessary and
appropriate to evaluate investment advisory agreements of the funds; and makes recommendations to the Board
concerning the approval or renewal of investment advisory agreements. Each committee will consult with the other
committees of the Board of Trustees, and in particular with the Audit Committee and the applicable Fund Oversight
Committees, in carrying out its responsibilities. Each committee's responsibilities are guided by Sections 15(c) and 36(b)
of the 1940 Act. While each committee consists solely of Independent Trustees, its meetings may, depending upon the
subject matter, be attended by one or more senior members of FMR's management or representatives of a sub-adviser not
affiliated with FMR. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, the Equity Contract Committee held three
meetings and the Fixed-Income Contract Committee held four meetings.

The Shareholder, Distribution and Brokerage Committee is composed of Messrs. Dirks (Chair), Gamper, and
Stavropoulos, and Ms. Small. The committee normally meets monthly (except August), or more frequently as called by the
Chair. Regarding shareholder services, the committee considers the structure and amount of the Fidelity funds' transfer
agency fees and fees, including direct fees to investors (other than sales loads), such as bookkeeping and custodial fees, and
the nature and quality of services rendered by FMR and its affiliates or third parties (such as custodians) in consideration of
these fees. The committee also considers other non-investment management services rendered to the Fidelity funds by FMR
and its affiliates, including pricing and bookkeeping services. Regarding brokerage, the committee monitors and
recommends policies concerning the securities transactions of the Fidelity funds. The committee periodically reviews the
policies and practices with respect to efforts to achieve best execution, commissions paid to firms supplying research and
brokerage services or paying fund expenses, and policies and procedures designed to assure that any allocation of portfolio
transactions is not influenced by the sale of Fidelity fund shares. The committee also monitors brokerage and other similar
relationships between the Fidelity funds and firms affiliated with FMR that participate in the execution of securities
transactions. Regarding the distribution of fund shares, the committee considers issues bearing on the various distribution
channels employed by the Fidelity funds, including issues regarding Rule 18f-3 plans and related consideration of classes of
shares, sales load structures (including breakpoints), load waivers, selling concessions and service charges paid to
intermediaries, Rule 12b-1 plans, contingent deferred sales charges, and finders' fees, and other means by which
intermediaries are compensated for selling fund shares or providing shareholder servicing, including revenue sharing. The
committee also considers issues bearing on the preparation and use of advertisements and sales literature for the Fidelity
funds, policies and procedures regarding frequent purchase of Fidelity fund shares, and selective disclosure of portfolio
holdings. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, the Shareholder, Distribution and Brokerage Committee held
12 meetings.

The Audit Committee is composed of Ms. Knowles (Chair), Dr. Heilmeier, and Messrs. Keyes and Wolfe. All
committee members must be able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a company's
balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. At least one committee member will be an "audit committee
financial expert" as defined by the SEC. The committee will have at least one committee member in common with the
Compliance Committee. The committee normally meets monthly (except August), or more frequently as called by the
Chair. The committee meets separately at least four times a year with the Fidelity funds' Treasurer, with personnel
responsible for the internal audit function of FMR LLC, and with the Fidelity funds' outside auditors. The committee has
direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of the outside auditors employed by the
Fidelity funds. The committee assists the Trustees in overseeing and monitoring: (i) the systems of internal accounting and
financial controls of the Fidelity funds and the funds' service providers, (ii) the financial reporting processes of the Fidelity
funds, (iii) the independence, objectivity and qualification of the auditors to the Fidelity funds, (iv) the annual audits of the
Fidelity funds' financial statements, and (v) the accounting policies and disclosures of the Fidelity funds. The committee
considers and acts upon (i) the provision by any outside auditor of any non-audit services for any Fidelity fund, and (ii) the
provision by any outside auditor of certain non-audit services to Fidelity fund service providers and their affiliates to the
extent that such approval (in the case of this clause (ii)) is required under applicable regulations of the SEC. In furtherance of
the foregoing, the committee has adopted (and may from time to time amend or supplement) and provides oversight of
policies and procedures for non-audit engagements by outside auditors of the Fidelity funds. It is responsible for approving
all audit engagement fees and terms for the Fidelity funds, resolving disagreements between a fund and any outside auditor
regarding any fund's financial reporting, and has sole authority to hire and fire any auditor. Auditors of the funds report
directly to the committee. The committee will obtain assurance of independence and objectivity from the outside auditors,
including a formal written statement delineating all relationships between the auditor and the Fidelity funds and any service
providers consistent with Independent Standards Board Standard No. 1. The committee will receive reports of compliance
with provisions of the Auditor Independence Regulations relating to the hiring of employees or former employees of the
outside auditors. It oversees and receives reports on the Fidelity funds' service providers' internal controls and reviews the
adequacy and effectiveness of the service providers' accounting and financial controls, including: (i) any significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Fidelity funds' ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data;
(ii) any change in the fund's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the fund's internal control over financial reporting; and (iii) any fraud, whether material or not, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Fidelity funds' or service providers internal
controls over financial reporting. The committee will review with counsel any legal matters that may have a material
impact on the Fidelity funds' financial statements and any material reports or inquiries received from regulators or
governmental agencies. These matters may also be reviewed by the Compliance Committee or the Operations Committee.
The Chair of the Audit Committee will coordinate with the Chair of the Compliance Committee, as appropriate. The
committee reviews at least annually a report from each outside auditor describing any material issues raised by the most
recent internal quality control, peer review, or Public Company Accounting Oversight Board examination of the auditing
firm and any material issues raised by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities of the
auditing firm and in each case any steps taken to deal with such issues. The committee will oversee and receive reports on
the Fidelity funds' financial reporting process, will discuss with FMR, the Fidelity funds' Treasurer, outside auditors and, if
appropriate, internal audit personnel of FMR LLC, their qualitative judgments about the appropriateness and acceptability
of accounting principles and financial disclosure practices used or proposed for adoption by the Fidelity funds, and will
review with FMR, the Fidelity funds' Treasurer, outside auditor, and internal auditor personnel of FMR LLC (to the extent
relevant) the results of audits of the Fidelity funds' financial statements. The committee will review periodically the Fidelity
funds' major internal controls exposures and the steps that have been taken to monitor and control such exposures. During
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, the committee held 12 meetings.

The Governance and Nominating Committee is composed of Messrs. Lautenbach (Chair), Stavropoulos, and Wolfe.
The committee meets as called by the Chair. With respect to fund governance and board administration matters, the
committee periodically reviews procedures of the Board of Trustees and its committees (including committee charters) and
periodically reviews compensation of Independent Trustees. The committee monitors corporate governance matters and
makes recommendations to the Board of Trustees on the frequency and structure of the Board of Trustee meetings and on
any other aspect of Board procedures. It acts as the administrative committee under the retirement plan for Independent
Trustees who retired prior to December 30, 1996 and under the fee deferral plan for Independent Trustees. It reviews the
performance of legal counsel employed by the Fidelity funds and the Independent Trustees. On behalf of the Independent
Trustees, the committee will make such findings and determinations as to the independence of counsel for the Independent
Trustees as may be necessary or appropriate under applicable regulations or otherwise. The committee is also responsible
for Board administrative matters applicable to Independent Trustees, such as expense reimbursement policies and
compensation for attendance at meetings, conferences and other events. The committee monitors compliance with, acts as
the administrator of, and makes determinations in respect of, the provisions of the code of ethics and any supplemental
policies regarding personal securities transactions applicable to the Independent Trustees. The committee monitors the
functioning of each Board committee and makes recommendations for any changes, including the creation or elimination of
standing or ad hoc Board committees. The committee monitors regulatory and other developments to determine whether to
recommend modifications to the committee's responsibilities or other Trustee policies and procedures in light of rule
changes, reports concerning "best practices" in corporate governance and other developments in mutual fund governance.
The committee meets with Independent Trustees at least once a year to discuss matters relating to fund governance. The
committee recommends that the Board establish such special or ad hoc Board committees as may be desirable or necessary
from time to time in order to address ethical, legal, or other matters that may arise. The committee also oversees the annual
self-evaluation of the Board of Trustees and establishes procedures to allow it to exercise this oversight function. In
conducting this oversight, the committee shall address all matters that it considers relevant to the performance of the Board
of Trustees and shall report the results of its evaluation to the Board of Trustees, including any recommended amendments
to the principles of governance, and any recommended changes to the Fidelity funds' or the Board of Trustees' policies,
procedures, and structures. The committee reviews periodically the size and composition of the Board of Trustees as a
whole and recommends, if necessary, measures to be taken so that the Board of Trustees reflects the appropriate balance of
knowledge, experience, skills, expertise, and diversity required for the Board as a whole and contains at least the minimum
number of Independent Trustees required by law. The committee makes nominations for the election or appointment of
Independent Trustees and non-management Members of any Advisory Board, and for membership on committees. The
committee shall have authority to retain and terminate any third-party advisers, including authority to approve fees and
other retention terms. Such advisers may include search firms to identify Independent Trustee candidates and board
compensation consultants. The committee may conduct or authorize investigations into or studies of matters within the
committee's scope of responsibilities, and may retain, at the Fidelity funds' expense, such independent counsel or other
advisers as it deems necessary. The committee will consider nominees to the Board of Trustees recommended by
shareholders based upon the criteria applied to candidates presented to the committee by a search firm or other source.
Recommendations, along with appropriate background material concerning the candidate that demonstrates his or her
ability to serve as an Independent Trustee of the Fidelity funds, should be submitted to the Chair of the committee at the
address maintained for communications with Independent Trustees. If the committee retains a search firm, the Chair will
generally forward all such submissions to the search firm for evaluation. With respect to the criteria for selecting
Independent Trustees, it is expected that all candidates will possess the following minimum qualifications: (i) unquestioned
personal integrity; (ii) not an interested person of FMR or its affiliates within the meaning of the 1940 Act; (iii) does not have
a material relationship (e.g., commercial, banking, consulting, legal, or accounting) that could create an appearance of lack
of independence in respect of FMR and its affiliates; (iv) has the disposition to act independently in respect of FMR and its
affiliates and others in order to protect the interests of the funds and all shareholders; (v) ability to attend 11 meetings per
year; (vi) demonstrates sound business judgment gained through broad experience in significant positions where the
candidate has dealt with management, technical, financial, or regulatory issues; (vii) sufficient financial or accounting
knowledge to add value in the complex financial environment of the Fidelity funds; (viii) experience on corporate or other
institutional oversight bodies having similar responsibilities, but which board memberships or other relationships could not
result in business or regulatory conflicts with the funds; and (ix) capacity for the hard work and attention to detail that is
required to be an effective Independent Trustee in light of the Fidelity funds' complex regulatory, operational, and
marketing setting. The Governance and Nominating Committee may determine that a candidate who does not have the type
of previous experience or knowledge referred to above should nevertheless be considered as a nominee if the Governance
and Nominating Committee finds that the candidate has additional qualifications such that his or her qualifications, taken as
a whole, demonstrate the same level of fitness to serve as an Independent Trustee. During the fiscal year ended September
30, 2007, the committee held 10 meetings.

The Board of Trustees established the Compliance Committee (composed of Ms. Small (Chair), Ms. Knowles, and
Messrs. Stavropoulos and Wolfe) in May 2005. The committee normally meets quarterly, or more frequently as called by
the Chair. The committee oversees the administration and operation of the compliance policies and procedures of the
Fidelity funds and their service providers as required by Rule 38a-1 of the 1940 Act. The committee is responsible for the
review and approval of policies and procedures relating to (i) provisions of the Code of Ethics, (ii) anti-money laundering
requirements, (iii) compliance with investment restrictions and limitations, (iv) privacy, (v) recordkeeping, and (vi) other
compliance policies and procedures which are not otherwise delegated to another committee. The committee has
responsibility for recommending to the Board the designation of a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) of the Fidelity funds.
The committee serves as the primary point of contact between the CCO and the Board, it oversees the annual performance
review and compensation of the CCO, and if required, makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the removal of
the appointed CCO. The committee receives reports of significant correspondence with regulators or governmental
agencies, employee complaints or published reports which raise concerns regarding compliance matters, and copies of
significant non-routine correspondence with the SEC. The committee receives reports from the CCO including the annual
report concerning the funds' compliance policies as required by Rule 38a-1, quarterly reports in respect of any breaches of
fiduciary duty or violations of federal securities laws, and reports on any other compliance or related matters that may have a
significant impact on the funds. The committee will recommend to the Board, what actions, if any, should be taken with
respect to such reports. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, the committee held nine meetings.

The Proxy Voting Committee is composed of Messrs. Gamper (Chair), Dirks, and Keyes. The committee will meet as
needed to review the fund's proxy voting policies, consider changes to the policies, and review the manner in which the
policies have been applied. The committee will receive reports on the manner in which proxy votes have been cast under
the proxy voting policies and reports on consultations between the fund's investment advisers and portfolio companies
concerning matters presented to shareholders for approval. The committee will address issues relating to the fund's
annual voting report filed with the SEC. The committee will receive reports concerning the implementation of
procedures and controls designed to ensure that the proxy voting policies are implemented in accordance with their terms.
The committee will consider FMR's recommendations concerning certain non-routine proposals not covered by the
proxy voting policies. The committee will receive reports with respect to steps taken by FMR to assure that proxy voting
has been done without regard to any other FMR relationships, business or otherwise, with that portfolio company. The
committee will make recommendations to the Board concerning the casting of proxy votes in circumstances where FMR
has determined that, because of a conflict of interest, the proposal to be voted on should be reviewed by the Board. During
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, the committee held four meetings.

A  Reflects compensation received for the calendar year ended December 31, 2006 for 350 funds of 58 trusts (including
Fidelity Central Investment Portfolios LLC). Compensation figures include cash, amounts required to be deferred,
and may include amounts deferred at the election of Trustees. For the calendar year ended December 31, 2006, the

As of the public offering of shares of the fund, 100% of the fund's total outstanding shares was held by FMR or an FMR
affiliate. FMR LLC is the ultimate parent company of FMR and these FMR affiliates. By virtue of his ownership interest in
FMR LLC, as described in the "Control of Investment Advisers" section on page <Click Here>, Mr. Edward C. Johnson 3d,
Trustee, may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of these shares.

CONTROL OF INVESTMENT ADVISERS

FMR LLC, as successor by merger to FMR Corp., is the ultimate parent company of Fidelity Management & Research
(U.K.) Inc. (FMR U.K.), Fidelity Research & Analysis Company (FRAC), formerly known as Fidelity Management &
Research (Far East) Inc., and FMRC. The voting common shares of FMR LLC are divided into two series. Series B is held
predominantly by members of the Edward C. Johnson 3d family, directly or through trust and limited liability companies,
and is entitled to 49% of the vote on any matter acted upon by the voting common shares. Series A is held predominantly by
non-Johnson family member employees of FMR LLC and its affiliates and is entitled to 51% of the vote on any such matter.
The Johnson family group and all other Series B shareholders have entered into a shareholders' voting agreement under
which all Series B shares will be voted in accordance with the majority vote of Series B shares. Under the 1940 Act, control
of a company is presumed where one individual or group of individuals owns more than 25% of the voting securities of that
company. Therefore, through their ownership of voting common shares and the execution of the shareholders' voting
agreement, members of the Johnson family may be deemed, under the 1940 Act, to form a controlling group with respect to
FMR LLC.

At present, the primary business activities of FMR LLC and its subsidiaries are: (i) the provision of investment advisory,
management, shareholder, investment information and assistance and certain fiduciary services for individual and
institutional investors; (ii) the provision of securities brokerage services; (iii) the management and development of real
estate; and (iv) the investment in and operation of a number of emerging businesses.

Fidelity International Limited (FIL), a Bermuda company formed in 1968, is the ultimate parent company of Fidelity
International Investment Advisors (FIIA), Fidelity Investments Japan Limited (FIJ), and Fidelity International Investment
Advisors (U.K.) Limited (FIIA(U.K.)L). Edward C. Johnson 3d, Johnson family members, and various trusts for the benefit
of the Johnson family own, directly or indirectly, more than 25% of the voting common stock of FIL. At present, the primary
business activities of FIL and its subsidiaries are the provision of investment advisory services to non-U.S. investment
companies and private accounts investing in securities throughout the world.

FMRC, FMR U.K., FRAC, FIJ, FIIA, FIIA(U.K.)L (the Investment Advisers), and the fund have adopted codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-1 of the 1940 Act that set forth employees' fiduciary responsibilities regarding the fund, establish
procedures for personal investing, and restrict certain transactions. Employees subject to the codes of ethics, including
Fidelity investment personnel, may invest in securities for their own investment accounts, including securities that may be
purchased or held by the fund.

MANAGEMENT CONTRACT

The fund has entered into a management contract with FMRC, pursuant to which FMRC furnishes investment advisory
and other services.

Management Services. Under the terms of its management contract with the fund, FMRC acts as investment adviser
and, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees, has overall responsibility for directing the investments of the fund in
accordance with its investment objective, policies and limitations. FMRC also provides the fund with all necessary office
facilities and personnel for servicing the fund's investments, compensates all officers of the fund and all Trustees who are
interested persons of the trust or of FMR, and all personnel of the fund or FMRC performing services relating to research,
statistical and investment activities.

In addition, FMRC or its affiliates, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees, provide the management and
administrative services necessary for the operation of the fund. These services include providing facilities for maintaining
the fund's organization; supervising relations with custodians, transfer and pricing agents, accountants, underwriters and
other persons dealing with the fund; preparing all general shareholder communications and conducting shareholder
relations; maintaining the fund's records and the registration of the fund's shares under federal securities laws and making
necessary filings under state securities laws; developing management and shareholder services for the fund; and furnishing
reports, evaluations and analyses on a variety of subjects to the Trustees.

Management-Related Expenses. Under the terms of the fund's management contract, the fund pays all of its expenses
other than those specifically payable by FMRC. FMRC, either itself or through an affiliate, pays all fees associated with
transfer agent, pricing and bookkeeping, and securities lending services. Expenses payable by the fund include interest and
taxes, brokerage commissions (if any), fees and expenses of the Independent Trustees, legal expenses, fees of the custodian
and auditor, costs of registering shares under federal securities laws and making necessary filings under state securities
laws, expenses for typesetting, printing, and mailing proxy materials to shareholders and all other expenses of proxy
solicitations and shareholder meetings, the fund's proportionate share of insurance premiums, if any, and Investment
Company Institute dues, and such non-recurring expenses as may arise, including costs of any litigation to which the fund
may be a party, and any obligation it may have to indemnify its officers and Trustees with respect to litigation.

In addition, the fund has entered into an expense contract with FMRC and FMR under which FMR agrees to pay or
provide for the payment of the fund's operating expenses, other than the following: (i) interest and taxes; (ii) brokerage
commissions and other costs in connection with the purchase or sale of securities and other investment instruments; (iii) fees
and expenses of the Independent Trustees; (iv) custodian fees and expenses; and (v) any non-recurring or extraordinary
expenses.

Management Fee. For the services of FMRC under the management contract, FMR, on behalf of each fund, pays
FMRC a monthly management fee. For each fund (other than a fund for which FMRC serves as sub-adviser) that invests in
the fund in a given month, FMR pays FMRC a fee equal to 50% of the monthly management fee rate (including
performance adjustments, if any) that FMR receives from the investing fund, multiplied by the average net assets invested
by that fund in the fund for the month. The fee is reduced to reflect any expenses paid by FMR on behalf of an investing fund
pursuant to an all-inclusive fee management contract, but is not reduced to reflect any fee waivers or expense
reimbursements made by FMR.

FMR may, from time to time, voluntarily reimburse all or a portion of the fund's operating expenses (exclusive of
interest, taxes, certain securities lending costs, brokerage commissions, and extraordinary expenses), which is subject to
revision or discontinuance. FMR retains the ability to be repaid for these expense reimbursements in the amount that
expenses fall below the limit prior to the end of the fiscal year.

Expense reimbursements by FMRC will increase the fund's returns and yield, and repayment of the reimbursement by
the fund will lower its returns and yield.

Sub-Advisers - FIIA, FIIA(U.K.)L, and FIJ. On behalf of the fund, FMRC has entered into a master international
research agreement with FIIA. On behalf of the fund, FIIA, in turn, has entered into sub-research agreements with
FIIA(U.K.)L and FIJ. Pursuant to the research agreements, FMR may receive investment advice and research services
concerning issuers and countries outside the United States.

Under the terms of the master international research agreement, FMR pays FIIA an amount based on the fund's
international net assets relative to the international assets of other registered investment companies with which FMR has
management contracts. Under the terms of the sub-research agreements, FIIA pays FIIA(U.K.)L and FIJ an amount equal to
the administrative costs incurred in providing investment advice and research services for a fund.

Sub-Adviser - FRAC. On behalf of the fund, FMRC and FRAC have entered into a research agreement. Pursuant to
the research agreement, FRAC provides investment advice and research services on domestic issuers. The Board of
Trustees approved the new research agreement with FRAC on January 19, 2006.

sub-advisory agreement with FIIA(U.K.)L and FIJ. On behalf of the fund, FRAC has entered into a sub-advisory agreement
with FIJ. Pursuant to the sub-advisory agreements, FMRC may receive from the sub-advisers investment research and

Matthew Torrey leads the portfolio management of International Equity Central Fund and receives compensation for
his services. As of October 31, 2007, manager compensation generally consists of a fixed base salary determined
periodically (typically annually), a bonus, in certain cases, participation in several types of equity-based compensation
plans, and, if applicable, relocation plan benefits. A portion of the manager's compensation may be deferred based on
criteria established by FMR or at the election of the manager.

The manager's base salary is determined by level of responsibility and tenure at FMR or its affiliates. The primary
components of Mr. Torrey's bonus are based on (i) the general management of the international equity research group in
his role as Managing Director of Research, and (ii) the investment performance of FMR international equity funds and
accounts. Each component is calculated separately over the manager's tenure on those fund(s) and account(s) over a
measurement period that initially is contemporaneous with the manager's tenure, but that eventually encompasses
rolling periods of up to five years for the comparison to a benchmark index, and rolling periods of up to three years for the
comparison to a peer group. A smaller, subjective component of the manager's bonus is based on the manager's overall
contribution to management of FMR. The portion of the manager's bonus that is linked to the investment performance of
International Equity Central Fund is based on the pre-tax investment performance of the fund measured against the MSCI
EAFE Index (net MA tax), and the pre-tax investment performance of the fund within the Morningstar Foreign Large Cap
Growth, Foreign Large Cap Blend, Foreign Large Cap Value, Foreign Small/Mid Cap Growth, and Foreign Small/Mid
Cap Value Categories. The manager also is compensated under equity-based compensation plans linked to increases or
decreases in the net asset value of the stock of FMR LLC, FMR's parent company. FMR LLC is a diverse financial
services company engaged in various activities that include fund management, brokerage, retirement, and employer
administrative services. If requested to relocate their primary residence, managers also may be eligible to receive
benefits, such as home sale assistance and payment of certain moving expenses, under relocation plans for most full-time
employees of FMR LLC and its affiliates.

The manager's compensation plan may give rise to potential conflicts of interest. The manager's base pay tends to
increase with additional and more complex responsibilities that include increased assets under management and a portion
of the bonus relates to marketing efforts, which together indirectly link compensation to sales. When a manager takes
over a fund or an account, the time period over which performance is measured may be adjusted to provide a transition
period in which to assess the portfolio. The management of multiple funds and accounts (including proprietary accounts)
may give rise to potential conflicts of interest if the funds and accounts have different objectives, benchmarks, time
horizons, and fees as the manager must allocate his time and investment ideas across multiple funds and accounts. In
addition, a fund's trade allocation policies and procedures may give rise to conflicts of interest if the fund's orders do not
get fully executed due to being aggregated with those of other accounts managed by FMR or an affiliate. The manager
may execute transactions for another fund or account that may adversely impact the value of securities held by a fund.
Securities selected for other funds or accounts may outperform the securities selected for the fund. Managers may be
permitted to invest in the funds they manage, even if a fund is closed to new investors. Trading in personal accounts,
which may give rise to potential conflicts of interest, is restricted by a fund's Code of Ethics.

PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

The following Proxy Voting Guidelines were established by the Board of Trustees of the funds, after consultation with
Fidelity. (The guidelines are reviewed periodically by Fidelity and by the Independent Trustees of the Fidelity funds, and,
accordingly, are subject to change.)

I.  General Principles

  A.  Voting of shares will be conducted in a manner consistent with the best interests of mutual fund shareholders
as follows: (i) securities of a portfolio company will generally be voted in a manner consistent with the Proxy Voting
Guidelines; and (ii) voting will be done without regard to any other Fidelity companies' relationship, business or otherwise,
with that portfolio company.

  B.  The FMR Investment & Advisor Compliance Department votes proxies. In the event an Investment &
Advisor Compliance employee has a personal conflict with a portfolio company or an employee or director of a portfolio
company, that employee will withdraw from making any proxy voting decisions with respect to that portfolio company.
A conflict of interest arises when there are factors that may prompt one to question whether a Fidelity employee is acting
solely in the best interests of Fidelity and its customers. Employees are expected to avoid situations that could present
even the appearance of a conflict between their interests and the interests of Fidelity and its customers.

  C.  Except as set forth herein, FMR will generally vote in favor of routine management proposals.

  D.  Non-routine proposals will generally be voted in accordance with the guidelines.

  E.  Non-routine proposals not covered by the guidelines or involving other special circumstances will be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis with input from the appropriate FMR analyst or portfolio manager, as applicable, subject
to review by an attorney within FMR's General Counsel's office and a member of senior management within FMR's
Investment and Advisor Compliance Department. A significant pattern of such proposals or other special circumstances
will be referred to the Fund Board Proxy Voting Committee or its designee.

  F.  FMR will vote on shareholder proposals not specifically addressed by the guidelines based on an evaluation
of a proposal's likelihood to enhance the economic returns or profitability of the portfolio company or to maximize
shareholder value. Where information is not readily available to analyze the economic impact of the proposal, FMR will
generally abstain.

  G.  Many Fidelity Funds invest in voting securities issued by companies that are domiciled outside the United
States and are not listed on a U.S. securities exchange. Corporate governance standards, legal or regulatory requirements
and disclosure practices in foreign countries can differ from those in the United States. When voting proxies relating to
non-U.S. securities, FMR will generally evaluate proposals in the context of these guidelines, but FMR may, where
applicable and feasible, take into consideration differing laws and regulations in the relevant foreign market in determining
how to vote shares.

  H.  In certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, shareholders voting shares of a portfolio company may be restricted from
trading the shares for a period of time around the shareholder meeting date. Because such trading restrictions can hinder
portfolio management and could result in a loss of liquidity for a fund, FMR will generally not vote proxies in circumstances
where such restrictions apply. In addition, certain non-U.S. jurisdictions require voting shareholders to disclose current
share ownership on a fund-by-fund basis. When such disclosure requirements apply, FMR will generally not vote proxies in
order to safeguard fund holdings information.

  I.  Where a management-sponsored proposal is inconsistent with the guidelines, FMR may receive a company's
commitment to modify the proposal or its practice to conform to the guidelines, and FMR will generally support
management based on this commitment. If a company subsequently does not abide by its commitment, FMR will generally
withhold authority for the election of directors at the next election.

II.  Definitions (as used in this document)

  A.  Anti-Takeover Provision - includes fair price amendments; classified boards; "blank check" preferred stock;
golden and tin parachutes; supermajority provisions; Poison Pills; and any other provision that eliminates or limits
shareholder rights.

  B.  Golden parachute - accelerated options and/or employment contracts for officers and directors that will result
in a lump sum payment of more than three times annual compensation (salary and bonus) in the event of termination following
a change in control.

  C.  Tin parachute - accelerated options and/or employment contracts for employees beyond officers and
directors that will result in a lump sum payment in the event of termination.

  D.  Greenmail - payment of a premium to repurchase shares from a shareholder seeking to take over a company
through a proxy contest or other means.

  E.  Sunset provision - a condition in a charter or plan that specifies an expiration date.

  F.  Permitted Bid Feature - a provision suspending the application of a Poison Pill, by shareholder referendum,
in the event a potential acquirer announces a bona fide offer for all outstanding shares.

  G.  Poison Pill - a strategy employed by a potential take-over/target company to make its stock less attractive to
an acquirer. Poison Pills are generally designed to dilute the acquirer's ownership and value in the event of a take-over.

  H.  Large Capitalization Company - a company included in the Russell 1000® stock index.

  I.  Small Capitalization Company - a company not included in the Russell 1000 stock index that is not a
Micro-Capitalization Company.

  J.  Micro-Capitalization Company - a company with a market capitalization under US $300 million.

III.  Directors

  A.  Incumbent Directors

  FMR will generally vote in favor of incumbent and nominee directors except where one or more such
directors clearly appear to have failed to exercise reasonable judgment.

  FMR will also generally withhold authority for the election of all directors or directors on responsible
committees if:

  1. An Anti-Takeover Provision was introduced, an Anti-Takeover Provision was extended, or a new
Anti-Takeover Provision was adopted upon the expiration of an existing Anti-Takeover Provision, without shareholder
approval except as set forth below.

  With respect to Poison Pills, however, FMR will consider not withholding authority on the election of
directors if all of the following conditions are met when a Poison Pill is introduced, extended, or adopted:

  a. The Poison Pill includes a Sunset Provision of less than 5 years;

  b. The Poison Pill includes a Permitted Bid Feature;

  c. The Poison Pill is linked to a business strategy that will result in greater value for the shareholders; and

  d. Shareholder approval is required to reinstate the Poison Pill upon expiration.

  FMR will also consider not withholding authority on the election of directors when one or more of the
conditions above are not met if a board is willing to strongly consider seeking shareholder ratification of, or adding above
conditions noted a. and b. to an existing Poison Pill. In such a case, if the company does not take appropriate action prior to
the next annual shareholder meeting, FMR will withhold authority on the election of directors.

  2. The company refuses, upon request by FMR, to amend the Poison Pill to allow Fidelity to hold an aggregate
position of up to 20% of a company's total voting securities and of any class of voting securities.

  3. Within the last year and without shareholder approval, a company's board of directors or compensation
committee has repriced outstanding options.

  4. The company failed to act in the best interests of shareholders when approving executive compensation,
taking into account such factors as: (i) whether the company used an independent compensation committee; and (ii) whether
the compensation committee engaged independent compensation consultants; and (iii) whether it has been proven that the
company engaged in options backdating.

  5. To gain FMR's support on a proposal, the company made a commitment to modify a proposal or practice to
conform to these guidelines and the company has failed to act on that commitment.

  6. The director attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the board or its committees
on which the director served during the company's prior fiscal year, absent extenuating circumstances.

  B.  Indemnification

  FMR will generally vote in favor of charter and by-law amendments expanding the indemnification of
directors and/or limiting their liability for breaches of care unless FMR is otherwise dissatisfied with the performance of
management or the proposal is accompanied by Anti-Takeover Provisions.

  C.  Independent Chairperson

  FMR will generally vote against shareholder proposals calling for or recommending the appointment of a
non-executive or independent chairperson. However, FMR will consider voting for such proposals in limited cases if, based
upon particular facts and circumstances, appointment of a non-executive or independent chairperson appears likely to
further the interests of shareholders and to promote effective oversight of management by the board of directors.

  D.  Majority Director Elections

  FMR will generally vote in favor of proposals calling for directors to be elected by an affirmative majority of
votes cast in a board election, provided that the proposal allows for plurality voting standard in the case of contested
elections (i.e., where there are more nominees than board seats). FMR may consider voting against such shareholder
proposals where a company's board has adopted an alternative measure, such as a director resignation policy, that provides
a meaningful alternative to the majority voting standard and appropriately addresses situations where an incumbent director
fails to receive the support of a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election.

IV.  Compensation

  A.  Equity Award Plans (including stock options, restricted stock awards, and other stock awards).

  FMR will generally vote against Equity Award Plans or amendments to authorize additional shares under
such plans if:

  1. (a) The dilution effect of the shares outstanding and available for issuance pursuant to all plans, plus any
new share requests is greater than 10% for a Large Capitalization Company, 15% for a Small Capitalization Company or
20% for a Micro-Capitalization Company; and (b) there were no circumstances specific to the company or the plans that
lead FMR to conclude that the level of dilution in the plan or the amendments is acceptable.

  2. In the case of stock option plans, (a) the offering price of options is less than 100% of fair market value on
the date of grant, except that the offering price may be as low as 85% of fair market value if the discount is expressly granted
in lieu of salary or cash bonus; (b) the plan's terms allow repricing of underwater options; or (c) the board/committee has
repriced options outstanding under the plan in the past two years.

  3. The plan may be materially altered without shareholder approval, including increasing the benefits accrued
to participants under the plan; increasing the number of securities which may be issued under the plan; modifying the
requirements for participation in the plan; or including a provision allowing the Board to lapse or waive restrictions at its
discretion.

  4. Awards to non-employee directors are subject to management discretion.

  5. In the case of stock awards, the restriction period, or holding period after exercise, is less than 3 years for
non-performance-based awards, and less than 1 year for performance-based awards.

  FMR will consider approving an Equity Award Plan or an amendment to authorize additional shares under
such plan if, without complying with the guidelines immediately above, the following two conditions are met:

  1. The shares are granted by a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors; and

  2. The shares are limited to 5% (large capitalization company) and 10% (small capitalization company) of the
shares authorized for grant under the plan.

  B.  Equity Exchanges and Repricing

  FMR will generally vote in favor of a management proposal to exchange shares or reprice outstanding
options if the proposed exchange or repricing is consistent with the interests of shareholders, taking into account such
factors as:

  1. Whether the proposal excludes senior management and directors;

  2. Whether the equity proposed to be exchanged or repriced exceeded FMR's dilution thresholds when
initially granted;

  3. Whether the exchange or repricing proposal is value neutral to shareholders based upon an acceptable
pricing model;

  4. The company's relative performance compared to other companies within the relevant industry or
industries;

  5. Economic and other conditions affecting the relevant industry or industries in which the company
competes; and

  6. Any other facts or circumstances relevant to determining whether an exchange or repricing proposal is
consistent with the interests of shareholders.

  C.  Employee Stock Purchase Plans

  FMR will generally vote against employee stock purchase plans if the plan violates any of the criteria in
section IV(A) above, except that the minimum stock purchase price may be equal to or greater than 85% of the stock's fair
market value if the plan constitutes a reasonable effort to encourage broad based participation in the company's equity. In
the case of non-U.S. company stock purchase plans, FMR may permit a lower minimum stock purchase price equal to the
prevailing "best practices" in the relevant non-U.S. market, provided that the minimum stock purchase price must be at least
75% of the stock's fair market value.

  D.  Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)

  FMR will generally vote in favor of non-leveraged ESOPs. For leveraged ESOPs, FMR may examine the
company's state of incorporation, existence of supermajority vote rules in the charter, number of shares authorized for the
ESOP, and number of shares held by insiders. FMR may also examine where the ESOP shares are purchased and the
dilution effect of the purchase. FMR will generally vote against leveraged ESOPs if all outstanding loans are due
immediately upon change in control.

  E.  Executive Compensation

  FMR will generally vote against management proposals on stock-based compensation plans or other
compensation plans if such proposals are inconsistent with the interests of shareholders, taking into account such factors as:
(i) whether the company has an independent compensation committee; and (ii) whether the compensation committee has
authority to engage independent compensation consultants.

  F.  Bonus Plans and Tax Deductibility Proposals

  FMR will generally vote in favor of cash and stock incentive plans that are submitted for shareholder approval
in order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, provided that the plan
includes well defined and appropriate performance criteria, and with respect to any cash component, that the maximum
award per participant is clearly stated and is not unreasonable or excessive.

V.  Anti-Takeover Provisions

  FMR will generally vote against a proposal to adopt or approve the adoption of an Anti-Takeover Provision
unless:

  A.  The Poison Pill includes the following features:

  1. A sunset provision of no greater than 5 years;

  2. Linked to a business strategy that is expected to result in greater value for the shareholders;

  3. Requires shareholder approval to be reinstated upon expiration or if amended;

  4. Contains a Permitted Bid Feature; and

  5. Allows the Fidelity funds to hold an aggregate position of up to 20% of a company's total voting securities
and of any class of voting securities.

  B.  An Anti-Greenmail proposal that does not include other Anti-Takeover Provisions; or

  C.  It is a fair price amendment that considers a two-year price history or less.

  FMR will generally vote in favor of proposals to eliminate Anti-Takeover Provisions. In the case of proposals
to declassify a board of directors, FMR will generally vote against such a proposal if the issuer's Articles of Incorporation or
applicable statutes include a provision whereby a majority of directors may be removed at any time, with or without cause,
by written consent, or other reasonable procedures, by a majority of shareholders entitled to vote for the election of
directors.

VI.  Capital Structure/Incorporation

  A.  Increases in Common Stock

  FMR will generally vote against a provision to increase a Company's common stock if such increase will
result in a total number of authorized shares greater than 3 times the current number of outstanding and scheduled to be
issued shares, including stock options, except in the case of real estate investment trusts, where an increase that will result in
a total number of authorized shares up to 5 times the current number of outstanding and scheduled to be issued shares is
generally acceptable.

  B.  New Classes of Shares

  FMR will generally vote against the introduction of new classes of stock with differential voting rights.

  C.  Cumulative Voting Rights

  FMR will generally vote against the introduction and in favor of the elimination of cumulative voting rights.

  D.  Acquisition or Business Combination Statutes

  FMR will generally vote in favor of proposed amendments to a company's certificate of incorporation or
by-laws that enable the company to opt out of the control shares acquisition or business combination statutes.

  E.  Incorporation or Reincorporation in Another State or Country

  FMR will generally vote against shareholder proposals calling for or recommending that a portfolio company
reincorporate in the United States and vote in favor of management proposals to reincorporate in a jurisdiction outside the
United States if (i) it is lawful under United States, state and other applicable law for the company to be incorporated under
the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction and to conduct its business and (ii) reincorporating or maintaining a domicile in
the United States would likely give rise to adverse tax or other economic consequences detrimental to the interests of the
company and its shareholders. However, FMR will consider supporting such shareholder proposals and opposing such
management proposals in limited cases if, based upon particular facts and circumstances, reincorporating in or maintaining
a domicile in the relevant foreign jurisdiction gives rise to significant risks or other potential adverse consequences that
appear reasonably likely to be detrimental to the interests of the company or its shareholders.

VII.  Auditors

  A.  FMR will generally vote against shareholder proposals calling for or recommending periodic rotation of a
portfolio company's auditor. FMR will consider voting for such proposals in limited cases if, based upon particular facts and
circumstances, a company's board of directors and audit committee clearly appear to have failed to exercise reasonable
business judgment in the selection of the company's auditor.

  B.  FMR will generally vote against shareholder proposals calling for or recommending the prohibition or
limitation of the performance of non-audit services by a portfolio company's auditor. FMR will also generally vote against
shareholder proposals calling for or recommending removal of a company's auditor due to, among other reasons, the
performance of non-audit work by the auditor. FMR will consider voting for such proposals in limited cases if, based upon
particular facts and circumstances, a company's board of directors and audit committee clearly appear to have failed to
exercise reasonable business judgment in the oversight of the performance of the auditor for audit or non-audit services for
the company.

VIII. Shares of Investment Companies

  A.  When a Fidelity Fund invests in an underlying Fidelity fund, FMR will vote in the same proportion as all other
shareholders of such underlying fund or class ("echo voting").

  B.  Certain Fidelity Funds may invest in shares of Fidelity Central Funds. Central Fund shares, which are held
exclusively by Fidelity funds or accounts managed by an FMR affiliate, will be voted in favor of proposals recommended
by the Central Funds' Board of Trustees.

IX.  Other

  A.  Voting Process

  FMR will generally vote in favor of proposals to adopt confidential voting and independent vote tabulation
practices.

  B.  Regulated Industries

  Voting of shares in securities of any regulated industry (e.g. U.S. banking) organization shall be conducted in
a manner consistent with conditions that may be specified by the industry's regulator (e.g. the Federal Reserve Board) for a
determination under applicable law (e.g. federal banking law) that no Fund or group of Funds has acquired control of such
organization.

FMRC, either itself or through an affiliate, bears the cost of pricing and bookkeeping services and administering the
securities lending program under the terms of its management contract with the fund.

DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY

Company Organization. Fidelity International Equity Central Fund is a fund of Fidelity Central Investment Portfolios
LLC (the Company), an open-end management investment company organized as a limited liability company in Delaware
on September 15, 2004. The Company and the fund are subject to a Limited Liability Company Agreement dated
September 16, 2004 (Agreement). On November 29, 2006, Fidelity Specialized High Income Central Fund changed its
name from Fidelity Specialized High Income Central Investment Portfolio to Fidelity Specialized High Income Central
Fund. Currently, there are 14 funds offered in the Company: Fidelity Consumer Discretionary Central Fund, Fidelity
Consumer Staples Central Fund, Fidelity Energy Central Fund, Fidelity Financials Central Fund, Fidelity Floating Rate
Central Fund, Fidelity Health Care Central Fund, Fidelity High Income Central Fund 1, Fidelity Industrials Central Fund,
Fidelity Information Technology Central Fund, Fidelity International Equity Central Fund, Fidelity Materials Central
Fund, Fidelity Specialized High Income Central Fund, Fidelity Telecom Services Central Fund, and Fidelity Utilities
Central Fund. The Trustees are permitted to create additional funds in the Company and to create additional classes of the
fund.

The assets of the Company received for the issue or sale of shares of each fund and all income, earnings, profits, and
proceeds thereof, subject to the rights of creditors, are allocated to such fund, and constitute the underlying assets of such
fund. The underlying assets of each fund in the Company shall be charged with the liabilities and expenses attributable to
such fund. Any general expenses of the Company shall be allocated between or among any one or more of the funds. The
debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or otherwise existing with respect to a particular fund
shall be enforceable against the assets of that fund only, and not against the assets of any other fund.

Shareholder Liability. The Company is an entity known as a limited liability company organized under the laws of
Delaware. Under Delaware law, no shareholder of such a limited liability company can be held personally liable for the
obligations of the limited liability company.

The Agreement contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for the debts, liabilities, obligations, and
expenses of the Company or fund. The Agreement further provides that shareholders of a fund shall not have a claim on or
right to any assets belonging to any other fund.

The Agreement provides for indemnification out of the fund's property of any shareholder or former shareholder held
personally liable for the obligations of the fund solely by reason of his or her being or having been a shareholder and not
because of his or her acts or omissions or for some other reason. The Agreement also provides that the Company, on behalf of
the fund, shall, upon request, assume the defense of any claim made against any shareholder for any act or obligation of the
Company, on behalf of the fund, and satisfy any judgment thereon from the assets of the fund. FMR believes that, in view of
the above, the risk of personal liability to shareholders is remote.

Voting Rights. The fund's capital consists of shares of beneficial interest. As a shareholder, you are entitled to one vote
for each dollar of net asset value you own. The voting rights of shareholders can be changed only by a shareholder vote.
Shares may be voted in the aggregate, by fund, and by class.

The shares have no preemptive or conversion rights. Shares are fully paid and nonassessable.

The Company or a fund or a class may be terminated upon the sale of its assets to, or merger with, another open-end
management investment company, series, or class thereof, or upon liquidation and distribution of its assets. The Trustees
may reorganize, terminate, merge, or sell all or a portion of the assets of the Company or a fund or a class without prior
shareholder approval. In the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, shareholders of each of its funds are
entitled to receive the underlying assets of such fund available for distribution. In the event of the dissolution or liquidation
of a fund or a class, shareholders of that fund or that class are entitled to receive the underlying assets of the fund or class
available for distribution.

Custodians. JPMorgan Chase Bank, 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, is custodian of the assets of the fund. The
custodian is responsible for the safekeeping of the fund's assets and the appointment of any subcustodian banks and clearing
agencies. The Bank of New York, headquartered in New York, also may serve as a special purpose custodian of certain
assets in connection with repurchase agreement transactions.

FMR, its officers and directors, its affiliated companies, Members of the Advisory Board, and Members of the Board of
Trustees may, from time to time, conduct transactions with various banks, including banks serving as custodians for certain
funds advised by FMR. Transactions that have occurred to date include mortgages and personal and general business loans.
In the judgment of FMR, the terms and conditions of those transactions were not influenced by existing or potential
custodial or other fund relationships.

Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 125 High Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, independent registered public accounting firm, examines financial statements for the fund and provides other
audit, tax, and related services.

FUND HOLDINGS INFORMATION

The fund views holdings information as sensitive and limits its dissemination. The Board authorized FMR to establish
and administer guidelines for the dissemination of fund holdings information, which may be amended at any time without
prior notice. FMR's Disclosure Policy Committee (comprising executive officers of FMR) evaluates disclosure policy with
the goal of serving the fund's best interests by striking an appropriate balance between providing information about the
fund's portfolio and protecting the fund from potentially harmful disclosure. The Board reviews the administration and
modification of these guidelines and receives reports from the fund's chief compliance officer periodically.

The fund will provide a full list of holdings upon request as of the prior business day to all Fidelity registered investment
companies that are shareholders of the fund.

The fund may also from time to time provide specific fund level performance attribution information and statistics to the
Board or third parties, such as fund shareholders or prospective fund shareholders, members of the press, consultants, and
ratings and ranking organizations.

The Use of Holdings In Connection With Fund Operations. Material non-public holdings information may be
provided as part of the investment activities of the fund to: entities which, by explicit agreement or by virtue of their
respective duties to the fund, are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed; other parties if legally
required; or persons FMR believes will not misuse the disclosed information. These entities, parties, and persons include:
the fund's trustees; the fund's manager, its sub-advisers and their affiliates whose access persons are subject to a code of
ethics; contractors who are subject to a confidentiality agreement; the fund's auditors; the fund's custodians; proxy voting
service providers; financial printers; pricing service vendors; broker-dealers in connection with the purchase or sale of
securities or requests for price quotations or bids on one or more securities; securities lending agents; counsel to the fund or
its Independent Trustees; regulatory authorities; stock exchanges and other listing organizations; parties to litigation; and
third-parties in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding relating to a fund holding. Non-public holdings information may
also be provided to an issuer regarding the number or percentage of its shares that are owned by a fund and in connection
with redemptions in kind.

Other Uses Of Holdings Information. In addition, the fund may provide material non-public holdings information to
(i) third-parties that calculate information derived from holdings for use by FMR or its affiliates, (ii) third parties that supply
their analyses of holdings (but not the holdings themselves) to their clients (including sponsors of retirement plans or their
consultants), (iii) ratings and rankings organizations, and (iv) an investment adviser, trustee, or their agents to whom
holdings are disclosed for due diligence purposes or in anticipation of a merger involving the fund. Each individual request
is reviewed by the Disclosure Policy Committee which must find, in its sole discretion that, based on the specific facts and
circumstances, the disclosure appears unlikely to be harmful to the fund. Entities receiving this information must have in
place control mechanisms to reasonably ensure or otherwise agree that, (a) the holdings information will be kept
confidential, (b) no employee shall use the information to effect trading or for their personal benefit, and (c) the nature and
type of information that they, in turn, may disclose to third-parties is limited. FMR relies primarily on the existence of
non-disclosure agreements and/or control mechanisms when determining that disclosure is not likely to be harmful to the
fund.

At this time, the entities receiving information described in the preceding paragraph are: Factset Research Systems Inc.
(full or partial fund holdings daily, on the next business day); Thomson Vestek (full holdings, as of the end of the calendar
quarter, 15 calendar days after the calendar quarter-end); Standard & Poor's Rating Services (full holdings weekly
(generally as of the previous Friday), generally 5 business days thereafter); Moody's Investors Service (full holdings
monthly, (generally as of the last Friday of each month), generally the first Friday of the following month); and Anacomp
Inc. (full or partial holdings daily, on the next business day).

FMR, its affiliates, or the fund will not enter into any arrangements with third-parties from which they derive
consideration for the disclosure of material non-public holdings information. If, in the future, FMR desired to make such an
arrangement, it would seek prior Board approval and any such arrangements would be disclosed in the fund's SAI.

There can be no assurance that the fund's policies and procedures with respect to disclosure of fund portfolio holdings
will prevent the misuse of such information by individuals and firms that receive such information.

Item 24.  Companies Controlled by or under Common Control with this Company



  The Board of Directors of the Company serve in a similar capacity as the Board of
Trustees of other Fidelity funds, each of which has Fidelity Management & Research
Company, or an affiliate, as its investment adviser. In addition, the officers of the Company
are substantially identical to those of the other Fidelity funds.  Nonetheless, the Company
takes the position that it is not under common control with other Fidelity funds because the
power residing in the respective boards and officers arises as the result of an official position
with the respective companies.

Item 25.  Indemnification

  Pursuant to Del. Code Ann. title 6 § 18-108, a Delaware limited liability
company may provide in its limited liability company agreement for the
indemnification of its officers, members, managers or other persons from and
against any and all claims and demands whatsoever. Article X, Section 10.03 of the
Limited Liability Company Agreement sets forth the reasonable and fair means for
determining whether indemnification shall be provided to any past or present
Director or officer. It states that the Company shall indemnify any present or past
director or officer to the fullest extent permitted by law against liability, and all
expenses reasonably incurred or paid by him or her in connection with any claim,
action, suit or proceeding in which he or she is involved by virtue of his or her
service as a director or officer and against any amount incurred or paid in settlement
thereof. Indemnification will not be provided to a person adjudged by a court or
other adjudicatory body to be liable to the Company or its members by reason of
willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of his or her
duties (collectively, "disabling conduct"), or not to have acted in good faith in the
reasonable belief that his or her action was in the best interest of the Company. In
the event of a settlement or other disposition of a proceeding without an
adjudication by a court or other adjudicatory body that such person was liable to the
Company or its members by reason of his or her disabling conduct, no
indemnification may be provided unless there has been a determination, as specified
in the Limited Liability Company Agreement, that the officer or director did not
engage in disabling conduct.

  Pursuant to the agreement by which Fidelity Investments Institutional
Operations Company, Inc. ("FIIOC") is appointed transfer agent, the Registrant
agrees to indemnify and hold FIIOC harmless against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) resulting
from:

  (1)  any claim, demand, action or suit brought by any person other than
the Registrant, including by a shareholder, which names FIIOC and/or the Registrant
as a party and is not based on and does not result from FIIOC's willful misfeasance,
bad faith or negligence or reckless disregard of duties, and arises out of or in
connection with FIIOC's performance under the Transfer Agency Agreement; or

  (2)  any claim, demand, action or suit (except to the extent contributed to
by FIIOC's willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence or reckless disregard of
duties) which results from the negligence of the Registrant, or from FIIOC's acting
upon any instruction(s) reasonably believed by it to have been executed or

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.


Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.



Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



          1. Fidelity's goal is to make financial expertise broadly accessible and effective in helping people live the lives they want. With assets under administration of $6.2 trillion, including managed assets of $2.2 trillion as of May 31, 2017, we focus on meeting the unique needs of a diverse set of customers: helping more than 26 million people invest their own life savings, nearly 23,000 businesses manage employee benefit programs, as well as providing nearly 12,500 advisory firms with technology solutions to invest their own clients' money.
	
    

          2. RMDs do not apply to investments in Roth IRAs or taxable accounts.
	
    

          3.
	
	
	       Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Fidelity reserves the right to change the funds available without transaction fees and reinstate the fees on any funds. Fidelity will charge a short term trading fee each time you sell or exchange shares of FundsNetwork No Transaction Fee (NTF) funds held less than 60 days (short-term trade).
