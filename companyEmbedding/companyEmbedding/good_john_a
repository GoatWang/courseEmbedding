Products for Good - Military gift of a lifetime
"I gave my husband the shadowbox and, after we both cried, he spoke to me for the first time about his military service. It was magical. Thank you so much"
We are also proud that all our products are assembled at Cleveland Vocational Industries who employ disabled workers with mental and physical challenges – many with Down Syndrome. This truly adds meaning to our mission of helping military families.
"The gift was great. But knowing disabled workers assembled it made it that much more special..."
The best part of our programs is the overwhelming response. We truly believed we found a unique way to find the best gifts for those who have served. Thousands of notes continue to flood our offices with customer testimonials thanking us for selling them our military gifts.

Every Gift Has a Story


        Thank you so much for all you do for our military. Sometimes words are not enough to show your appreciation for those who fight to protect us. My father is 73 years old and served in the Marines and Air Force. I was trying to think of something to give him for Father’s Day when I realized I had never said thank you for protecting me and my rights even before he knew my mother.

JOHN'S STORY



Feel Good About Looking Good
John Masters Organics provides the finest in luxury organic beauty products to customers around the world. Founded by visionary stylist John Masters in his Soho, New York salon, John Masters Organics is synonymous with premium quality, earth-friendly botanical ingredients and the ultimate in professional salon-level results. Each and every product is painstakingly crafted to let you “feel good about looking good.”
Our Founder
A Niagara Falls, NY native, John Masters’s career as a top stylist skyrocketed in the 1970s, with widespread recognition in fashion and celebrity circles. But as his dedication to organics grew in his personal life, he began to realize the perils posed by inhaling and handling harsh chemicals in the salon day after day. He became committed to creating a toxin-free salon environment, and renounced the use of toxic chemicals to open Manhattan’s first “clean-air” salon to wide acclaim.
He also began extensive research and testing of essential oils, plant extracts and other botanical ingredients to produce his first organic haircare products in 1991. “Caring about yourself and caring about the earth don’t have to be mutually exclusive,” John says, “We only get one body and we only get one planet. Why not treat them both with the utmost care?” His singular dedication to professional salon-quality performance in products crafted with care and respect for the Earth has blossomed into a full line of incomparable hair, skin, and body products.
Super Natural Beauty
Today John Masters Organics is sold around the world, and is recognized as the pioneering producer of luxury organic beauty. Through partnerships with farmers and harvesters of organic and wild-crafted ingredients, and dedication to using 100% recyclable packaging and earth-friendly production methods, John Masters Organics produces the ultimate in “guilt-free luxury”. That commitment to seeking the highest standards of quality, performance, and organic certification is how John Masters Organics brings super natural beauty to you.

                Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers design partner John Maeda talks to McKinsey’s Hugo Sarrazin about why today’s senior executives must understand design.
            


























Video 



Design was once largely about making products more attractive. Today, it’s a way of thinking: a creative process that spans entire organizations, driven by the desire to better understand and meet consumer needs. In this conversation, McKinsey director Hugo Sarrazin and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers design partner and former president of the Rhode Island School of Design, John Maeda, discuss how design has moved from the drafting table to the boardroom—and all functions in between. An edited transcript of their remarks follows.
Interview transcript

Hugo Sarrazin: You have been around design for a long time, and it means so many things for so many different folks. You looked at it from different angles—from the technical, from the arts, and from leading a great design school, the Rhode Island School of Design. How do you define what design is today? And what should executives think about?

John Maeda: The word “design” has a very simple definition: good design is good business. This came from T. J. Watson Jr., in a 1966 memo to all of IBM.1 1.
For more on IBM’s view of design, see “Good design is good business,” ibm.com.
  Certain kinds of design have strategic value. It has a multiplier effect. It is design that can be instrumented, and then design where the process is changing because you are now saving time. And saving time is saving money.

Hugo Sarrazin: A question I get a lot is, Why now? Why is design so important now? And why is it a C-suite type of topic?

John Maeda: Moore’s law’s efficacy is dwindling. We have enough processing power, therefore we aren’t driven to buy it because it’s faster or has more memory. So now we have to buy it because of how it makes us feel. But not only that—Steve Jobs died. And that was a big deal.

I remember the day he died, I got an email from John Hockenberry of [New York public-radio station] WNYC at 4:00 AM: “Steve Jobs died. People want to know what this design thing he did was.” I remember that moment. I was on the radio at 5:00 AM on NPR.2 2.
National Public Radio.
  I realized no one really knew what this thing was that Jobs had marketed as being “magical design,” and they wanted to understand it. So Moore’s law is dwindling—and that big moment. That’s what’s catapulted all this here.

Hugo Sarrazin: And I’d add a few other things. One is that the advent of mobile is fundamentally changing the need to think about design, the interaction, and the experience in a substantive way. The last one is that we just have a new generation of folks who are being trained on this. And I think that’s good.

It doesn’t mean that immediately the C-suite people are going to wake up and say, “This is important.” It’s just that you now have expectations of solving problems differently, and that is now embedded in both how they got educated and also what they’re using in terms of products out there.
Great expectations for design 

Hugo Sarrazin: I do think we have a danger. The expectations are that the only way to create value is a Steve Jobs–type of moment.

John Maeda: Whenever someone has come to me asking for the silver bullet, I say, “There’s only a silver ray. And you have to know where to point it. And you might get lucky.”

Hugo Sarrazin: Well, the other thing, too, that we often get is impatience: “sprinkle that design dust and magic will happen.” It’s just the wrong way to think about the problem. I think design is a mind-set. It’s a set of capabilities and skills. It does require an environment to flourish. It requires people to work in a collaborative way that is different than it’s been historically. So just thinking that sprinkling a bunch of magic design dust—and you’re quickly going to get to a new product, a new experience—is a bit naive.

John Maeda: I talk to a lot of start-ups. And I was talking to a CEO who was formerly a doctor. I love CEOs who come up a weird path. He was a medical professional doctor—a real doctor—but he’s very curious about design. So he retained some design firm early on; he’s very curious about how it all works.

Now he’s about to release his product—and everyone’s telling him to gamify, to social, this, that, whatever. He asked me what I thought. I usually do not offer my opinion, because I’m always concerned that it will cause the wrong effect. But in this case, I had to offer my opinion, which was, “Just because you can do it doesn’t mean you should do it.” If you think about design adding value, a lot of what people don’t understand is that sometimes the best design consultants will tell you not to design it.
Measuring design’s worth

John Maeda: One thing I’ve noticed is that—so now we assume that because usage patterns have changed design is important because it can’t be bad anymore—that funny word “measurement” comes in. How do I measure if it’s good or not? How do you approach that?

Hugo Sarrazin: I’m going to make the question even broader. We’ve forever questioned, “What’s the return on investment on design?” That is an incredibly, incredibly difficult question, and it’s not unlike, “How do you measure the value of a brand?” So I’m going to give you two things.

One is you can instrument your design more so today. And because you have more ability to measure, you can see if it’s being used. You can receive feedback on what is being used, how it’s being used, and that kind of stuff. So that’s one dimension that is very, very, very different. And in a world where we’re going to have so much data, it’s going to allow you to measure good design versus bad design.

The second is I think we’re changing the way to even land on the design. You can do a whole lot more rapid prototyping iteration at a scale that is very different.
Connecting design to the business

Hugo Sarrazin: As a large company, you think about applying design principles, design thinking. What do you see as some of the challenges and some of the ways that seem to work better?

John Maeda: Well, I had the good luck of getting to work with John Donahoe on the eBay companies,3 3.
John Donahoe was president and CEO of eBay from March 2008 to July 2015. For more on eBay, see Michelle Angier and Beth Axelrod, “Realizing the power of talented women,” McKinsey Quarterly, September 2014; and “PayPal’s vision for a global marketplace,” August 2014.
  through Brian Chesky.4 4.
Brian Chesky is the cofounder and CEO of Airbnb. For more, see “The future of Airbnb in cities,” November 2014.
  He wanted to find someone who could help him as CEO, to get his design function working at a different rate and scale. And so I showed up, and the first thing I did was I didn’t overpromise. I said, “I don’t think I’m going to be able to do anything. OK, let’s set expectations low.”

What I did is, I understood that the only challenge you have, for organizations at scale, is that culture is hard to create because you’re busy. What I observed is that the designers were all spread out, and they couldn’t see each other. So I connected all of them together, all 380-something of them, into one community that could see each other. And the CEO could see them. I remember John saying, “Oh, so design isn’t about this pixels thing. It’s about systems thinking.” I’m a systems thinker. “Oh, so it isn’t just about the appearance.” He totally got it, and all the designers would see him get it. It’s that moment where a leader gets to lead. So I saw that happen. It took a year. It’s not going to be a GSB5 5.
Stanford Graduate School of Business.
  case study. But if you can just get that to happen in an authentic way—

Hugo Sarrazin: So it’s getting the right people together, creating the sense of community. It’s also reframing what it is.

John Maeda: Reframing, exactly.

         Ethnic Specific: Which White Products are Good for Black Hair?                                   toggle menu          Be The Boss Kids Edition   She's the Boss                            WATCH MORE           WATCH MORE       Ethnic Specific: Which White Products are Good for Black Hair?             October 25, 2011  |  By Stacie Forrest     40 Comments               1 of 6TV and print advertisements are loaded with product promotion in the beauty industry as it has to be – how else are we going to learn about the latest and greatest mascara and dark spot corrector? Because hair is our greatest accessory, hair products are equally important, each promising to do something great for our coifs like provide better nourishment, shiny hair and prevention of split ends.We can pretty much gauge which make- up products complement our deeper hued skin tone, but hair products can take a bit more research. Gone are the days when we relied solely on Ultra Sheen and Luster’s Pink Oil Moisturizer. Today’s hair care market is saturated with styling tools and remedies guaranteed to revitalize dull, lifeless hair; and interestingly enough the products offering and delivering some of the best results are products made by and for our European brothers and sisters. There is no doubt that some of my best-tressed sister girls rely on some of these hair care staples:PANTENEThis tried and true product is sensitive to the needs of African-American hair, so much so, they introduced the Relaxed & Natural line just for us. A leader in the industry for promotion of strong, healthy hair, this shower stall staple has delivered the best in at home hair care for all ethnicities.WENThat’s no typo. The WEN hair care system is creating quite a buzz in the African American community. Their approach is simple: take away the extra; the perfumes, dyes and all the other harsh ingredients that can strip hair of its natural oils and moisture – and you’re left with frizz-free, soft and shiny hair. Stylist Sherry Miles says this: “One of my every week clients went away on vacation for three weeks, and to be honest with you, I was really worried about what kind of condition her hair would be in when she returned; but it was if she never left! I was convinced that she had her hair done while she was away, until I used the product on my own hair. I now use it in my salon.”GARNIER NUTRISSEOnce, when she was low on color and her favorite beauty supply space was closed, my mother and veteran hair stylist Brenda Forrest had to make a mad dash to the local drug store to find a replacement and now, four years later, Garnier Nutrisse has become her brand of choice. “The conditioners are so rich and I was so impressed with how well it covered my client’s gray.” Apparently the grapeseed and avocado oil really sets this product apart, because not only does it deliver amazing coverage and true tonal value, but women have actually seen hair texture and overall hair condition dramatically improve.AVEDAAveda does everything well. From skin care to hair care and everything in between, the Aveda brand has staying power and has proven to be a leader in the industry. Using only plant-derived ingredients, this brand was built on an environment conscious platform, creating products that had zero impact on the Earth’s climate. As one of the first sustainable hair care companies, Aveda maintains is commitment to provide exceptional hair care using cutting edge, all natural methods. We love the Shampure, Damage Remedy Daily Hair Repair, Smooth Infusion Style Prep and Smoother and of course, the Brilliance Emollient Finishing Gloss.JOHN FRIEDAKnown for his anti-frizz products, John Frieda has a serum, pomade and crème for every type of hair. His products repel humidity, define curl and add tremendous volume. Many naturalistas use his line to keep their fros fresh while others swear by it for the ultimate in weave care maintenance. “I tell all of my weave clients that John Frieda is the best product to use in between hair appointments,” says weaveologist Lisa McKasey.More on Madame Noire!Woman to Woman: You’ve got the powerThe Scent of A Woman: Signature Scents He’ll LoveRihanna Reveals Her “Rebelle”7 Reasons He’s Not Ready To Tie the KnotThe Definition of a Mean GirlEight Things You Shouldn’t Buy On-Line    PREVIOUS NEXT PAGE   1 of 6   123456               Trending on MadameNoire            View Comments   Comment Disclaimer: Comments that contain profane or derogatory language, video links or exceed 200 words will require approval by a moderator before appearing in the comment section.

Pingback: Simple Hairstyles For Wavy Curly Hair | Simple Hairstyles Ideas()   Pingback: Tips On How To Make Curly Hair Look Good | Hairstyle Ideas for Curly Hair()     Beautifully Black    What exactly is . . . Ethnic???      Nicole Jazzette Johnson    I’m not adverse to supporting Black owned companies but they’re pricing themselves out of the market for average and below income brackets. I mean really $20+ dollars for less than 8 oz of curl puddings, hair cream etc… a bit ridiculous and hard to choose them when something equitable can be found for less and works well.      Nicole Jazzette Johnson    I’m glad to hear that I’m not alone regarding Pantene. It made my hair hard, dry and brittle which was soo far from normal that I tossed it immediately and went back to a different store further away to get what I normally use. So much for saving myself time and gas. SMH      Jane    Now I lost trust from the very beginning in this article the moment they put Pantene first because everyone I have ever talked to about washing my hair have said-NO to PANTENE. It has sulfates which are harsh and strip your hair’s nutrients, protein, and moisture and ultimately weaken your hair. My aunt, cousin, every hair dresser I ever had, multiple online forums, and actual research into the affects of sulfates on the hair have made me realize that PANTENE was not great for black hair.      Nadegeous    Last time I used Pantene, I looked like a Barbie that’s been carried around in dirt for 7 years…My hair were all dried up and so lifeless they had a tint of grey. They were hard as plastic. Never again.

Their haircare line is formulated with only natural and organic ingredients. Their Juicy Leave In Conditioner keeps my natural hair moist for several days at a time. This company is awesome and I love supporting black owned businesses.       Sistergirlintx    I’m just started using WEN.  I love it.  It makes my natural hair so soft and easy to comb.  Excellent product I have all my friends and family using it now.      Clare Claymore    I love JOHN FRIEDA products. I’m using the straight fixation smoothing creme on my  hair and it’s awesome. No white flakes and no breakouts along the hair line. #hair      NinaE27    Whatever happened to being entitled to your opinion…good gracious and I'm assuming that all of us here are black women? Wow! So much for the encourgement….       Leslove 21    Wow! Alot of these comments are so negative!!! I don't think that the writer was trying to "push" any product on anyone – just expressing an opinion of perhaps what she herself or stylists or other consumers may have used. If you don't like the products and they don't work for you, that's okay. There are a few products in this list I agree with, a few I don't. But c'mon, don't be mean and the majority of these comments are mean.       Elise    Um, actually these products ARE being pushed on you. Proctor and Gamble makes Pantene, Proctor and Gamble pay for advertising Tide Detergent on this site, you don’t think this isn’t advertising too?!?!?!? HELLO WAKE UP. Black people, white people, GREEN PEOPLE (anyone who has money) is susceptible to brainwashing if you don’t think for yourselves.    Pingback: The “Precious” Effect: Black Women and Weight Problems()     KISSING UP    This article is one big commercial for chemicals that aren't good for anybody's hair: silicones, ammonia, waxes, etc. Take a tip from Grandma – wash with Prell and coconut oil, egg and honey or just VO5 conditioner. Rinse with vinegar & water. Then oil with coconut, olive or jojoba oil. Use henna, indigo and honey to adjust color. Plus you'll live longer.       lynnemery    This article saying WEN doesn't have perfumes in them is incorrect. WEN products do contain perfume, so if you're like me and allergic to fragrance pass those up!       ANJELA    THE LIST IS FINE YA'LL BUT PLEASE REMEMBER TO SUPPORT THE BLACK OWNED NATURAL HAIR PRODUCT COMPANIES, LIKE KINKY CURLY, AFRO VEDA, UNCLE FUNKY'S DAUGHTER, AND MY HONEY CHILD! LET'S TRY TO SUPPORT BLACK BUSINESSES! THE PRODUCTS I MENTIONED ARE EXCELLENT AND REALLY SAVED MY NATURAL HAIR!!       Amc    Will support our black owned natural hair product companies if they stay true to having natural ingredients only. Why are companies such as Miss Jessies, Taliah Waajid and a few others putting harmful chemicals in their supposed natural products? And charging an arm and a leg.      Jessica Lucinda Williams    and not to mention the cost! especially Miss Jessies. i have three daughters (thick and long hair) hair to do plus my own, i will be broke trying to support Miss Jessies.       Rosie    Amen to that! My mom and I have used Miss Jesse’s crap and it dried the hell out of our hair. Same with Wen. Just tried a new company called Soultanicals and I am hooked. All Natural, leaves my hair soft, and Black owned. Shea Moisture is really good as well.      GIRLA    I would love to support Black Owned companies but why are they so high though? I want my hair to be healthy but I’m balling on a college student budget. Therefore, I have to use products that fit my budget…      crystal    Okay so when I saw the title of this article my first thought was “who has paid them to advertise these products?”…Only product I know to be good for my hair is WEN, the rest can kick rocks.       jjac401    Crystal – I am a natural sista and you are right about WEN! WEN is the truth!       SimplyRessy    Hey, can you give me more information on Wen? I’m going natural (haven’t permed in 6 months) I’m considering using wen but still indecisive. Any suggestions?      feri    John Frieda is the truth. Salon quality but drug store (ok a little higher than most drug store) prices. Too bad its not all natural. I always get compliments on how shiny and bouncy my hair is. I like that their products keep my hair moisturized but not too greasy and weighed down. Another good product for curls/kinks is head and shoulders 2 in 1 moisturizing shampoo. I don't have dandruff but I use it because the shampoo actually has conditioner in it so it doesn't strip my hair but it leaves it feeling really clean and moisturized than I use a john freida conditioner and styling products       LaLaLaMeansILoveYou    Wait a minute, I'm confused now. Since going natural, I've been reading a lot on what's good and what's not good for natural hair. Most of the things that I've read (some even on this website) say that any hair products that contain alcohol, sulfates, and petrolatum are NOT good for our hair. Which leads me to the question, how did Pantene (yes, even the line they created supposedly for "us") make #1 on this list? I was in the store not even a month ago with their shampoo and conditioner in my cart, because they packaged it all nice and shiny and boasted "naturals" on the front…then I read the list of ingredients and guess which product had ALL 3 of them in it? Exactly. Ladies, we have to stop trusting these websites and magazines (Essence had a similar rave review of Pantene's R&N products) that SUPPOSEDLY have our best interests at heart when in reality they are most likely being paid in some way from these companies to push theses harmful products on us because they know that we trust them and are too lazy to do the research for ourselves. To the author of this article, may I suggest next time doing better research on the products you push on us.       bbsinclair    Some people like pantene. Some don't. My natural sister's hair thrives on pantene, my natural hair doesn't. Every natural doesn't follow the same rules and buy the same products. This site is for entertainment with basic info. You should take it as such. What's good for the goose is good may not be good for the gander. Buy what you like and let others do the same. I for one use products with mineral oils and have had better growth/moisture retention (mineral oil stops water from escaping). Maybe consider that the author has to write broad articles for all readers? If you don't like. Product fine. But someone else might.       Jessica Lucinda Williams    Amen!! I for one believe that if it keeps my hair from breaking off, i’ll use it. that “B&B hair grease has mineral oil and it keeps my hair from breaking. maybe it breaks someone elses, but i haven’t had that experience.       Elise    You’re right. I’ve done TONS (read:hours and hours) of research about products that are good for our hair and the crap in pantene is NOT good. Pantene is made by Proctor and Gamble- which also makes TIDE Detergent- please look to the sides of this blog and tell me you don’t see Tide detergent ads right now.BOOM$ is everything. the end. don’t believe everything you’re told, everyone has a motive.      Lyla Maroon    I just saw a tide ad right now, if Pantene is dangerous why is it still on the market?more people have curls kinks and waves not straight hair but yet again most products are for fine hair. That is not fair      cheekee baby    There leave in conditioner is great. Most products on the market have these harmful ingredients. This article does not claim to offer natural 100% healthy hair care products for our hair (hello they’re touting a box dye) but if homegirl is in her local Wal-mart with no more than $20 to spend on her hair care products and doesn’t have hours to boil, blend, and grow her own natural stuff this list would help her out.

            This really makes you reexamine your ideas and perception of what is only good and not of God.  This book is very informative and a must read for everyone who claims to be a Christian and are constantly being busy with things they believe are good, but not of God.

            I enjoyed this book immensely. This was a good read I even purchased a couple copies for some of my friends. This book help open my eyes to what should be God's good in our life. I encourage everyone who name the name of Christ to read this book to get a refreshed perspective on who we are and what our purpose is in this life. God's good is much better than the what the world (or the enemy) says is good.

            It's not easy to read, he uses all the "New" translations and I'm not excited about it.  sometimes it seem almost like double talk.

            This book should be MANDATORY reading for every believer.  John expounded on every point my Pastor has been preaching and now I understand clearly why it is so important for Jesus to be my LORD and not just my Savior!


Thank you John Bevere.

            It causes you to sit back and rethink and reevaluate what you truly believe.
