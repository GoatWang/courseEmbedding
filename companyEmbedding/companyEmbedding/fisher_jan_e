Spray and Fuse - Fisher Products LLC



































Spray and Fuse
The spray and fuse method is by far the most 
							commonly used technique for hard surfacing. It is a 
							method by which powdered metal alloys are forced 
							through an oxyacetylene gun-type torch. The powder 
							is melted and the propelled in a molten state at the 
							part's surface.

Yields an instant solidification and a 
								mechanical bond between the coating and 
								substrate. The coating is then fused to the 
								substrate to obtain a permanent molecular bond.
Normally recommended for new and not 
								salvaged, worn parts because of the high 
								temperatures attained in the fusing process (1,900°F 
								to 2,200°F) may cause warpage.
Is more 
								economical to apply than rod-welded or plasma 
								coatings because of the application's rapidity 
								and the coating's controllable thickness.
Has its limitations with coating thicknesses. 
								Overlays up to 1/16" (0.0625") can be applied 
								without extreme difficulty. But thicknesses 
								greater than 1/16" require special attention 
								and, generally, a higher cost.

Plasma Transferred Arc - Fisher Products LLC



































Plasma Transferred Arc
Stellite Starweld 400 PTA
Plasma Transferred Arc (PTA) is an overlay 
							welding process with deposits that are homogenous 
							and fused to the substrate, forming a metallurgical 
							bond.
Plasma Transferred Arc makes use of a constricted 
							arc and powdered alloy, which is carried from a feeder 
							to the plasma torch in a stream of argon gas. The powder 
							is then directed away from the torch into the effluent 
							arc, where it is melted and fused to the base metal.

In a single, rapid pass, produces deposits 
								between 0.025" and 0.250" thick, and allows 
								close control of penetration.

NOTE: A single pass, however, 
							commonly results in a 5% to 20% dilution of the 
							substrate in the deposit - a dilution that will 
							generally weaken the hardness range of the coating 
							by 5RC. Therefore, many design-engineers specify a 
							two-pass minimum, with the added requirement that 
							not less than half of the second pass be machined 
							away.
* Includes a variety of nickel-base, cobalt-base 
							and iron-base alloy powders.

In 2013 while undergoing rehabilitation for major back surgery Mr Fisher was approached by a women who due to the recent amputation of her leg became dependent on her Powered  wheelchair to complete daily activities. She shared a frightening story that one day while crossing a busy street in an area of Pittsburgh called East Liberty she found her self caught in the midst of a summer storm and then her wheelchair suddenly became inoperable. This left the women stranded in the middle of street It was determined the cause of the failure was because water entered the control panel resulting in a short-circuit. At the time the women was using a plastic shopping bag to protect the control panel because there were next to no reliable covers available. And Touched by her story Mr. Jan Fisher, Sr. decided as a former trouble shooter in the electrical industry and once taking a closer view of the system he then took some cellophane scissors and Scotch tape and began to carefully wrapped her joystick control panel and instead of going over the joystick controller stem Mr. Fisher went under and around the joystick shaft. an after being asked if he could make a more permanent cover and then through many months then years of research on hismaterials he then registered his patent applicationand on February 5th of 2017 three days after Mr. Fisher's 59th birthday he was informed by his patent attorney that the industry needed his device because of the manner in which it was designed and the safety features that was approved by the Food an Drug Administration, "FDA" and be for the patent was finalized; "Now tell me Isn't our GOD Good yes our Heavenly Father inspired me to create the first waterproof & condensation free joystick control panel cover that will protect your control panel from moisture and debris while allowing you the operator a full range of motion. And with a deep heartfelt appreciation I Mr. Jan E Fisher, Sr engineer and inventor would like to an with a profound respect would like to present to you the birth of "The Wheelchair Buddy™" by The Omnione Group of Pennsylvania, LLC.       "A Product Made In America By Americans"              Thank you all for becoming a part of!                         The Wheelchair Buddy™                                      " Family "
