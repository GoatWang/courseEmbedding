Alpine seeks to produce stock market-like returnswith substantially less risk and volatility
Alpine Associates Management Inc. (“Alpine” or the “Firm”) manages the Alpine funds, which were founded in 1976 and have produced outstanding absolute returns. The Alpine funds have engaged in merger arbitrage and long/short equity trading since their inception. The firm’s investment strategies also include convertible arbitrage.




40+ Year History 
Objectives
Founders







Exceptional 40 year track record of absolute and risk-adjusted returns with historical non-correlation to the S&P 500
The Alpine funds have historically produced significant alpha through multiple market cycles
The Firm currently has $1.8 billion of total assets under management
Of the current 36 employees, 10 are investment professionals whose average tenure with the firm is over 15 years




Alpine's mission is to generate superior absolute returns across all market environments with low volatility and low correlation to both equity and fixed income markets
Over our long history, we have been highly successful at producing returns that beat both the stock market and the bond market
As a fixed income substitute: Alpine's core business of merger arbitrage has been consistently profitable, exhibited low volatility, and benefited from rising interest rate environments
As an equity alternative: Alpine has produced superior long-term returns while avoiding the severe stress caused by significant downside volatillity



Alpine was founded by Robert E. Zoellner (1932-2014) and his wife, Victoria E. Zoellner, who continues to serve as the Chairman of Alpine's Board of Directors. Bob Zoellner was a legend in the financial industry and his vision and spirit continue to inspire Alpine as it moves into the future.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
