Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC Key Developments

New Jersey Township Sues Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co. LLC over Land Sale
Apr 5 17
A New Jersey township has sued Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co. LLC over a land sale connected with an expansion of the Transco natural gas pipeline system.


Transco Applies for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Authorization for an Expansion Project to Serve Louisiana Chemical Plant
Feb 8 17
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line requested Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorization for an expansion project that would provide 161,500 Dth/d of natural gas transportation service to an industrial customer in Louisiana. The company applied for a certificate to expand it's interstate transmission system on Feb. 6, 2017. The St. James supply project would provide increased transportation capacity from a Transco station in St. Helena Parish, La., to a new interconnection at a proposed methanol manufacturing plant in St. James Parish, La. The project's customer, Yuhuang Chemical Inc.'s YCI St. James Enterprises LLC, would use the gas supplies for the proposed plant. YCI has contracted for the entire 161,500-Dth/d amount in a 20-year precedent agreement with Transco. The project is estimated to cost approximately $33.5 million. Transco asked the commission for a final certificate order approving the project by Jan. 1, 2018. An approval by that date would allow Transco to place the project in service by Jan. 1, 2019, the pipeline company said, a date requested by YCI.


Transco Commences Registered Exchange Offer for its 7.85% Senior Notes Due 2026
Dec 5 16
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC announced that it has commenced an offer to exchange any and all of its $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 7.85% Senior Notes due 2026 (the ‘Original Notes’) for an equal amount of its registered 7.85% Senior Notes due 2026 (the ‘Exchange Notes’). The terms of the Exchange Notes are identical in all material respects to those of the Original Notes, except that the Exchange Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the transfer restrictions, registration rights and additional interest provisions relating to the Original Notes do not apply to the Exchange Notes. The purpose of the Exchange Offer is to fulfill Transco’s obligations under the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the issuance of the Original Notes. Transco will not receive any proceeds from the exchange offer. The exchange offer will expire at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Jan. 4, 2017, unless extended (such date and time, as may be extended, the ‘Expiration Date’). The settlement date for the exchange offer will occur promptly following the Expiration Date. The terms of the exchange offer and other information relating to Transco and the Exchange Notes are in a prospectus dated Dec. 5, 2016, a copy of which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Transco has not authorized any person to provide information other than as in the prospectus.

                    Refund & Exchange Policy: 
                
                2. Pricing, Payment and Refund Terms2.1. Upon Enrollment, we will initiate an account for you (your "Account") and debit your Credit Card in the agreed amount, which amount will constitute your Enrollment Deposit.  The Enrollment Deposit will be added to your Account balance.  The Enrollment Deposit, all amounts prepaid to your Account and all credits to your Account are non-refundable.2.2. The purchase price of each Lead is based upon the type of Construction Services requested by a Consumer, as set forth in the pricing schedule on the Website. You will be notified of any changes to the pricing schedule not less than seven (7) days prior to the effective date of any such change.  Upon Enrollment, you will select the maximum dollar value of Leads that you agree to purchase each month ("Monthly Lead Budget").  You may change your Monthly Lead Budget by modifying your Account.  We will automatically provide you with Leads up to the dollar value established by you from time to time.  To ensure that all funds in your account are used to purchase leads, you agree and authorize us, in our sole discretion, to provide leads for you with a value up to twenty dollars ($71) in excess of your Monthly Lead Budget. We may periodically provide discounts and incentive programs to you, the terms of which shall be limited to that particular discount or incentive program which shall not otherwise modify the terms of these Terms and Conditions.2.3. We will issue an invoice to you whenever your outstanding balance due on your Account exceeds Twenty Dollars ($20.00) or, in our sole discretion, some higher amount for which you shall from time to time qualify based upon your good payment history.  We will also issue an invoice to you when you begin any month with a balance due.  You can access an electronic statement of your Account through the Website. Past due balances will be subject to a late charge of Nine Dollars ($9.00) plus two percent (2%) per month or the maximum amount permitted by law.  In addition, each returned payment shall incur a twenty dollar ($20.00) fee.  We may turn over a past-due account to a third-party collection agent or counsel and file a report with credit rating agencies.2.4. We have no obligation to provide you with a refund or credit for any Leads, whether or not a Consumer elects to use your Construction Services.  In our sole discretion, we may issue a credit to your Account, if:2.4.1. You receive one or more Leads in the wrong Construction Service category, provided, however, we may adjust the purchase price in lieu of providing a credit;2.4.2. You receive a Lead with a non-working or incorrect phone number or incorrect email address or where the Consumer provided a false name; provided, however, we will not provide a credit if the Lead does not have the correct address but all other information is correct;2.4.3. We determine that the Consumer never requested to be placed in contact with a contractor or sought information through us pertaining to Construction Services; and2.4.4. Our system provided a Lead in error.2.5. All credits to your account shall be issued at the Company's discretion, and only if requested within seventy-two (72) hours after delivery of notification of the Lead to you.  Any credit for a Lead shall be deducted from your unpaid invoice in an amount equal to the purchase price of the Lead for which the credit was requested. If the invoice for the lead for which you are requesting credit was already paid, then the credit shall be applied to the current open invoice. No credits will be issued as refunds for leads in which the invoice has already been paid.  Notwithstanding any credits to your Account, you acknowledge and agree that you are obligated to pay for all Leads provided by us and credits can only be applied to the future purchase of Leads.   By agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, you acknowledge and agree that you understand our refund and credit policy.  Any and all fees paid by you to us constitute an advertising fee and shall not be construed to be a referral commission dependent on your successful completion of Construction Services requested by a Consumer.  In the event a fee or payment is prohibited by law or violates any applicable law, it shall not be due or payable.2.6. Lead Credits are issued to a CraftJack member at our discretion and cannot be transferred between accounts or between users. Lead Credits cannot be bartered, exchanged or sold. Lead Credits are a promotional offer and are not payment instruments. Lead Credits are issued without any exchange of money or value from you and you have no vested property right or interest in them. Lead Credits are provided on a promotional basis only, have no cash or other value  and cannot be redeemed for cash or its equivalents by themselves. We reserve the right to limit or cancel your Credits in our sole discretion if we determine that you have violated these Terms of Service, or if we terminate your account for any reason. Lead Credits are only valid during your CraftJack membership, and will expire upon membership termination.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Page Content
The Atlantic Sunrise is a natural gas pipeline proposed by Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco). The proposed Atlantic Sunrise Pipeline Project is designed to supply natural gas by connecting producing regions in northeastern Pennsylvania to markets in the Mid-Atlantic and southeastern states. The proposed project will consist of compression and looping of the Transco Leidy Line in Pennsylvania along with a greenfield pipeline segment, referred to as the Central Penn Line, connecting the northeastern Marcellus producing region to the Transco mainline near Station 195 in southeastern Pennsylvania. Additional existing Transco facilities are being added or modified to allow gas to flow bi-directionally. The proposed pipeline corridor will traverse 10 counties from northeastern Pennsylvania to the southern tier of Pennsylvania.
Below please find information concerning applications and approvals associated with the proposed project and the Central Penn Line. Additional materials will be added to the site as the Department continues with its review of the permit applications. 
Related documents, such as additional correspondence between the DEP and the Applicant, may be in DEP files maintained at that regional office which is conducting the review of the applications. Note: the review of the Lancaster and Lebanon applications is being conducted by the North-Central Regional Office. Persons wishing to review the public file for the applications associated with the project should schedule a file review with the appropriate regional office (i.e., Northeast or North-Central).
