What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

History[edit]
DST was founded in the 1960s as a subsidiary of Kansas City Southern Industries (KCSI) to track movements on their railroad. KCSI also owned a mutual fund management company and leveraged technology to automate the administration of mutual funds, creating the industry's first online shareholder accounting system.
To handle the growing processing and data storage demands seen in the 1980s, DST built several data centers, including one called Winchester that was built in 1985, which was one of the most sophisticated such centers in the United States at the time.
In the 1990s, DST was spun off as an independent entity from KCSI and began trading on the NYSE in 1995 as NYSE: DST.
In 1990, DST first released the Automated Work Distributor (AWD[3]), a business process management product that has been widely adopted by banks, insurance companies, healthcare companies, brokerages and mutual fund companies looking for a paperless environment.
In 1989, DST acquired a 50% interest in Argus Health Systems, at the time focused on pharmacy benefit administration. On March 31, 2009, DST acquired the remaining equity interest of Argus Health.
In 2005 and 2006, DST acquired CSC's Health Plan Solutions group and Amisys Synertech, Inc,[4] allowing DST to provide claims administration, software applications and business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions. This became the newly established DST Health Solutions, a sister company to Argus Health.
In 1991, DST created a wholly owned subsidiary eventually known as DST Customer Communications (formerly DST Output) to handle the design, printing, sorting, mailing and electronic presentment of the voluminous output of its product management systems.
In July 2016, DST sold their North American Customer Communications business to Broadridge Financial Solutions.
Expansion, Partnerships & Investments[edit]
Since 1973, DST has offered many services through substantial joint venture enterprises with State Street Corporation. DST and State Street joint venture activities now include significant international operations.
In 1992, DST formed International Financial Data Systems (IFDS), UK, as a joint venture with State Street Corporation. The UK venture later expanded to locations in Germany and Ireland to provide financial service recordkeeping services for its clients.
In 2001, IFDS combined with International Financial Data Systems (Canada) Ltd.
In 2008, Bluedoor Technologies, a provider of software solutions for participant accounting for the superannuation markets in Australia, was acquired.[13] DST Retirement Solutions was formally established that year.
In 2011, UK-based Lateral Group was acquired to create what is now called DST Applied Analytics. That same year, DST Brokerage Solutions and DST Market Services were established. Also acquired in 2011 was ALPS Holdings, Inc. (ALPS), a Denver-based provider of servicing and asset gathering solutions to the asset management industry. ALPS began in 1991 and became the first service providers of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) beginning in 1995. In 2007, ALPS expanded their capabilities to asset management, specializing in satellite and alternative investment strategies.
DST acquired New York-based kasina LLC in January 2015. kasina is a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry and provides business analytics, consulting and research to asset managers. DST kasina is now part of DST Distribution Services.
In July 2015, DST acquired Wealth Management Systems Inc. (WMSI), a leading provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement industry offering wealth management solutions. WMSI is now part of DST Retirement Solutions.
February 24, 2016, DST completed an acquisition of alternative fund service provider Kaufman Rossin Fund Services (KRFS).[5] KRFS is a full-service provider of specialized administration services to the global financial community and has expertise in the hedge fund business. KRFS is part of the asset servicing division of ALPS.

History[edit]
DST was founded in the 1960s as a subsidiary of Kansas City Southern Industries (KCSI) to track movements on their railroad. KCSI also owned a mutual fund management company and leveraged technology to automate the administration of mutual funds, creating the industry's first online shareholder accounting system.
To handle the growing processing and data storage demands seen in the 1980s, DST built several data centers, including one called Winchester that was built in 1985, which was one of the most sophisticated such centers in the United States at the time.
In the 1990s, DST was spun off as an independent entity from KCSI and began trading on the NYSE in 1995 as NYSE: DST.
In 1990, DST first released the Automated Work Distributor (AWD[3]), a business process management product that has been widely adopted by banks, insurance companies, healthcare companies, brokerages and mutual fund companies looking for a paperless environment.
In 1989, DST acquired a 50% interest in Argus Health Systems, at the time focused on pharmacy benefit administration. On March 31, 2009, DST acquired the remaining equity interest of Argus Health.
In 2005 and 2006, DST acquired CSC's Health Plan Solutions group and Amisys Synertech, Inc,[4] allowing DST to provide claims administration, software applications and business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions. This became the newly established DST Health Solutions, a sister company to Argus Health.
In 1991, DST created a wholly owned subsidiary eventually known as DST Customer Communications (formerly DST Output) to handle the design, printing, sorting, mailing and electronic presentment of the voluminous output of its product management systems.
In July 2016, DST sold their North American Customer Communications business to Broadridge Financial Solutions.
Expansion, Partnerships & Investments[edit]
Since 1973, DST has offered many services through substantial joint venture enterprises with State Street Corporation. DST and State Street joint venture activities now include significant international operations.
In 1992, DST formed International Financial Data Systems (IFDS), UK, as a joint venture with State Street Corporation. The UK venture later expanded to locations in Germany and Ireland to provide financial service recordkeeping services for its clients.
In 2001, IFDS combined with International Financial Data Systems (Canada) Ltd.
In 2008, Bluedoor Technologies, a provider of software solutions for participant accounting for the superannuation markets in Australia, was acquired.[13] DST Retirement Solutions was formally established that year.
In 2011, UK-based Lateral Group was acquired to create what is now called DST Applied Analytics. That same year, DST Brokerage Solutions and DST Market Services were established. Also acquired in 2011 was ALPS Holdings, Inc. (ALPS), a Denver-based provider of servicing and asset gathering solutions to the asset management industry. ALPS began in 1991 and became the first service providers of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) beginning in 1995. In 2007, ALPS expanded their capabilities to asset management, specializing in satellite and alternative investment strategies.
DST acquired New York-based kasina LLC in January 2015. kasina is a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry and provides business analytics, consulting and research to asset managers. DST kasina is now part of DST Distribution Services.
In July 2015, DST acquired Wealth Management Systems Inc. (WMSI), a leading provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement industry offering wealth management solutions. WMSI is now part of DST Retirement Solutions.
February 24, 2016, DST completed an acquisition of alternative fund service provider Kaufman Rossin Fund Services (KRFS).[5] KRFS is a full-service provider of specialized administration services to the global financial community and has expertise in the hedge fund business. KRFS is part of the asset servicing division of ALPS.
March 27, 2017, DST to acquire remaining interest in Joint Ventures, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. (BFDS) and International Financial Data Services Limited ("IFDS U.K."), from State Street Corporation.[6]

The Four Pillars of The DST e-Business Suite
The four pillars of our e-Business suite, TurboParts®, TurboPrise®, TurboSight® and TurboShop® technologies, have earned us a reputation for developing bolt-on solutions that integrate with disparate back-end systems, providing clients with the kind of flexibility they need to efficiently manage their businesses.
TurboPartsTurboParts® is quickly becoming the preferred e-Commerce gateway for customer-centric global aftermarket organizations. A best-in-class Internet-based parts ordering and fulfillment system, TurboParts allows OEMS, retailers and distributors to connect with their customers 24/7. TurboParts integrates with the Epicor® (formerly Activant®), PartExpert® and Cover-to-Cover™ e-catalogs, and can quickly be customized and private-labeled to make it a seamless part of a customer’s e-Business suite.
TurboPriseTurboPrise® is the aftermarket’s most robust supply chain management solution. TurboPrise serves as the electronic link between geographically-dispersed locations and regional and/or master corporate sites to enhance efficiency and productivity up and down a company’s supply chain. TurboPrise helps customers turn their supply chains into competitive advantages, synchronizing them at every tier by enabling all users to view real-time information simultaneously. In closing the gap between planning and execution, TurboPrise enhances the bottom line by delivering true time and cost savings.
TurboSightTurboSight® is business intelligence. With TurboSight, companies integrate business systems, internal and external, to provide manufacturers and their distribution partners with the critical sales reporting and data warehousing capabilities they need to remain competitive in dynamic markets. There’s a difference between real-time data and right-time information, and fortunately for the aftermarket, DST understands the difference. TurboSight makes it easier for business managers to create the executive scoreboards they need to make strategic decisions and business course corrections for their enterprises.
TurboShopTurboShop® helps owners and managers of tire and repair shop operations of all sizes complete more work in the same amount of time and achieve higher average repair order amounts, which in turn reduces costs and increases customer satisfaction. TurboShop’s “Home Office” control makes each location visible in real time so operations can be monitored and adjusted while they are occurring, rather than after the fact, giving individual locations the information they need to run operations independently. However, data is stored centrally, allowing visibility across the entire enterprise even when a real time internet connection is unavailable – a unique functionality that allows TurboShop to be scaled to any sized operation. Using the software’s intuitive interface, and by utilizing industry standard electronic catalogs, shops can order parts directly from almost any supplier. They can also check the status of open work orders and estimates, track employee assignments on open jobs, review a customer’s repair history and easily suggest and quote factory maintenance services. All of this can also be accessed by a customer’s PC, allowing them to schedule appointments on-line.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
