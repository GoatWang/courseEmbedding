DESCRIPTION
Fresh perspective on Paul's  teaching about God the Father, Jesus  Christ, and the  SpiritPaul's ways of  speaking about God, Jesus, and the  Spirit are intricately intertwined: talking  about any one of the three, for Paul,  implies reference to all of them  together. However, much current  Pauline scholarship discusses Paul's  God-, Christ-, and Spirit-language  without reference to trinitarian  theology.In contrast to that  trend, Wesley Hill argues in this book  that later, post-Pauline trinitarian  theologies represent a better  approach, opening a fresh angle on  Paul's earlier talk about God the  Father, Jesus Christ, and the Spirit. Hill  looks critically at certain well-known  discussions in the field of New  Testament studies — those by  N. T. Wright, Richard Bauckham, Larry  Hurtado, and others — in light of  patristic and contemporary trinitarian  theologies, resulting in an innovative  approach to an old set of  questions.Adeptly integrating  biblical exegesis and historical- systematic theology, Hill's Paul and  the Trinity shows how trinitarian  theologies illumine interpretive  difficulties in a way that more recent  theological concepts have failed to  do.Read more from the  author of this book on Eerdword.Watch a 2015 interview with the  author of this book  here:

REVIEWS

Francis Watson— Durham University"There has long been a consensus among New Testament scholars that the doctrine of the Trinity has little to contribute to the study of the New Testament in general and Paul in particular. Wesley Hill presents here a fundamental challenge to that consensus, making sophisticated use of resources drawn from ancient and modern trinitarian conceptuality to bring to light the pervasively relational structure of Paul's statements about God, Christ, and the Spirit. Hill's outstanding book should cause scholars to question — or preferably to abandon — conventional non-relational and un-trinitarian approaches to Pauline theological discourse." 

Matthew Levering— Mundelein Seminary"To say that this book is exciting and important would be a major understatement. . . . Hill brings together cutting-edge Pauline exegesis and the main lines of traditional trinitarian theology in an extraordinary and unique synthesis. Simply put, Hill has accomplished a breakthrough that will transform Pauline studies." 

Douglas A. Campbell— Duke Divinity School"Hill engages carefully and explicitly with some of the key resources of trinitarian theology — in particular, the relational understanding of personhood — to illuminate both Paul's thinking about Jesus within the identity of God and modern attempts to grasp it. . . . Welcome, courageous, and deeply informative." 

Fred Sanders— Torrey Honors Institute, Biola University"This book is a breakthrough. Wesley Hill notes and describes an element of Paul's thought that has been overlooked for too long. . . . Exegetes who rightly fret over the danger of imposing a foreign and anachronistic conceptual grid on Paul's texts are invited to take up and read: without flash or bombast, Hill nimbly models just how apt and illuminating the trinitarian matrix is for serious biblical studies." 

Khaled Anatolios— Boston College"This is theological exegesis at its very best, a brilliant demonstration of `the interdependence of biblical exegesis and dogmatic theology.' " 

Daniel J. Treier— Wheaton College"Wesley Hill provides an intriguing argument for fundamentally reframing the questions we ask about Pauline christology and trinitarian theology. Given the exegetical care and theological consciousness on display in this well-written book, Hill's case deserves serious consideration. Along the way, the book models promising interaction between Scripture and Christian doctrine." 

Angus Paddison— University of Winchester"In this crisply argued volume Hill demonstrates that theology and the reading of Scripture do not just belong together but need one another. Trinitarian theology, Hill convincingly shows, can provide hermeneutical resources for unlocking how Paul speaks of God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. . . . This is theological exegesis at its finest and sharpest." 

Lewis Ayres— Durham University"Advocates with clarity and power for a dense trinitarian reading of Paul. Hill reveals Paul's own subtle use of trinitarian categories, and he shows us how to draw on the trinitarian faith of the church to draw out the beauty and depth of Paul's vision." 

Spirit & Life"Argues that post-Pauline theologies can serve as a hermeneutic lens through which the text can be interpreted, thus providing fresh insights."

N. T. Wright, The Living Church"This is a bold and interesting argument. It deserves careful pondering not only for its proposals about using later trinitarian theological categories to understand Paul but also for the wider challenge of seeing the first five Christian centuries as a continuum rather than in two different compartments — which raises important questions about Scripture and tradition. . . . An important step forward." 

Choice"Recommended."

Our Values
For us, producing the highest quality professional hair care available is simply not enough. John Paul Mitchell Systems is (and always will be) dedicated to making our world a more beautiful place.

No Animal Testing
Never Have. Never Will.
In 1980, we became the first professional beauty company to publicly stand up against animal testing. Now, nearly 35 years later, that pledge to our furry friends remains a driving force in all that we do.







Caring For Our Planet
Live Beautifully
Whether we're planting trees, protecting animals or preserving our natural resources, John Paul Mitchell Systems is (and always has been) dedicated to making our world a more beautiful place.











Product Control
The Real Deal on Diversion
Diversion occurs when professional salon products are sold by unauthorized retailers. Oftentimes these products are old, stolen, counterfeit or tampered with. That's why you should only purchase John Paul Mitchell Systems products within the professional beauty salon industry.







Research & Development
Our product development process begins in our state-of-the-art Product Innovation Center (PIC), in Santa Clarita, California. It's here where our products are researched, formulated and tested (on humans!). From concept to completion, our talented teams work hand-in-hand to perfect every formula and bring our newest innovations to life.







The Awapuhi Farm
Green from the get-go. In 1983, our co-founders established a self-sustaining, solar-powered Awapuhi farm in Hawaii—all of the Awapuhi used in our products is still harvested there today.

Buyer Beware!!! – Don't leave a deposit for equipment that needs to be ordered.  The owner robs Peter to pay Paul.  Take a good look around  the store, no new equipment, and  very messy.  Owner is obnoxious and hard to deal with.  The repair  and service is poor and unprofessional.  The only thing missing is the "going out of business" sign.

well done and thank you! – Thankfully I found Paul years back in Mt Kisco just after I purchased a Husquavarna Tractor from a place in Ct.
I didn't know it, but they closed later that year.

Ever since Paul has been the guy that has helped me with all repairs and service on several different peices of equipment. Snow Blowers, Generator, tractor, And on and on. 
Paul has a busy shop so try to plan ahead when you can. He will try to help you and his guys are very helpful as well.

Took my non starting two year old Stihl hand held blower to Paul's Power Products. After one week they had not even looked at it. Next day I called again. Paul tells me he was sorry for the delay as his mother is in hospital and his employees had not shown up for work. (the dog ate my homework)

Told me he had spent three hours trying to fix the blower to no avail. Said it was worn out and unfixable. I told him I would take it back. He said "No, not possible it is all in pieces."

Smells like the old switcheroo. Suspect he sold my blower leaving me with a hunk of junk. 

Suspect this guy will soon be out of business.

Recent Experience with Pauls Power  – I am a professional Landscaper and about 2 months ago I brought (2) Redmax back  pack leaf blowers in to
Pauls Power Products to be repaired. Immediately I had
problems.First  he  didn't even know what models I brought in.Then I was told that one of the blowers was no
good. Then I was told that it was the wrong blower,that
it was somebody else's. So they returned my blower and didn't charge me, and I though that's great. But hold
on a minute. When I asked about the other Blower, a
Redmax EBZ-8001 a blower that I had a little over 2 years, I was given the runaround. First I was told that it
was no good. then I was told by the owner that he'd have to look into it himself. When he gave me back what
he tried to pass off as my blower I told him it wasn't be-
cause my blower had my company name written on it
in magic marker. His exact words were "I kinda figured
it wasn't yours. This went on for 7 or 8 weeks. Finally when I asked him "Where's my Blower"? He said that
that hunk of junk that he gave me was my blower,but that the covers were switched, that's why my name wasn't on it. He then said   "I'll gladly give you 10 percent
of a new blower" Then he said that the 8001's were
not lasting and that  REDMAX didn't even give a warranty
with that model anymore.Well I went online to check this
out. Not only did the independent survey give the 8001's
a glowing review but  they said that it came with a 2 year
warranty whether you were a professional or a home-
owner. Oh and by the way, that blower that he didn't charge me to fix lasted about 4 weeks, then  went down. When I told the owner this he  basically said,"Yeah well whatta ya gonna do. As I was leaving his shop, obviously not happy, he kind of blew me off saying,"Well thanks for coming, see ya.
 In closing  let's just say that Paul's Power was
telling me the truth no matter how fishy it all sounded.It
still was a very slipshod way of doing business with a
person that had dealt with them for a few years and never complained about a price and always paid his bills. I'll be looking elsewhere and you should too.
                                                                               John C
