Overview
Whether you're a sun worshipper or just want to get a share of the booming economic growth, Florida is a state on the rise that has a lot to appeal to newcomers looking for apartments for rent. One of the fastest-growing states in the Union, Florida has enjoyed almost continuous growth during its history. Whether people come to retire at the end of their careers or are just starting out, this state has plenty to offer.
What to Expect

At 1,350 miles long, Florida has the longest coastline of all states except Alaska. So it's no wonder that tourism is Florida's major source of income; in 2000 alone, tourists spent nearly $60 billion while visiting Florida. From Disneyworld to posh resorts, the Everglades to seemingly endless beaches, beautiful and exciting attractions abound.
In addition to those appealing destinations, what draws people to search for apartment rentals in Florida is the fantastic subtropical climate, with its year-round warmth and sunshine. In winter, southern Florida is one of the warmest places on the U.S. mainland, with average January temperatures ranging from 64 to 70 degrees. Keep in mind, though, that the fall often brings hurricanes that flood the area and occasionally cause residents to have to evacuate their apartments.
Where to Explore

The vast majority of the population lives in urban areas, and the remainder lives in small communities in rural areas. Most people reside in towns and cities along the coast or in a corridor stretching between Tampa and Daytona Beach and including Orlando. While Jacksonville, on the northern Atlantic shore, is the state's largest city in population, the state's largest metropolitan area centers on Miami, which is near the southern tip of the state. Tallahassee, in the panhandle, is Florida's capital and is also a good place to look for apartments.
Miami Apartments

It's the "Magic City," home of sophisticated nightlife, luxurious homes and apartments, fabulous restaurants and, of course, miles and miles of beaches. Although Miami is well over 100 years old, it has the fresh aura of a perpetually modern city. Want to live the good life on Miami Beach? Believe it or not, you can find small apartments for rent starting in the $500-600 range. But to live it up in style, expect to pay $1,500 or more for appropriately fabulous apartment rentals.
Jacksonville Apartments

Jacksonville ("Jax" to locals) is the most important city in northern Florida, with its busy seaport and extensive financial and insurance industries. The 14th largest city in the country with a population of more than 800,000 residents, Jacksonville has one of the lowest overall costs of living in Florida and the U.S. The average cost of living is nearly 9% below the national average, with apartments being especially affordable. Need more convincing? Money Magazine has called it one of the top ten best places to live.
Orlando Apartments

One of the world's premiere travel destinations, Orlando hosts more than 35 million tourists every year, who flock to this Southern city to take advantage of the 95 theme parks and attractions. But what is it like for the people who live here year-round? While they enjoy the splashy destinations their city has to offer, locals are more likely to enjoy the less touristy attractions like the downtown farmer's market every Saturday, Orlando Philharmonic concerts or pro basketball team Orlando Magic playing at the TD Waterhouse Centre. Hundreds of apartments are sprinkled throughout Downtown Orlando, near to all the action. Rents are surprisingly affordable, considering all there is to do in the area, with small apartment rentals starting in the $400-500 range and snazzy townhouses and sophisticated downtown lofts going for well over $2,000.Rent.com is a free rental site that offers a large selection of trusted apartments and houses for rent. Our large selection of listings and helpful tools will make it easy for you to find an affordable apartment quickly.© 2017 RentPath, LLC.

Known as the "Birthplace of Speed," this quiet Floridian community has one of the most unique backgrounds in the state. Home to more than 38,000 residents according to the U.S. Census Bureau, more than a quarter of the city's population is over the age of 65, making Ormond Beach apartments for rent a great option for seniors looking to retire in the area. With a diverse culture and history on one of the most beautiful beaches in the Sunshine State, it is easy to see why so many people are calling Ormond Beach home.

Living in Ormond Beach, FL

The first settlements in the Ormond Beach area happened around 12,000 years ago when Timucuan Native Americans came into the area and named it "Nocoroco" until the Spanish arrived in the 1500s and claimed the areas near Ormond Beach for their king. Once Florida became a British colony, indigo became the biggest export and brought economic growth to the area. Florida's first highway, the King's Railroad was also established near Ormond Beach.


Florida did not begin to gather its true identity until the Spanish and English left in the early 1800s, and sugar and cotton production became cash crops in Ormond Beach along with shipbuilding. Since Florida was largely unoccupied during this time, the state was mostly sold in land grants to wealthy Americans who began to promote the areas around Ormond Beach as an ideal winter vacation site for the wealthy.


At the turn of the 20th century, the area began to promote speed racing after the recent invention of the car. It is even rumored that Henry Ford slept on the beaches here because he could not afford the local hotel fare but still wanted to learn more about the new invention of the automobile. During the roaring 20s, Ormond Beach became a playground for New England's elite, including the Rockefellers. However, the Great Depression and World War II brought many people from diverse backgrounds into the city and forced the city to reinvent itself.

Ormond Beach Work and Study

Many manufacturers are attracted to the Ormond Beach area because of its pro-business identity and healthy global market. Since the area is a foreign trade zone, the city is home to 29 companies that provide more than 2,000 jobs. The leading industries in the area include education, healthcare and government. However, some the communities largest corporate partners include the Hawaiian Tropic-Tanning Research Laboratories, Florida Production Engineering, Homac Manufacturing and Command Medical Products, Inc.


One of the largest institutions of higher learning in the area include Daytona College, an institution that provides 2-year degrees and certifications in a variety of competitive fields including business, healthcare, medical billing, massage therapy and cosmetology. Whether you are attending school here or commuting to nearby Daytona Beach for your education, finding your perfect Ormond Beach rentals before classes start is a great way to get a jump start on a new semester.

Rentals in Ormond Beach, FL and Cost of Living

Despite miles of beachfront property and recent commercial and residential growth, the cost of living index in Ormond Beach is 9 points below the national average, according to information from city-data.com. As of 2009, the median gross rent in the area was $983 per month, making it a very affordable place to live. Since residents here typically earn around $3,000 more per year than the average Floridian, it makes sense that the city experienced a 5 percent growth in population from 2000 to 2009.

Ormond Beach Attractions and Special Events

One of the best ways to understand the past, present and future of Ormond Beach is to visit Tomoka State Park. This is home to a variety of habitats and wildlife, including the West Indian manatee and more than 160 birds.


One of the landmarks that the community takes great pride in is the Ponce de Leon Inlet Lighthouse. The tallest lighthouse in the Florida, this authentic light station is visited by more than 140,000 people each year and offers beautiful views of one of Florida's most famous beaches.

"Most of my personal net worth invested in multi-family investments like the one here in this offering because these are assets that should provide long term positive cash flow while paying down the debt over time."

Company Management Team
The Company is currently managed by a seasoned business and sector professional dedicated to the success of the Company and efficient execution of its planned operations






Grant Cardone
Manager

Grant Cardone has been investing in Multi-Family Real Estate since the mid 1990’s. Mr. Cardone’s combined 40+ transactions have been
across seven states including San Diego and Los Angeles California, Tuscon, Arizona, Austin Texas, Charlotte North Carolina, Nashville,
Tennessee, Savannah, Georgia and throughout Florida.
Mr. Cardone made his single largest private acquisition of 5 properties, Harbour Portfolio, just north of Miami where he competed with
38 other groups to make the acquisition. The $59m dollar purchase of 1016 units produces a positive cash flow in excess of 20% a
year using Fannie Mae debt while Mr. Cardone’s third party management team takes advantage of product development and trending
rising rents.
By focusing on value add opportunities of B and C properties in tertiary and secondary markets overlooked by REITs and provide some
barriers or limitations to new product coming to market. Cardone Real Estate Acquisitions focuses on buying properties that offer opportunities to increase rents, higher occupancy, reducing concessions and lowering expenses. In addition to the above criteria all
new purchases must provide positive cash flow from closing date. Our very conservative investing approach is based on a purchase
price based on trailing 12 income calculations. Mr. Cardone’s team does their own due diligence and will only enter negotiations on
properties they are prepared to close. This has created a great reputation with sellers for the ability to close the deal.
Mr. Cardone has bought and sold real estate assets through all sorts of economies and in different markets.
Mr. Cardone has limited his purchases to the use of his own personal equity along with very small amounts of family funds. He has
used regional banks and agency debt for financing.
With over $500,000,000 in deals done over 25 years Mr. Cardone’s goal is to grow his real estate holdings to 10,000 plus units.
In 2012 the Cardone team moved all operations to Miami Beach Florida and is focusing on purchases in the Florida, North Carolina,
Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama markets.
