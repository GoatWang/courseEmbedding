Zero Gravity Solutions, Inc. Issued Patent for Its Commercial Product 
      for Agriculture, BAM-FX™, by the United States Patent and Trademark 
      Office






February 24, 2016 10:51 AM Eastern Standard Time



BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Zero 
      Gravity Solutions, Inc.'s (ZGSI or the Company) (Pink Sheets: ZGSI), 
      an agricultural biotechnology public company commercializing its 
      technology derived from and designed for Space with significant 
      applications on Earth, has previously announced the notification of 
      approval for BAM-FX 
      by the United 
      States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The Company today was 
      issued U.S. Patent No. 9,266,785 for BAM-FX.
    


      BAM-FX is the first formulation of a family of BAM (Bio Available 
      Minerals) products designed to increase crop yields and quality while 
      also addressing crop plant mineral deficiencies and the stress related 
      challenges facing agriculture worldwide. Major problems facing 
      agriculture include population growth and the hidden hunger of humans on 
      our planet, known globally as crop mineral deficiencies in (zinc, 
      selenium, iron and iodine), and coping with the now common weather 
      events resulting in excessive heat and drought, frost and wind damage. 
      Furthermore, soil degradation caused by excessive use of 
      chemicals/fertilizers and subsequent damage to aquifers and water bodies 
      caused by run-off can all be potentially mitigated by adopting the use 
      of Precision Agricultural micronutrient products such as BAM-FX that 
      help increase the efficiencies of fertilizer use.
    

      “These agricultural problems can be addressed through precision farming 
      techniques along with the use of new technology innovations, such as 
      BAM-FX. BAM-FX provides the means to deliver bioavailable forms of 
      micronutrients, such as copper and zinc in precise ratios through our 
      technology, which allows these micronutrients to actually enter into the 
      plants cells. This results in visibly better growth, enhanced yields 
      with better food quality and other crop benefits including observed 
      plant stress tolerance,” stated Glenn 
      Stinebaugh, ZGSI’s President and Chief Executive Officer.
    

      “The final issuance of the patent represents an important milestone 
      relating to the Company’s intellectual property estate now being 
      monetized,” stated Harvey 
      Kaye, Chairman of ZGSI.

Zero Gravity Solutions, Inc. Receives Notification of Patent Approval 
      for its Commercial Product, BAM-FX from the United States Patent and 
      Trademark Office






November 24, 2015 11:09 AM Eastern Standard Time



BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Zero 
      Gravity Solutions, Inc.'s (“ZGSI” or the “Company”) (Pink Sheets: 
      ZGSI), an agricultural biotechnology public company commercializing its 
      technology derived from and designed for Space with significant 
      applications on Earth, announced today that it has received notification 
      from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that its BAM-FX™ 
      patent pending application has been approved for issuance in the United 
      States. The Company is now completing the last procedures necessary for 
      the final issuance of the patent. The approval of the BAM-FX patent 
      represents a significant milestone in the product’s commercialization.
    


      “The rollout and introduction of BAM-FX in multiple markets and crops is 
      well underway; the granting of the patent approval by the USPTO provides 
      necessary protection for our unique and potentially disruptive 
      agricultural technology,” stated Glenn 
      Stinebaugh, ZGSI’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. 
      Stinebaugh further stated, “We believe that the Company’s manufacturing 
      facility will be able to provide commercial quantities of BAM-FX for the 
      current and upcoming growing season. The intended expansion of our 
      agricultural sales, marketing and professional staff enabled by our 
      recently announced equity financing, will allow us to accelerate the 
      pace of our commercialization efforts.”
    

      “My 20 year career with the USDA 
      and over 30 years consulting with the EPA 
      has provided me with a unique perspective into the immense difficulties 
      facing agriculture and I believe BAM-FX can be a very useful tool in 
      dealing with many of these issues,” stated John 
      Wayne Kennedy, Chief Science Officer and co-founder of ZGSI. Mr. 
      Kennedy further stated, “I am gratified by the approval of this patent 
      for a product designed to address the multiple challenges facing world 
      agriculture and the need to feed the world’s growing population in the 
      coming years.”

SPLASHDOWN! EXPERIMENT USING BAM-FX TO STUDY ITS EFFECTS ON SEEDLING GROWTH AND NUTRITION IN MICROGRAVITY HAS ARRIVED BACK ON EARTH.
The SpaceX Dragon vehicle carrying the student research project using our BAM-FX micronutrient technology was among approximately 3,600 pounds of science experiments and other gear that returned to Earth on March 19, 2017 after a month’s stay on the International Space Station. This experiment, studying the effects of BAM-FX on broccoli seedling growth and nutrition in microgravity, is aimed at significantly advancing how fresh, nutrient-dense food is grown on long-duration space missions. The seedlings flown on the ISS are now headed back to NASA Ames Research Center, where they will be analyzed by plant stress physiologists and the students involved in the experiment. Results are expected to take about a month to process. Click here to read more about Dragon’s return.


























			Corporate Overview		



  

 Print 



Zero Gravity Solutions, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on commercializing technology derived from and designed for Space with significant applications on Earth. These technologies seek to improve world agriculture by providing valuable solutions to challenges facing humanity, including threats to world agriculture and the ability to feed the world's rapidly growing population. The Company's business model is currently focused on its two primary business segments: 1) BAM-FX, which is a cost effective, ionic nutrient delivery system for plants that can deliver minerals and micronutrients systemically at the cellular level of a plant, and 2) Directed Selection, which relates to the production and alteration of new varieties of novel stem cells with unique and beneficial characteristics in the prolonged zero/micro gravity environment of the International Space Station. These can be patented for commercial sale to third parties in the agricultural and human regenerative medical markets. Zero Gravity Solutions has two wholly-owned, operating subsidiaries BAM Agricultural Solutions, Inc. and Zero Gravity Life Sciences, Inc.
The Company is focused on implementing a near-term revenue generation plan through the introduction of the Company's first commercial product, BAM-FX™, to the world's agricultural markets. BAM-FX is an ionic nutrient delivery system for agriculture. The Company conducted field trials on a variety of crops in laboratory and academic settings as well as in field applications on grower/end-user crops. These trials showed exceedingly positive results, resulting in a significant increase in yield, quality and nutritional value in a variety of crops. The Company is beginning the commercial roll out plan for BAM-FX into the world's agricultural markets.
The Company's mid-to-longer term objectives relate to the commercialization of ZGSI's space derived Directed Selection technology, which predicts that plant and animal stem cells exposed to prolonged microgravity in space can be endowed with new characteristics beneficial to society. In conjunction with our collaborators, National Aeronautics and Space Administration ("NASA"), the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and the University of Florida, over the past six years, we have conducted scientific studies on six NASA sponsored flights to the International Space Station ("ISS"). These experiments have demonstrated that the gene expression of plant cells in zero/microgravity changes substantially, and furthermore, provided us with strong evidence that these changes can be directed toward beneficial attributes.
The commercialization of products developed in the zero gravity environment represents a coming of age for new products that cannot be developed here on Earth. Zero Gravity Solutions is positioned to be a world leader in this new scientific paradigm.

(“ZGSI” or the “Company”) (Pink Sheets: ZGSI), an agricultural biotechnology public company commercializing its technology derived from and designed for Space with significant applications for agriculture on Earth, announced that its research experiment using its BAM-FX micronutrient product was successfully delivered today to the International Space Station (ISS) on the SpaceX CRS-10 Dragon cargo resupply mission launched February 19, 2017 from historic pad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.In collaboration with NASA and Intrinsyx Technologies Corporation (ITC), the BAM-FX experiments, led by two plant stress physiologists, Dr. John Freeman of ITC and Dr. David Bubenheim (NASA Biospheric Science Branch code SGE), will study the growth and nutritional effects of our patented micronutrient product BAM-FX in broccoli seedlings in microgravity.The focus of two separate, but related experiments, BAM-FX and V3PO (Vegetative Propagation of Plants in Orbit) are focused on advancing the science necessary to promote the growth of fresh, nutrient-dense food for astronauts on long-duration space missions. This experimental flight opportunity is made available by NanoRacks, LLC via its Space Act Agreement with NASA’s U.S. National Lab on the International Space Station.BAM-FX (Bio-Available Minerals-Formula X), a product manufactured and marketed by ZGSI’s wholly owned subsidiary, BAM Agricultural Solutions, is a solution of special ionic minerals, which can not only correct nutrient deficiencies, but may also increase yield, quality and nutrition with less inputs, by-products and waste. The patented platform technology was originally developed as a way to promote growth of strong plants for astronauts on long duration Space missions, but has shown dramatic results when applied to the agricultural industry here on Earth. The principal aim of the BAM-FX experiment on the ISS is to investigate the possibility to improve nutraceutical crop plant growth at zero gravity and produce large quantities of high quality Zinc bio-fortified broccoli on a space station, thereby ensuring astronauts on long mission a continuous supply of zinc enriched, fresh, anti-carcinogenic cruciferous vegetables. Zinc is important not just for plants to cope with several environmental stresses, but also for human immune system function and cancer inhibition.The V3PO project, supported by BASF, is a student research project on space farming, which will research the effects of microgravity in growing plantlet cuttings with the objective of seeing if vegetative propagation of plants is possible in space to generate fresh food for space missions without having to carry large amounts of seed.V3PO and BAM-FX will share two habitats inside a 1.5U NanoRacks facility compatible cube structure. The Intrinsyx hardware was already flown on SpX-3 named AFEx but slightly modified (introduction of second habitat) for V3PO and BAM-FX joint educational plant growth experiments. Once the BAM-FX experiment returns from the 25-30 day mission on the ISS, the BAM-FX cube with seedlings will come to NASA Ames, where it will be analyzed by Dr. John Freeman and Dr. David Bubenheim and the students involved in the experiment from the International Space Station Science Program at Valley Christian High School. Results are expected to take about a month to process.“The upcoming BAM-FX experiment on the ISS represents an opportunity to go back to our roots, literally and figuratively, to further validate this new science by significantly advancing how fresh, nutrient-dense food is grown on long-duration space missions,” stated Harvey Kaye, ZGSI’s Chairman of the Board.About Zero Gravity Solutions, Inc.Zero Gravity Solutions, Inc. (www.zerogsi.com) is an agricultural biotechnology public company commercializing its technology derived from and designed for Space with significant applications on Earth. These technologies are focused on providing valuable solutions to challenges facing world agriculture. ZGSI’s two primary categories of technologies aimed at sustainable agriculture are: 1) BAM-FX, a cost effective, ionic micronutrient delivery system for plants currently being introduced commercially into world agriculture by Zero Gravity’s wholly owned subsidiary BAM Agricultural Solutions 2) Directed Selection, utilized in the development and production, in the prolonged zero/micro gravity environment of the International Space Station, of large volumes of non-GMO, novel, patentable stem cells with unique and beneficial characteristics.Read MoreLike us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterThis press release may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

SPLASHDOWN! EXPERIMENT USING BAM-FX TO STUDY ITS EFFECTS ON SEEDLING GROWTH AND NUTRITION IN MICROGRAVITY HAS ARRIVED BACK ON EARTH.
The SpaceX Dragon vehicle carrying the student research project using our BAM-FX micronutrient technology was among approximately 3,600 pounds of science experiments and other gear that returned to Earth on March 19, 2017 after a month’s stay on the International Space Station. This experiment, studying the effects of BAM-FX on broccoli seedling growth and nutrition in microgravity, is aimed at significantly advancing how fresh, nutrient-dense food is grown on long-duration space missions. The seedlings flown on the ISS are now headed back to NASA Ames Research Center, where they will be analyzed by plant stress physiologists and the students involved in the experiment. Results are expected to take about a month to process. Click here to read more about Dragon’s return.


























			Corporate Overview		



  

 Print 



Zero Gravity Solutions, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on commercializing technology derived from and designed for Space with significant applications on Earth. These technologies seek to improve world agriculture by providing valuable solutions to challenges facing humanity, including threats to world agriculture and the ability to feed the world's rapidly growing population. The Company's business model is currently focused on its two primary business segments: 1) BAM-FX, which is a cost effective, ionic nutrient delivery system for plants that can deliver minerals and micronutrients systemically at the cellular level of a plant, and 2) Directed Selection, which relates to the production and alteration of new varieties of novel stem cells with unique and beneficial characteristics in the prolonged zero/micro gravity environment of the International Space Station. These can be patented for commercial sale to third parties in the agricultural and human regenerative medical markets. Zero Gravity Solutions has two wholly-owned, operating subsidiaries BAM Agricultural Solutions, Inc. and Zero Gravity Life Sciences, Inc.
The Company is focused on implementing a near-term revenue generation plan through the introduction of the Company's first commercial product, BAM-FX™, to the world's agricultural markets. BAM-FX is an ionic nutrient delivery system for agriculture. The Company conducted field trials on a variety of crops in laboratory and academic settings as well as in field applications on grower/end-user crops. These trials showed exceedingly positive results, resulting in a significant increase in yield, quality and nutritional value in a variety of crops. The Company is beginning the commercial roll out plan for BAM-FX into the world's agricultural markets.
The Company's mid-to-longer term objectives relate to the commercialization of ZGSI's space derived Directed Selection technology, which predicts that plant and animal stem cells exposed to prolonged microgravity in space can be endowed with new characteristics beneficial to society. In conjunction with our collaborators, National Aeronautics and Space Administration ("NASA"), the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and the University of Florida, over the past six years, we have conducted scientific studies on six NASA sponsored flights to the International Space Station ("ISS"). These experiments have demonstrated that the gene expression of plant cells in zero/microgravity changes substantially, and furthermore, provided us with strong evidence that these changes can be directed toward beneficial attributes.
The commercialization of products developed in the zero gravity environment represents a coming of age for new products that cannot be developed here on Earth. Zero Gravity Solutions is positioned to be a world leader in this new scientific paradigm.

					Corporate Overview				








































				Corporate Overview			



  

 Print 




Zero Gravity Solutions, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on commercializing technology derived from and designed for Space with significant applications on Earth. These technologies seek to improve world agriculture by providing valuable solutions to challenges facing humanity, including threats to world agriculture and the ability to feed the world's rapidly growing population. The Company's business model is currently focused on its two primary business segments: 1) BAM-FX, which is a cost effective, ionic nutrient delivery system for plants that can deliver minerals and micronutrients systemically at the cellular level of a plant, and 2) Directed Selection, which relates to the production and alteration of new varieties of novel stem cells with unique and beneficial characteristics in the prolonged zero/micro gravity environment of the International Space Station. These can be patented for commercial sale to third parties in the agricultural and human regenerative medical markets. Zero Gravity Solutions has two wholly-owned, operating subsidiaries BAM Agricultural Solutions, Inc. and Zero Gravity Life Sciences, Inc.
The Company is focused on implementing a near-term revenue generation plan through the introduction of the Company's first commercial product, BAM-FX™, to the world's agricultural markets. BAM-FX is an ionic nutrient delivery system for agriculture. The Company conducted field trials on a variety of crops in laboratory and academic settings as well as in field applications on grower/end-user crops. These trials showed exceedingly positive results, resulting in a significant increase in yield, quality and nutritional value in a variety of crops. The Company is beginning the commercial roll out plan for BAM-FX into the world's agricultural markets.
The Company's mid-to-longer term objectives relate to the commercialization of ZGSI's space derived Directed Selection technology, which predicts that plant and animal stem cells exposed to prolonged microgravity in space can be endowed with new characteristics beneficial to society. In conjunction with our collaborators, National Aeronautics and Space Administration ("NASA"), the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and the University of Florida, over the past six years, we have conducted scientific studies on six NASA sponsored flights to the International Space Station ("ISS"). These experiments have demonstrated that the gene expression of plant cells in zero/microgravity changes substantially, and furthermore, provided us with strong evidence that these changes can be directed toward beneficial attributes.
The commercialization of products developed in the zero gravity environment represents a coming of age for new products that cannot be developed here on Earth. Zero Gravity Solutions is positioned to be a world leader in this new scientific paradigm.

Zero Gravity Solutions, Inc. Issued Patent for its Commercial Product for Agriculture, BAM-FX™ - BAM-FX: Bio Available Minerals in Precision Agriculture
























































































 

 

 

 

 
    

































 

























Zero Gravity Solutions, Inc. Issued Patent for its Commercial Product for Agriculture, BAM-FX™Zero Gravity Solutions, Inc. Issued Patent for its Commercial Product for Agriculture, BAM-FX™, by the United States Patent and Trademark Office
 
BOCA RATON, Fla.— (February 24, 2016),– Zero Gravity Solutions, Inc.’s (ZGSI or the Company) (Pink Sheets: ZGSI), an agricultural biotechnology public company commercializing its technology derived from and designed for Space with significant applications on Earth, has previously announced the notification of approval for BAM-FX by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The Company today was issued U.S. Patent No. 9,266,785 for BAM-FX.
BAM-FX is the first formulation of a family of BAM (Bio Available Minerals) products designed to increase crop yields and quality while also addressing crop plant mineral deficiencies and the stress related challenges facing agriculture worldwide. Major problems facing agriculture include population growth and the hidden hunger of humans on our planet, known globally as crop mineral deficiencies in (zinc, selenium, iron and iodine), and coping with the now common weather events resulting in excessive heat and drought, frost and wind damage. Furthermore, soil degradation caused by excessive use of chemicals/fertilizers and subsequent damage to aquifers and water bodies caused by run-off can all be potentially mitigated by adopting the use of Precision Agricultural micronutrient products such as BAM-FX that help increase the efficiencies of fertilizer use. 
“These agricultural problems can be addressed through precision farming techniques along with the use of new technology innovations, such as BAM-FX.  BAM-FX provides the means to deliver bioavailable forms of micronutrients, such as copper and zinc in precise ratios through our technology, which allows these micronutrients to actually enter into the plants cells. This results in visibly better growth, enhanced yields with better food quality and other crop benefits including observed plant stress tolerance,” stated Glenn Stinebaugh, ZGSI’s President and Chief Executive Officer. 
 
“The final issuance of the patent represents an important milestone relating to the Company’s intellectual property estate now being monetized,” stated Harvey Kaye, Chairman of ZGSI.
About Zero Gravity Solutions, Inc.
