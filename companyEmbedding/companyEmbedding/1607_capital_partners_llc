Taxable Bond: The 1607 Capital Partners Taxable Bond strategy seeks to maximize returns on an after-tax basis through investments in closed-end funds that invest primarily in fixed income securities, including corporate bonds. Specifically, the Fund targets a total annualized “net rate of return on assets” which exceeds, on a long-term basis, (defined as one market cycle), the return of the Barclays US Aggregate Index.

History

Late 1970s and 1980s

1607 Capital Partners Chairman, Fred Tattersall, begins to study the closed-end fund universe and develops an affinity for this unique investment vehicle and the ability to buy a dollar’s worth of assets for less than a dollar.

1988

Following the stock market crash of 1987, the extreme dislocations in the equity closed-end fund universe provides the opportunity to launch a dedicated investment product in this space within the structure of the independently-owned Tattersall Advisory Group (“TAG”).

1992

After recognizing the long-term potential for this special closed-end fund vehicle, Jim Mallory joins the firm to begin to build a dedicated team and attract new clients.

1994

Trading begins in the U.K. investment trust market after extensive research, uncovering many similarities to the closed-end funds traded in the U.S. Shannon Fake is brought on board to further develop this market.
The closed-end fund team branches out and begins to offer services to the fixed income clients of the firm by launching a dedicated fixed income closed-end fund product.

1999

Ashley Long joins the team to further develop the strength of the investment process and broaden the capabilities of the group.
TAG is sold to First Union Bank. At the time, the firm was a traditional fixed income specialist and the closed-end fund group was working within this larger firm.

2007

1607 Capital Partners is founded as the closed-end fund specialists from TAG leave to team up with Fred and Kirk Tattersall.

2008

Assets under management quickly surpass $1 billion and the investment team is enhanced with the hire of a new Research Analyst, Carlos Domenech.

2009

With the increased research capability, the firm begins to invest in funds traded in Canada and Australia, broadening its ability to find attractive funds for client portfolios.

2012

The firm surpasses $2 billion in assets under management and continues to build on its strong foundation for future years.

2014

As value returns to the fixed income funds, the Taxable Bond product grows quickly. This, combined with continued strength in equity markets, allows the firm to surpass $3 billion in total assets under management.

2017

To take greater advantage of the many funds dedicated to U.S.-domiciled companies, 1607 launches a dedicated U.S. Domestic Equity strategy.

Investment Process
With a bottom-up, value-oriented approach, the 1607 Capital investment team buys closed-end funds and other discounted assets based on a proprietary system developed and refined over more than 25 years. The unique attributes of closed-end funds, combined with the relatively unsophisticated investor base for these funds, allows the team to take advantage of what is often an extremely inefficient market. The firm’s investment professionals have over 100 years of combined experience in the closed-end-fund industry.
The firm’s investment team looks to achieve excess returns in three key areas:

Discounts – Since the ability to buy these funds at discounts to their net asset values is what makes 1607’s approach unique, one would assume that this is where the firm would expect to achieve its greatest advantage, and indeed it is. The team identifies funds that are trading at discounts wider than their own historical averages, expecting those discounts to revert to that mean over time. This typically happens as a result of market forces (supply and demand), but in the absence of those, corporate actions may also help to achieve this reversion.
Manager Performance – Similar to a more traditional fund of funds, the investment team works diligently to identify managers with the best opportunity to outperform going forward.
Asset Allocation – While the ultimate allocation of assets among regions, countries or sectors is often the result of the bottom-up research done to identify quality managers and attractive discounts, the investment team confirms these weightings with an analysis of the macro environment as well. Investment decisions are confirmed through this process and, as a result, portfolios will often have over and under weights with respect to their benchmarks.
