Real Estate: History & Experience
Real Estate: Investment Philosophy
Real Estate: In the Media



Founding in Los Angeles:


Pacifica began in 1980 as a Los Angeles-based firm that specialized in investing in commercial real estate. From its inception, the organization was committed to implementing its value-based investment philosophy:
• Buy real estate at a discount to replacement cost, in markets and product types where we have superior knowledge and expertise; hold for the long term; and consider selling when markets reach price levels that are not sustainable and/or when excess new supply threatens market rents and values.
With its private investors Pacifica began acquiring, improving, developing, and managing commercial income properties. Its affiliate provided commercial brokerage services for its independent landlord and tenant clientele as well as for Pacifica’s properties.
In the early 1980’s, Southern California began recovering from a deep recession that had resulted in depressed prices for commercial real estate. Pacifica seized on the opportunity to acquire income properties at below their replacement cost and assembled a portfolio extending from West LA to the South Bay Area of Los Angeles County. As the market improved, selective properties were added where development and re-development could create value. When prices became inflated in the late 1980’s, Pacifica began selling its holdings and looking elsewhere for investment opportunities.
Signature Portfolio in Denver:

A regional search led us to Denver in 1988 where severely depressed real estate prices followed the regional energy and real estate boom and bust cycle of the early 1980’s. Repeating its successful Southern California business plan, Pacifica began acquiring commercial income property with its private clients as the local economy was rebounding. To provide a hands-on presence, it soon opened offices in Denver that accommodated some of Pacifica’s top executives – including Steve Leonard – who relocated from Los Angeles to take full advantage of the opportunity. As the cycle continued and the market improved, Pacifica began partnering with institutional investors on both acquisitions and development opportunities. (Some of those same institutional partners, including the Mack Family of New York/previously “Apollo”, have resumed investing with us after Pacifica returned to Southern California.)
By 1997, Pacifica became the largest private owner of commercial space in Colorado, the 2nd biggest commercial property manager in the state, and its 4th largest commercial brokerage firm.
As the cycle matured and commercial markets became strong in the mid-1990’s, additional investors with large amounts of capital arrived, and new developments were planned that would likely exceed the increase in demand. So, in 1997 and 1998, Pacifica sold its 8 million square feet of industrial, retail and office product for approximately $750 million. Those sales resulted in an attractive IRR for the portfolio. As they were exiting the Denver market, principals in the Pacifica portfolio began to pursue opportunities in other markets.
Modest Portfolio in Las Vegas:

With a local partner, Blake Isaacson took his portion of the Denver portfolio to Southern Nevada to establish new industrial and retail holdings initially funded in part by 1031 exchange money generated from sales in Colorado. The portfolio was assembled early in the strong part of the cycle before being liquidated in approximately 2004 and 2005 as prices began to reach their cyclical highpoints.
Resume Investing in Los Angeles:

Meanwhile, Steve Leonard with Pacifica’s LA partners developed again in Southern California, from 1996 through 1999, when they built a portfolio of approximately 4 million square feet of commercial product. Those efforts culminated in 2004 when Pacifica sold the last facilities built in that phase of the cycle for approximately $400 million, again resulting in an impressive IRR on the equity invested.
Other than that selective activity, Pacifica had generally paused investing in commercial real estate in the early 2000’s, as it was concerned that too much capital – public, private and institutional – was being deployed in the sector. Those concerns proved justified as The Great Recession decimated real estate markets, creating new opportunities to find value for Pacifica’s capital and that of its investors.
Multi-Family Development in Gateway Cities:


The upheaval in housing markets and other demographic, economic and regulatory dynamics following the financial crisis created strong demand for urban apartments – both among renters and institutional investors, including public REITs. The lack of building to meet that demand in the early years of this decade created a unique development opportunity to build and sell, or to hold the projects.

Cyrene high-rise project in downtown Seattle.

Pacifica joined forces with Matt Burton (now with Pacifica) and Paul Keller of Urban Partners along with the Mack Family of New York (Apollo Real Estate Advisors, “AREA”) to capitalize developments in key cities up and down the West Coast that were experiencing strong growth in high-paying jobs. That portfolio was anchored by a number of developments in Seattle as well as projects in Southern California and Portland. The total development cost of building out that portfolio will be in excess of $1 billion when they are completed (not all by Pacifica). Institutional investment partners have included Carlyle, Pritzker, AECOM Capital, LA County Public Employee Pension, and Cigna Insurance.
San Diego Industrial/ Office/Showroom:


Carlsbad Research Center, Carlsbad, CA


By 2013, the San Diego economy was experiencing sustainable growth and Pacifica anticipated that the recovery cycle for commercial real estate would follow. Sure enough, vacancy rates began to fall as the local economy expanded, creating ideal conditions for investing in a market that had not seen speculative construction for many years. Pacifica teamed with local partners, primarily RAF Pacifica Group (founded by Adam Robinson), and began buying existing product at attractive discounts to replacement cost. As we gained confidence in the market and our local

Lionshead Ave, Carlsbad, CA

capabilities, Pacifica took on lease up risk in exchange for deeper discounts from sellers. We also initiated the redevelopment of projects where value could be created.
The portfolio of existing product has grown to include 2 million square feet of commercial buildings acquired for approximately $250 million. We are particularly focused on industrial/office/R&D/ showroom product in and around Central and North San Diego County where two principals of the firm reside: Steve Leonard and Blake Isaacson.

San Diego Development:


We are now also developing among the first speculative projects in North County. The industrial/R&D market for existing buildings is very tight as the local economy continues to grow, and new construction is minimal (just over 1% planned in a market with a low 4% vacancy rate). Pacifica has seen similar conditions when it started development

in*sti*gate Creative Industrial Development, Carlsbad, CA

in other markets throughout its history. Those factors, when combined with the strength of our local partners’ capabilities and our deep penetration and knowledge of the San Diego real estate market, lead us to be confident about the investment potential of our new construction projects.
Our institutional partners include Carlyle in this portfolio. Our plan is to take advantage of favorable supply and demand conditions to build and lease high end industrial/R&D buildings. We then plan to sell them at attractive prices to institutional who are particularly interested in buying new buildings that are leased in strong markets like San Diego. We will also be constructing more traditional industrial buildings for sale to owner/users who will pay high prices at this point in the cycle.
Santa Barbara Portfolio:


The Leonards decided to relocate to Montecito, and Steve has established relationships with local real estate professionals. Those connections have led to new development opportunities, including a 24-unti multi-family project in Santa Barbara. We are attracted to these dynamics for the development of commercial real estate in and around Santa Barbara: a strong local economy, healthy demand among tenants, and limited competitions from new construction due to the difficulty in securing the approval for new developments.
Pacifica Senior Living:


It is no secret that the huge Baby Boomer Generation is heading towards retirement and old age, and its members and their families are making arrangements accordingly. Senior housing is experiencing among the fastest growing demand among all real estate sectors. Indeed, demographic, life span, and aging patterns suggest that senior housing will be part of a growth industry for decades to come – a very desirable feature for any investment.
We have had our eye on those attractive dynamics as they have become more compelling and recently pulled the trigger when the right ingredients came together: a specific land opportunity in the Roaring Fork River Valley with a local development partner we know, an experienced operator of senior communities whom we trust, and in related markets where we have a familiarity and history.
Pacifica Real Estate Senior Living Fund I, LLC acquired 3.88 acres of land in Carbondale, Colorado, to develop and operate a 78-unit Senior Living Center: Sopris Lodge. Our project will accommodate three key needs during the typical aging cycle: initially, independent living, assisted living options as the residents slow down, and memory care. Our expectation is to hold the investment for the long term for cash flow and appreciation magnified by modest leverage. We hope to add to the fund additional senior communities in the Denver Metro Area and in other locations in the Front Range, the Roaring Fork River Valley, and the Western Slope and where the Leonards have had a “second home” since the 1990s.

Pacifica’s History
Disclosures



Pacifica’s goal is to build long term wealth for clients by investing in public companies that have strong prospects for the foreseeable future. Our proprietary investment process focuses on acquiring stock in those businesses, as part of a concentrated investment portfolio, at prices below our estimate of their intrinsic value. Our approach reflects patience and discipline – and they are the foundation of PCI’s long-run success.
No part of our investment management is outsourced; we analyze and select each company, and then opportunistically include each one in a portfolio that has the best long term potential. We seek to minimize risk by knowing more about the companies we own. Pacifica gains no comfort in “diversifying” holdings beyond the top tier of businesses, where that intimate knowledge becomes increasingly less likely. Instead, we concentrate holdings in our favorite companies rather than spread them over ones that aren’t. The investable assets of the firm’s principals are concentrated in the same basic portfolio of companies as our clients (depending upon the opportunities available at the time).

Pacifica’s History
Disclosures



Pacifica began as a Los Angeles-based real estate investment company in 1982. From its inception, the organization was committed to implementing the investment philosophy it now executes in public equities: buying interests in exceptional businesses in industries it deeply understands and at a significant discount to intrinsic value.
With its private investors Pacifica developed, acquired, and managed commercial income property. Its affiliate, Leonard & Ohren, provided commercial brokerage services for its independent landlord and tenant clientele as well as for Pacifica’s properties.
In the early to mid-1980’s, Southern California began recovering from a deep recession that resulted in depressed prices for commercial real estate. Pacifica seized on the opportunity to acquire income properties at below their replacement cost and built a portfolio extending from West Los Angeles to the South Bay area of Los Angeles County. As the market improved, selective properties were added where development and re-development could create value. As prices became inflated in the late 1980’s, Pacifica began selling its holdings, and looking elsewhere for investment opportunities.
A regional search led to Denver in 1988, where severely depressed real estate prices followed the regional industry boom and bust of the 1980’s. Repeating its successful Southern California business plan, Pacifica began acquiring commercial income property for its private clients. It soon opened offices in Denver that accommodated some of Pacifica’s top executives who relocated from Los Angeles to take full advantage of the opportunity. As the market improved, Pacifica began partnering with institutional investors on both acquisitions and development.
Excessive building in Colorado in the mid-1990’s became a concern, so in 1998 Pacifica sold its 8 million square foot portfolio for approximately $750 million resulting in an exceptionally high Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) for the portfolio. As it was exiting the Denver market, Pacifica began to see opportunities to acquire and develop again in Southern California. From 1996 thru 1999 Pacifica assembled a portfolio of approximately 4 million square feet.
Those efforts culminated in 2004 when Pacifica sold the last buildings in the portfolio for a sale of approximately $400 million, again resulting in an impressive IRR on the investment. During this period Pacifica established an office in Madrid, Spain, and began assembling and developing a 180 acre retail center and industrial park within the city limits of Madrid.
Pacifica Capital Investments was formed in April of 1998 and has applied the same philosophy Pacifica executed so successfully in real estate investments. Now in its 16th year, PCI has grown significantly with assets under management of $329 million as of the beginning of 2014.



 

























 



Performance Record –  Pacifica Capital Investments, LLC









































































Performance RecordHomeResultsPerformance Record 





Performance Record



Our Performance Record*
Below is a chart showing the difference between the market’s performance, as measured by the S&P 500 Total Return Index (which reinvests all dividends), from April 1, 1998 (the PCI start date) through December 31, 2016, versus the composite performance of all fully discretionary accounts managed by PCI.

 
Listed below are comparisons between the market’s performance, as measured by the S&P 500 Total Return Index (which reinvests all dividends), from April 1, 1998 (the PCI start date) through December 31, 2016, versus the composite performance of all fully discretionary accounts managed by PCI.


*PCI performance for each year is unaudited and is a Time Weighted Rate of Return for that year, except for 1998-2004, which is an Internal Rate of Return for those years. IRR is a dollar-weighted return that accounts for contributions and withdrawals during the period. TWR is a time-weighted return that effectively eliminates the effects of contributions and withdrawals and their timing. 1998 is a partial year. The S&P 500 Total Return measures the change from the start of the period to the end of the period, assuming no contributions and/or withdrawals and includes dividends. The “Total” is for the entire period, compounded annually. PCI results are shown net of all fees, including management fees, brokerage fees and custodial expenses, and reflect the reinvestment of all dividends and earnings. Performance results provided herein are the aggregate of all fully discretionary accounts managed by PCI, including those accounts no longer with PCI, and include the performance of the accounts of PCI’s principals (which do not incur management fees) and certain other accounts that have reduced management fees. Minimal leverage and short selling has been used since inception for the PCI managed accounts; the effects of such leverage and short selling on PCI’s performance figures have been nominal. Results for individual accounts are varied and will vary in the future. In addition, it is not likely that the relative performance of PCI’s managed accounts will exceed the performance of the broader stock market (as measured by the S&P 500 Total Return or other broad market indexes) by as large a margin as has occurred to date. The stock market faced an unprecedented decline in the year 2008, which strongly impacted the performance of the S&P 500 Total Return Index during the time period shown. In addition, PCI’s performance during the year 2000 was significantly enhanced by the strong performance of one large position in its accounts under management. The 12/31/16 total ending balance for all accounts was approximately $343 million and approximately $77 million was in accounts of PCI principals (Leonard and Pemberton family accounts). Total number of individual accounts was 269 as of 12/31/16.
Past performance is not a guarantee or indicator of future results, and investors should not assume that investments made on their behalf by PCI will be profitable, and may, in fact, result in a loss. Investors also should not assume that PCI’s results will outperform the S&P 500 Total Return Index or other broad market indexes in the future. The investment objective of PCI’s managed accounts is capital appreciation. PCI’s strategy is to concentrate its investments in a limited number of positions with certain positions representing an intentionally large size in the accounts. This concentration is likely to result in greater volatility than the overall market as measured by the S&P 500 Total Return Index, which is made up of 500 large companies. The S&P 500 Total Return Index reflects both changes in the prices of stocks in the S&P 500 Index as well as the reinvestment of the dividend income from its underlying shares. The Index does not bear fees and expenses, and investors cannot invest directly in the Index. In addition, PCI’s strategy is to “hold for the long term” which reduces trading costs.


 

























 



Investment Philosophy –  Pacifica Capital Investments, LLC









































































Investment PhilosophyHomePhilosophy & ProcessInvestment Philosophy 





Investment Philosophy
Investment Process



Investment Philosophy
Pacifica’s first rule of investing is “no permanent loss of capital,” and our investment approach is designed to avoid that occurrence over the long term. The key to our success is finding outstanding businesses that can be bought at attractive prices and holding them over the long term – and the longer the better. With tax rates on the rise, our “buy and hold” philosophy also creates tax efficiencies for most investors.
Pacifica often holds substantial cash positions for varying periods of time while we await opportunities to buy interest in great companies when the market makes them available at discounted prices. Until compelling investment opportunities present themselves, your money will remain in interest or dividend-bearing instruments.

Focused
Pacifica Capital Investments focuses on finding quality businesses that we understand well.
We define these as having:


favorable long term prospects,
sustainable competitive advantages, and
capable and shareholder-oriented management teams.


PCI’s investments are most often in companies having: strong brands, leading market positions, honest and capable management, high returns on invested capital, and sustainable competitive advantages.
We concentrate on select industries and limit our holdings to just those top companies when we can buy them at attractive prices. Pacifica seeks to minimize risk by owning fewer businesses we know more about. We see no benefit to extending our holdings beyond that first tier and into companies with futures that are more difficult to evaluate.

Value Investing
We strive to invest in just the best businesses when the market makes them available at prices below our estimate of their intrinsic value. Since that condition doesn’t regularly occur, the PCI approach often leads to opportunistic acquisitions of quality companies when there is a solvable concern within a company, trouble in its sector, or fear is prevalent in the broader market.
The key to PCI’s success is finding outstanding businesses that can be bought at attractive prices and holding them over long periods of time (the longer the better). We wait patiently until the opportunity emerges and buy only when we have confidence in the long-term performance of the business. If those criteria aren’t met, our philosophy dictates that we hold cash and await value.

Long-Term Results
The key to our long-term success is that we have found and invested in outstanding businesses bought at attractive prices — and have typically held them for long periods of time. Our goal is to beat the market over time — and not worry about beating it every time. PCI’s long term results, illustrated in our Performance Record, are a testament to this rewarding strategy.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Academy Bank


                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

Alfa Insurance


                                            I have (had) been with Alfa for 23 years. Over the course of the last few years, my premiums kept going up. $20 here, $30 there - well, this last time it went up over $200 with the new renewal. I have a perfect driving record- no tickets, no wrecks- and yet my insurance jumps up...show more

NetSpend® Visa® Prepaid Card


                                            I've had a NetSpend prepaid debit card for approximately 3 years. Up until recently I've had no problem. On June 5, 2017 my account was hacked and $1000 was transferred to someone I've never heard of. I filed a dispute and after 3 days NetSpend returned the money to...show more

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!
