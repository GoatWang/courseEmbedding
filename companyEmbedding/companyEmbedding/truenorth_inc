About 



Getting Started With TrueNorthInvestment PhilosophyOur Team

















Investment Philosophy

	There’s no single concept is right for every investor – at TrueNorth, our team works with you to develop a strategy that aligns with your objectives and risk profile. Our guiding principles are based upon our core beliefs regarding asset allocation, risk management and securities selection:

Asset Allocation

	Asset allocation is a key component of our portfolio management decisions. Unlike many other wealth managers, it is an ongoing process at TrueNorth. It begins with determining your strategic asset allocation – this simply means the long-term target for how your assets are divided between stocks, bonds and cash. Your strategic allocation is based upon your risk profile and long-term return objectives. It indicates how your investments would typically be allocated in what we would consider “normal” or neutral market conditions.

Tactical asset allocation is ongoing, and refers to adjustments we may make to your strategic asset allocation based upon our economic and market outlook. For example, if we think the markets pose excessive risks, we may make a tactical adjustment to your allocation to reduce market exposure and increase cash. We may also hold a limited amount of bonds in equity portfolios or stocks within fixed income portfolios, in an effort to reduce risk or enhance returns.

Risk Management

	Managing risk is integral to wealth creation and preservation. Our recommendations with respect to overall investment strategy and strategic asset allocation are based upon each client’s individual circumstances. This means that our approach for clients with sufficient lifetime wealth will differ from strategies for those who need their nest egg to grow for the future. It also means transitioning your portfolio to a different strategy as your needs change over time.

Securities Selection

	We select asset classes from the top down, then pick stocks from the bottom up. Top down asset class selection involves analyzing the "big picture". We form our outlook for the economy and individual economic sectors, and then use our economic forecast to pick the industries we believe represent the best opportunities for growth and out-performance. Bottom up stock selection is driven by in-depth analysis of investment candidates within those favored industries.

	Both qualitative and quantitative securities analysis are used in our securities selection process. (Quantitative analysis focuses on mathematical and statistical research such as the debt-to-equity and price-to-equity ratios. Qualitative analysis uses subjective judgment to evaluate information such as management expertise, industry cycles, labor relations, and other factors not generally identified through quantitative analysis.) Our securities selection process incorporates independent and sell-side research with our own internal analysis. Resources include independent economic, market, sector, and individual securities analysis, and research subscription services that provide a wide range of sell-side analysis of market sectors and individual securities.

	Our goal with respect to fixed income securities selection is to develop a portfolio that seeks to optimize income, manage downside risk, and provide some potential for portfolio appreciation.

Personal Investment Management

What do you really need from your investment advisor?

	We understand you have a vision of what you want to achieve for yourself, your family, your business. But as the saying goes, life is what happens while you are busy making other plans. This means dealing with challenges and taking advantage of new opportunities, while never losing sight of what's most important to you.

	You need an advisor you can talk to as "life happens". Someone you know and who knows you, too. Someone who wants to learn what matters to you most in life...and help you stay on course.

About 



Getting Started With TrueNorthInvestment PhilosophyOur Team

















The TrueNorth Difference



Independence of Thought.
	We take a consultative approach in that we do not market our own proprietary investments or retirement plans, nor do we offer any proprietary investments. This allows us the flexibility to choose from a vast array of securities to design a portfolio that we believe is well-suited to your objectives.

Objectivity.
	Our investment recommendations and portfolio management decisions are made in-house by our experienced portfolio managers and at the direction of our Investment Policy Committee, utilizing our own independent research and analysis.

Experience.
	Our team approach brings together our collective understanding, insight, skills and resources to provide you with expert advice and guidance. Our expertise in the financial services industry allows us to offer you the personalized investment strategies and high quality service for which we are known.

Size.
	We not only bring to you the knowledge, experience and focus you would expect from a large firm, yet our size allows us the opportunity to really get to know you. A close, ongoing relationship allows us to identify strategic solutions that are tailored to fit you now – and as your needs change over time.

Focus.
	Our clients are the heart of our business. Our clients value the decades of collective experience behind our advice, as well as the way that we provide it - with respect, trust, and a deep commitment to exceptional client service.

	TrueNorth, Inc., established in 1999, is registered as an investment advisor with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). TrueNorth is also registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, Member FINRA. We are a wholly owned subsidiary of The IMA Financial Group, Inc., an employee-owned insurance brokerage/agency. IMA is consistently ranked among the Top 20 largest independently owned insurance and employee benefits brokers in the country, with offices in Dallas, Denver, Kansas City,and Wichita.

	We are entrepreneurial, professional, the “right size” and community focused. We are passionate about service; we are hands-on, collaborative and innovative. And, as part of an employee-owned company, it is clear to us that we create value by nurturing long-term customer relationships that are built on trust, integrity, honesty and mutual respect. We invite you to contact us today – we look forward to meeting you!

	 

	The TrueNorth Difference in our Communities



	TrueNorth was the #1 team in the Wichita Altzheimer’s 2015 Walk for the Cure event in terms of money raised. Our very own Dave Strohm was chairman of the walk this year, helping Walk for the Cure surpass its 2015 goal!
