Welcome to the Qumu Corporation First Quarter 2016 Conference Call.
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, May 4, 2016.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's presentation, Mr. Vern Hanzlik, President and CEO of Qumu. Sir, please begin.
Vern Hanzlik
Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
Some of our comments today may also contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, should any of these materialize, or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
As description in our risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors could affect our financial results, and are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
During our call, we may offer additional metrics to provide future insight into our business and results. This detail may or may not be provided in the future. We may also reference certain unreleased services or features not yet available and we cannot guarantee the timing or availability of these services and features. So we recommend customers listening today make purchase decisions based on services or features currently available.
With me today is Peter Goepfrich, our CFO. I will begin the call touching on a few quarterly financial highlights. Peter, then will provide some additional financial commentary. From there I’ll provide an operational highlights and comments of our market. After that, we will open the call up to questions.
In the first quarter, strong execution and customer deployments and solid expense management enable us greatly to improve revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a year-over-year basis. We generated quarterly revenues of $8.7 million an increase of 46% compared to first quarter 2015.
We continue to focus on strengthening our financial performance and growing the business with new and existing customers. Our 11 enterprise customers account for greater than $250,000 each in revenue. These enterprise customers represented in multiple industries; financial, technology, manufacturing and pharmaceutical. We had two transactions greater than $1 million in revenue for the quarter.
Geographically the Americas and AMEA markets continue to show strong adoption for enterprise video. Our enterprise business performed well. The America market represented 68% of our revenue and the AMEA market was 30% of our revenue for the quarter.
In APAC we continue to make progress developing our pipeline through our partnership with Fujitsu, CTC and other unified communication partners. APAC represented 2% of our revenue for the quarter.
In the quarter we saw 18 larger enterprise implementations and upgrades to our latest release or expanded their video footprint. Additionally, in Q1 2016, our global renewal rates for maintenance and support, term contracts and SaaS contracts were greater than 90%.
As I commented in the press release, we saw timing of several deals with new and existing customers push into the second half of the year, but we remain confident in our annual guidance as these deals remain in our future pipeline.

For additional financial commentary, I'll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter Goepfrich
Thank you, Vern. I'll comment on a few items not already addressed by Vern or included in our earnings release.
As discussed last quarter, we changed what information is provided in our earnings release. The changes were made to increase transparency and provide information that we use to plan, monitor and evaluate our financial results.
In regards to revenues, we continue to transition to more revenue that's recurring in nature. We've provided supplemental information for subscription, maintenance and support revenue. From a non-operating expense perspective, we've separated sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses for reporting purposes.
As it relates to operating profitability, we've provided supplemental information for adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure. In addition to the new information we're providing, we're no longer specifically calling out total bookings because total bookings includes a variety of long-term items in nature and it does not reflect the mix of the underlying bookings.
We believe the supplemental revenue information now provided as well as our quarterly and annual revenue guidance is more insightful and relevant to our performance. As we continue to refine and enhance our reporting, we may provide additional supplemental information in the future.
Vern commented on revenue and I'll provide more context to gross margins. Software license and appliance gross margin was 51.2%, primarily driven by first quarter product mix, which included a higher percentage of hardware revenue and software license revenue compared to prior quarters.
Service gross margin was 57.8%, primarily driven by improved economies of scale and increased service revenue as well as cost savings initiatives implemented in the second half of 2015. Total gross margins are expected to improve from the mid 50s early in the year to the mid to high 60s late in the year.
Moving on to the balance sheet, cash and investments were $11.3 million as of March 31, 2016, compared to $13.3 million as of December 31, 2015. We'll continue to manage cash closely and we expect that we'll be cash flow breakeven in the second half of 2016.
Deferred revenue was $11.1 sorry, $11.8 million as of March 31, 2016, compared to $12.6 million as of December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency, deferred revenue decreased $756,000, primarily due to the timing of sales and the delivery of products and services. We expect that deferred revenue will increase the balance of the year.
As noted in yesterday's press release, while we expect second quarter revenue to be consistent with first quarter 2016 revenue, we expect adjusted EBITDA to improve.
Now back to Vern with additional operating highlights and comments on our market.
Vern Hanzlik
Thank Peter. Let me review some key operational highlights and market comments and then we'll open up the call for questions.
Our software platform's ability to address the video market both at the departmental level and the enterprise level is unique in our defined markets. We'll continue to focus on the Global 5000 industries verticals, such as financial services, pharmaceutical, manufacturing and other business verticals.
At the enterprise level, we continue to have success with new customers with proof of concept engagements. We continue to win business because customers demand choice, control and completeness of solution that we can offer.
Qumu has the largest internal video deployments and the most demanding customers. Our customer's needs for highly secured end-to-end video platform, plus an industrial grade broadcast network to deliver video and scale to audiences around the world, both for live and on-demand video communications.

We continue to see used cases for video multiplying enhance our ability to enhance, to expand horizontally in our customer base. Some of our top used cases for our customers are executive communications, corporate training, social video portals, video blogging, sales training, customer service, employee on-boarding, digital marketing, unified communications, mobile evidence capturing, user generated content and ipTV.
In Q1 we began to implement and account based marketing strategy. We expect to have a positive impact on out account acquisition and maximize our horizontal penetration to existing enterprise accounts in the future.
The opportunity for us with large accounts is courtesy in the number of Qumu customers on the Forbes Global 2000 list, with the largest public companies. Qumu's customers represent about 4% of the top 2000 companies, 10% of the top 500 companies, 19% of the top 100 customers on the Forbes list.
In the first quarter, the majority of our contracts were on premise transactions, both new and existing customers. However, we continue to see it trends towards our increasing percentage of cloud and hybrid deployments and our growing pipeline.
In January, we conducted a two-day strategy meeting with 15 enterprise customers including several top 10 companies in multiple industries. We received uniformly positive feedback on our product roadmap from these customers, giving us additional confidence in our future technology plans.
In 2016 we continue to advance our cloud and hybrid offering with the foundation of our next generation platform. The new software platform will expand our current capabilities, namely our customers to use video to enhance their work product even on a more broadly basis, every day, everywhere and any time.
And as we've mentioned before, our hybrid deployments will continue to grow throughout 2016 and in Q2, we'll be deploying a new release combining Pathfinder with Qumu Cloud for a more robust delivery service for all new and existing cloud customers.
Unified Communications is a key strategy for businesses to drive effective communication. Last quarter we announced a partnership with Pexip, that enhances Pexip next generation fusion video conferencing platform with an integrated recording function powered by Qumu.
This combination gives customers the ability to communicate as a virtual enterprise and manager of video assets with an enterprise grade backing. We see a strong pipeline with new opportunities with this new partnership. We see this type of video communication management as a huge disrupter in Unified Communications market and continue to be excited about the collective opportunity.
Another strategic partner is Citrix. In our customer base and in the broader enterprise market there are hundreds of thousands of VDI desktops that are not optimized for viewing video. Partnering with Citrix, we've built a unique video player framework leveraging our Pathfinder delivery network that delivers excellent video experience to VDI desktops, expanding the reach of video in large corporations.
We'll be showcasing our Qumu VDI player at a National Show called Citrix Synergy 2016 at the end of May. Our VDI solution gives a tremendous competitive advantage and addresses a key communication challenge for our customers.
As I've mentioned earlier, we had continued growth in some of our largest enterprise customers for the first quarter in financial, manufacturing and pharmaceutical verticals. One customer in the Americas is into financial services industry and continues to expand its footprint for delivery to all employees in the organization.
In the pharmaceutical market, we had other customers in Germany and in the U.K. expand the foundation of video investment for more reach for live on-demand and other video used cases.

In summary, we're in a strong position for growth in 2016, which is why we're maintaining our annual guidance. We continue to invest in the future with a mindful discipline of our product direction, a clear vision for our team and operational momentum to carry us into the second half of the year, well positioned to reach our corporate milestones and revenue growth objectives.
Now I would like to open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Mark Argento from Lake Street Capital. Your line is open.
Mark Argento
Hey, good morning, guys.
Vern Hanzlik
Hey Mark.
Mark Argento
Hey, could you talk a little bit about your visibility into the second half from some of these larger transactions, maybe talk about what is the -- what's causing some of the shift, the push-out of some of the larger deals? Is it feature-sets? Is it budgets? What's -- maybe you can provide some visibility or some thoughts around that?
Vern Hanzlik
The clarity I can provide Mark is that some of them are proof of concepts and it's just timing of the transactions. The ones that we see in the pipeline right now as we look out through the year is not particularly feature sets, it's more timing for the customer and their budget cycles.
And proof of concept sometimes run 60 to 90 days and it's just timing and negotiating with large organizations, just it becomes a timing issue. So we're being a little bit more prudent on the timing of when we would close them.
Mark Argento
Sure. And then you mentioned I think you said you signed two seven figure deals in the quarter. Were those hybrids, on-prem? What type of deals were those?
Vern Hanzlik
Well it was revenue that they were -- some of them were existing revenue that we took, but one of them is hybrid and then other one is just an expansion of an existing customer. The financial services industry continues to grow out their delivery network.
Mark Argento
Got you. And then last for me, the sales, how big of a sales force are you running right now?
Peter Goepfrich
Quota carrying is about 16, 17.
Mark Argento
Is that where you see yourself got to running for the rest of the year?
Peter Goepfrich
Typically somewhere in that range.
Vern Hanzlik
Yes. The only switch we would see is if we continue to see an inflection point of something with the unified communication partnership in that building out those partners, but we want give more evidence to that.
Mark Argento
One more and then I'll hop back in, but on the gross margin side, you guys are still looking to see a nice pick up in gross margins in the second half and that's really a function of you seeing more, that more software license bookings, is that what's driving their margin improvement in the second half?
Vern Hanzlik
Yes. For the most part yes, software licenses will drive that margin up.
Mark Argento
Great. That's it for me. Thanks guys.
Vern Hanzlik
All right. Thanks Mark.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jeff VanRhee from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Jeff VanRhee
Got it. Hey there, guys. Thanks for taking the call. I guess Vern as it relates to the push-outs referenced, you saw few from Q4 that you call out sounding more than that in Q1, but notably it sounded like you're thinking those deals closed in the second half as opposed to Q2.
Even with proof of concept 60 to 90 days, it sounds like there is maybe a little more in there. Can you just expand on why the not necessarily a one quarter, but it sounds like you're thinking rather than Q2 close as their second half closes. Just what's changed with the customer to drive that behavior?
Vern Hanzlik
Yes, the ones that flowed out of Q1 into Q2 Jeff and then there is ones that we identified that were in Q2 that potentially push into Q3. So I think some of its market related. Some of it was just timing for these big customers that when we were able to get the deals done.

Our sense of urgency versus theirs when we're dealing with these larger enterprises just even if they're exiting customers, it's a cycle. So I think that we have a clear visibility of what the pipeline is through the end of the year and we have deals identified that we're looking at that's kind of why we're sticking with the guidance that we have.
And then kind of pushing these things as quickly as we can, I think that that's the one that we usually see in this enterprise sales cycle.
Jeff VanRhee
The account-based marketing strategy maybe, you can expand on what that means?
Vern Hanzlik
Yes, so what we've done Jeff is we've looked at what -- so I was stating those facts because of the amount of customers that we have in the Forbes 2000, but what we're doing as we get more horizontal in our bigger account base, we're getting more revenue as people understand the used cases that are broader perspective, which drives more revenue for us whether we're building out the network or we're going into different departments that they haven't even talked to us.
So it's an awareness of a focus list within that Global 2000 and continuing to expand the video platform story and then how people should be using it because one department doesn’t know what the other department is using and I think that's really education around unified communications. All the used cases that are laid out and how they can take advantage of the platform whether that's departmental or enterprise.
Jeff VanRhee
Could you quantify or give us a sense of pipeline build maybe thinking back six months ago and comparing what you see now, both in overall value as well as construction early stage, late stage deals or any other meaningful observations there?
Vern Hanzlik
I think the one thing we're doing on pipeline as we bring new opportunities in, so we've got as I had mentioned on the unified communications, we have a list of somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 22 different types of opportunities within that relationship that we have with the Pexip Group.
But that's one platform that we've done a really good job of integrating with and then the account piece is just deals that come in, RFPs that we're responding to, proof of concept. So I think that we're scrubbing the opportunities more diligently so that we can see what the conversion is and then the enterprise ones versus the departmental ones and whether they're on premise or cloud or hybrid doesn’t really matter, but it does dictate where we're selling to, whether it's IT or departmental form the size perspective.
But I would say that the volume of the pipeline is where we've been. I would say that we're not at the three times coverage. We're more at a two times coverage and I think that's where we continue to think we can get more opportunities out of the base as we see in our revenue right now.
Jeff VanRhee
I guess just lastly then along those lines, the account based marketing strategy, it sounds like you're trying to think about how to have drive better volume in the front end of that -- in the front end of that pipe in terms of just lead identification.
Can you just talk about where the leads are coming from now. How you're sourcing them and maybe any incremental color on some of the steps you're changing or taking to meaningfully grow the quantity and scope, what's coming in the front end?
Vern Hanzlik
Yes, I think that well we're using all of the latest techniques with digital marketing where we use Marketo internally. We drive campaigns based on these used cases. We are kind of scrubbing the list with inside of the accounts that are in this Global 2000.
We target all the used cases and the people that would be around that and then the leads flow into there and then we quality them. They come into the pipeline. They get lead. We put them on to the reps if there is an existing customer or it's a new like we've got a proof of concept going on a very large opportunity that it's been going on beginning of Q1 and it flows into Q2 because of the POC started and it cuts of the cycle there.

But I think for us right now it's just seeing how that account based marketing because we've had more of a broader brush with the lead Jeff and then we've come back to this as where our revenues coming out of our base and then also the types of accounts that are acquiring are broadcast quality network that they need to put in.
People are starting to see that they need to have that which is really where we're focusing on that and that's where we see the biggest opportunity for where we're at as a company.
Jeff VanRhee
Okay. And I guess just one last quick one, the cash certainly EBITDA you've made great strides on the cost controls and EBITDA in the past cash generation in the near term. How do you think about over the next two three quarters where we see cash bottomed, as for cash balances?
Vern Hanzlik
Well we don't give a explicit cash number because of the timing of working capital, but if you use our EBITDA guidance gives you a reasonable proxy give or take to cash use. So for seeing at a number and looking at $2 million to $2.5 million because we're not extending out beyond that for second quarter guidance other than to say second half we're going to be cash flow positive.
So you can take it from there, give or take that number. So somewhere south of $10 million, but not much.
Jeff VanRhee
Yes, got it. Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.
Vern Hanzlik
All right. Thanks Jeff.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Glenn Mattson from Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.
Glenn Mattson
Yes, hi. Good morning. I jumped in a little late, so I might have missed if you've covered this already, please excuse me, but the competitive landscape, can you talk about who you're seeing when you go into accounts and is it usually multiple players and who is there and why you're winning or not winning in various circumstances?
Vern Hanzlik
Yes, we didn't touch on it Glenn, but I'll give you the color. We see the normal competitors on the enterprise side, which would be [call] or a VBrick, but where we're winning are very high percentages when we're building a large delivery network that's end to end and highly secure and also redundant those types of things.
That's what we're winning our business and those are usually at the proof of concept that I had mentioned before. So on the departmental side, it's a different level with our cloud products, so we see some of the boutique players and those transactions seem to be those are smaller.
But I think we're seeing we -- see a little bit of call on the cloud side because they're pushing a lot of that and we don't see VBrick there very much and then you see some of the other players that have kind of drifted off into the online video portals and really we're just trying to expand that from a perspective of what we're doing with Unified Communications because we see that as a way to get a foundation of recording and then expand from there from a cost perspective.
Glenn Mattson
And then how about pricing?
Vern Hanzlik
At the enterprise level, our pricing is holding right now and on the cloud side we're competitive there. We're starting to see more traction as we get more features into our cloud and are sort of where we're going with that platform.
Glenn Mattson
Okay. And then I realized it's very early and we're not talking about 2017 yet, but the sales force that as it exists now down in the mid teens is that enough to build continued momentum into 2017 plus the channel partners or we need to start adding people again at some point?
Vern Hanzlik
We're going to be prudent about how we're adding them. We want to see how the channel takes off and where you allocate resources in order to build the alternative channel. That's one of the things we're keeping a close eye on and we've a lot of activity around that area.

So we want to create more draft that way and keep our enterprise team focused on the larger transaction and more solution selling around video solutions as we get broader into this Global 2000.
Glenn Mattson
Okay. What do you guys think and not to hold you to anything, but what would you say is the natural growth rate for this business right now? Maybe what the market is doing and what you're doing if you should be growing better that that or at the same rate or any color there on a long term?
Vern Hanzlik
On a long term basis, I think that we're -- this market is somewhere between 15% and 25%. I think the wildcard Glenn as far as growth is where the Unified Communications and some of the things we're doing combine and does that create a different inflection point in different growth rate.
We're seeing a lot of activity around that, but I want to have more evidence of where the changes on the growth rates are because there is market shifting and video is going to be growing dramatically inside of businesses and the management piece will start to see more of that.
So I think that it's a wise scale in any of the analysts that we talk to about the market give it that range. It's somewhere between 15% to 25%. So I think that we -- that's where we see our growth rate based on what we've laid out to date and I think that we're looking for inflection point both from a global perspective because we're still -- our partnerships are just starting to produce some revenue out of the APAC and also in EMEA and you've got some economical things going on right now.
But I think in general, that's where we see the growth rate right now which is until we see more evidence on these other sides with the Unified Communications being a wild card that creates wild accounts for us, but also then we can expand in those because our strategy with the UC guys is just an entry point and then we sell our enterprise platform beyond that.
Glenn Mattson
Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jason Revland from Blueprint Capital. Your line is open. Go ahead sir.
Jason Revland
Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. My question is off the topic if you will relating to the minority holding you have in Briefcam, in monitoring this company it really appears to be quite a bit of momentum there and interest in the technology particularly in the contest of global terrorism.
They also seem to be in a pretty good expansion mode just based on the job openings you can see on their website. So the two part question I have is can you remind us of your involvement your ownership position there. And two, maybe comment on whether this can be potentially monetized for cash at some point and then short and medium term, thanks?
Vern Hanzlik
Thanks Jason. I think the original investment I think that the organization put in was about $3.3 million in capital. I think that we're -- I sit on the Board at Briefcam and we definitely are having some of those conversations.
There is some interest of that business and their IP in the surveillance area, which is not a core focus for us, so that would be something that we would be looking to monetize at the right level. So we're definitely reviewing all those options in order to we're trying to build the business from around the video and then use that stuff inside of our products. So we would probably divest that if it made sense at the right time.
Jason Revland
And just as a potential follow-up, do you have any sense of whether the valuation of that business has been expanding or contracting in the last year?
Peter Goepfrich
We can't comment on it because it's private side company that we don't have the ability to do comment on publicly, but other than to say our asset on our books is covered by value. So we've got a $3.2 million asset on our books related to our investment and we're comfortable with that valuation.

Jason Revland
Okay. I appreciate the detail. Thank you.
Vern Hanzlik
Okay.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Qumu Corporation First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]
I would like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. Peter Goepfrich, CFO. Sir, you may begin.
Peter Goepfrich
Thank you, Britney. Good morning. And thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me today is Vern Hanzlik, President and CEO of Qumu.
Our comments today may include forward-looking statements relating to our expectations, plans and prospects. These statements are based on information available to us at the time of this presentation and by their nature involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements.
Risk and uncertainties associated with our business are described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed periodic reports on Form 10-Q. Any unreleased features or services referenced in this presentation or other public statements, are not currently available and may not be delivered on time or at all.
Customers who purchase our products or services should make sure that their decisions are based on the features that are currently available. We assume no obligation to and do not intend to update any forward-looking statements.
I now turn the call over to Vern.
Vern Hanzlik
Thank you, Peter. Good morning. I’d like to make a few comments before Peter reviews the numbers. Qumu’s first quarter 2017 was a solid start to the year and we continue to take a long-term view of our dynamic industry.
We are successfully transitioning Qumu to a higher margin, more predictable software as a service model and we are doing so while serving large organizations globally with both on-prem and cloud solutions.
At the same time, we’re investing in our future with an exciting new development about our suite of solutions that we’re announcing later this month and we have validated our strategy is in step with the market direction towards highly collaborative video environments. The digital workforce thrives on video and enterprise level clients need solutions both encourage and manage that demand at enterprise scale.
Let me touch on a few financial highlights. During the quarter we lost $1.9 million of adjusted EBITDA was within the guidance. Revenue fell short of guidance by 5% due to late closing two large deals representing nearly $1.8 million in bookings.
Both of those deals closed in the first week of the second quarter. One of those was a mid six figure on-premise deal, which we have taken in the first quarter. And the other was a subscription deal worth approximately $1.32 million
Gross margins for the first quarter improved year-over-year, up from 56% to 61% and last, we ended the quarter with a cash position of $10.4 million.
With our sights set on large enterprises, Qumu added nine new customers during the quarter, including a significant six figure deal with British Telecom. This puts us on place with our objective of 50 new enterprise customers during 2017, given that the second half of the year is typically strong order and new customer acquisition.
As for our existing customers, we continue to see high renewal rates greater than 90% for the quarter and our customer satisfaction scores remain in the high 90s due to our continued focus on quality, product and service.

In the Americas and EMEA markets of the nine new customers I mentioned, three were on-premise sales and six were cloud deals of the new customers. They were also predominantly blue chip companies, meaning our land-and-expand strategy is taking hold.
One company plans to implement a hybrid cloud and an on-prem solution. This is as much an endorsement of our enterprise expertise as it is our technology platform. Serving the customers well pays dividends in the long run in the form of true partnership and sustained loyalty.
In Asia-Pac, we are seeing a momentum build with our Japanese-based partner, V-cube. Asia-Pac represented 5% of our revenue for the quarter, compared to 2% for the fourth quarter in 2016. I’m excited that V-cube is further -- furthering our commitment to Qumu by expanding our own product offering with the Qumu Cloud.
Our sales pipeline remains strong approximately 2.5 times. During the quarter, we closed 60% of the 75 opportunities that we were tracking for the quarter. Larger transactions continue to be our sweet spot. However, the timing of closure on these deals can be challenging to predict and the combination mix of SaaS revenue, perpetual license revenue adds complexity to our projections.
For financial commentary, over to Peter and then I’ll come back and review some strategies and market comments before we open up for questions. Peter?
Peter Goepfrich
Thank you, Vern. I’ll comment on a few additional items. Total revenue was $6.7 million for the first quarter, compared to $9.3 million last quarter. Software license and appliance revenue was $1.2 million for the first quarter, compared to $1.9 million last quarter. The decrease in software license and appliance revenue was primarily due to the seasonality of software license sales, in which the fourth quarter is typically the strongest quarter.
Subscription, maintenance and support revenue was $4.8 million for the first quarter, compared to $6.2 million last quarter. Professional services and other revenue was $650,000 for the first quarter, compared to $1.2 million last quarter.
As noted in to -- fourth quarter 2016 earnings release, fourth quarter revenue included subscription, maintenance and support revenue of $1.2 million, and professional services revenue of $0.4 million, a previously deferred revenue contingent on a customer’s acceptance, which was received in the fourth quarter. Going forward, subscription, maintenance and support revenue related to this customer is expected to be $300,000 annually.
In 2017, we expect that software license and appliance revenue will continue to be dependent on large on-premise sales, which are difficult to forecast, and that subscription, maintenance and support revenue will grow steadily from a quarterly base approximately $5 million.
Gross margin was 61.5% for the first quarter, compared to 70.7% last quarter. The benefit to the gross margin relating to the previously noted customer acceptance was 6.1% and 1.8% for the fourth quarter and full year 2016, respectively.
The total gross margin percentage is expected to improve from the low 60s early in the year to the high 60s late in the year. Total gross margin will continue to be impacted by the timing and mix of large on-premise sales.
Moving on to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure. We continue to diligently manage our expense structure, significantly improving adjusted EBITDA. Compared to the corresponding periods last year, total operating expenses decreased 20% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and adjusted EBITDA improved $1 million to a loss of $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Now for the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents were $10.4 million as of March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, which is approximately $1.5 million more than expected due to better cash collections than forecasted and the deferral of the 2016 annual bonus payment from March to April. Cash at the end of the second quarter is expected to be approximately $7 million.

As it relates to full year 2017 guidance, we are maintaining our revenue guidance of $31 million to $34 million and improving our net loss and our adjusted EBITDA guidance by approximately $1.5 million, reflecting our continued focus on expense management during these dynamic times. We continue to expect that we’ll be cash flow breakeven for the second half of 2017.
Now back to Vern.
Vern Hanzlik
Thanks, Peter. Let me review a few key operating highlights and that are related to our market and product direction. Qumu is focused on a two-pronged strategy; first, capitalize on our core strength and serve large enterprise with complex global video needs; and second, build new partnerships in the video ecosystem.
During Q1, I validated our strategy by meeting with 15 large enterprise customers and prospects in Europe and in the U.S. It was a great opportunity to listen to their challenges as they undertake massive transformation in digital communication.
They know the digital workforce inside and outside the firewall is going to create and consume a minimum of an estimate of 5 times more video over the next three years and they understand this will place huge demands on their network, on security and management. Qumu gives them the ability to manage the explosion of video content.
During these customer meetings, we shared our upcoming new platform architecture that I alluded to earlier. We received positive feedback and validation that our strategy is directly in line with both the market and their needs.
Towards that end, I’m very happy to tell you that we’ll be launching our new product architecture and solution later this month at our Customer Summit in New York and London. So please be on the lookout for announcements.
We are currently briefing analysts and preparing a new website, among other launch activities. This announcement is both a vision and a set of solutions that give customers the most complete and extensible platform in the industry and will help grow our ecosystem of potential white label for our OEM partners.
Speaking of partners, another takeaway from those customer meetings was their considerable interest in Qumu’s integration with Microsoft Office 365, 70% of customers that I talked to in the process were rolling out Skype for Business deployments.
Skype for Business facilitates collaboration and knowledge transfer. Now they want to turn those conversations into video assets. They expressed their excitement about Qumu’s seamless integration with Skype for Business that lets them record Skype for Business calls, store, search and manage in their Qumu video library.
Plus they can broadcast a live meeting or as a recording in the entire enterprise on the Qumu Pathfinder network. This fundamentally extends the value of Skype for Business from a collaboration tool to a streaming platform with Pathfinder’s intelligent network.
With a strong customer interest in mind, we conducted a campaign last month showcasing our seamless integration with the entire Microsoft collaboration suite, which includes Yammer, SharePoint and Skype for Business.
In summary, we are managing the business with an eye to the future. We have the support of large loyal customers as we transition to a more predictable, higher margin SaaS model versus perpetual license accounts.
As I have mentioned many times, our land-and-expand strategy is working with our SaaS product providing entry into new enterprise customers. And finally, we’re evolving our enterprise video platform, which will open up powerful potential of growing our ecosystem of partners and other market opportunities.
When I meet with customers, I always take the opportunity to ask them why they choose Qumu. They consistently respond that they count on Qumu, because of our deep expertise in complex enterprise deployments that we can deliver both inside and outside the firewall.

The evolution of the market is changing. Unified communications is merging with enterprise video content management plus intelligent delivery. Customers are looking for a true platform that provides an end-to-end solution.
We’re the only solution that provides software with all core functions in one platform. As the new digital enterprise opens up the floodgates for video, Qumu is positioned with the right product, right architecture and plus enterprise expertise to help customers achieve their digital vision.
I’ll now open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mark Argento from Lake Street Capital. Your line is open.
Mark Argento
Hey. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to get a better idea, cost structure, it sounds like, obviously, your guidance for this -- for the full year you’re planning a $1.5 million or $2 million in expenses you’re able to take on new model, where should we see those coming out of and how does that impact the longer term kind of opportunity?
Vern Hanzlik
It come -- it generally across all areas from -- slightly from every area, so COGS to R&D to sales and marketing to G&A, and we don’t anticipate it impacting our ability to reflex and grow proactively in the future. We’re just being prudent at this point with managing the cost structure.
Peter Goepfrich
Yeah. And I think just to add to that, Mark, I think that and I’ve had conversation with multiple people. I mean, we’re seeing some of these partnerships that are going to start to take hold, which helps us, as I mentioned with some of the things we’re doing with integration with the Microsoft suite, but also just in the unified comms and then those partnerships are starting to take hold in different vertical markets like healthcare and then also, our partnerships that are with larger integrators just taking our platforms and running them and creating practices around them. So that will help our ability to continue to create growth with less expense.
Mark Argento
Got it. And then, I think, you had mentioned bonuses, have those been accrued for or how does that kind of impact the next quarter…
Vern Hanzlik
Yes.
Mark Argento
… in terms of the numbers?
Vern Hanzlik
It was all timing. It was accrued for at the end of 2016 and normally we pay it out in March but didn’t get paid out until April.
Mark Argento
Perfect. And then more of a strategic question, so it seems to me the way this market’s evolving that the model -- your model almost become more of a middleware type model where you are kind of providing that connectivity between the various bigger the Skype for Business and other kind of input devices or consumption devices. Do you guys think about the business maybe indifferently than you did six months or a year ago and any kind of major strategic changes you could see on the horizon in terms of how you go to market?
Vern Hanzlik
Yeah. Well, I did comment little bit on that, Mark, but I think the net of it is we’re becoming more of this video hub where the inputs are come, they are endless on the inside and then the core focus for us is to make sure we’re managing these video assets at scale and then also providing this intelligent, which we branded around our Pathfinder and more of an intelligent delivery network that we can expose from an enterprise CDN perspective inside the firewall.
So there will be opportunities for us to people leveraging up our core technologies more of a platform. And as you said, a middleware piece where they’re talking to our services. I mean, we’ll have -- we have a lot of different partnerships that we’ll announce here later this month and we’re calling our extensions, which are extensions to our core platform for what we provide and then we’ll continue to build that out, and then those will also bring us into different vertical markets also.

Mark Argento
Okay. Great. And then just one more housekeeping, Peter, did you say you expect to be cash flow breakeven or positive in the second half, I hear you right?
Peter Goepfrich
Yes.
Mark Argento
You guys are comfortable...
Peter Goepfrich
Cash flow breakeven second half of the year.
Mark Argento
So you’re comfortable with the cash levels, with the balance sheet, where it sits right now to kind of get you to where you need to be?
Peter Goepfrich
Correct.
Mark Argento
Great. Thanks guys.
Vern Hanzlik
Thanks, Mark.
Operator
And our next question comes from Jeff VanRhee with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Jeff VanRhee
Yeah. Thank you. Just a couple, first, I guess, Peter, I wanted to clarify on the deals. You talked about the two pushes, $1.8 million in value and that they both closed in the first week of the second quarter. But I missed something about, you said taken in Q1, I want to be sure that the revenue for those all fall in Q2, correct?
Vern Hanzlik
That’s correct, Jeff. Yeah. I would add, probably, I -- that was me so it’s…
Jeff VanRhee
Okay.
Vern Hanzlik
Yeah. That revenue for the on-premise field would be in Q2 and the -- that the subscription one would be a ratable deal anyway.
Jeff VanRhee
Got it. Yeah. Okay. Just wanted to be sure.
Vern Hanzlik
Yeah.
Jeff VanRhee
And then, I guess, last quarter, you were talking about expectations of 30% to 40% bookings growth for ‘17, if I recall, still a valid number, is that guidance, are you reiterating or just expressing comfort with that here?
Vern Hanzlik
Yeah.
Jeff VanRhee
Okay. And then, so the Q2, essentially looking for ballpark flattish sequentially, with such a strong start to the quarter, right. You’ve got a couple of big ones in. I’m surprised it’s probably -- it’s not a little bit better. Is there anything else -- are you seeing other deals like all cycles essentially pushing, so these pushed into the quarter, but you had to push a few out that were in the quarter, how should I think of that?
Vern Hanzlik
I think that’s the best way to think about it, Jeff. I think some of them. That’s why we got a range on it the way we do. Some of them can drop end of the quarter. We’re continuing to negotiate and so they will. So that’s the variability of -- when I -- as I’ve continued to talk about, we’re trying to be as prudent as possible how we’re articulating this to everybody, because we’ve got our baseline of our subscription stuff, which we’ve got base, as Peter mentioned, around that $5 million range and then our variables per quarter are the on-prem stuff and then stuff that falls in from a subscription perspective we get it earlier in the quarter.
So, I think that there are ones that we’re negotiating that kind on the bubble and we just wanted to have that flexibility. But there are -- as we see significant type things that we’re in proof-of-concepts, where the budget’s going to land and are we going to be able to get it done. So we just wanted to be conservative. But with also there’s the pipeline, as I mentioned, is robust and we’re seeing it more in our second half of the year than we are in the first two quarters.
Jeff VanRhee
How much of the sort of the delayed cycles do you sense is due to architecture sort of feature issues, things that are going to be addressed to this new launch versus potentially others/sales execution?
Vern Hanzlik
Some of them are to that. I think that when people want to have a validation like we’re validating something right now in a hybrid deployment for a particular client, it’s a larger hybrid where it’s cloud and some of the things we’re doing feature-wise and we’re testing that with them, validation is a larger organization.
So those things do come into play for sure. Also, just as we’re rolling this out, we had some opportunities to show this to folks and they got excited about it, we are on the unified communications piece. We want to validate it internally to make sure it’s all working and these are even existing customers, because it’s a big -- it’s a bigger play.

We’re enabling 1,000 end points in a big bank. They want to make sure that you’re going to be able to handle the scale. So there are just things like that that happened in the fabric in these larger enterprise that they want to validate and as we’re -- we’ve got other ones where we’re rolling out larger delivery networks and they want to test and validate. So that is a valid point.
Jeff VanRhee
How would you describe the sales execution progression over the last 18 months? I think in the early ‘16 you moved to this, I think, it was -- if I recall a named account strategy. It’s been a little while, but I think you kind of went through a few iterations. Where do you feel you are now in that evolution, are we still sort of searching for the right structure, do you feel like they’ve got it and they’re executing to the fullest with what they have right now in product and they just need this new architecture, obviously, I’m just trying to get a sense of do you think you’re essentially holding share, losing share, gaining share, just those kind of dynamics, however, you can frame that for me?
Vern Hanzlik
Yeah. Well, let me answer it twofold, Jeff, because, I think, what I alluded to in my -- our two-pronged strategy is, one, we’re holding share in our base of our customers and we’re expanding in those base and we continue to show that with our existing revenue out of our base and transactions. And I also look at our account base marketing strategy, the focus of our 2,000 accounts that we’ve been focusing on as we sit for 2017 and as we look to 2018, we would expand out of that with more self-service and things like that in our cloud. So that will continue like, so we set this objective of 50 new customers this year on the enterprise in that 2,000, so that’s -- we’re continuing to track on that.
The second piece of that is, where we’re changing, and I think, the question earlier from Mark was that, we’re changing the strategy a little bit in our partnerships where people are taking our product into markets that we’re not into. And so that will help us from execution perspective beyond and creates more draft and those are the things that we would message to the market more effectively because as we look at our pipelines right now the things that we’re doing. So the partnerships are starting to evolve and the BT stuff is kicking off and we’re starting to see traction there.
So I think that the strategy is going to help us because we’ve created a whole service based architecture with all our major points in the product so that people can take it and run with it. In addition to that, our customers are resonating so our account base are getting more horizontal, so we can sell more to our existing base and as we lay this out competitively to compete with the players that are competing in our defined market in this Global 2000, which are the largest businesses in the world.
We think that we can stack up against anybody with an end-to-end solution, a lot of the competitive landscape is trying to put on intelligent delivery onto their solutions inside the firewall. We know that that is paramount. You have to have a delivery network for video as it expands. So we feel really bullish on where our strategy is. The validation of where our customers are and just the natural excitement based on what we’re doing that we can solve problems both inside the firewall and externally.
Jeff VanRhee
Got it. And I guess, last then, the -- where are you -- what is the sales org now in terms of size and structure?
Vern Hanzlik
We’ve got seven what we call enterprise people, Jeff, that are selling to the largest businesses and we got six sort of account managers, which are doing sort of the mid-level size deals and then we have two BT people, so the total is about 15 right now that are -- that have a quota on their head.

Jeff VanRhee
Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Glenn Mattson with Ladenburg Thalman. Your line is open.
Glenn Mattson
Hi. Good morning. I guess, interesting to hear about, I mean, pipeline 2.5 times coverage, sounds like that improved during the quarter and closing a large number of your deals, as -- I think you said 60% of the opportunities you’re tracking you closed.
Vern Hanzlik
Yeah.
Glenn Mattson
So, it seems like the sales effort is resulting in better performance, but we are curious about the base of what we have now and just kind of protecting that flank of subscription revenue. You’re talking about 90% renewal rates, but do you have any very large renewals coming up this year?
Vern Hanzlik
Yeah. We’ve got large renewals every quarter, Glenn. And so, I think, we’re -- that’s what we focus on the most is that customer sat piece and the renewal rates on a quarterly basis to show up that base.
Glenn Mattson
Okay. But any like top five customers or, I mean, I know top 10 is a big percent of the revenue, but those flow through pretty regularly I guess?
Vern Hanzlik
They do, I mean, we -- they’re always, the bigger ones are always a little bit at risk, but I think that we -- that depends on whether they’re going to change out a big infrastructure or not and our bet is sometimes that they’re not going to change that out. So, but we do -- we have over 300,000 renewals on a quarterly basis for our client base and we continue to track those, we see them out through the whole year, so we’re very focused on them.
Glenn Mattson
Okay. And then, Peter, just on the receivables, the collections, what was going on there, a significant drop sequentially?
Peter Goepfrich
Yeah. The significant improvement, we didn’t have the reflective...
Glenn Mattson
No. I mean, for drop in the -- on the balance sheet you guys -- significant improvement, yeah.
Peter Goepfrich
The significant improvement on collections side, probably about $1 million better than we would have anticipated on the actual collection side. That said, we were light on our sale based on our guidance and that was the primary results why it went down a little bit more than we would have anticipated on a balance sheet approach.
Glenn Mattson
Okay. Great. That’s it for me. Thanks guys.
Vern Hanzlik
Thanks, Glenn.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Neil Cataldi from Blueprint Capital. Your line is open.
Neil Cataldi
Hi, guys. IBM, who bought Ustream last year, put out some interesting data last month, high level, they talked about the increasing use of video within the enterprise, managers relying more on streaming video in the enterprise and they noted that mobile viewership of cloud video has increased five-fold just in 2016 versus 2015. My question to you is this. Your customer list is great. I think, I speak for most investors who are sort of waiting for this inflection point with growth and you’ve referenced this land-and-expand strategy in the past. What’s holding up the customer base today, what are you seeing from them or hearing from them and does this recent IBM data maybe suggest the change in sentiment where they’re going to start moving a little bit faster?
Vern Hanzlik
I can’t -- the activity that we’re seeing, Neil, the internal networks where the people are becoming more aware that they need to have a enterprise CDN inside the firewall and I referenced 5 times growth over the next three years just on these corporate networks and IT is becoming, we’ve got proof-of-concepts that we’re running right now in larger organizations that are over 100,000 employees, that they’re trying to figure out and this is mostly for live and VOD.
So the pace that this market is going to pick up I think is over the next two year to three years where people are going to see the pain on their inside the firewall needs and they’re going to have to build on a network, why we’re starting to message more and more our enterprise CDN, which are Pathfinder intelligent network, which gives them the capability to do that in a diversified fashion and alleviate that pain that they’re going to have on their network as they start to produce more and more video on their backbones.

So I don’t know that. We’re tracking the timing of that perceived inflection point. It is real. It is going to happen and we’re seeing it more and more as people we’re talking to more to the, we’re getting more on the business side on our external communication stuff with cloud and smaller deals, but when we’re doing hybrid deals, if they’re using cloud with our Pathfinder stuff on-prem or it’s a large on-premise deal, it depends, like large on-premise deals are mostly dealing with IP, with the IT organization. They’re validating how it fits into their fabric. It’s going to run in their data center and we continue to see opportunities in that even as we transition to this more SaaS model over the next couple of years.
So the -- IBM is right that they’re going to do that. They’ve made some big investments there. But I think their challenge with this inside the firewall need and they’re going to have -- they need to be able to approach that, you have to create a solution inside the firewall in order to do it, because it’s delivered on a secure network.
Neil Cataldi
Okay. Thanks. And one more sort of high level too, I think, we’ve started to see more M&A activity in the unified communications space. You guys have referenced working with some companies there. Are you seeing any change in how you see companies are looking at video and whether there’s a little bit more of an interest level there to expand their product suite?
Vern Hanzlik
Yeah. Well, I mean, as I talked about our, I kind of focused on the Microsoft stuff that we’re doing with social business with Yammer and SharePoint. But it was apparent to me in talking to a lot of customers and the majority of them were in Europe that were rolling out Skype for Business and these were very large organizations, all north of 50,000 employees, where they’re starting to look at how much of these video assets, because the phone calls are changing to video calls. And the video calls need to be, are they compliance based and do you have to have a management backend to do that.
We demonstrated some of our Skype for Business interface to those folks. So there’s definitely an appetite for how much do they need the management. So the video content management component of those assets are going to become more prevalent and there’s definitely a need for that at scale. So the convergence, as I just closed on is the unified communications market, whether it’s Skype for Business, whether it’s [inaudible] (31:51), whether it’s an Acano, whether it’s a video, StarLeaf, Zoom, they’re all -- we’re seeing a lot of activity around the telemedicine environment and they’re going to have to manage those assets.
So there is lots of convergence between that on the management side of those where those vendors are providing great video, small meeting collaboration, but they’re not providing management in large streaming. And so we’re focusing on the management piece and building out the network so they can use those interfaces as broadcast interfaces if they so desire and that is resonating with our customers.
Neil Cataldi
Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Vern Hanzlik
All right. Thanks, Neil.
Peter Goepfrich
Thanks, Neil.
Neil Cataldi
Yeah.
Operator
And I’m showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Vern Hanzlik, President and CEO for closing remarks.
Vern Hanzlik
Thank you. I want to thank everybody for joining us today and let us know if you have any questions and have a great day.

Content Management Veteran to Join TEAM




Stellent Co-founder to Lead TEAM’s EMEA Operations






April 05, 2011 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ARDEN HILLS, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TEAM Informatics, Inc., a leading enterprise software products and 
      systems integration firm and recognized expert in Oracle Enterprise 2.0 
      and Google Search technology, announces today that Vern Hanzlik has 
      joined the company as the President of the newly formed EMEA (Europe, 
      Middle East, Africa) division of TEAM. In addition, Vern is being 
      appointed to TEAM’s Board of Directors. This past week, TEAM formed TEAM 
      Informatics LTD in Brighton England as the base for EMEA operations with 
      Vern as its president. As an active member of the board, Vern will 
      provide proactive advice and leadership to the organization as TEAM 
      continues to refine and execute global growth initiatives.
    

      Hanzlik is an industry recognized expert in the field of Enterprise 
      Content Management (ECM). Having co-founded Intranet Solutions, Inc. in 
      the mid-1990’s, which later was renamed Stellent, Inc., Vern performed a 
      number of roles – leading product development activities, sales and 
      marketing functions, and later as President and CEO of Stellent. In 
      2006, Stellent was acquired by Oracle and formed the basis for Oracle’s 
      ECM offering. Since the Oracle acquisition, Vern has worked in 
      operational roles and as an advisor to several early stage IT companies.
    

      TEAM CEO Dave Shannon comments on the addition of Hanzlik, “Vern brings 
      incredible depth and experience to TEAM, at a time when we are 
      experiencing explosive growth and transitioning from a services-centered 
      business model to emerge as a global solutions provider. I’m looking 
      forward to Vern’s contributions to TEAM and expect the organization to 
      fully leverage his potential. We are excited to have him as part of 
      TEAM.”
    

      Hanzlik states, “TEAM is a fast moving company focused on products and 
      markets that are high value and high growth in the coming decade. I 
      believe great companies are built around great people and the TEAM 
      organization is deep with talented people. TEAM’s strategy to expand 
      their software product portfolio, professional services and support into 
      different markets is very exciting to me and I look forward to the 
      challenges and opportunities ahead. TEAM is a progressive, next 
      generation technology company that has global reach and a range of 
      products and services that Fortune 1000 companies want and need. I am 
      excited to be part of the organization.”
