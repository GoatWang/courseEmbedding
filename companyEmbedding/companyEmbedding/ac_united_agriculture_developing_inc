Not applicable. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares 
offered by the selling shareholders.


Competition in the vegetable seed industry in China and internationally is 
intense. We will face direct competition by other seed companies, including 
small family-owned businesses, as well as subsidiaries or other affiliates of 
chemical, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which have 
substantially greater resources than we do. We will initially be a small 
competitor in the market. 
  
Our principal larger competitors will be Monsanto, Syngenta, Limagrain, Bejo, 
China National Seed Group Co., Ltd. We intend to compete with these larger 
competitors be offering more flexibility and quicker turnaround time when 
potential customers or distributors are asking for new seed varieties.  There 
are about 50-60 small to mid-size local Chinese companies that are also 
importing foreign seeds with which we will also compete. We believe that our 
management’s research on the American seed supplier market and contacts we 
have made with the American supplier market in connection with the two trial
businesses they established as described above will give us a competitive 
advantage over these competitors. 
  
However, many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially 
greater research and product development capabilities and financial, marketing
and human resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may: 
  
·    succeed in developing products that are equal to or superior to our
 products or potential products or that achieve greater market acceptance than
 our products or potential products;  

·    devote greater resources to developing, marketing or selling their
 products;   

·    respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or scientific
 advances which could render our products or potential products obsolete or
 less preferable;  

·    obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop
 and commercialize potential products we might otherwise develop;   

·    withstand price competition more successfully than we can;   

·    establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third
 parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our customers
 or prospective customers; and   

·    take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than
 we can.


Company Description
We are a development stage company.  Our business will be the sale of 
vegetable seeds in all areas of the world, focusing initially on China.  We 
have not yet sold any of these products. 
  
We will sell the following types of vegetable seeds:  broccoli, squash, and
cabbage. 

We will acquire


 these seeds from various suppliers in the United States. 

Since our inception we have engaged in the following significant operating 
activities:

a.    Incorporate company in state of Nevada  

b.    Set up main executive office in Oak Brook, IL  

c.    Open up bank account for the company  

·    Secured initial capital by private placement to investors  

·    Commenced significant other operational activities, such as:  

a.    Have visited 3 existing seed suppliers in California, Illinois, Maine  

b.    Have visited 2 existing farms in California  

c.    Have visited 2 existing seed breeders in California and Wisconsin  

As of the date of this Prospectus, we have oral agreements with the following 
four seed suppliers: 

·    Rispens Seeds. Inc, IL  

·    Holaday Seed Company, CA  

·    Johnny's Selected Seeds, ME  

·    Integra Hybrids, LLC, CA  
  
We do not intend to enter into formal written supply contracts with these or 
any other suppliers but instead will place separate purchase orders with our 
suppliers.  These suppliers have orally indicated that they can and will 
honor all our purchase orders when given in the foreseeable future.
