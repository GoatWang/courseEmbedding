BLB&B Advisors, LLC, is pleased to announce it has been named to the 2017 edition of the Financial Times 300 Top Registered Investment Advisers. The list recognizes top independent RIA firms from across the U.S. 
BLB&B Advisors, LLC, is one of only 14 firms selected throughout Pennsylvania.
This is the fourth annual FT 300 list, produced independently by the Financial Times in collaboration with Ignites Research, a subsidiary of the FT that provides business intelligence on the investment management industry.
Applicants were graded on six factors: assets under management (AUM); AUM growth rate; years in existence; advanced industry credentials of the firm's advisers; online accessibility; and compliance records. There are no fees or other considerations required of RIAs that apply for the FT 300.
The final FT 300 represents an impressive cohort of elite RIA firms, as the "average" practice in this year's list has been in existence for 24 years and manages $2.7 billion in assets. The FT 300 Top RIAs hail from 37 states and Washington, D.C.

Aligning the Finances of Business and Family
Your family business is much more than a career; it’s the culmination of a lifetime’s worth of passion, commitment, late nights and working weekends. There’s no question that the responsibilities and demands of running a business can be all-consuming. So many people – from clients and suppliers to your employees and their families – depend on the critical decisions you make every day.

According to its most recent survey of college pricing, the College Board estimates that an “average” four-year private university degree now costs $197,280, with that amount expected to double by 2030. As a result, more than two-thirds (68%) of today’s graduates are entering the workforce with college loan debt, and the average outstanding debt amount per student exceeds $30,000.1

Possible Changes are Coming….

                                    Jan 11 2017,

We wanted to make you aware of possible changes that may be coming to BLB&B due to a variety of governmental regulations that were approved in 2016 and are supposed to take effect in 2017. As you may already know, last year the Department of Labor (“DOL”) passed over a thousand pages of new regulations related to the investment industry. These regulations have the potential to fundamentally change how our industry and the firms within it operate. Probably the most visible change on the horizon relates to retirement accounts (401Ks, 403Bs, IRAs, etc.).

BLB&B Investment StrategiesFor our investment advisory clients, BLB&B develops and builds portfolios customized to each client’s unique financial circumstances, goals, needs, and risk-reward profile. Most often, we diversify a client’s investments across a broad spectrum of asset classes. We construct portfolios using individual stocks and bonds and may employ exchange-traded funds to achieve the desired level of diversification. Account holdings can be further customized when necessary or desirable ― for example, to manage tax liabilities or maintain exposure to a favorite security. Client portfolios are managed on site by our investment professionals; we do not hire third parties to manage client assets or make decisions about client portfolios. 

  Value-Oriented Equity Strategy    Value-Oriented Equity Strategy  
  High-Quality Fixed Income Strategy    High-Quality Fixed Income Strategy  

     When selecting equities, we aim to purchase stocks trading at a discount to key measures of a company’s financial strength, or at prices that are temporarily below the stock’s normal price range. By attempting to not overpay for stocks, we may gain some protection if stock markets decline. Additionally, many of the stocks we select pay a dividend that adds to portfolio returns. Still others exhibit growth characteristics that may make them more valuable over time.    When selecting bonds, we generally stay true to our relatively conservative approach to investing and focus primarily on investment-grade taxable and tax-free securities. From time to time, we complement these with non-investment grade securities that, in our view, present little risk of depreciation (downside risk) and have strong prospects for receiving credit-ratings upgrades and appreciating in value.

ABOUT:  Five Decades of Service    |   Is BLB&B Right for You?   |   Our Services    |  How We Work With You  |   Meet Our PeopleIS BLB&B RIGHT FOR YOU?Achieving your financial goals requires careful planning and disciplined execution. Developing a strong, long-term, trusting relationship with the right financial advisor can make all the difference.BLB&B may be the right choice for you if you need and value:    Conservative and  value-oriented  investment  management         A stable,  established firm         A lasting and  meaningful  relationship with caring  and experienced  investment professionals         Excellent  communications        Custom solutions  to financial  challenges     Knowledge and  skills to help you  navigate life events  that affect your  assets or financial  goals      A network of  qualified financial  planning specialists    Case Studies:   A Complex, Multi-Generational Family  
It’s ComplicatedIt began with a simple request: would BLB&B perform a financial check-up for a retired couple? Today, it is a strong, longstanding relationship with the many generations of a typically complex modern American family.Our initial discussions with the couple revealed a knotted web of financial accounts that could be unwound, simplified and refocused, to reduce costs while providing retirement income. Repositioning their assets also would help them better achieve th goal closest to their hearts—providing for the future of their family. But like many family trees today, theirs was complicated by adoption, divorce and remarriage, partnerships, and the presence of current and former step-children and step-grandchildren. Some members of this extended family were doing well in life and work, while others struggled.We take great pride at BLB&B in the work we have done with this family in the years since. While managing the couple’s investment portfolio for income and growth, we coordinated the creation of a system for transferring wealth to present and future generations. Today, we continue to assist the surviving spouse with a wide range of financial and health care matters. We also advise several generations of the family on how best to utilize their trust funds — to develop skills for success and economic independence, start businesses, plan for retirement, and generally lead the best financial lives they can.    A Regional Non-Profit Organization  
Two Decades and CountingIn the 1990s, BLB&B had the good fortune to begin managing the investment portfolio of a small regional non-profit organization. The leaders and staff were excellent at pursuing their mission but less knowledgeable about managing the organization’s finances. BLB&B assisted them with budgeting and cash flow management as well as investing. We also began providing financial education, as needed, for new board members. As the organization and its endowment have grown, so has BLB&B’s relationship with it. In addition to managing the organization’s assets and providing market and economic insights to the board, we also play a role in the development and updating of its investment policy statement and asset allocation strategy.While much has evolved in our relationship with this group, one thing is unchanged: We focus on cash management and investment performance so that the organization can focus on its mission.    A Couple Preparing for Retirement  
A Dynamic Plan for Retirement IncomeThe approach to retirement is often fraught with questions and uncertainty. Can we afford to retire? At what point in time? Will the money last?For one couple, the questions were triggered when his employer offered an early-retirement package. Using our Envision software, BLB&B was able to provide him an initial set of answers on where they stood financially, and what they could afford to do. With its sophisticated capabilities, Envision took into account their entire financial scenario: age, cost of living, assets, legacy goals, Social Security eligibility, and other resources, including the potential value of corporate stock options. In short order, it gave a complete picture suggesting their best approach to claiming Social Security, when to tap pension plans ,and a plan for converting the stock options to income over time.Best of all, now that they have retired, they always have an up-to-date picture of where they stand versus their income and legacy goals. Envision is a dynamic process that is updated regularly via links to their investment accounts, so they can quickly see the implications of changing market conditions or their investment decisions. And it can be modified at will to form new projections and revised strategy whenever they need.

  The Attention Your Cause Deserves       BLB&B understands the challenges many small to medium-sized family foundations, endowments, and charitable organizations face when seeking an asset manager. As a firm, we are charity-minded, and all BLB&B portfolio managers have played significant roles on boards of directors or investment committees of nonprofits in the Philadelphia metro area and beyond. From these experiences, we know how difficult it can be to find an investment manager that will provide a smaller institution with a long-term investment approach, quality service, and a high level of individual attention.We are proud to say that BLB&B gives smaller nonprofits the service and support their worthy causes deserve. In addition to providing relatively conservative equity and fixed investment strategies and a well-defined, disciplined investment process, BLB&B:Aids nonprofits in developing investment policy statements (IPSs)Provides asset allocation guidanceCustomizes portfolio holdings to the organization’s financial goalsIs sensitive to the organization’s mission and manages country, sector, industry, and security exposures accordingly Provides in-depth account reporting Will participate in board of directors and investment committee meetingsOffers suggestions on best use of assets when the organization has multiple accounts targeted at different needs (e.g., operating and reserve accounts) Can provide board training on investment management, if desired Learn more  about the BL&B investment management philosophy, process and investment strategies here.
