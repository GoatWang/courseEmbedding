Securing his doctoral degree from Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences in 2006, Dr. Singh then completed his post-graduate year one at Providence Hospital in Michigan, and his 3-year neurology residency at Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois. Dr. Singh's passion for learning all he could about epilepsy led him to do a fellowship in clinical neurophysiology, with specific training in EEG/VEEG, IOM, and EMG/NCV, also at Loyola University Medical Center. He completed this fellowship in 2011. Dr. Singh became board certified by the American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychiatry in 2011.

Dr. Singh continues his passion for teaching by working closely with the residents of the Kettering Medical Center-Grandview residency program. He has also published several articles in medical journals.
Dr. Singh came from India as a teenager. He is married and has  two children. His interests include being a car enthusiast, as well as learning about history and comparative analysis of religions. Dr. Singh is fluent in 4 languages.

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type
                            

                                Individual
                            

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                N
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).

                                The last name of the provider (if an individual). If the provider is an individual, this is the legal name. This name must match the name on file with the Social Security Administration (SSA). In addition, the date of birth must match that on file with SSA.

The First, Middle, Last and Credential(s) fields allow the following special characters: ampersand, apostrophe, colon, comma, forward slash, hyphen, left and right parentheses, period, pound sign, quotation mark, and semi-colon.
