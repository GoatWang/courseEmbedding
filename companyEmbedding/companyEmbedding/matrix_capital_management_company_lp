Product Management Assessments 

Our Product Management Assessments can help take your company or team to the next level!
Get A Free Estimate
Product Management is one of the most important strategic functions in a company. Great Product Management leads to more successful and more profitable products, happier customers and long-term winning strategies to conquer markets. It also ensures that your company doesn’t waste money developing, marketing and selling products that don’t meet customer needs and should not have been built in the first place.
Optimal Product Process Assessment
Our Product Management Assessments ensure that you have the following elements in place:

An effective product process (as lightweight as possible for your culture)
A great team who understands their role and is trained to perform at a high level of competence
Excellent standardized tools and templates to ensure that deliverables can be created quickly
Systems in place for ongoing company improvements/learning and leveraged collaboration

The 280 Group Product Management Assessments are a service where we do an in-depth analysis of the Product Management function at your company (process, people and tools), provide concrete recommendations for dramatically improving its effectiveness, and assist you with implementing key changes. By working with the 280 Group, you can ensure that you are implementing best practices and that product management will help drive your company’s overall success.
To perform the Product Management Assessments, the 280 Group assigns a team of senior consultants to work with your company. Our rapid and thorough assessment will provide you with a plan to dramatically improve Product Management at your company in a short period of time.
Let the 280 Group help you build a plan to optimize your company’s Product Management function
The deliverable for the assessment is:

Presentation to stakeholders and/or executive staff

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

TRANSACTION DETAILS
Superior Transport, Inc.



Client: Superior Transport, Inc.                                    

Location: Rome, GA                                    

Industry: Downstream Energy & Convenience Retail                                    

Buyer/Investor: Empire Petroleum Partners, LLC                                    

Close Date: June 2017                                    

Situation
The shareholders of Superior Transport, Inc., d/b/a STi Fuels, (“STi” or the “Company”) desired to sell their consignment and wholesale motor fuels supply business and the related transportation assets after many years successfully building the business.
Based in Rome, Georgia, STi was a leading petroleum marketer serving northern Alabama, northwestern Georgia, and southern Tennessee and distributing over 75 million gallons of motor fuels annually primarily through its proprietary Hi-Tech and Smile brands. The Company was also a jobber for both Shell and BP and provided unbranded fuels to customers using their own flags. At the time of the sale, STi retailed fuels through 47 consignment accounts and supplied wholesale fuels to 77 customers. The Company operated a trucking division that hauled fuel to its sites in Georgia and Tennessee, and the Company also operated a commercial fuels business under the Enterprise Oil trade name. Through separate LLCs, STi’s shareholders owned the real estate at several of the consignment and dealer sites.
Objective
To customize, execute, and complete a sale process that would allow the shareholders to realize maximum value for the assets of the Company and their related real estate holdings.
Solution
Matrix provided merger and acquisition advisory services to STi, which included valuation advisory, marketing of the Company through a customized, confidential, structured sale process, and negotiation of the transaction.
Matrix solicited offers that included the real estate owned by the shareholders as well as offers for STi’s fuel supply assets without the real estate. A number of competing offers were received, and after further negotiations with various potential buyers, Empire Petroleum Partners, LLC was selected as the purchaser for STi’s consignment and wholesale motor fuels supply business and the related transportation assets. STi retained the Enterprise Oil commercial fuels business, and the shareholders retained their real estate holdings to maintain the rental income stream.
Matrix assisted in the negotiation of the purchase agreement and coordinated the due diligence and closing process.
The transaction closed in June 2017.

Brian Burrow, President of Campbell Oil, has continued the Company’s growth by shaping a successful retail strategy to become a preeminent convenience brand in Ohio.

Buyer/Investor: Parkland Fuel Corporation                                    

Close Date: December 2016                                    

Situation
7-Eleven, Inc. (“7-Eleven” or the “Company”) acquired CST Brands, Inc.’s (“CST”) West Coast Portfolio, which consisted of seventy-six stores in California and three stores in southeastern Wyoming. The transaction between 7-Eleven and CST closed on July 7, 2016.
The three stores located in Wyoming included two truck stops, one of which was a recently redeveloped 10,300 square foot facility, and one high-volume convenience store.
Due to the fact that 7-Eleven did not operate any stores in Wyoming at the time of the closing on CST’s West Coast Portfolio, it entered into an agreement with CST to have CST continue to operate the three stores located in Wyoming through a temporary lease agreement until the Company determined the best course of action for these stores.
7-Eleven determined it was in its best interest to divest of these Wyoming properties due to its lack of store concentration around these markets.
Objective
To customize, execute, and complete an expedited sale process that would allow 7-Eleven to realize maximum value for these Wyoming assets prior to the expiration of the temporary lease agreement with CST.
Solution
Matrix provided merger and acquisition advisory services to 7-Eleven, which included valuation advisory, marketing of the assets through a customized, confidential, structured sale process, and negotiation of the transaction.
Matrix contacted a select group of national and regional strategic buyers who had the financial capacity to complete the transaction. Several competing offers were received, and Parkland Fuel Corporation (TSE: PKI) was selected as the purchaser.
Matrix assisted in the negotiation of the purchase agreement and helped coordinate the due diligence and closing process.
The transaction closed in December 2015, five months after Matrix was engaged to conduct the sale process.

Client: F.L. Roberts and Company, Inc.                                    

Location: Springfield, MA                                    

Industry: Downstream Energy & Convenience Retail                                    

Buyer/Investor: Atlantic Coast Enterprises, LLC.                                    

Close Date: October 2016                                    

Situation
After retaining Matrix to perform a valuation of F.L. Roberts and Company, Inc. (“F.L. Roberts” or the “Company”), the majority shareholder of F.L. Roberts decided it was time to sell the Company’s assets in order to retire and diversify the family wealth.
The Company, headquartered in Springfield, MA, owned and operated a chain of 26 convenience stores and retail fuel outlets, 22 Golden Nozzle car washes, and 9 Jiffy Lube quick lube facilities primarily in the greater Springfield, MA and Hartford, CT markets .
The Company also operated a wholesale motor fuels distribution business and a fuels transportation business in these markets, which one of the Company’s principals desired to acquire from the Company and continue to grow.
Objective
To customize, execute, and complete a sale process that would allow F.L. Roberts to realize maximum value for their convenience store, car wash, and Jiffy Lube assets.
Solution
Matrix provided valuation guidance to F.L. Roberts’ shareholders and then structured a multifaceted sale process designed to maximize value by driving competition for each of the Company’s divisions. In order to effectively market the businesses, it was important to position the Company’s rewards program that was utilized in all of its divisions in a way that allowed the program to continue post-transaction, even if the businesses were sold to different buyers.
Matrix contacted a select group of regional and national petroleum marketers/convenience store operators, car wash companies, Jiffy Lube franchisees, and private equity groups. Prospective buyers could submit offers for all of the convenience store, car wash, and Jiffy Lube assets together as one portfolio or offers for one or more of the divisions.
Matrix received several competing offers for the entire portfolio, the convenience store division, the combined convenience store and car wash divisions, and the Jiffy Lube division.
After management meetings with certain groups, a second round of offers, and further negotiations with each party, Nouria Energy Corporation was selected to acquire the convenience store and car wash divisions and Atlantic Coat Enterprises, LLC was chosen to purchase the Jiffy Lube assets.
Matrix assisted in the negotiations of the purchase agreements and helped coordinate the closings. Both transactions closed in October 2016.

After retaining Matrix to perform a valuation of F.L. Roberts and Company, Inc. (“F.L. Roberts” or the “Company”), the majority shareholder of F.L. Roberts decided it was time to sell the Company’s assets in order to retire and diversify the family wealth.
The Company, headquartered in Springfield, MA, owned and operated a chain of 26 convenience stores and retail fuel outlets, 22 Golden Nozzle car washes, and 9 Jiffy Lube quick lube facilities primarily in the greater Springfield, MA and Hartford, CT markets .
The Company also operated a wholesale motor fuels distribution business and a fuels transportation business in these markets, which one of the Company’s principals desired to acquire from the Company and continue to grow.
Objective
To customize, execute, and complete a sale process that would allow F.L. Roberts to realize maximum value for their convenience store, car wash, and Jiffy Lube assets.
Solution
Matrix provided valuation guidance to F.L. Roberts’ shareholders and then structured a multifaceted sale process designed to maximize value by driving competition for each of the Company’s divisions. In order to effectively market the businesses, it was important to position the Company’s rewards program that was utilized in all of its divisions in a way that allowed the program to continue post-transaction, even if the businesses were sold to different buyers.
Matrix contacted a select group of regional and national petroleum marketers/convenience store operators, car wash companies, Jiffy Lube franchisees, and private equity groups. Prospective buyers could submit offers for all of the convenience store, car wash, and Jiffy Lube assets together as one portfolio or offers for one or more of the divisions.
Matrix received several competing offers for the entire portfolio, the convenience store division, the combined convenience store and car wash divisions, and the Jiffy Lube division.
After management meetings with certain groups, a second round of offers, and further negotiations with each party, Nouria Energy Corporation was selected to acquire the convenience store and car wash divisions and Atlantic Coat Enterprises, LLC was chosen to purchase the Jiffy Lube assets.
Matrix assisted in the negotiations of the purchase agreements and helped coordinate the closings. Both transactions closed in October 2016.

Buyer/Investor: CrossAmerica Partners LP (NYSE:CAPL)                                    

Close Date: September 2016                                    

Situation
State Oil Company (“State Oil” or the “Company”) and Matrix’s relationship dates back to 2011 when the Company originally retained Matrix to perform a valuation of its retail and wholesale fuels distribution assets. In conjunction with this corporate valuation, Matrix helped State Oil review a potential sale of the Company, but the Company’s shareholders decided to retain the business and make operational improvements.
As result of its previous experience with Matrix, State Oil again reviewed a potential sale of the Company with Matrix in 2014 and once again in 2015. This last review ultimately resulted in the Company’s shareholders deciding it was time to sell the Company.
Objective
To customize, execute, and complete a sale process that would allow State Oil to realize the maximum value for its retail and fuels distribution assets.
Solution
Matrix provided merger and acquisition advisory services to State Oil, which included valuation advisory, marketing of the Company through a customized, confidential, structured sale process, and negotiation of the transaction.
Matrix executed a highly confidential sale process by contacting select national and regional strategic buyers who had the financial capacity to complete the transaction.
Multiple competing offers were received and CrossAmerica Partners LP (NYSE: CAPL) was selected to purchase State Oil’s retail and wholesale fuels distribution assets.
Matrix assisted in the negotiation of the purchase agreement and coordinated the due diligence and closing process.
The transaction with CrossAmerica Partners LP closed in September 2016.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
