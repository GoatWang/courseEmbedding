FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Build to Discover



We follow a "Build to Discover" approach, enabling us to boost our client’s customer and employee experience. In this model, the two activities are complementary, closely interrelated and developed simultaneously. We start with a brief Discovery session to quickly jump into Build. The model relies on the two processes working together, learning and adapting as we build the experiences. To do so, we leverage 3 key pillars: our studios, agile pods methodology and services over platforms.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately
$35.7 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses.

The principal reasons for this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a
public market for our common shares. We intend to use the net proceeds as
follows:

. approximately $8 – 10 million to repay all or part of our U.S. subsidiary’s 
  working capital facility with Bridge Bank, as well as certain lines of credit
  of our principal Argentine subsidiary. Advances under the working capital 
  facility accrue interest at Bridge Bank’s prime rate plus an applicable 
  margin ranging from 3.25% to 4.00%, depending on the amounts drawn, which is 
  due monthly, and the maturity date of the facility is May 6, 2015. Our 
  principal Argentine subsidiary’s lines of credit are denominated in Argentine
  pesos and bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 7.0% to 21.5% and have 
  maturity dates ranging from June 2014 to December 2017; 

. approximately $10 – 12 million for capital expenditures associated with 
  investments in new offices and IT infrastructure to support our planned 
  growth; 

. approximately $12 – 15 million for future strategic acquisitions of, or 
  investments in, other businesses or technologies that we believe will 
  complement our current business and expansion strategies. We have no 
  definitive agreements or understandings with respect to any such acquisitions
  or investments, however, we continue to seek new acquisition opportunities; 
  and 

. any remaining amount for general corporate and working capital purposes. 

However, we have no specific allocation for the use of the net proceeds to us
from this offering, and our management retains the right to utilize the net
proceeds as it determines. The actual allocation of our resources to the above
or other uses will depend on the needs and opportunities that our management
perceives at the time of allocation.

Pending such use, we intend to invest the net proceeds in a diversified
portfolio of short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities, such as
certificates of deposit, repurchase agreements, commercial paper, government
obligations and sovereign and corporate bonds.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of common shares by the
selling shareholders.


The markets in which we compete are changing rapidly. We face competition from
both global IT services providers as well as those based in the United States.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include: the 
ability to innovate; technical expertise and industry knowledge; end-to-end 
solution offerings; reputation and track record for high-quality and on-time 
delivery of work; effective employee recruiting; training and retention; 
responsiveness to clients’ business needs; scale; financial stability; and 
price. 

We face competition primarily from: 

. large global consulting and outsourcing firms, such as Accenture, Capgemini, 
  Sapient and IBM; 

. digital agencies and design firms such as SapientNitro, RGA and Ideo; 

. traditional technology outsourcing IT services providers, such as Cognizant 
  Technology Solutions, EPAM Systems, GlobalLogic, Aricent, Infosys 
  Technologies, Mindtree HCL, Tata and Wipro; and 

. in-house product development departments of our clients and potential 
  clients. 

We believe that our focus on delivering innovative software solutions that
harness the potential of emerging technologies for our clients positions us well
to compete effectively in the future. However, some of our present and potential
competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing or technical
resources; may be able to respond more quickly to emerging technologies or
processes and changes in client demands; may be able to devote greater resources
towards the development, promotion and sale of their services than we can; and
may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among
themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the
needs of our clients.


Company Description
We are a new-breed of technology services provider focused on delivering
innovative software solutions that leverage emerging technologies and related
market trends. We combine the engineering and technical rigor of IT services
providers with the creative approach and culture of digital agencies.


 Globant is
the place where engineering, design and innovation meet scale. Our principal
operating subsidiary is based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Our clients are
principally located in North America and Europe and for the three months ended
March 31, 2014, 79.9% of our revenues were generated by clients in North America
and 7.1% of our revenues were generated by clients in Europe, including many
leading global companies.

Over the last several years, a number of new technologies and related market
trends, including mobility, cloud computing and software as a service,
gamification, social media, wearables, internet of things and “big data” have
emerged that are revolutionizing the way end-users interface with information
technology and are reshaping the business and competitive landscape for
enterprises. As enterprises adjust their business models to adapt and benefit
from these changes, they are increasingly seeking solutions that not only meet
the rigorous engineering requirements of emerging technologies, but that also
engage the end-user in new and powerful ways. We believe this dynamic is
creating an attractive opportunity for technology service providers that have
the engineering rigor, creative talent, and culture of innovation to deliver
these solutions.

At Globant, we seek to deliver an optimal blend of engineering, design, and
innovation to harness the potential of emerging technologies to meet our
clients’ business needs. Since our inception in 2003, we have believed that
while engineering is central to information technology, only by combining strong
engineering capabilities with creativity and agility can we deliver innovative
solutions that enhance end-user experiences while meeting our clients’ business
needs. Our commitment to this differentiated approach is reflected in three core
tenets of our company: organization by technology-specialized practices called
Studios; emphasis on a collaborative and open Culture; and Innovation and
creativity in technology and design. To contribute to these core concepts, we
have made and continue to make significant ongoing investments in developing an
operating environment that fosters innovation, creativity and teamwork, while
ensuring a commitment to quality and project discipline.

Our employees, whom we call Globers, are our most valuable asset. As of March
31, 2014, we had 3,322 employees and 25 delivery centers across 16 cities in
Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico and the United States, supported by
four client management locations in the United States, and one client management
location in each of the United Kingdom, Colombia, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil.
Our reputation for cutting-edge work for global blue chip clients and our
footprint across Latin America provide us with the ability to attract and retain
well-educated and talented professionals in the region. We are culturally
similar to our clients and we function in similar time zones. We believe these
similarities have helped us build solid relationships with our clients in the
United States and Europe and facilitate a high degree of client collaboration.

Our clients include companies such as Google, Electronic Arts, JWT, Sabre,
LinkedIn, Orbitz and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Online, each of which were
among our top ten clients by revenues for at least one Studio in 2013. We
believe our success in building our attractive client base in the most
sophisticated and competitive markets for IT services demonstrates the value
proposition of our offering and the quality of our execution as well as our
culture of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.
