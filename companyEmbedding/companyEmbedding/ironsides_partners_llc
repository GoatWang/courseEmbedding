Ironsides Partners LLC Issues Open Letter to Shareholders of PIMCO 
      Dynamic Credit Income Fund




Encourages Fellow Stockholders to Vote for its Slate of Board Nominees


Ironsides’ Nominees Would Take Concrete Steps to Enhance Shareholder 
      Value if Elected






April 02, 2015 01:18 PM Eastern Daylight Time



BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ironsides Partners LLC, an investment management firm advising funds 
      holding shares in PIMCO Dynamic Credit Income Fund (NYSE: PCI), today 
      issued the following open letter to PCI shareholders from Robert Knapp, 
      founder and chief investment officer:
    


      Dear Fellow PCI Shareholder,
    

Allow me to open this letter with a simple question. Consider: 
      Ironsides is a shareholder – like you. Ironsides only 
      benefits if PCI shares perform – like you. PIMCO, on the 
      other hand, is paid fees regardless of performance or the discount.
PIMCO and its nominees benefit from the status quo. So, 
      who should you believe?


      We are writing to you again in connection with PIMCO Dynamic Credit 
      Income Fund (“PCI”) upcoming meeting scheduled for April 30, 2015. Funds 
      advised by Ironsides Partners own over $10 mm worth of PCI shares and 
      Ironsides has nominated two independent nominees for election as 
      directors. Both Ironsides and PIMCO (as manager of PCI) have written to 
      you explaining why we think our nominees will serve you best. PIMCO has 
      stated that “Ironsides is pursuing a self-serving agenda.” Sounds 
      serious, right? If you will take a moment to read this letter, though, 
      we will set the record straight and highlight that PIMCO is distorting 
      reality by mischaracterizing the mediocre actual returns of PCI.
    

Ironsides Interests are Aligned with Yours


      Ironsides is a shareholder. Although many of our clients are 
      institutions, ultimately the beneficiaries are individuals like most of 
      you, trying to save for retirement. We only benefit if the shares 
      perform. What about PIMCO, the manager of PCI? They earn fees - a lot of 
      fees. PIMCO was paid $63.2 million in management fees by you and me, 
      the shareholders of PCI, in 2014 alone. PIMCO has called Ironsides 
      “short term” oriented, suggesting that somehow Ironsides has interests 
      different than any other shareholder. But consider the steps that 
      Ironsides nominees will work for if elected to the board:
    


        Initiating a share repurchase plan to enhance the NAV per share and 
        narrow the discount
      

        Evaluating a tender offer at NAV
      

        Considering other managers or alternative management arrangements
      


What do these steps have in common? They will reduce 
      PIMCO’s fees while potentially improving shareholder returns. So 
      when PIMCO starts name-calling, we hope you will reflect on who will 
      really benefit from having the fresh perspective that Ironsides’ 
      nominees will provide: all PCI shareholders.
    

The Discount Harms Shareholders


      PCI shares have consistently traded at a discount to NAV since shortly 
      after the Fund was launched in early 2013. PIMCO blames this on “the 
      volatile market environment that followed the launch of the Fund in 
      2013.” Really, could PIMCO possibly offer a more pathetic excuse? Other 
      funds, including several managed by PIMCO, navigated the same volatility 
      and trade at premiums! PCI has a $3 billion portfolio which we estimate 
      could be liquidated in about a day. There is no good reason for the 
      shares of a liquid bond fund to trade at a 10% discount to NAV. Despite 
      PIMCO’s attempt to dismiss the discount, it remains wide, at 10.5% as of 
      March 26, 2015. The discount represents $2.38 per share of lost 
      value, or in total over $326 million in lost shareholder funds. This 
      money belongs to you!


PIMCO is Aggressive with Leverage and Derivatives


      PIMCO manages PCI with very high leverage. We calculate leverage by 
      dividing total assets by net assets, or $5.66 billion / $3.13 billion at 
      year-end, which equals 1.8x. The average leverage ratio in Morningstar’s 
      multi-sector peer group of closed-end bond funds is 1.4x (see table 
      below).
    

      PCI also has significant derivative exposure to credit default swaps or 
      “CDS,” principally written against default risk on Russian Government 
      bonds (Insuring Putin? Yikes!) and issuers such as Petrobras of Brazil 
      (mired in a corruption scandal that is destabilizing the Brazilian 
      government). While PCI’s prospectus includes standard legal disclosure 
      saying these risky derivatives are possible, PIMCO certainly does not 
      explain the full dimension of the risk it is taking. At year-end 
      2014, PCI was exposed to default risk on over $115 million worth of 
      Russian and Brazilian issuers. The market value of those credit default 
      swaps is reported in its schedule of investments as approximately $10.7 
      million, but if Russia and Petrobras were to default, PCI shareholders 
      would be exposed to more than $115 million in losses!

          Return Data: Morningstar Multisector Rank as of March 26, 2015
        











          Leverage Data: Calculated by Ironsides using publicly disclosed 
          information from SEC filings (Total Assets/Net Assets)
        



           
        



PCI’s Performance is Mediocre – Especially Considering its Leverage


      PIMCO has written to PCI shareholders saying that its performance has 
      been great, stating that PCI’s “total return has significantly 
      outperformed the average performance of its peers.” Ironsides asks, what 
      peers, and for that matter, what strategy? The fact is that PIMCO has 
      never articulated a strategy for PCI except “to earn current income.” 
      Nowhere in PCI’s documents can we find any articulation of the Fund’s 
      benchmark, or geographic focus, or credit quality focus, or duration 
      focus. All we know is that PCI is a “dynamic” income fund and hurrah, 
      that PIMCO has won Morningstar awards. Well, according to Morningstar’s 
      own numbers, displayed in the table above, PCI’s performance ranks near 
      the bottom of the “Multisector Bond” funds. Ironsides asks: does this 
      performance deserve a boastful defense?
    

      In addition, if we consider the high leverage and use of derivatives 
      employed by PIMCO, then we PCI shareholders have reason for more than 
      dissatisfaction, we should be alarmed: leverage amplifies returns! With 
      all its risky leverage and derivatives, PCI’s returns should have been 
      much much higher.


PIMCO Must Go


      Before the proxy contest began, Ironsides believed that with the fresh 
      perspective of its director nominees, a concerted effort by PIMCO to 
      market PCI, and the repurchase of PCI shares in the market, that the 
      discount could be eliminated in a cooperative process of working 
      together with PIMCO and the other incumbent directors of PCI. But based 
      on PIMCO’s conduct during the process, and the desperate statements 
      issued in what we believe is a clear attempt to preserve PIMCO’s fee 
      stream over the interests of shareholders, Ironsides has concluded that 
      a different manager is required. PCI’s proxy statement says that the 
      incumbent independent nominees serve as directors or trustees on 92 
      different PIMCO or PIMCO-affiliated funds! How can these individuals 
      possibly exercise independent judgment when they are being paid over 
      $200,000 per year for these services?
    

      PCI shareholders deserve good performance and the 
      elimination of the NAV discount. Under PIMCO’s management, they are 
      getting neither. PCI shareholders deserve the services of 
      independent shareholder oriented directors. PCI shareholders deserve 
      real change – vote now to protect your investment!
