About Infinite Conferencing



Getting Started
1. How quickly can I be set up with an account for phone and web conferencing?

During business hours (weekdays 8am – 8pm, Eastern time, excluding holidays), within 15 to 30 minutes of faxing us your completed application form. You should call us at 1.888.203.7900 or 1.973.671.0040 if your phone and/or web conference is starting soon and you’re in a hurry.

2. Do I have to use the phone and web conferencing together or can I use them separately? 

You can use them together or separately. We charge for them separately, however.

3. Do you require a contract? 

We do not require a contract from you and there are no setup fees. Our standard pricing is “per-minute” and with this rate structure we do not impose any monthly minimum charges. We do require an application form with your signature to ensure that you will pay for any usage of the services.

4. Do you offer training for your services?  

Yes, we offer extensive training through your dedicated account manager or event coordinator at no charge. Depending upon what services you are planning to use, you may not need training; for example, our Reservationless phone conferencing is very easy to use.

5. Do I call you to schedule a conference?  

Not usually. Most of our customers use our on-demand, automated phone and web conferencing for their everyday meetings; no reservation required. Larger conferences and those with special needs are more likely to need our “Operator-Assisted” phone conferencing, which does require a reservation.

6. How many people can join my conference? 

Our automated phone and web conferencing accommodates up to 100 attendees by default. Call or email us if you may need to go over 100 with one of these services, please. Operator-assisted phone conferences and webcasts can handle thousands of attendees.

7. What is the difference between Operator-Assisted and Reservationless phone conferencing? 

Reservationless phone conferencing does not require advance reservation,it is fully automated, and available 24x7x365. You receive permanent dial-in numbers and entry codes and can use it any time; it’s on-demand. Operator-Assisted phone conferencing is for larger and/or more complex events and requires an advanced reservation. Typically, an operator greets all callers and gathers their contact information, introduces the speakers, monitors the entire conference, moderates live Question & Answers (Q&A) sessions and more.



7 - Day Free Trial
1. How does the free trial work? 

The 7-day free trial allows you to utilize our automated phone and web conferencing services at no charge to determine if they will meet your needs. 

1. How does Infinite compare to WebEx and LiveMeeting? 

Both are excellent products but we stack up very well. Many former WebEx and LiveMeeting customers have told us so. We typically surpass the competition in support and flexibility. 


Phone Conferencing
Reservationless Phone Conferencing
1. How will I be able to know who attended the call? 

During the conference call you can perform a roll call by dialing “#1”. Assuming you have name recording turn on (this is turned on by default), the system will play back the names of all callers. Only you, as Chairperson, will hear the roll call. After the conference, you will receive an automated email detailing the usage on your conference call. We can’t provide names unless you have activated PIN codes, however, we do provide you with the number they called from. You also receive this information on your invoice at the end of each month. 

2. How many people can our product accommodate? 

Our Reservationless (automated, 24x7 on-demand) service allows up to 100 callers by default. We can set it higher, but you will need to call us. 

3. How secure is your service? 

The service is as secure as your dial-in number and entry codes. Additionally, you have the ability to lock the conference at any time by dialing “*5”. Once you have locked the conference, nobody else can enter/listen, including our operators. Another option for highly secure conferences is turning on PIN codes for your account. This requires all callers to be setup in advance with a unique code. 

4. How do I record my conference call? 

Once dialed in as the Chairperson, you simply dial “*8” and follow the system prompts. For more detailed information and a user’s guide, click here. Once you have recorded the conference call, it remains in your account until you record again and overwrite it. Click here for instructions on giving people on-demand access to your recording via phone. See below for getting a digital copy of your recording. 

5. What is a WAV file? 

WAV is a common digital file format. When you record your conference call it is stored on our system as a digital file in the WAV format. Virtually all computers now come with free software (media players) that can play the WAV file through the computers speakers. 

6. How can I get a WAV file? 

If you want a WAV file of your recording, you must order it from us by contacting your account manager or calling Customer Service. Be sure to tell us before you make a new recording and overwrite this file. We copy the WAV to a server with public access and send you the link via email.

7. How long does it take to receive my recording and what format will it be sent in? 

The link to your WAV file will be emailed to you, generally, within about 1 hour of your conference conclusion. If you want a WAV file of your recording, you must order it from us by contacting your account manager or calling Customer Service. Access to your recording via telephone is available immediately afterwards.

8. Do I call you to schedule a conference?  

Unless you think you may have more than 100 callers, you do not need to “schedule a conference” with us at all. The service is available 24x7, on-demand. Just give your conference invitees the date and time, the dial-in number, and the Participant Entry Code.

9. What additional features do you offer for Reservationless phone conferencing (mute, etc.)? 

Some of the features that are included in the Reservationless phone conferencing service are: No reservation required, automated 24/7 service , hosts up to 100 people (can be expanded if desired), permanent Toll-free Dial-in number and entry codes, global Access and international dial-ins, free wallet cards for each user, billing code option, *0 operator support, 24X7 phone and email support, chairperson dial-out capability, automated recording and playback options, detailed invoice with cost center breakdown, and emailed phone usage summary report.

10. How do I change my room features?  

In the near future we will allow you to do this online, but for now please contact your account manager or Customer Service.

11. Why would someone choose Operator-Assisted instead of Reservationless?  

Conference calls that are very large and/or complex are often better off using professional operators. The following are just a few examples of features only available with an Operator-Assisted conference call that can add a professional polish to your event: toll Free and toll (for international callers) dial-in with live operator, operator monitoring, sub-conference, communications line, presentation mode, music hold, polling, questions and answers, and security/conference lock.

12. How can I not have people on the phone that I don't want in a particular call? 

Change your Participant Entry Code, lock your conference, or turn on PIN codes.

13. Can I have multiple chairpersons in conference? 

Yes. Multiple callers may use the Chairperson Entry Code. All Chairpersons will have access to the Chairperson-only features.

14. If I don’t use my codes for a certain period of time do they expire? 

We have never deactivated codes or accounts for inactivity in the past. In the future, should we decide to do so, you will be given plenty of advance notice via phone and email.



Operator - Assisted and Event Phone Conferencing
1. What services do I get with an Operator-Assisted conference that I don't get with the automated service? 

Operator-Assisted conferences are for those that need a professionally run conference. Here are just a few of the services that are can be included: live operator to greet each caller and collect contact information, sub-conference with multiple speakers in advance, lead operator gives real-time updates of audience counts and takes last minute script changes, lead operator to introduce speaker(s) and make announcements from your script, fully moderated questions and answer (Q&A) session (muting and unmuting of callers lines and introduction of those with questions), real-time monitoring and troubleshooting (i.e. sound quality, dialing out to missing speakers, etc.), operator announcements at the end of the conference call. 

2. How do I record?  

Just tell us that you want it recorded when you make your reservation. We take care of the rest. 

3. How will I be able to know who attended the call? 

For a small additional fee, we will send you a Participation Report which provides all the contact information our operators gathered from each caller prior to the conference call starting.



Web Conferencing
1. How many people can your product accommodate?  

WebInterpoint accommodates up to 100 by default – with no advance reservation required. If you might have more than 100 showing up, please let us know in advance so we can change your account settings.

2. How secure is your service?  

Highly. Attendees must know the date and time of your conference, the login page URL, and the Participant Entry Code to get in. All sessions use SSL encryption to keep hackers from spying on your meetings.

3. What are the major differences between per-minute web conferencing and flat rate web conferencing (payment options and features)? 

Our default pricing for WebInterpoint is per-minute; you pay only for actual usage – by the minute, per person connected. Per-minute pricing is a post-pay model; we invoice you at the end of each month based on actual usage. Our flat-rate model is a subscription-like service; you pre-pay monthly for “Rooms”. The number of Rooms you buy defines how many simultaneous meetings you can have. The size of the Room (the number of attendees it will accommodate) determines the rate you pay.

4. If I use WebInterpoint, do I have to use your phone conferencing? 

No, but for 3 or more participants, you should probably consider it.

5. Can you record my web conference?  

Yes we can, please click here for complete details on recording a web conference and the related charges.

6. How long does it take to receive my recording and what format will it be sent in? 

If your recording requires little or no editing, it will be ready within approximately 48 business hours. The format of the media file is QuickTime.

7. Is Remote Control a separate service? 

No, Remote Control and application/desktop sharing are included features of WebInterpoint. Also, our user guide gives a good overview of most features and how to initiate them.

8. If I don’t use my codes for a certain period of time do they expire? Do I need to reactivate my account? 

We have never deactivated codes or accounts for inactivity in the past. In the future, should we decide to do so, you will be given plenty of advance notice via phone and email.



Webinars
1. What is a Webinar and what makes it different than a Web Conference?  

The name implies, it is a Web-based seminar. Webinars:

-Are typically larger than a Web conference, less interactive, and more formal. 

-Tend to be scheduled much further in advance. 

-Usually are advertised on the Web and through emailed invitations. 

-Many times they require an advance registration. 

-Sometimes require a registration fee. 



Webcasting
1. What is a Webcast and what makes it different than a Web Conference?  

The name implies, it is a Web-based broadcast. Webcasts: 

-Tend to be larger than both Web conferences and Webinars, and even less interactive than a Webinar. 

-Generally have audio streaming (audio delivered via the internet), and sometimes video streaming.

WebInterpoint - Web conferencing
1. The system is telling me I have to turn off my pop-up blockers. How do I do that? 

Right click on the pop-up blocker and click on the  “Allow Pop-up blocker” message.

2. The system is telling me I need to install Java Virtual Machine. How do I do that? 

Go to www.java.com and click the “Download Software” button on the top-left.



Busy Signals
1. I’m getting busy signals when dialing in to a phone conference. What should I do?  

If you are dialing the toll-free access number and getting a busy signal, try dialing the local access number (advertised for international access). If this fails, call Customer Service at 1.888.203.7900 or 1.973.671.0040. We can either give you an alternate access number or dial out to you from the phone conferencing system.



International Access
1. How do international callers gain access to my phone conference?  

You should have been given a local access number (toll-paid / non toll-free) for people calling in from abroad. If you have lost or misplaced this access number call Customer Service at 1.888.203.7900 or 1.973.671.0040. 



Support
1. Do you offer live technical support and when is it available? 

Yes, we offer live technical support during our business hours (8am – 8pm, ET, all weekdays except USA national holidays).

Pricing

5. How much does it cost to make a recording of my phone conference? 
There is no charge to record the conference. If callers listen to the recording via phone, you are charged at the same per-minute rate as your live conference dial-in usage. If you require a digital file (WAV format) of the recording, we charge $35 to post the file to publicly reachable server.

AMENDED AND
RESTATED
 

MEMBERSHIP INTEREST OPTION
AGREEMENT
 
 

THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED MEMBERSHIP
INTEREST OPTION AGREEMENT (the “ Agreement ”) is
made and entered into this 16th day of December, 2015 (the “
Effective Date ”), by and among Infinite Conferencing,
Inc. (“ Optionee ”), and Infinite Conferencing
Partners, LLC (“ Optionor ”)

R E C I T A L S

A.

WHEREAS Optionee and Optionor entered
into a Membership Interest Option Agreement effective February 28,
2015, and the parties wish to amend such agreement to extend the
Option Term and to reflect changes in certain other financial terms
being made primarily in contemplation of additional capital
contribution and the granting of additional membership
interests.

B.

Optionee desires to be granted from
Optionor, and Optionor desires to grant to Optionee, an option to
acquire all of the membership interests in the Optionor (the
“ Membership Interests ”) for the price and upon
the terms and conditions set forth herein. Capitalized terms used
herein but not defined herein are defined in accordance with the
Sale Agreement entered contemporaneously herewith between Optionor
and Optionee.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
mutual promises and representations set forth herein and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

1.

Recitals .  The recitals set forth above in Paragraph A
are true and correct and are hereby incorporated herein.

2.

Options .

(a)

Grant of Option
.  Optionor hereby grants an
irrevocable option during the Option Term, as defined below, (the
“ Option ”) to Optionee to purchase from
Optionor all the Membership Interests, which can be exercised as
set forth below.  The Optionee shall not have the right to
exercise the Option for less than all of the outstanding Membership
Interests.

(b)

Exercise of Option
.  Optionee shall have the right to
exercise the Option to purchase the Membership Interests at any
time beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the date that is
two (2) years from the Effective Date (the “ Option
Term ”) by sending an option notice, as described below,
to Optionor hereunder (the date of such option notice shall be
referred to herein as the  “ Exercise Date
”).

(c)

Option Notice .  In the event that Optionee desires to
exercise the Option, Optionee shall send written notice to Optionor
that Optionee is exercising the Option
 
 
 
 





 

to purchase the Membership Interests
hereunder.  Optionor shall send notice to its members within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of such notice.

(d)

Closing .  The closing of a purchase of the Membership
Interests after the timely exercise of an Option hereunder (the
“ Option Closing ”), shall take place at
the offices of the Optionor at such time as Optionor and Optionee
shall mutually agree, which in no event shall be later than the
date that is thirty (30) days following the timely exercise of the
Option hereunder.

(e)

Distributions. The Option granted hereby does not prevent or
encumber or affect in any respect any distribution by the Optionor
to its members of the preferred return (equal to an annual rate of
30% of each Optionor member’s capital contribution to the
Company) (the “ Preferred Return ”) accruing
prior to the Option Closing.

(f)

Sale of Customer Accounts.
 Subject to the Right of First
Refusal (as hereinafter defined), Optionor agrees that it shall
retain ownership of the customer accounts, attached on Exhibit
A hereto (the “ Customer Accounts ”), for
not less than six (6) months from the Effective Date, provided that
a notice of offer shall not be delivered by Optionor to Optionee
earlier than six (6) months after the Effective Date. Optionor may
sell the Customer Accounts thereafter to a third party
(“Third Party”) in a bona fide transaction.  In
the event of sale of the Customer Accounts by the Optionor, an
amount equal to the Option Price (or lesser sale proceeds),
excluding any accounting fees, shall be distributed to the members
of the Optionor at the time of such sale, and Optionee shall have
no right to prevent such distribution to members of Optionor.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Optionee shall continue to
have an Option on membership interests (to acquire Optionor,
including the undistributed sale proceeds in excess of the amount
to be distributed as contemplated by this Section 2(f)).

(g)

Encumbering Membership
Interests .  During the
Option Term, and until the Option Closing in the event of a timely
exercise of the Option hereunder, neither Optionor nor its members
will (i) encumber any of the assets or membership interests of
Optionor to any party, other than Optionee or (ii) incur any
liability whatsoever, whether actual or contingent, other than per
the terms and provisions of the Operating Agreement and the
Management Services Agreement between Optionor and Optionee dated
of even date herewith (the “ Management Agreement
”).

(h)

Liens on Optionor’s
Assets .  To accommodate
the exercise of the Option by Optionee, Optionor shall not place a
lien on the Customer Accounts.

3.

Payment .

(a)

Purchase Price .  The purchase price (the “ Option
Price ”) for the Membership Interests to be purchased
pursuant to this Agreement shall be equal to the sum of: (i) all of
Optionor’s members’ initial capital contributions
(which shall not be less than the purchase price for the Customer
Accounts); (ii) $100,000 in additional capital arising from that
certain Agreement to Amend dated December ____, 2015 between
Optionor and Optionor’s members, to the extent this amount is
not duplicated as

 part of item (i) hereof; (iii) to
the extent not previously paid, the Optionor’s Members’
Preferred Return for the period prior to the Option Closing, but
not less than six months; (iv) an amount equal to five percent (5%)
of the Optionor’s Member’s initial capital contribution
(which shall increase by one and one-quarter percent (1.25%) for
each quarterly period beginning twelve (12) months after the
Effective Date) and (v) any reasonable costs incurred by
Optionor’s designated agent in connection with the exercise
of the Option and distributing the proceeds of the Option. In the
event of a sale by Optionor of the Customer Accounts, the Option
Price shall be reduced by the proceeds received through such sale
distributed to the Optionor’s members (but not below
$0).

(b)

  Deliveries at Closing .
 At the Option Closing, Optionee and Optionor shall deliver to
or cause to be delivered the following:

(i)

Assignment .  Optionor shall, or shall cause its members
to, execute all documents necessary to convey the relevant
Membership Interests to Optionee.

(ii)

Purchase Price .  Optionee shall deliver to the members of the
Optionor immediately prior to the Option Closing, as their
interests appear on the books and records of the Optionor, the
Option Price in immediately available funds.

4.

Right of First Refusal
.  Optionor grants to Optionee a
right of first refusal on any sale of the Customer Accounts by
Optionor (the “ Right of First Refusal ”).
 Optionee shall have a right of first refusal to purchase the
Customer Accounts at a purchase price and on those terms and
conditions equal to that purchase price and those terms and
conditions offered to Optionor by a third party in an arm’s
length transaction (“ Third Party Offer ”).
 Optionor shall give written notice to Optionee of a bona fide
Third Party Offer.  Such notice shall detail the purchase
price and other material terms and conditions. Optionee shall have
one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of such written
notice to exercise its Right of First Refusal or the Option (and
retain the Customer Accounts).  For the avoidance of doubt,
the Optionee shall have the right to exercise the Option during
such 120 day period in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
