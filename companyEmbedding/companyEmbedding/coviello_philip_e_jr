Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Energy and retail companies dominate the list of losers. The benchmark S&P 500 index lost 0.9% on Thursday and has pulled back 1.8% since its most recent closing high on June 19. While the numbers don't seem alarming, the tone in the financial media has turned negative. Don't miss: Should you sell the U.S. stock market and buy the rest of the world?

Here are some possible bargains for income-seeking investors willing to consider contrarian plays. The S&P 500 index is up 9% so far in 2017, but there are losers in any market. And that's where you might find long- term bargains, along with the expected batch of companies facing painful secular declines.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.
