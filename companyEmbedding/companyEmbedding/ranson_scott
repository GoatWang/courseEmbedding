Would definitely purchase again.Functionality and good looksMy son was pleased with how he looked and how the goggles perform. Good Product Not as large as I would have like but pretty good otherwise. doing a great job to accommodate my eye glassesI always struggled to position my eye glasses in the right spot with my old googles. To do this in a cold area and with my gloves off, it was more than a hassle. This goggle does exactly what it said. I can easily pull it down and cover my eye glasses directly.Sponsored LinksWhat's This?BrandsSmith OpticsBolleRevoHot OptixAvg.

Factory Description

                                 An all-mountain master of epic proportions, Scott's Ransom 20 tackles the ups and the downs with equal voracity. It boasts a light monocoque aluminum frame with an adjustable rear shock that gives you three suspension modes (locked out, 100mm- and 165mm-travel) for the ultimate in trail domination. For even more bump control, the Ransom features a 160mm-travel RockShox Lyrik R fork, Avid Elixir discs and fat Schwalbe knobbies. Plus, you'll appreciate the smooth-rolling Alex wheels, the quick-shifting SRAM/Shimano drivetrain and Scott's awesome aluminum components.

            "Terrific blend of cross-country weight with freeride bump-eating."
        Skip to view deals for Ransom 20 (08)The Ransom 20 is the cheapest way to get Scott's rock-devouring  all-mountain carbon fiber frame. Its components are still good enough  to preserve the Ransom's famed do-everything capabilities.Ride & handling: ability-challenging funThe Ransom is a fascinating blend of cross-country and  all-mountain capabilities. Six inches of travel either end, upright  position and big brakes says all-mountain, but it turns out to flow  beautifully through singletrack.   That makes the Ransom an all-day bike with some superbly useful  extra top end for those moments when things get fast.As a card-carrying cross-country wuss I initially found it on the  scary side of exciting when the going got steep. The Ransom bounds  away from you quickly, unaffected by trivia like rocks, boulders and  small cars. A fast, steep descent immediately becomes an exercise in  hanging on and praying.When you get used to it though – wa-hoo! Flip the Travel Control  lever on the bar to full-travel 'sled mode' and awaaaaaay you go. I  was thankful, time and again, for the smooth control and huge power  of the Avid Juicy brakes.   Being able to limit the travel to 3.5 inches for dirt climbs and  zero for tarmac is a boon. With the suspension locked in short-travel  mode, the bike sits up and pootles pleasantly uphill. It's never  going to be a lightweight cross-country bike on the climbs – not  even a fully suspended one – but its plenty tolerable for the  payback.Where the Ransom struggles is steep, technical climbs. Faced with  a sequence of steps and ledges its heft and long front end make it  less than sprightly. It's fine if you can rush the problem and muscle  through it, letting the suspension soak up the edges, but it lacks  low-speed finesse.It's an amazing package though, and perfectly suited to a  cross-country rider who wants to play in the steeps but still ride  back up.Chassis: long-travel carbon lovelinessThe Ransom's carbon frame is the most visually and technically  startling aspect of the bike. Carbon is seen as the material for  super-light, flighty cross-country hardtails, not all-mountain trail  tyrants. But Scott's execution in the Ransom has proven robust;  there's something like 300g of extra material in there beyond what  Scott thinks is essential to make sure its tough.Nestling low in the frame is Scott's Equalizer triple chamber  shock. This custom air-sprung unit offers seven different  adjustments, and its vital to take the time to get it dialled in.  Once you do, it combines with the linkage-activated, low-pivot to  provide suspension travel with that bottomless feel that's  nevertheless tightly controlled: it never bounces or wallows, just  soaks up the bumps.We ended up running the pressure a bit softer than Scott  recommends. That increased the sag and made the back end feel deep,  plush and absorptive of everything.   Equipment: decent midrange gearThe Ransom 20 sports a carefully chosen selection of parts that  complement its abilities and tread the fine line between durability  and excessive gram count.The SRAM X-9 rear derailleur, SRAM X-7 triggers and Shimano Deore  LX front derailleur combine with the SRAM chain and cassette to make  up a quick-shifting, fuss-free transmission.Our only gripe with the gears is that we'd like an 11-34 cassette  instead of the fitted 11-32.  The Ransom climbs well for a 6.5in  travel bike, but you still need all the help you can get to haul its  15.4kg (33.9lb) heft upslope.Own-brand wheels can be a bit of a red light, but Scott's SOS P1  rims have handled my lack of finesse and shrugged off at least one  rib-bruising crash.They're shod with Schwalbe Nobby Nicks, which everyone loves in  moist conditions, but which we found a bit skatey on loose, dry  Australian trails. Getting the tyre pressure exactly right helped:  too soft and they fold, too hard and they skim.   Avid Juicy Five brakes may not be as light or as tweakable as  their more expensive stablemates, but they have plenty of stopping  power. Initially a bit grabby, they bedded in to   The Maverick Speedball high-adjustable seatpost quickly becomes  addictive. Steep drop? Flip the saddle down, and roll off. Riding  along? Flip it back up and away you go. If there was a 27.2mm version  available I'd be reaching for my credit card to fit one to my main  bike. (Speedball design licensee Crank Brothers says the 27.2mm  version announced at Interbike last year is coming in 2009.)We were less impressed with the rather clunky Scott own-brand saddle and swapped it for something less over-padded and in the way.Conclusion: push yourselfThe Ransom 20 is the perfect bike for a cross-country rider who wants to extend his or her skills into bigger stuff, and Scott's done a good job of speccing it to get the price halfway reasonable, for a carbon fiber suspension bike. It's still far from cheap, but you get a hell of a lot of bike for your money.Get inspired by our deals

            "An amazing all-mountain bike, but it needs the right terrain to get the best from it"
        Skip to view deals for Ransom 10 (08)The Scott Ransom is a mould-breaking do-everything bike with a  distinct Alpine nutter slant, but it still climbs reasonably well   because of its on-the-fly shock adjustment.   This is an agile singletrack machine, whipping in and out of  twisty trails with a lightness that’s surprising when you consider  its weight. It also climbs reasonably well and excels on downhills.  We never noticed the near-ﬁve pounds of extra weight the Ransom  carries over our regular shorter-travel cross-country full-susser.Ride & handling: unstoppable downhill, surprisingly good upScott achieved the rare feat of building a long-travel bike that  pedals properly while still being able to soak up major terrain with  ease. Whichever way you cut the Ransom, it’s a challenging bike,  and proves that Scott isn’t afraid to spit in the face of  convention.Take in its butch looks and a weight of more than 30lb, and you’d  be forgiven for assuming that climbing on the Ransom is akin to  pushing a three-seater sofa uphill. Climbing on the Scott isn’t  going to make you feel like an athlete, but if you use the gears  provided and give yourself a sensible timeframe to make it up the  mountain, you will get there.   And you’ll be able to pedal all the way to the top. Traction is  one thing this bike delivers in spades. When you hit those  super-slow, slippery, rocky-rooty climbs, just relax, hit the  bar-mounted TC switch to set the shock in ‘Traction’ mode, and  keep the torque low. With the help of the bitey Schwalbe tyres, the  bike will then give you the summit on a silver tray.Wipe the sweat from your brow – and you will be sweating – and  release the TC switch back to the 165mm/6.5inch All-Travel mode.  You’re now clear to run amok, pumping and pushing every lump, bump,  rock, root, dip and turn. You’ll marvel at the suspension’s  ability to eat trail while you hit the gas without feeling like  you’re pedalling a jelly.   Some of this excellent trail behaviour can be attributed to the  frame’s inherent design, although a good deal must also be  apportioned to the Equalizer rear shock and the RockShox Lyrik fork.  Both are able to balance the demands for both buttery-smooth travel  and efﬁcient hill climbing with the sort of dexterity usually  reserved for circus plate-spinners.   With the fork in full 160mm travel mode, the Ransom feels easy to  steer even with its 68-degree head angle – you don’t get the  ﬂoppy front wheel feeling that some long-travel trail bikes have.  Wind the travel down (with the rear to match) and it becomes a more  precise climber, but you’re only counting the seconds before you  can ﬂick it back to life.   This bike isn’t meant to be tippy-toed around the mountain, it’s  supposed to grind it into dust – a job the Ransom does only too  well. Hell, it doesn’t even spit out the stones. If you like the  sound of this but still aren’t convinced by carbon, then try one of  the cheaper alloy-framed versions, with the bonus of a further degree  off the head angle for an aggressive ride back down the mountain.Frame: Why carbon ﬁbre?   That’s the question many people pose when faced with the Ransom  – it’s not the material you’d immediately think of for a tough  all-mountain bike.But Scott’s reply is: “why not?” The company has spent more  time honing its understanding, design and production skills with  carbon ﬁbre than any other bike maker. For Scott, making the Ransom  out of carbon wasn’t a risk, at least not in a material sense. The  only risk was that buyers might not believe it could cope with  all-mountain levels of punishment.To play on the safe side, though, Scott also offers two Ransom  models with an alloy frame – the 30 and 40.The burly-looking Ransom certainly stands out, even in the butch  world of all-mountain bikes. This is largely down to the over-sizing  of almost every tube one the frame. The splitting of the top/seat  tube brace adds to the Ransom’s ‘meaty’ feeling.   At 6.8lb including the rear shock, the carbon heart of the Ransom  is ﬁt and lithe, leading to an all-up weight of an astonishing  14.25kg/31.39lb for this ‘10’ model. Choose the top-of-the-range  Ltd model and you break the magic 30lb barrier.One of the Ransom’s standout features is Scott’s bespoke rear  shock, called Equalizer TC. The innovative system, with its triple  chamber, comes with a bar-mounted remote lever that allows you to  select the optimum shock and ride feel on the move. Choose between  ‘Lock-out’ mode, ‘Traction’ mode (with 3.5 inches of rear  travel) and ‘All-Travel’ (6.5in of travel), simply by ﬂicking  the lever.Equipment: specced for performance not gramsAny bike which can pack the 160mm travel punch and still make it  to within a whisker of 30lb without recourse to unsuitable  lightweight shortcuts in componentry deserves a medal before it even  turns a pedal.   Better than that, the Ransom 10 – as specced from the factory –  comes with everything you need to challenge any alpine trail. From  the serious 2.4in Schwalbe Nobby Nic tyres on tough DT Swiss E540  wheels, to the full-length fully sealed cables and sweet Maverick  Speedball height-adjustable seat post, this is deﬁnitely a case of  Scott speccing for ability, not weight limits.Verdict: for non-technophobes with real mountains to play inWho should buy the Ransom? Any ambitious ‘real mountain’ rider  who also wants to bathe in the warm waters of cutting-edge mountain  bike technology. Certainly technophobes need not apply – they’d  get a headache trying to understand the Equalizer shock.It must be said the Ransom needs to be owned by people who ride on  rough, tough hills on a regular basis. If you live and ride in  Surrey, the Ransom just doesn’t make sense. Leave it in the shop,  and buy a Scott Spark instead – you’ll get a lot more use out of  it.The designer saysPeter Denk was responsible for many of Scott’s innovative bikes.  He now has his own company, Denk Engineering, but still has a soft  spot for the Ransom…How do you feel about the Ransom now you’ve left Scott?The Ransom is my baby, and still the bike I love the most. I  believe this kind of versatile bike, with its adjustable rear shock,  is how mountain bikes will be in the future. Riders will be happy to  shift the suspension as well as the gears.Was the Ransom concept-driven or material-driven?Absolutely concept-driven. With the Genius shock, we introduced  the concept of adjustable spring rates, but the difference between  traction and full mode wasn’t big enough for our tastes. Developing  the OTS Equalizer gave us the possibility to realise a shock where  the spring rate could be doubled.The Ransom was the platform around which we designed the OTS. That  we did it out of carbon as well was because we wanted it as light as  possible. However, for us the revolution is not that we saved 500  grams; it’s that the Ransom makes you start riding differently.  You’ll head for steeper and more technical hills than ever before,  and that’s just pure fun.Do you think you could have developed the Ransom further? We could have built it much lighter, but then it wouldn’t have  had that aggressive look — and style is fundamental in this  category. Also, we sacriﬁ ced a lot of weight because having a seat  post that you can lower is a must.Does it make you proud that no one else has produced a challenger  for the Ransom? Actually it makes me a bit sad that it takes such a long time to  bring a multi-travel concept to the market. It was the same when we  started developing long-travel XC bikes — it took years to convince  people that you wouldn’t lose too much energy.The ContendersGT Sanction £2499: The Sanction has a slackened  geometry, six inches of travel and a healthy heritage, thanks to GT’s  experience of building no-nonsense full-suspension bikes.

CryptoWall Ransomware Removal Report










































				CryptoWall Ransomware			

CryptoWall Ransomware Description
The CryptoWall Ransomware is a ransomware Trojan that carries the same strategy as a number of other encryption ransomware infections such as Cryptorbit Ransomware or CryptoLocker Ransomware. The CryptoWall Ransomware is designed to infect all versions of Windows, including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8. As soon as the CryptoWall Ransomware infects a computer, the CryptoWall Ransomware uses the RSA2048 encryption to encrypt crucial files. Effectively, the CryptoWall Ransomware prevents computer users from accessing their data, which will be encrypted and out of reach. The CryptoWall Ransomware claims that it is necessary to pay $500 USD to recover the encrypted data. The payment is demanded using TOR and Bitcoins in order to maintain the recipients' anonymity. Malware researchers strongly advise against paying the CryptoWall Ransomware ransom. This only encourages ill-minded persons to continue carrying these types of attacks and does not guarantee that you will recover your data.
Fake Updates and Spam Emails may Bring the CryptoWall Ransomware to Your Computer
The CryptoWall Ransomware is distributed as a fake update for applications such as Adobe Reader, Flash Player or the Java Runtime Environment. These types of updates may be offered in pop-up windows when you visit unsafe websites or when a Potentially Unwanted Program is installed on your computer. The CryptoWall Ransomware also may be distributed using spam email attachments and other typical threat delivery methods. Apart from encrypting your software, the CryptoWall Ransomware will also drop the files DECRYPT_INSTRUCTION.txt, DECRYPT_INSTRUCTION.html and DECRYPT_INSTRUCTION.url into directories where the CryptoWall Ransomware has encrypted data. The CryptoWall Ransomware uses the following ransom message to demand payment:
Decrypt service
Your files are encrypted.
To get the key to decrypt files you have to pay 500 USD/EUR. If payments is not made before [date] the cost of decrypting files will increase 2 times and will be 1000 USD/EUR Prior to increasing the amount left: [count down timer]
We are present a special software - CryptoWall Decrypter - which is allow to decrypt and return control to all your encrypted files. How to buy CryptoWall decrypter?

3. Send 1.22 BTC to Bitcoin address: 1BhLzCZGY6dwQYgX4B6NR5sjDebBPNapvv
4. Enter the Transaction ID and select amount.
5. Please check the payment information and click 'PAY'.

					Threat Scorecard
					?
						
							The ESG Threat Scorecard is an assessment report that is given to every malware threat that has been collected and analyzed through our Malware Research Center. The ESG Threat Scorecard evaluates and ranks each threat by using several metrics such as trends, incidents and severity over time.
							
							In addition to the effective scoring for each threat, we are able to interpret anonymous geographic data to list the top three countries infected with a particular threat. The data used for the ESG Threat Scorecard is updated daily and displayed based on trends for a 30-day period. The ESG Threat Scorecard is a useful tool for a wide array of computer users from end users seeking a solution to remove a particular threat or security experts pursuing analysis and research data on emerging threats.
							
							Each of the fields listed on the ESG Threat Scorecard, containing a specific value, are as follows:
							
Ranking: The current ranking of a particular threat among all the other threats found on our malware research database.
							
Threat Level: The level of threat a particular PC threat could have on an infected computer. The threat level is based on a particular threat's behavior and other risk factors. We rate the threat level as low, medium or high. The different threat levels are discussed in the SpyHunter Risk Assessment Model.
							
Infected PCs: The number of confirmed and suspected cases of a particular threat detected on infected PCs retrieved from diagnostic and scan log reports generated by SpyHunter's Spyware Scanner.
							
% Change: The daily percent change in the frequency of infected PCs of a specific threat. The formula for percent changes results from current trends of a specific threat. An increase in the rankings of a specific threat yields a recalculation of the percentage of its recent gain. When a specific threat's ranking decreases, the percentage rate reflects its recent decline. For a specific threat remaining unchanged, the percent change remains in its current state. The % Change data is calculated and displayed in three different date ranges, in the last 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days. Next to the percentage change is the trend movement a specific malware threat does, either upward or downward, in the rankings. Each level of movement is color coded: a green up-arrow (∧) indicates a rise, a red down-arrow (∨) indicates a decline, and a brown equal symbol (=) indicates no change or plateaued.
							
Top 3 Countries Infected: Lists the top three countries a particular threat has targeted the most over the past month. This data allows PC users to track the geographic distribution of a particular threat throughout the world.

My computer was infected with the CryptoWall Ransomware virus
I tried different free tools to decrypt my files, but nothing helped.
Does anybody have a solution how to get back my data?
Thanks

I think that the big Ransomware risk if the hackers will succeed to infect the most of company’s servers. In that case the company will not be able to work at all, and may be there will not be recovery option without pay the ransom. What is your recommendation for such case

I have both my computer hard drives cloned with true image. I also have all my important date, files, movies, pictures, bills, everything, on two different external hard drives. 
If these guys ever come to me, I would tell them to go F*** themselves!
I was told in 1998, but a guy that built me my first desktop computer. If you want to keep it, don’t put it on a computer. And never use your real name when filing out anything online! 
I had maybe four viruses. They were my fault, as I was downloading movies. No, not porn. I had that virus gone in less than an hour!

My computer was infected with the CryptoWall Ransomware virus.  SpyHunter was able to remove the infection in full after a remote session with one of their technicians.  Unfortunately I was unable to recover my files as the virus deleted all shadow files or previous restore points.  Sadly I didn’t do a recent backup, and lost several files.  Thanks to SpyHunter I’m back up and running though.  Very satisfied with their software and technical support.  Top notch!! 
If anyone has any other information on how I might be able to recovery encrypted files please advise.  Referred to all the links provided by SpyHunter support but no luck.  Aside from paying the ransom, I’m open to suggestions.
Thanks.

I was afraid my entire network would be affected but as soon as I discovered something funny on my wife’s computer I cut the sharing options and put her IP in my firewall list.
If anybody knows where these arseholes live or work, I would like to know. Please, someone let me know and I’ll fix them the old fashioned way.

The virus hit one PC and of course encrypted as much as it had access too but nobody let us know (we’re  an outsourced IT support company) so it had all yesterday afternoon to worm its way around and this morning. I just wanted to get something clear; is the program local to one machine’s available places to access or once its gotten to as far as it can on the server through that first user’s machine, can it jump across to other users’ machines, start the executable from there and then get more access, or is it only local to the machine the virus hit?





Terri:

Found that some files can be recovered by right clicking and choosing previous versions. Only do this after running a full antivirus scan otherwise..anything that this computer touches will get infected. DO NOT ATTACH USB DRIVES WHILE INFECTED!!!

The latest version of Cryptowall wipes out all your files wholesale. The only way to have your files back is by using data recovery softwares or better yet, from an external source..





Tim S:		


	3 years ago			

To Richard Carry: You say you were able to decrypt the files? exactly how? My mother’s computer was hit – Oct 24, 2014.
For those whose are ‘adamant’ about not paying to having them decrypted obviously haven’t lost years of files that include financial, family history, personal files!!!! We would be more than willing to pay, but a service tech wipe the computer clean (of the virus) before we realized the only way to get them decrypted was to pay them! Now we have over 4000 encrypted, useless files! We had the files back-up on an external hard drive that was connected to the computer. The virus hit that too!





Victim too:

Paying these thieves is like negotiating with terrorists, if you pay you’re only making things worse and you’re voluntarily inviting them into your computer to make things worse down the road.  Plus you’re wearing a target since they know you’ve paid before… you’ll keep paying again.
These people will eventually get caught. Don’t be a part of the problem.

Should I go ahead paying the Cryptowall? If I pay what are the chance of decrypt my file?





Richard Carey:		


	3 years ago			

I have seen this Trojan first hand once. The original file is not deleted, so you cannot recover deleted files to get yourself out of trouble.
I can’t believe that some of you have talked to a number of IT specialists and they have told you to pay the ransom!
I have recovered the files twice that were encrypted by cryptowall. Once locally, the second time, across the globe.





Deb s:

I got the virus last night.  I have an image backup from an external drive but it does not include all files as I save some files directly to a 2nd drive.  Unfortunately this drive was connected last night when I got the virus and it also got the virus.  My virus software IT dept says that it seems to just be Malware that encrypts the files and deletes the original.  My dilemma is that I need to try to recover the files on the external drive – is this possible?





Shannon:

have there been any positive results in retrieving the data left on the hard drive. i have been infected on a windows 7 machine





bokchoy:		


	3 years ago			

Windows 7 has previous file options which you may be able to go back to… otherwise, if you don’t have backups you’re SOL unless you want to pay $500 extortion to get the decrypt ability.
In response to the article, the exe file created seems to be random.  The one I saw had a different random string of charactors for a name.  I’ve seen cryptolocker before, and cryptolocker appeared to act faster or more efficiently.
I’m working on clean up now and there’s directories that have some files encrypted whereas others are not.  So I’m confused as to whether I just got to it in time or what.
For any average user, sorry if you’ve gotten infected.  $500 is a bit much for most people but if you don’t have back ups that’s the only current way to get your files back.  In the future keep backups on a device that’s not left connected to your computer.





Dolmac:

Here is how to recover your files:
The ransomware function this way :
When a user launch it (usually by email) it will encrypt all their files and add in each directory a document explaining that they will have to pay in Bitcoin 500$ to recover their files. 
FYI, if you pay, you will actually recover your files, but is there another solution than paying 500 or 1000$ to some kind of mafia ? Yes.
1.
Power-Off the machine : the faster the better
CryptoWall operate this way :
First it will do a copy of your original file, and encrypt it with what they claim to be a RSA2048 key. Then it will delete the original files. It goes on until it encrypted all files on all disks and network shares the user can access.
In a second time it will try to delete any windows shadowcopies of your files to prevent you to recover a previous &quot;unencrypted&quot; version of your files.
The reason you should power off the machine quickly is that it might prevent the suppression of shadowcopies. Then all you have to do is power on the machine, press F8, launch it in Safe mode, and use antimalware programs to clean the virus. then use the &quot;precedent version&quot; tab on properties of your user folders to recover unencrypted files.
2.
 What if you have no shadow copies and no backup of your files ? There is still a way.
As I said, Cryptowall doesn’t encrypt your original files. It will do a copy of it, encrypt it, and delete the original file.
As you probably know, a deleted file can be recover if nothing as been written over it on your disk. Good think you quickly power off the machine soon after the infection !
Now all you have to do is take your hard drive out, put it in another machine as external drive, or second drive if you don’t have a sata dock, an run a file recovery program.
I use Ontrack EasyRecovery or R-Studio, or even DataRescue for Mac.
The pro version of Ontrack EasyRecovery might also be able to recover files from a RAID array if one of your network share as been encrypted and you don’t have backups.
All these programs will be able to recover the original files deleted by Cryptowall.
Just make sure when you run those to NOT do it directly on the original machine as by writing on your infected disk, the program could Overwrite your deleted files.
You should be able to recover 99% of your files using this method.
After you recover your files, always do a clean format / install of your machine.
Of course the best way to protect you from this kind of virus is always the same :
Have a backup. Always. And a good up to date AV.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Free Shipping.*EXTRA 10% OFFSelect Furniture*Shop NowRelated Product Reviewsdoing a great job to accommodate my eye glassesI always struggled to position my eye glasses in the right spot with my old googles. To do this in a cold area and with my gloves off, it was more than a hassle. This goggle does exactly what it said. I can easily pull it down and cover my eye glasses directly.great!great for our family ski trip - better than using rental helmets - good price, nice adjustable fit (and they are cute!)Quality Helmet Except for Painful RivetThe helmet has excellent quality with it's style, fit, and padding. On the first usage of the helmet on the ski slope, we were surprised when our 8 year old daughter told us that the helmet was hurting her head.   We took off her helmet and looked inside it. Behind the circular adjustment was a 1/8th inch round rivet that is exposed and protrudes by 1/16th of an inch.   

Of course we had cut the tags at home. We put the helmet back on her head and tucked her jacket hood between the helmet and the back of her head so that she could ski comfortably.. Now that we are back home, I'm looking into putting duct tape or finding some extra bicycle helmet padding to attach or glue onto the helmet.

Our other Lucky Bums helmets do not have this protruding rivet and are covered with padding.  So hopefully your helmet will be fine.Great helmet.Our son used this helmet from 9 months in a pack on my back while skiing. A year and a half on my back and up to three years when my son was skiing tip to bottom. The helmet is very adjustable and when our broke they sent us a new one no questions asked. Great helmet for very young snow sports and very adjustable. Decent helmet.Decent helmet. I would recommend this item for anyone that does not need specific or odd fitting headgear.Had to return it...You know how it is when you order something online that is sized - a 'hit or miss' proposition. Have to say the Lucky Bums Snow Sport Helmets run small as compared to their reported size. Would have kept the helmet if it was just a tad bigger. Overstock let me return the helmet ***.Very satisfiedI ended up ordering four of these helmets (two black and two silver) for my family to go snow skiing.  We were all satisfied and have no complaints.Snomobile helmetMy son uses the helmet and likes it very much has ventilation in so shield does not fog up and size fits well for him supports neck the way the helmet is formed and paded.Good quality helmetThis is the first ski helmet I have ever bought/worn. I bought it mainly to attach a camera to it while I ski. The helmet was nice it is warm! I didn't wear any type of hat with it except for one cold day in Colorado when it was below zero. I liked it I shopped around this was the best price I could find.Sponsored LinksWhat's This?BrandsSmith OpticsBolleRevoRaiderLucky BumsCapixVenturaHot OptixSportsSnowboardSkiCyclingSizes2XL3XLExtra LargeLargeMediumSmallSort by:Sort ByBest SellingPrice Low - HighPrice High - LowAvg.
