In that role, Michalak will report directly to Comerica Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ralph W.

As Chief Risk Officer, Michalak will be responsible for overseeing risk on an enterprise-wide basis. This includes ongoing compliance with policies and procedures relating to risk management governance, risk management procedures, and risk control infrastructure, and monitoring compliance with such policies and procedures, among other responsibilities.
"As a 26-year veteran of Comerica with significant risk management experience, Mike is ideally suited to become our banking company's Chief Risk Officer," said Babb.
Michalak joined Comerica in 1988 in the Asset Liability Management area and was named Treasurer of the Corporation in 1996.

The Amazon.com Textbooks Store




	
Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year?

When you come to Amazon.com, you can save money by buying cheap new and used textbooks and by renting textbooks for college. You can also trade your used textbooks for an Amazon Gift Card, whether you bought your books from us or not.

Don’t worry about selection, we’ve got your textbook needs covered for any subject from biology, chemistry, and nursing to accounting, arts, and engineering. Once you’re finished with your textbooks you can trade them in at Amazon.com and get up to 80% of their value in an Amazon Gift Card.   

Shop the Amazon Textbooks Store and save up to 90% on textbook rentals, up to 90% on used textbooks, and up to 50% on new textbooks. You can also enjoy Free Two-Day Shipping on millions of items, including cheap college textbooks, when you join Prime Student.
