BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Staying out of the money pit: Avoiding a bad homeBuying a home is always a bit of gamble, even with new homes. The largest gamble is a pre-owned home. You need to be careful to not get stuck with a money pit. Here are 5 simple ways to avoid getting stuck with a giant money pit:The layout and size - Look closely at how the house is designed and how your family will use it. If you might need to put on an addition, it’s going to cost you. Also, think about how your family might change in the next 20 years.Neighbors - Look closely at how the neighborhood fits with your needs. If the neighborhood is an uncomfortable place, you might find yourself moving much sooner than you had planned.Condition - When you look at the home, you need to think about more than just what shows up on the home inspection. Calculate the costs of repainting, new molding, and nearly everything else. It can cost you thousands just to fix the house up the way you want.Resale potential - Think ahead to how much this home might be worth when you go to sell. You might not want to think about getting rid of the house that you just bought, but it’s likely that you will at some point, so plan ahead.Shopping and arts - The proximity to shopping and arts can be a great indication of the neighborhood and the home’s long-term value. Closer is always better and will increase the value of the house.

Staying out of the money pit: Avoiding a bad homeBuying a home is always a bit of gamble, even with new homes. The largest gamble is a pre-owned home. You need to be careful to not get stuck with a money pit. Here are 5 simple ways to avoid getting stuck with a giant money pit:The layout and size - Look closely at how the house is designed and how your family will use it. If you might need to put on an addition, it’s going to cost you. Also, think about how your family might change in the next 20 years.Neighbors - Look closely at how the neighborhood fits with your needs. If the neighborhood is an uncomfortable place, you might find yourself moving much sooner than you had planned.Condition - When you look at the home, you need to think about more than just what shows up on the home inspection. Calculate the costs of repainting, new molding, and nearly everything else. It can cost you thousands just to fix the house up the way you want.Resale potential - Think ahead to how much this home might be worth when you go to sell. You might not want to think about getting rid of the house that you just bought, but it’s likely that you will at some point, so plan ahead.Shopping and arts - The proximity to shopping and arts can be a great indication of the neighborhood and the home’s long-term value. Closer is always better and will increase the value of the house.
