(NYSE:T) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»AT&T: Oversold, Unloved, And Poised To PopJul.21.17 | About: AT&T Inc. (T) David Alton Clark Long/short equity, tech, banks, oil & gasCNBC PRO ColumnSummaryAT&T shares hit a new 52 week low. Nevertheless, the stock quickly bounced off the low and is up over 1% on Thursday.Recently, certain bears have acknowledged the stock may offer a solid buying opportunity at this level and have begun to turn bullish.We believe the stock may be poised to pop when earnings are announced next week. In the following piece we divulge our take on the current state of affairs.

 What Happened? AT&T (NYSE: T) is set to report earnings next week and the set up actually looks quite promising to us. Expectations couldn’t be set any lower at present. The stock is trading just off its 52-week low. Current Chart 

 Source: finviz.com On 4/25/2017, AT&T reported first quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of $0.74 per share. This result was in-line with the consensus of the 22 analysts following the company and beat last year's first quarter results by 2.78%. 

 Source: scottrade.com The next earnings announcement is expected on 07/25/2017 after the market closes. At present, AT&T's P/E ratio is vastly lower than the telecommunications services industry average and signals that investors are not willing to pay a premium for this stock.
 

 Source: scottrade.com During the past year earnings growth has lagged the company’s historical five year growth rate. However, considerable EPS growth is expected to over the next five years. If the company can execute on its planned transformation from a wireless carrier one trick pony into a Technology, Media and Telecommunications (TMT) giant EPS should increase significantly. However, believers are few and far between, and that is just the way I like it. Contrarian plays few and far between 

 "Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect." ~ Mark Twain With the stock market continuing to take out new all-time highs day and after day, buying opportunities are becoming harder and harder to find. At this point it’s akin to finding a needle in a haystack. All sectors are up year-to-date with the exception of the energy and telecom sectors. 

 Source: Bloomberg.com Of course there is much debate on what truly represents a buying opportunity when the market is hitting new all-time highs. Some believe it is better to go with the leaders such as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) rather than the laggards such as AT&T. Nevertheless, we believe many will begin to take profits on the leaders as they have run up into the stratosphere and reallocate those funds into the laggards with solid long-term growth prospects such as AT&T. The key is to get in prior to this happening. The upcoming earnings announcement may be just the catalyst the bulls have been waiting for. Here is what I expect.
 Subscriber losses less than expected? I found this interesting tidbit of information while performing some further due diligence regarding wireless subscriber gains and losses. 

 Source: businessinsider.com We were thinking the picture would be much bleaker for AT&T regarding subscriber losses due to the wireless wars. Nonetheless, AT&T seems to be holding its own at present. On an anecdotal note, we am currently considering switching from Sprint (NYSE: S) to AT&T for our wireless services due to the fact AT&T’s offer appears to be the better value. What’s more, we expect AT&T to provide more detailed data regarding the increased profitability once the Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) is completed. Positive Time Warner merger news With the Time Warner merger expected to be completed in the next couple of months, we expect CEO Randall Stephenson to provide more in-depth color on the prospects for profits post Time Warner. The fact of the matter is content is king and AT&T will be the king of content post-merger. A really interesting article just out in Forbes covers the topic in detail. You can read it here. We do not believe the potential upside from AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner and other content providers has been properly accounted for. Stephenson will hopefully clear this ambiguity up on the call next week. On top of all the positive organic growth prospects, AT&T still maintains its rock solid safe haven play status. Market participants are 10 feet tall and bulletproof The sentiment of stock market participants reminds me of our attitude as teenager. We were 10 feet tall and bullet proof. The issue is sooner or later all good things come to an end. I believe that time may be coming soon. The good thing is you don’t have to try and time tit with an investment in AT&T at present. The stock has an extremely low bets which means it is much less volatile than the market in general. This fact coupled with the company’s size, strength, and best-in-class dividend yield of 5.4% provide investors with a substantial margin of safety if some exogenous event occurs causing a macro market selloff. The bottom line is we believe there may never be a better time to invest in AT&T than right now. Moreover, the odds a corporate tax cut just went up.
 Corporate tax cut coming? House Speaker Paul D. Ryan vowed Tuesday that Congress will approve a broad-based overhaul of the federal tax code this year, laying down a firm deadline for Republicans as he tries to smooth over intra-party differences that have plagued the effort thus far. Ryan stated: “We are going to get this done in 2017. We have to get this done in 2017. We cannot let this once-in-a-generation moment slip by.” With the recent downfall of the effort to overhaul the healthcare system we do not believe any of the potential positives from a corporate tax cut getting approved have been priced into the stock presently. This would essentially be icing on the cake if it comes to fruition. The Bottom Line AT&T shares are oversold, unloved, and under-owned at present, just the way we like it when we are looking to add. We picked up some additional shares Thursday in expectation of a trend reversal post earnings. We see the over 1% pop on Thursday as a tell earnings may come in better than expected. The stock trading at a steep discount to its peers and the industry, provides a safe and predictable dividend yielding 5.4%, and has solid organic growth prospects for the foreseeable future. Add to this the current macro market conditions and you have the makings of a solid total return opportunity. Those are my thoughts on the subject. I look forward to reading yours. Please use this information as a starting point for your own due diligence. Your input is required! The true value of my articles is provided by the prescient remarks from Seeking Alpha members in the comments section below. Do you think AT&T is a buy going into earning? Is a macro market correction on the horizon? Have people under-estimated the value the Time Warner merger will bring? Thank you in advance for your participation.

These Companies Could Win Big at the Emmys
Prestige drama powers several companies to dramatic increases in nominations.











                Eric Volkman
            

                (TMFVolkman)



            
            Jul 22, 2017 at 8:20AM
            
            





It's that time of year again in Hollywood. Nominations for TV's Emmys, arguably visual entertainment's second most important prize next to moviedom's Oscars, were handed down last week.
The nominees were the usual mix of shoo-ins, surprises, and disappointments. The same can be said for the companies behind the TV shows that got the nod. Let's take a brief look at which corporations collected this year's nominations.

Image source: HBO/Time Warner.

Time for prestige TV
It was hardly a surprise that shows from venerable Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) unit HBO took first place in terms of total nominations, with 110 nominations across the Emmys' numerous categories (up from 94 last year). Time Warner's premium cable channel long ago planted its flag in the soil of prestige TV and has managed to hold and defend that ground ever since.
HBO scored well with dark sci-fi saga Westworld, which is a contender in 24 Emmy categories. Other HBO shows up for a statue are popular comedy Silicon Valley, political satire Veep, crime drama The Night Of, and one-off TV movie The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.
Onetime upstart Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is rapidly becoming a major Emmy presence. It reaped 91 nominations in 2017, up sharply from last year's 56. Its concentrated push ever harder into prestige TV is a big reason Netflix is a strong contender in the Emmys' key outstanding-drama category -- its long-running House of Cards is a contender, as is recent phenomenon Stranger Things and U.K. royal family drama The Crown.





Among the traditional broadcast networks, Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) NBC led the pack with 60 nominations, well up from the 41 of 2016. In fact, the Comcast unit was the only one of the "big four" (along with ABC, CBS, and 21st Century Fox's Fox network) to improve its number from last year. Much of that improvement was due to the hit weepie This Is Us, which is up for awards in a host of categories, including outstanding drama.
Another notable improvement came from ever-ambitious streaming service Hulu, which incidentally is jointly owned by subsidiaries of Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, Comcast, and -- holding a smaller stake -- Time Warner.
The dramatic rise, to 18 nominations from the 2016 tally of two, can be summed up in three words: The Handmaid's Tale. The dystopian drama struck a chord with both critics and viewers and collected 13 of those 18 candidacies.
As mentioned, ABC, CBS, and Fox saw their nomination tallies decline on a year-over-year basis. Their haul for 2017 was, respectively, 34, 29, and 21. Also experiencing drops were Showtime (15, down from last year's 22), PBS (11, from 26), and AMC Networks' flagship channel AMC (11 and 24). Amazon.com's Instant Video, meanwhile, flat-lined with 16 nods.





Dramatic development
So what does it mean for the stocks of the companies behind those shows? Well, the top entertainment awards are effectively opportunities for buckets of free PR for the nominees and the eventual winners, rather than major stock-moving events. So in and of themselves, we shouldn't expect nominations (or even victories, down the road) to move the needle much on the relevant stocks.
Regardless, judging by this year's crop of nominees, we can tease out a notable trend. Prestige dramas still resonate with audiences, whether they're aired on a network (This Is Us), cable channel (Westworld), or streaming service (The Handmaid's Tale). Look for all companies in the running to spend handsomely promoting their existing high-end dramas or make concentrated efforts to develop a new one or several.
So the Emmy laggards this year -- the three broadcast networks that aren't NBC, plus AMC and perhaps Showtime -- might feel compelled to ramp up their efforts to develop new quality dramas to have a better showing at next year's nominations.

Why Walt Disney Is the Best Buy in Entertainment
The company has found a formula for films which helps all its divisions. 











                Daniel B. Kline
            

                (TMFDankline)



            
            Jul 22, 2017 at 8:07AM
            
            





Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) can leverage a hit property as well as any company on the planet.
Whether it's a blockbuster movie like Frozen or an established film universe like Star Wars, the company understands how to wring every dime from fans without making them feel exploited. Disney also has an ability to create new hits while finding new life in old properties.
The company can move characters or franchises from film to TV, to theme parks, to a licensed anything-you-might-imagine, and can then repeat the whole process when the time is right. It's not only a license to print money, it's one that's hard for rivals to duplicate.
Disney isn't perfect. It's struggling with ESPN, which is performing poorly compared to its historic success. Disney also has to catch up on investment in its theme parks after years of neglect. In addition, the cord cutting phenomenon which has hurt its sport network threatens the rest of its television empire.
Despite those worries, Disney remains the premier player in the entertainment space. The company will hit some bumps as the overall cable/television industry moves toward digital delivery, but ultimately its deep roster of characters, major properties, and franchises will see it through.

Disney plans to extend the Star Wars brand to a hotel. Image source: Walt Disney.

What are Disney's strengths?
Disney was built on its library of cartoon characters and it has dramatically expanded that roster to include live action stars from Han Solo to Captain Jack Sparrow. The company not only owns a huge archive of its self-branded animated movies, it also owns the Pixar, Marvel, and LucasFilm (Star Wars and Indiana Jones) brands. Just in its film business, that allows it to have an impressive lineup of near-guaranteed hits films each year that looks roughly like this:

3 Marvel movies
2 Pixar films
1 Disney animated project
1 Disney live-action film based on a classic animated project
1 Star Wars movie

Basically the company has taken the risk out of movie making. It's certainly possible for a Pixar or even a Star Wars film to fail, but it's not all that likely, and it hasn't happened under the Disney banner.
In 2016, a year in which Disney claimed the global box office crown while setting a company record, it also dominated the domestic box office. The company had 26.3% of the market with only 13 new films released in the year earning over $3 billion, according to Box Office Mojo. Second-place Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) put out 23, while third-place FOX (NASDAQ:FOX) needed 16 (not including Fox Searchlight) to bring in half the box office receipts Disney did.
The difference is that, while Time Warner and Fox had a mix of winners and losers during the year, Disney's only real failures were Steven Spielberg's The BFG which earned $55 million domestically and Pete's Dragon which under-performed at $76 million in the U.S.
Even the disappointing Alice: Through the Looking Glass brought in just under $300 million globally, while Disney's top-eight films for the year each took in at least $200 million in the U.S. Of those eight, five topped $1 billion globally for the year. Neither Warner Bros. nor FOX has a single billion-dollar film.
It's more than movies
Disney's films may be the backbone of the company, but it's all the other ways it can use those properties that make up the company's true strength. Disney's film division is actually its third-highest revenue producing group through the first six months of the year at $4.5 billion, behind Media Networks at $12 billion and Parks & Resorts at nearly $9 billion. 
The theme park division, however, owes much of its success to characters from movies. That includes classic Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, but in recent years the parks have become more reliant on Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel (where allowed, given that rival Universal Studios has a lock on some key characters due to a deal which predates Disney buying the comic book company.
ABC has less dependence on movie-based intellectual property (IP), though it does have some shows derived from the company's film universes and ESPN is an entirely different entity. The company's cable networks, however, draw heavily from its films with Star Wars, Marvel, and Pixar shows. In addition Disney makes money in its Media Networks division through its successful Marvel-driven partnership with Netflix. 
On top of all that, the Mouse House has made just over $1 billion on licensing its various characters through its Consumer Products division in the first half of 2017. In addition, it's also worth noting that, despite the ongoing problems at ESPN, revenue was slightly up year-over-year for the first two quarters in Media Networks, though operating income was down 3%. 





IP is portable
While the cable business, and to an extent the network television business, will change due to cord cutting, Disney has content people will pay for. That means that even if its cable networks weaken, the company should be able to monetize its content by bringing it to whatever platforms people are using.
Whether that means creating its own subscription service or working with an existing one, Disney has the IP to thrive. There might be transitional bumps in the road, as ESPN is experiencing now, but good content will find an audience. Disney has content and a machine built to make money from it. That should serve the company well, even as consumer behaviors change.

These Are The Best Costumes From Comic-Con 2017: You Won't Believe How Detailed! 






ALISSA CORAM

XAutoplay: On | Off SAN DIEGO -- Comic-Con is all about the fans, and superfans love dressing up in costumes for the show.
We of course weren't able to see them all, but some of the best cosplay outfits we found were of characters from Warner Bros. Pictures' Suicide Squad. Warner Bros. is owned by Time Warner (TWX).
There were also your fair share of characters from Marvel and Lucasfilm, both Disney (DIS) properties.
Take a look at the video to see just how much attention to detail there was for some of these outfits.

Wall Street's M&A Chatter From July 18: Hydro One-Avista, AT&T-JV Otter Media, ConAgra-Pinnacle Foods 

Discovery, Scripps Merger Could Create Specialty Brand For Food, Animal Lovers 


 
Summer is the time for huge blockbuster movies, but it’s also looking to be a time for huge mergers and acquisitions in the media industry.
Since June, these five deals have been the subject of Wall Street’s chatter or have seen significant progress.

1. AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) And Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX)
AT&T announced in October that it will acquire Time Warner for $107.50 per share. The deal initially faced antitrust issues, but the FCC ultimately decided it has no role to play.
The deal has been approved by the European Commission, but is awaiting word from the FTC. On July 6, CNBC reported that the deal could close by early August.

2. Discovery Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: DISCA) And Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNI)
The two specialty television producers recently restarted merger talks that date back to 2014, according to a Wall Street Journal report.
When the merger happens, the company would house the Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, TLC, Eurosport, HGTV, the Food Network, Travel Channel, DIY Network and more. The company would be worth close to $24 billion.
On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Viacom, Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAB) was holding competing talks with Scripps about a takeover.

3. Liberty Interactive Corp (NASDAQ: QVCA) And HSN, Inc. (NASDAQ: HSNI)
Speculation began in October that Liberty might make a move to acquire HSN. The company already owned 38 percent of HSN.
Without an update for months, Liberty announced on July 6 that it will buy the rest of HSN for $2.6 billion. HSN shareholders will receive 1.65 shares of Series A Q+VC Group common stock for every share of HSN common stock.

4. Sprint Corp (NYSE: S), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) And Charter Communication, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR)
Sprint disappointed T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS) investors late-June when it announced it was putting merger talks on hold and entering exclusive negotiations with Comcast and Charter regarding a wireless service partnership.
The move seems to be a reaction to the AT&T–Time Warner deal. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) is also rumored to be seeking a media partner.
Also on the table is Comcast and Charter jointly acquiring Sprint. The exclusive talks end later this month.

5. Univision And Liberty Media Corporation (NASDAQ: FWONA) (NASDAQ: FWONK)
Univision’s IPO, to be funded with $10 billion of debt, was recently delays, opening the door for interested potential investors to begin talks. Univision first filed to be listed under the ticker UVN in 2015, but continuously put off going public because of a weak media stock environment.
John Malone, the CEO of Liberty Media, is one such investor vying for a major stake in the company, according to a Wall Street Journal report Wednesday. The company’s current owners, including several private equity firms, have long been trying to exit their positions.

T-Mobile US Inc. accomplished what it set out to: trounce Sprint Corp. and ruffle feathers at the once unrivaled wireless leaders, Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. Now investors should start to see a more mature T-Mobile -- even if magenta-t-shirt-wearing CEO John Legere still boisterously nags his starchy rivals in the Twittersphere. The little engine that could is entering the next phase of its transformation, and that means growth in both subscribers and its stock price will be tougher to come by. T-Mobile's second-quarter results after Wednesday's close of trading may yet be good, with analysts estimating adjusted earnings jumped 44 percent to 36 cents a share as revenue increased 6 percent to $9.8 billion. But T-Mobile's stock, which has more than quadrupled in five years, has recently started to hit speed bumps. Options trading ahead of earnings imply investors are tempering their expectations. Bloomberg markets reporter Gregory Calderone notes that the potential average gain implied by the most popular contracts is less than the historical average, as puts congregate around the $59 to $62.50 level. T-Mobile shares were selling for $61.30 apiece midday Wednesday.

This doesn't detract from what's been an impressive strategy by Legere, who seems to enjoy making it look more impromptu than it probably was. It's all part of T-Mobile's "cool" factor, which he brought to the brand, even if it does at times induce eye rolls. Not for nothing, T-Mobile was able to steal Sprint's spot as the No. 3 player in the industry, then force AT&T and Verizon to cave by offering unlimited data plans.

Growth Slog
T-Mobile's post-paid subscriber net additions probably declined in the second quarter as its competitors began offering unlimited data plans


Source: Bloomberg


There's also a marked difference in how T-Mobile went about this versus Sprint's approach: Sprint is offering customers a year of free service if they make a switch, which does more to highlight Sprint's desperation than present a substantial threat to the other carriers. This table created by Bloomberg Intelligence analysts shows how T-Mobile is being competitive while Sprint just looks sad:

Going Unlimited
While T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T are in a price war over unlimited data plans, Sprint went all out -- free for new customers through July 2018 if they sign up this month


Source: Company websites, Bloomberg Intelligence
Note: Sprint, Verizon and AT&T don't include taxes and fees in their rates, while T-Mobile does.

But now that the easy subscriber wins have been made, T-Mobile's attention should turn to improving its coverage. There are signs that the company is doing this. Bloomberg Intelligence notes that T-Mobile ended a promotion that offered customers two lines for the price of one and increased the charge for HD video. It also outbid every other company in the spectrum auction earlier this year, spending $8 billion to narrow its gap with AT&T and Verizon.Step 1: Get CustomersStep 2: Keep ThemRegardless of whether T-Mobile merges with Sprint or another party (other possible candidates here), it needs to work on consumers' perception that its service isn't great. That means adding new subscribers from here will get more costly, a challenge for a company that already has tighter margins than its bigger rivals -- and those bigger rivals are only getting more powerful. AT&T may not be growing, but it will have more enticing offerings once it closes the acquisition of Time Warner Inc. Verizon is also clearly on the hunt to join forces with a big media company. 

Margin Compression
T-Mobile has strategically sacrificed profits for growth, but it will be a larger trade-off going forward as stealing subscribers becomes more costly


Source: Bloomberg


T-Mobile has had quite a run, but to impress investors from here will be more difficult. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Investing Action Plan



Fed, FANGs, Autos, Defense, Eateries On Deck: Investing Action Plan 






IBD STAFF
7/21/2017


 Reprints




Here's your weekly Investing Action Plan: what you need to know as an investor for the coming week.
XAutoplay: On | OffThe biggest names in the tech, defense, energy, automotive, telecom and restaurant industries will report, including three of the FANG stocks: Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL). The Federal Reserve will hold another policy meeting, while OPEC and non-OPEC officials will also meet to discuss their production agreement.
Stocks To Watch
Several chip and chip equipment makers are nearing buy points, with a few due to report results in the coming week.
Broadcom (AVGO) is just 1.5% below a 256.88 entry from a flat base, though this is the Apple (AAPL) chip supplier's fourth base in the last year, warranting some caution.
Chipmaker Texas Instruments (TXN), which reports Tuesday, is 3.6% short of an 84.75 buy point from a flat base, which is also a late-stage base.
The chip equipment companies, however, aren't weighed down as much by prior bases.
Applied Materials (AMAT) is 2.4% away from a 47.96 flat base entry. Lam Research (LRCX), which reports Wednesday, is climbing the right side of six-week cup base, and is 2.2% shy of a 167.15 entry. Kulicke & Soffa (KLIC) is working its way through a consolidation and needs to gain 4.3% to reach its 23.10 buy point.
Fed Meeting
Central bank policymakers will start their meeting Tuesday and wrap up on Wednesday, when an announcement is due at 2 p.m. No press conference with Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen is scheduled, and markets are putting the odds of no change in policy at nearly 97%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool. But nuances in how the statement changes from the last meeting could hint at shifts in the Fed's stance, which has softened recently as inflation data weakened. Meanwhile, markets are also waiting for more guidance on how the Fed will shrink its more than $4 trillion balance sheet.
3 FANGs
Facebook will report Q2 results after the close Wednesday. The consensus looks for revenue to climb 43% to $9.17 billion, with adjusted EPS growing 46% to $1.14. Its dominance is viewed as so complete that Needham analysts recently said Facebook "is becoming the de facto near-monopoly mobile choice for brands and direct response advertisers." Facebook last month said it reached a new milestone, announcing that it has topped 2 billion monthly active users, doubling its base in a little more than 4-1/2 years.
Amazon reports Q2 earnings late Thursday. The consensus on revenue is growth of 22% to $37.2 billion, with EPS falling 20% to $1.42, as Amazon is undergoing yet another heavy investment period. Amazon recently held its annual Prime Day, when "tens of millions" of Prime members made purchases, driving sales up 60% from the same period a year ago.
Alphabet reports after the market close on Monday, and analysts expect gross revenue to grow 19% to $25.6 billion, with EPS down 2% to $8.25. Included in Q2 numbers will be a $2.74 billion fine received from the European Commission, which accused the company of skewing search results to benefit its own shopping search service. But analysts also see continued contributions from YouTube and a growing impact from Maps.
Big Oil
Officials from OPEC and top nonmember countries will meet in Russia Monday to discuss the effectiveness of their deal to curb output and if deeper cuts are needed. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) will report Q2 results Friday. Exxon's EPS is seen doubling to 87 cents with revenue up 10% to $63.6 billion. Chevron's EPS is expected to jump 94% to 93 with revenue rising 9% to $31.9 billion. ConocoPhillips (COP), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and France's Total (TOT) will release quarterly results on Thursday.
Big Guns
Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) will report quarterly results Wednesday. Analysts see Boeing swinging to a profit of $2.31 per share vs. a per-share loss of 44 cents a year ago, when it booked $3 billion in charges. But revenue is expected to fall 7.2% to $22.96 billion, as commercial aircraft deliveries slipped 8% to 183.
Northrop's EPS is seen rising 9.2% to $2.84 with revenue up 3.3% to $6.2 billion. Expect gains from increased F-35 sales, which helped boost Lockheed Martin's (LMT) earnings. General Dynamics' EPS and revenue are seen rising. Raytheon (RTN) is on tap for Thursday and analysts expect a 0.6% dip in EPS to $1.74 with revenue up 3% to $6.22 billion.
Big Mac
When McDonald's (MCD) reports Tuesday, EPS is expected to climb 12% to $1.63 n a 4% revenue decline to $5.99 billion. Like other fast-food giants, the Golden Arches is developing mobile ordering and delivery, making its stock one of the best performers on the Dow so far in 2017. Also reporting Tuesday are Domino's Pizza (DPZ) (EPS up 24.5% to $1.22, revenue up 11.5% to $610 million) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) (EPS up 152% to $2.19, sales up 19% to $1.19 billion). But Chipotle shares are under pressure again on reports that diners had fallen ill after eating at a Virginia location.
Big Coffee
Expect focus to remain on Starbucks' (SBUX) U.S. same-store sale, mobile efforts and growth in China when the coffee-shop chain reports on Thursday. Consensus is for 12% EPS growth to 55 cents on a 10% sales gain to $5.74 billion. Dunkin' Donuts parent Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), meanwhile, is seen posting EPS of 62 cents on sales of $220 million, up 9% and 2% respectively. The Starbucks rival also reports Thursday.
Big Three
General Motors (GM) announces Q2 results Tuesday, and analysts see a 7% EPS slide to $1.73 on a 5% revenue drop to $40.25 billion. Ford Motor (F) releases results Wednesday, and estimates are for EPS of 45 cents, down 13.4%, on revenue of $37.95 billion, up 2.8%. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) steps up Thursday. Among top auto suppliers, Lear International (LEA) reports Wednesday, while Borg Warner (BWA) and Visteon (VC) are on Thursday.
Big Chip
Late Tuesday, analysts expect Texas Instruments to earn 96 cents a share, up 26%, on sales of $3.57 billion, up 9%. Late Wednesday, Xilinx (XLNX) is seen earning 60 cents a share, down 2%, on sales of $616 million, up 7%, and chip-gear firm Lam Research is forecast to earn $3.04 a share, up 69%, on sales of $2.32 billion, up 50%. Late Thursday, Intel (INTC) is expected to earn 68 cents a share, up 15%, on sales of $14.41 billion, up 6%.
Industrial Biggies
Caterpillar (CAT) and United Technologies (UTX) disclose Q2 Tuesday. Heavy machinery maker Caterpillar is expected to see a 12% gain in EPS to $1.22 as revenue climbs almost 6% to $10.95 billion. United Tech, a maker of jet engines, climate-control systems and elevators, is likely to see a 2.7% drop in EPS to $1.77 on a 2.1% gain in revenue to $15.18 billion. Dupont (DD) and 3M (MMM) report Tuesday, and Dow Chemical (DOW), which is merging with Dupont, is out Thursday.
Expedia Flies High Ahead Of Results
The travel booking site will report second-quarter results Thursday, and analysts expect EPS to climb 13.3% to 94 cents and revenue to rise 15.7% to $2.54 billion. Overall travel is up for both business and pleasure in the U.S., Europe and Asia and analysts are bullish on Expedia's (EXPE) China revenues thanks to its joint venture with Air Asia. Despite the Trump administration's travel and device bans, shares have jumped more than 30% this year.
EA Seen Growing On Catalog, Digital Sales
Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) is expected to deliver solid gains when it posts June-quarter results after the close Thursday. But with no major game releases in its fiscal first quarter, EA will be relying on catalog and digital game sales in the period. Analysts expect EA to earn 27 cents a share, up from 7 cents in the year-earlier period, on sales of $768 million, up 13%, in fiscal Q1. For the September quarter, EA's fiscal Q2, Wall Street is expecting the Redwood City, Calif.-based company to earn 67 cents a share, up 26%, on sales of $1.18 billion, up 7%. Key game releases in fiscal Q2 include "FIFA 18" and "Madden NFL 18."
PayPal To Show Accelerating Earnings
The digital payments company is expected to deliver its fourth straight quarter of accelerating EPS growth when it posts Q2 results after the close Wednesday. Analysts predict PayPal (PYPL) will earn 43 cents a share, up 19.4% year over year, on sales of $3.09 billion, up 17%, in Q2. PayPal stock has been near record-high territory of late.
Medtech
Late Wednesday, analysts expect Edwards Lifesciences (EW) to report adjusted EPS of 88 cents, up 16%, on sales of $836 million, up 10%. Boston Scientific (BSX), early Thursday, is projected to report EPS of 31 cents, up 15%, and revenue of $2.21 billion, up 4%. Stryker (SYK) is forecast to report EPS of $1.51, up 8.6%, on $2.98 billion in sales, 4.8%, late Thursday.
Telecom Giants
AT&T is out Tuesday after the close. Analysts are looking to see EPS of 74 cents, up 2.8%, and revenue of $39.80, down 1.8%. Verizon issues Q2 earnings early Thursday. The wireless giant is expected to see EPS rise 2.1% to 96 cents, as revenue dips 1.5% to $29.91 billion. Investors will look for more indications on how the telecom behemoths plan to leverage the traditional and new media properties they are acquiring, such as Time Warner (TWX) at AT&T and Yahoo's core assets at Verizon.
Drugmakers
Eli Lilly (LLY) and AbbVie (ABBV) are scheduled to report Q2 numbers early Tuesday and early Friday, respectively. Analysts call for Lilly to report EPS of $1.04, up 21%, on $5.59 billion in sales, up 3.4%. AbbVie is expected to report $6.93 billion in sales, up 7.4%, and EPS of $1.40, up 11%.
Biotechs
Early Tuesday, Biogen (BIIB) is expected to report EPS of $4.46, down 14%, on $2.81 billion in revenue, down 3%. Late Tuesday, analysts forecast Amgen (AMGN) to report $5.68 billion in sales, flat, and EPS of $3.09, up 9%. Before the markets open Thursday, Alexion (ALXN) is expected to report EPS of $1.26, up 11.5%, on $848 million in sales, up 12.6%.

MGM will acquire TV assets of 'Vanderpump Rules' producer Evolution Media
The TV production and distribution arm of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer said on Tuesday it's acquiring the assets of unscripted TV producer Evolution Media. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Evolution Media's roster of shows include hit reality shows such as "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" and "Vanderpump Rules," which air on Comcast Corp.-owned  NBCUniversal's Bravo. After the deal, the company will operate as Evolution Media, an MGM company, and founder and Chief Executive Douglas Ross will become the company's president. "Doug and [Alex Baskin, president of programming and development] have been creating and producing hit series for decades," said MGM TV head Mark Burnett in a statement. "These guys have talent and drive and will help our MGM Television 'hit machine' to continue to grow and grow." MGM hopes the acquisition will enhance its current roster of series, which include "Survivor" on CBS Corp. , "The Voice" on NBC, "Shark Tank" on Walt Disney Co.-owned  ABC and "The Handmaid's Tale" distributed by Hulu -- a joint venture from Disney, Comcast, 21st Century Fox Inc.  and Time Warner Inc. .

Disney shares up almost 2% on report Verizon is eyeing deal
Shares of Walt Disney Co.  climbed 1.7% Monday, after the New York Post said a rumor circulated last week that Verizon Communications Inc.  is eyeing a purchase of Disney.

Time Warner, Inc. is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered in New York City.[6] It is currently the world's third largest entertainment company in terms of revenue, after Comcast and The Walt Disney Company. It was also once the world's largest media conglomerate.[7] Time Warner was first founded in 1990, with the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The current company consists largely of the assets of the former Warner Communications (as well as HBO, a Time Inc. subsidiary prior to the merger), and the assets of Turner Broadcasting (which was acquired by the company in 1996). Time Warner currently has major operations in film and television, with a limited amount in publishing operations. Among its major assets are HBO, Turner Broadcasting System, The CW, Warner Bros., CNN, DC Comics, and as of August 2016, Hulu, owning 10%.[8] In the past, other major divisions of Time Warner included Time Inc., AOL, Time Warner Cable, Warner Books and Warner Music Group. All of these operations were either sold to other investors or spun off as independent companies from 2004 to 2014.
On October 22, 2016, AT&T announced its intent to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion (including assumed Time Warner debt).[9][10]

History[edit]
1920s[edit]
Time magazine made its debut in 1923 as the first weekly news magazine in the United States.[22] Four years later, in 1927, Warner Bros. released the world’s first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer.[23]
1960s[edit]
In 1963, recommendations from Time Inc. based on how it delivered magazines led to the introduction of ZIP codes by the United States Post Office.[citation needed]
1970s[edit]
In 1972, Kinney National Company spun off its non-entertainment assets due to a financial scandal over its parking operations and renamed itself Warner Communications Inc.[24]
It was the holding company for Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Music Group during the 1970s and 1980s. It also owned DC Comics and Mad, as well as a majority stake in Garden State National Bank (an investment it was ultimately required to sell pursuant to requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act). Warner's initial divestiture efforts led by Garden State CEO Charles A. Agemian were blocked by Garden State board member William A. Conway in 1978; a revised transaction was later completed in 1980.
In 1975, Home Box Office became the first TV network to broadcast nationally via satellite, debuting with the Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier “Thrilla in Manila” boxing match.[25]
In 1975, Warner expanded under the guidance of CEO Steve Ross and formed a joint venture with American Express, named Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, which held cable channels including MTV (launched 1981), Nickelodeon (launched 1979) and The Movie Channel. Warner Bros. bought out American Express's half in 1984, and sold the venture a year later to Viacom, which renamed it MTV Networks.[citation needed]
In 1976, the Turner–owned WTCG originated the "superstation" concept, transmitting via satellite to cable systems nationwide and pioneering the basic cable business model. WTCG was renamed WTBS in 1979.
In 1976, Nolan Bushnell sold Atari, Inc. to Warner Communications for an estimated $2–12 million. Warner made considerable profits (and later losses) with Atari, which it owned from 1976 to 1984. While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of Atari 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time.[26]
1980s[edit]
In 1980, Warner purchased The Franklin Mint for about $225 million. The combination was short lived: Warner sold The Franklin Mint in 1985 to American Protection Industries Inc. (API) for $167.5 million. However, Warner retained Franklin Mint’s Eastern Mountain Sports as well as The Franklin Mint Center, which it leased back to API.[27][28]
In 1980, Turner launched CNN, the first 24-hour all-news network, redefining the way the world received breaking news.[29]
In January 1983, Warner expanded their interests to baseball. Under the direction of Caesar P. Kimmel, executive vice president, bought 48 percent of the Pittsburgh Pirates for $10 million.[30] The company then put up its share for sale in November 1984 following losses of $6 million due to its failed attempt to launch a cable sports package. The team's majority owner, John W. Galbreath, soon followed suit after learning of Warner's actions.[31] Both Galbreath and Warner sold the Pirates to local investors in March 1986.
In 1984, due to major losses spurred by subsidiary Atari Inc.'s losses, Warner sold Atari Inc.'s Consumer Division assets to Jack Tramiel. It kept the rest of the company and named it Atari Games, eventually reducing it to just the Coin Division. They sold Atari Games to Namco in 1985, and repurchased it in 1992, renaming it Time-Warner Interactive, until it was sold to Midway Games in 1996. In a long-expected deal, Warner Communications announced on May 11, 1988, they were acquiring Lorimar-Telepictures; the acquisition was finalized on January 12, 1989.[32]
The merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications was announced on March 4, 1989.[33] During the summer of that same year, Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western) launched a $12.2 billion hostile bid to acquire Time, Inc. in an attempt to end a stock-swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications. This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9 Billion in cash and stock. Paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time/Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Paramount to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of the two companies' merger which was completed on January 10, 1990. However, instead of the companies becoming defunct, the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure, resulting in the new company being called "Time Warner".
1990s[edit]
US West partnered with Time Warner in 1993 to form what is now known as TW Telecom, initially known as Time Warner Communications (also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the ATC name), in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses. US West also took a 26% stake in the entertainment portion of the company, calling that division Time Warner Entertainment (or legally Time Warner Entertainment Company L.P.). US West's stake eventually passed to acquired cable company MediaOne, then to AT&T Broadband in 1999 when that company acquired MediaOne, then finally to Comcast in 2001 when that company bought the AT&T Broadband division. Comcast sold their stake in the company in 2003, relegating the name to a subdivision under Time Warner Cable.
Time Warner subsequently acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System in October 1996. Not only did this result in the company (in a way) re-entering the basic cable television industry (in regards to nationally available channels), but Warner Bros. also regained the rights to their pre-1950[34][35] film library, which by then had been owned by Turner (the films are still technically held by Turner, but WB is responsible for sales and distribution),[36] while Turner gained access to WB's post-1950 library, as well as other WB-owned properties.
Time Warner purchased the Six Flags Theme Parks chain in 1993. The company later sold all Six Flags parks and properties to Oklahoma-based Premier Parks on April 1, 1998.[37]
Dick Parsons, already a director on the board since 1991, was hired as Time Warner president in 1995, although the division operational heads continued to report directly to Chairman and CEO Gerald Levin.[38]
In 1991, HBO and Cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers, with companion channels supplementing the main networks.[39]
In 1993, HBO became the world's first digitally transmitted television service.[40]
In 1995, CNN introduced CNN.com which later became a leading destination for global digital news, both online and mobile.[41]
In 1996, Warner Bros. spearheaded the introduction of the DVD, which rapidly replaced VHS tapes as the standard for home video.[42]
In 1999, HBO became the first national cable TV network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel.[43]
2000s[edit]
Merger with AOL[edit]
In 2000, it was announced that AOL would purchase Time Warner for US$164 billion.[44] Due to the larger market capitalization of AOL, their shareholders would own 55% of the new company while Time Warner shareholders owned only 45%,[45] so in actual practice AOL had acquired Time Warner, even though Time Warner had far more assets and revenues. Time Warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution, while AOL wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets.[46]
The deal, announced on January 10, 2000[45] and officially filed on February 11, 2000,[47] employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity. The Federal Trade Commission cleared the deal on December 14, 2000,[48] and gave final approval on January 11, 2001; the company completed the merger later that day.[49] The deal was approved on the same day by the Federal Communications Commission,[47] and had already been cleared by the European Commission on October 11, 2000.[50]
AOL Time Warner Inc., as the company was then called, was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides. Gerald Levin, who had served as Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. Steve Case served as Executive Chairman of the board of directors, Robert W. Pittman (President and COO of AOL) and Dick Parsons (President of Time Warner) served as Co-Chief Operating Officers, and J. Michael Kelly (the CFO from AOL) became the Chief Financial Officer.[51]
According to AOL President and COO Bob Pittman, the slow-moving Time Warner would now take off at Internet speed, accelerated by AOL: "All you need to do is put a catalyst to [Time Warner], and in a short period, you can alter the growth rate. The growth rate will be like an Internet company." When the AOL Time Warner deal was announced, the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward; by tapping into AOL, Time Warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers. AOL would use Time Warner's high-speed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers Time Warner's branded magazines, books, music, and movies. This would have created 130 million subscription relationships.
Unfortunately, the growth and profitability of the AOL division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers. The value of the America Online division dropped significantly, not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell, and forced a goodwill write-off, causing AOL Time Warner to report a loss of $99 billion in 2002 — at the time, the largest loss ever reported by a company. The total value of AOL stock subsequently went from $226 billion to about $20 billion.[52]
An outburst by Vice Chairman Ted Turner at a board meeting prompted Steve Case to contact each of the directors and push for CEO Gerald Levin's ouster. Although Case's coup attempt was rebuffed by Parsons and several other directors, Levin became frustrated with being unable to "regain the rhythm" at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of 2001, effective in May 2002.[53] Although Co-COO Bob Pittman was the strongest supporter of Levin and largely seen as the heir-apparent, Dick Parsons was instead chosen as CEO. Time Warner CFO J. Michael Kelly was demoted to COO of the AOL division, and replaced as CFO by Wayne Pace. AOL Chairman and CEO Barry Schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new "content creation division", being replaced on an interim basis by Pittman, who was already serving as the sole COO after Parsons' promotion.
Many expected synergies between AOL and other Time Warner divisions never materialized, as most Time Warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger. A new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of AOL Time Warner, replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division, caused resentment among Time Warner division heads who blamed the AOL division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company. AOL Time Warner COO Pittman, who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives, who also criticized Pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for AOL Time Warner that were never met. Some of the attacks on Pittman were reported to come from the print media in the Time, Inc. division under Don Logan.[54] Furthermore, CEO Parsons' democratic style prevented Pittman from exercising authority over the "old-guard" division heads who resisted Pittman's synergy initiatives.[51][55]
Pittman announced his resignation as AOL Time Warner COO after July 4, 2002, being reportedly burned out by the AOL special assignment and almost hospitalized, unhappy about the criticism from Time Warner executives, and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as Parsons was firmly entrenched as CEO.[55] Pittman's departure was seen as a great victory to Time Warner executives who wanted to undo the merger. In a sign of AOL's diminishing importance to the media conglomerate, Pittman's responsibilities were divided between two Time Warner veterans; Jeffrey Bewkes who was CEO of Home Box Office, and Don Logan who had been CEO of Time. Logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group, overseeing America Online, Time, Time Warner Cable, the AOL Time Warner Book Group and the Interactive Video unit, relegating AOL to being just another division in the conglomerate. Bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group, comprising HBO, New Line Cinema, The WB, Turner Networks, Warner Bros. and Warner Music. Both Logan and Bewkes, who had initially opposed the merger, were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to AOL Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons.[54][56] Logan, generally admired at Time Warner and reviled by AOL for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker, moved to purge AOL of several "Pittman panzers".[53]
AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case took on added prominence as the co-head of a new strategy committee of the board, making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the Internet. However, under pressure from institutional investor vice president Gordon Crawford who lined up dissenters, Case announced in January 2003 that he would not stand for re-election as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting, making CEO Richard Parsons the chairman-elect. That year, the company dropped the "AOL" from its name, and spun off Time-Life's ownership under the legal name Direct Holdings Americas, Inc. Case resigned from the Time Warner board on October 31, 2005.[53][57] Jeff Bewkes, who eventually became CEO of Time Warner, described the 2001 merger with AOL as 'the biggest mistake in corporate history'.[58]
In 2005, Time Warner was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[59][60][61] On December 27, 2007, newly installed Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes discussed possible plans to spin off Time Warner Cable and sell off AOL and Time Inc. This would leave a smaller company made up of Turner Broadcasting, Warner Bros. and HBO.[62] On February 28, 2008, co-chairmen and co-CEOs of New Line Cinema Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne announced their resignations from the 40-year-old movie studio in response to Jeffrey Bewkes's demand for cost-cutting measures at the studio, which he intended to dissolve into Warner Bros.
On May 28, 2009, Time Warner announced that it would spin off AOL as a separate independent company, with the change occurring on December 9, 2009.
2010s[edit]
In 2010, Turner Sports, Inc. and the National Collegiate Athletic Association jointly announced the formation of NCAA Digital, a 14-year agreement in which Turner will manage and operate the NCAA’s digital portfolio and strengthen coverage of all 88 NCAA championships. NCAA Digital encompasses NCAA.com and additional NCAA digital platforms, including mobile web and applications, as well as other connected devices.[63]
On August 25, 2010, Time Warner's Latin American division bought Chilean nationwide terrestrial television station Chilevisión from Chile's elected president Sebastián Piñera. Time Warner already operates in the country with CNN Chile.[64]
In January 2012, Home Box Office and DISH Network LLC reached an agreement that will give DISH customers expanded access to HBO’s acclaimed programming.
In October 2012, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Media Distribution reached an agreement that will give Warner Bros. rights to Blu-ray and DVD distribution of several titles from Paramount in the US and Canada.[65]
In June 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid for Time Warner at $85 per share in stock and cash ($80 billion total) which Time Warner's board of directors turned down in July. Warner's CNN unit would have been sold to ease antitrust issues of the purchase.[66] On August 5, 2014, 21st Century Fox withdrew its offer to purchase Time Warner.
In January 2014, Time Warner, Related Companies, and Oxford Properties Group announced that Time Warner intends to relocate the Company’s corporate headquarters and its New York City-based employees to 30 Hudson Yards in the Hudson Yards neighborhood in Chelsea, Manhattan, and has accordingly made an initial financial commitment.[67] Time Warner sold its stake in the Columbus Circle building for $1.3 billion to Related and two wealth funds. The move will be completed in 2018.[68]
Transactions[edit]
On December 15, 2006, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. announced an investment in SCi Entertainment Group plc[69] the parent company of publishing label Eidos Interactive Ltd, representing 10.3 percent of the company's enlarged share capital. Additionally, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group and SCi have entered into an agreement for licensing and distribution of games based on select Warner Bros. Entertainment properties. The investment, licensing and distribution agreements are all pending SCi shareholder approval.

On February 4, 2009, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group announced their acquisition of Snowblind Studios,[73] a game development studio.
On May 21, 2008, Time Warner and Time Warner Cable Inc. agree to separation. It is the second largest cable company in the U.S. behind only Comcast.[74]
On February 19, 2009, Time Warner and Time Warner Cable completed the separation of the two companies through a spin-off.[75][76]
On March 17, 2009, Time Warner Inc. announced the legal and structural separation of Time Warner Cable Inc. (NYSE:TWC) from Time Warner through a tax-free spin-off that had become effective on March 12, 2009.
In the first quarter of 2010, Home Box Office purchased additional interests in HBO LAG for $217 million, which resulted in Home Box Office owning 80% of the equity interests of HBO LAG. In 2010, Home Box Office purchased the remainder of its partners’ interests in HBO Europe[77] (formerly HBO Central Europe) for $136 million, net of cash acquired.
On April 20, 2010, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group announced the acquisition of Turbine, Inc.,[78] a gaming studio in North America.

On March 6, 2013, Time Warner announced that it would spin off its publishing division Time Inc. as a separate, publicly traded company. The transaction was completed on June 6, 2014.[86][87]
Planned acquisition by AT&T[edit]
On October 20, 2016, it was reported that AT&T was in talks to acquire Time Warner. The proposed deal would give AT&T significant holdings in the media industry; AT&T's competitor Comcast had previously acquired NBCUniversal in a similar bid to increase its media holdings, in concert with its ownership of television and internet providers.[88][89][9] On October 22, 2016, AT&T reached a deal to buy Time Warner for $108.7 billion. If approved by federal regulators, the merger would bring Time Warner's properties under the same umbrella as AT&T's telecommunication holdings, including satellite provider DirecTV.[90][91]
On February 15, 2017, Time Warner shareholders approved the merger,[92] which is still pending regulatory approval. On February 28, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that his agency will not review the deal, leaving the review to the US Department of Justice.[93]

Main article: The CW




The CW logo.


On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner announced that they were to create a new broadcast network, The CW. The network officially debuted on September 18, 2006. The network formally debuted on September 20 with the 2-hour premiere of America's Next Top Model.
The network is the result of a merger of The WB (a Time Warner holding) and UPN (a CBS Corporation holding). CBS Corporation and Time Warner each own 50% of the network. Tribune Broadcasting (previously owned a 25% stake on The WB) and CBS Corporation contributed its stations as new network affiliates.
Commercial properties[edit]
Time Warner owns several large properties in New York City; certain buildings in the Rockefeller Center complex and adjacent office towers house its main offices; one of which houses a CNN news studio. In late 2003, Time Warner finished construction of a new twin-tower complex, designed to serve as additional office space, facing Columbus Circle on the southwestern edge of Central Park. Originally called the AOL Time Warner Center, the 755-foot (230 m), 55-floor mixed-use property was renamed Time Warner Center when the company itself was renamed.[95]

Competition[edit]
Time Warner faces industry competition from traditional media companies such as Sony, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, Viacom, The Walt Disney Company, and Comcast. Time Warner's and many of their competitions' business may be severely impacted by the increasing viewership of feature films, television programming and other content online with low ad-income, which decreases company revenues.
Box office receipts have been rising while the growth rate of DVD sales have recently been declining, which affects Warner Bros.' growth prospects and revenues.[105]
Company names[edit]

Warner Bros. Pictures (1923–1967)
Seven Arts Productions (1957–1967)
Kinney National Company (1966–1972)

Time Warner, Inc. is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered in New York City.[6] It is currently the world's third largest entertainment company in terms of revenue, after Comcast and The Walt Disney Company. It was also once the world's largest media conglomerate.[7] Time Warner was first founded in 1990, with the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The current company consists largely of the assets of the former Warner Communications (as well as HBO, a Time Inc. subsidiary prior to the merger), and the assets of Turner Broadcasting (which was acquired by the company in 1996). Time Warner currently has major operations in film and television, with a limited amount in publishing operations. Among its major assets are HBO, Turner Broadcasting System, The CW, Warner Bros., CNN, DC Comics, and as of August 2016, Hulu, owning 10%.[8] In the past, other major divisions of Time Warner included Time Inc., AOL, Time Warner Cable, Warner Books and Warner Music Group. All of these operations were either sold to other investors or spun off as independent companies from 2004 to 2014.
On October 22, 2016, AT&T announced its intent to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion (including assumed Time Warner debt).[9][10]

History[edit]
1920s[edit]
Time magazine made its debut in 1923 as the first weekly news magazine in the United States.[22] Four years later, in 1927, Warner Bros. released the world’s first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer.[23]
1960s[edit]
In 1963, recommendations from Time Inc. based on how it delivered magazines led to the introduction of ZIP codes by the United States Post Office.[citation needed]
1970s[edit]
In 1972, Kinney National Company spun off its non-entertainment assets due to a financial scandal over its parking operations and renamed itself Warner Communications Inc.[24]
It was the holding company for Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Music Group during the 1970s and 1980s. It also owned DC Comics and Mad, as well as a majority stake in Garden State National Bank (an investment it was ultimately required to sell pursuant to requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act). Warner's initial divestiture efforts led by Garden State CEO Charles A. Agemian were blocked by Garden State board member William A. Conway in 1978; a revised transaction was later completed in 1980.
In 1975, Home Box Office became the first TV network to broadcast nationally via satellite, debuting with the Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier “Thrilla in Manila” boxing match.[25]
In 1975, Warner expanded under the guidance of CEO Steve Ross and formed a joint venture with American Express, named Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, which held cable channels including MTV (launched 1981), Nickelodeon (launched 1979) and The Movie Channel. Warner Bros. bought out American Express's half in 1984, and sold the venture a year later to Viacom, which renamed it MTV Networks.[citation needed]
In 1976, the Turner–owned WTCG originated the "superstation" concept, transmitting via satellite to cable systems nationwide and pioneering the basic cable business model. WTCG was renamed WTBS in 1979.
In 1976, Nolan Bushnell sold Atari, Inc. to Warner Communications for an estimated $2–12 million. Warner made considerable profits (and later losses) with Atari, which it owned from 1976 to 1984. While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of Atari 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time.[26]
1980s[edit]
In 1980, Warner purchased The Franklin Mint for about $225 million. The combination was short lived: Warner sold The Franklin Mint in 1985 to American Protection Industries Inc. (API) for $167.5 million. However, Warner retained Franklin Mint’s Eastern Mountain Sports as well as The Franklin Mint Center, which it leased back to API.[27][28]
In 1980, Turner launched CNN, the first 24-hour all-news network, redefining the way the world received breaking news.[29]
In January 1983, Warner expanded their interests to baseball. Under the direction of Caesar P. Kimmel, executive vice president, bought 48 percent of the Pittsburgh Pirates for $10 million.[30] The company then put up its share for sale in November 1984 following losses of $6 million due to its failed attempt to launch a cable sports package. The team's majority owner, John W. Galbreath, soon followed suit after learning of Warner's actions.[31] Both Galbreath and Warner sold the Pirates to local investors in March 1986.
In 1984, due to major losses spurred by subsidiary Atari Inc.'s losses, Warner sold Atari Inc.'s Consumer Division assets to Jack Tramiel. It kept the rest of the company and named it Atari Games, eventually reducing it to just the Coin Division. They sold Atari Games to Namco in 1985, and repurchased it in 1992, renaming it Time-Warner Interactive, until it was sold to Midway Games in 1996. In a long-expected deal, Warner Communications announced on May 11, 1988, they were acquiring Lorimar-Telepictures; the acquisition was finalized on January 12, 1989.[32]
The merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications was announced on March 4, 1989.[33] During the summer of that same year, Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western) launched a $12.2 billion hostile bid to acquire Time, Inc. in an attempt to end a stock-swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications. This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9 Billion in cash and stock. Paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time/Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Paramount to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of the two companies' merger which was completed on January 10, 1990. However, instead of the companies becoming defunct, the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure, resulting in the new company being called "Time Warner".
1990s[edit]
US West partnered with Time Warner in 1993 to form what is now known as TW Telecom, initially known as Time Warner Communications (also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the ATC name), in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses. US West also took a 26% stake in the entertainment portion of the company, calling that division Time Warner Entertainment (or legally Time Warner Entertainment Company L.P.). US West's stake eventually passed to acquired cable company MediaOne, then to AT&T Broadband in 1999 when that company acquired MediaOne, then finally to Comcast in 2001 when that company bought the AT&T Broadband division. Comcast sold their stake in the company in 2003, relegating the name to a subdivision under Time Warner Cable.
Time Warner subsequently acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System in October 1996. Not only did this result in the company (in a way) re-entering the basic cable television industry (in regards to nationally available channels), but Warner Bros. also regained the rights to their pre-1950[34][35] film library, which by then had been owned by Turner (the films are still technically held by Turner, but WB is responsible for sales and distribution),[36] while Turner gained access to WB's post-1950 library, as well as other WB-owned properties.
Time Warner purchased the Six Flags Theme Parks chain in 1993. The company later sold all Six Flags parks and properties to Oklahoma-based Premier Parks on April 1, 1998.[37]
Dick Parsons, already a director on the board since 1991, was hired as Time Warner president in 1995, although the division operational heads continued to report directly to Chairman and CEO Gerald Levin.[38]
In 1991, HBO and Cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers, with companion channels supplementing the main networks.[39]
In 1993, HBO became the world's first digitally transmitted television service.[40]
In 1995, CNN introduced CNN.com which later became a leading destination for global digital news, both online and mobile.[41]
In 1996, Warner Bros. spearheaded the introduction of the DVD, which rapidly replaced VHS tapes as the standard for home video.[42]
In 1999, HBO became the first national cable TV network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel.[43]
2000s[edit]
Merger with AOL[edit]
In 2000, it was announced that AOL would purchase Time Warner for US$164 billion.[44] Due to the larger market capitalization of AOL, their shareholders would own 55% of the new company while Time Warner shareholders owned only 45%,[45] so in actual practice AOL had acquired Time Warner, even though Time Warner had far more assets and revenues. Time Warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution, while AOL wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets.[46]
The deal, announced on January 10, 2000[45] and officially filed on February 11, 2000,[47] employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity. The Federal Trade Commission cleared the deal on December 14, 2000,[48] and gave final approval on January 11, 2001; the company completed the merger later that day.[49] The deal was approved on the same day by the Federal Communications Commission,[47] and had already been cleared by the European Commission on October 11, 2000.[50]
AOL Time Warner Inc., as the company was then called, was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides. Gerald Levin, who had served as Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. Steve Case served as Executive Chairman of the board of directors, Robert W. Pittman (President and COO of AOL) and Dick Parsons (President of Time Warner) served as Co-Chief Operating Officers, and J. Michael Kelly (the CFO from AOL) became the Chief Financial Officer.[51]
According to AOL President and COO Bob Pittman, the slow-moving Time Warner would now take off at Internet speed, accelerated by AOL: "All you need to do is put a catalyst to [Time Warner], and in a short period, you can alter the growth rate. The growth rate will be like an Internet company." When the AOL Time Warner deal was announced, the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward; by tapping into AOL, Time Warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers. AOL would use Time Warner's high-speed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers Time Warner's branded magazines, books, music, and movies. This would have created 130 million subscription relationships.
Unfortunately, the growth and profitability of the AOL division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers. The value of the America Online division dropped significantly, not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell, and forced a goodwill write-off, causing AOL Time Warner to report a loss of $99 billion in 2002 — at the time, the largest loss ever reported by a company. The total value of AOL stock subsequently went from $226 billion to about $20 billion.[52]
An outburst by Vice Chairman Ted Turner at a board meeting prompted Steve Case to contact each of the directors and push for CEO Gerald Levin's ouster. Although Case's coup attempt was rebuffed by Parsons and several other directors, Levin became frustrated with being unable to "regain the rhythm" at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of 2001, effective in May 2002.[53] Although Co-COO Bob Pittman was the strongest supporter of Levin and largely seen as the heir-apparent, Dick Parsons was instead chosen as CEO. Time Warner CFO J. Michael Kelly was demoted to COO of the AOL division, and replaced as CFO by Wayne Pace. AOL Chairman and CEO Barry Schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new "content creation division", being replaced on an interim basis by Pittman, who was already serving as the sole COO after Parsons' promotion.
Many expected synergies between AOL and other Time Warner divisions never materialized, as most Time Warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger. A new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of AOL Time Warner, replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division, caused resentment among Time Warner division heads who blamed the AOL division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company. AOL Time Warner COO Pittman, who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives, who also criticized Pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for AOL Time Warner that were never met. Some of the attacks on Pittman were reported to come from the print media in the Time, Inc. division under Don Logan.[54] Furthermore, CEO Parsons' democratic style prevented Pittman from exercising authority over the "old-guard" division heads who resisted Pittman's synergy initiatives.[51][55]
Pittman announced his resignation as AOL Time Warner COO after July 4, 2002, being reportedly burned out by the AOL special assignment and almost hospitalized, unhappy about the criticism from Time Warner executives, and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as Parsons was firmly entrenched as CEO.[55] Pittman's departure was seen as a great victory to Time Warner executives who wanted to undo the merger. In a sign of AOL's diminishing importance to the media conglomerate, Pittman's responsibilities were divided between two Time Warner veterans; Jeffrey Bewkes who was CEO of Home Box Office, and Don Logan who had been CEO of Time. Logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group, overseeing America Online, Time, Time Warner Cable, the AOL Time Warner Book Group and the Interactive Video unit, relegating AOL to being just another division in the conglomerate. Bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group, comprising HBO, New Line Cinema, The WB, Turner Networks, Warner Bros. and Warner Music. Both Logan and Bewkes, who had initially opposed the merger, were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to AOL Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons.[54][56] Logan, generally admired at Time Warner and reviled by AOL for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker, moved to purge AOL of several "Pittman panzers".[53]
AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case took on added prominence as the co-head of a new strategy committee of the board, making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the Internet. However, under pressure from institutional investor vice president Gordon Crawford who lined up dissenters, Case announced in January 2003 that he would not stand for re-election as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting, making CEO Richard Parsons the chairman-elect. That year, the company dropped the "AOL" from its name, and spun off Time-Life's ownership under the legal name Direct Holdings Americas, Inc. Case resigned from the Time Warner board on October 31, 2005.[53][57] Jeff Bewkes, who eventually became CEO of Time Warner, described the 2001 merger with AOL as 'the biggest mistake in corporate history'.[58]
In 2005, Time Warner was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[59][60][61] On December 27, 2007, newly installed Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes discussed possible plans to spin off Time Warner Cable and sell off AOL and Time Inc. This would leave a smaller company made up of Turner Broadcasting, Warner Bros. and HBO.[62] On February 28, 2008, co-chairmen and co-CEOs of New Line Cinema Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne announced their resignations from the 40-year-old movie studio in response to Jeffrey Bewkes's demand for cost-cutting measures at the studio, which he intended to dissolve into Warner Bros.
On May 28, 2009, Time Warner announced that it would spin off AOL as a separate independent company, with the change occurring on December 9, 2009.
2010s[edit]
In 2010, Turner Sports, Inc. and the National Collegiate Athletic Association jointly announced the formation of NCAA Digital, a 14-year agreement in which Turner will manage and operate the NCAA’s digital portfolio and strengthen coverage of all 88 NCAA championships. NCAA Digital encompasses NCAA.com and additional NCAA digital platforms, including mobile web and applications, as well as other connected devices.[63]
On August 25, 2010, Time Warner's Latin American division bought Chilean nationwide terrestrial television station Chilevisión from Chile's elected president Sebastián Piñera. Time Warner already operates in the country with CNN Chile.[64]
In January 2012, Home Box Office and DISH Network LLC reached an agreement that will give DISH customers expanded access to HBO’s acclaimed programming.
In October 2012, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Media Distribution reached an agreement that will give Warner Bros. rights to Blu-ray and DVD distribution of several titles from Paramount in the US and Canada.[65]
In June 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid for Time Warner at $85 per share in stock and cash ($80 billion total) which Time Warner's board of directors turned down in July. Warner's CNN unit would have been sold to ease antitrust issues of the purchase.[66] On August 5, 2014, 21st Century Fox withdrew its offer to purchase Time Warner.
In January 2014, Time Warner, Related Companies, and Oxford Properties Group announced that Time Warner intends to relocate the Company’s corporate headquarters and its New York City-based employees to 30 Hudson Yards in the Hudson Yards neighborhood in Chelsea, Manhattan, and has accordingly made an initial financial commitment.[67] Time Warner sold its stake in the Columbus Circle building for $1.3 billion to Related and two wealth funds. The move will be completed in 2018.[68]
Transactions[edit]
On December 15, 2006, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. announced an investment in SCi Entertainment Group plc[69] the parent company of publishing label Eidos Interactive Ltd, representing 10.3 percent of the company's enlarged share capital.

On February 19, 2009, Time Warner and Time Warner Cable completed the separation of the two companies through a spin-off.[75][76]
On March 17, 2009, Time Warner Inc. announced the legal and structural separation of Time Warner Cable Inc. (NYSE:TWC) from Time Warner through a tax-free spin-off that had become effective on March 12, 2009.
In the first quarter of 2010, Home Box Office purchased additional interests in HBO LAG for $217 million, which resulted in Home Box Office owning 80% of the equity interests of HBO LAG. In 2010, Home Box Office purchased the remainder of its partners’ interests in HBO Europe[77] (formerly HBO Central Europe) for $136 million, net of cash acquired.
On April 20, 2010, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group announced the acquisition of Turbine, Inc.,[78] a gaming studio in North America.

On March 6, 2013, Time Warner announced that it would spin off its publishing division Time Inc. as a separate, publicly traded company. The transaction was completed on June 6, 2014.[86][87]
Planned acquisition by AT&T[edit]
On October 20, 2016, it was reported that AT&T was in talks to acquire Time Warner. The proposed deal would give AT&T significant holdings in the media industry; AT&T's competitor Comcast had previously acquired NBCUniversal in a similar bid to increase its media holdings, in concert with its ownership of television and internet providers.[88][89][9] On October 22, 2016, AT&T reached a deal to buy Time Warner for $108.7 billion. If approved by federal regulators, the merger would bring Time Warner's properties under the same umbrella as AT&T's telecommunication holdings, including satellite provider DirecTV.[90][91]
On February 15, 2017, Time Warner shareholders approved the merger,[92] which is still pending regulatory approval. On February 28, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that his agency will not review the deal, leaving the review to the US Department of Justice.[93]

Main article: The CW




The CW logo.


On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner announced that they were to create a new broadcast network, The CW. The network officially debuted on September 18, 2006. The network formally debuted on September 20 with the 2-hour premiere of America's Next Top Model.
The network is the result of a merger of The WB (a Time Warner holding) and UPN (a CBS Corporation holding). CBS Corporation and Time Warner each own 50% of the network. Tribune Broadcasting (previously owned a 25% stake on The WB) and CBS Corporation contributed its stations as new network affiliates.
Commercial properties[edit]
Time Warner owns several large properties in New York City; certain buildings in the Rockefeller Center complex and adjacent office towers house its main offices; one of which houses a CNN news studio. In late 2003, Time Warner finished construction of a new twin-tower complex, designed to serve as additional office space, facing Columbus Circle on the southwestern edge of Central Park. Originally called the AOL Time Warner Center, the 755-foot (230 m), 55-floor mixed-use property was renamed Time Warner Center when the company itself was renamed.[95]

Competition[edit]
Time Warner faces industry competition from traditional media companies such as Sony, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, Viacom, The Walt Disney Company, and Comcast. Time Warner's and many of their competitions' business may be severely impacted by the increasing viewership of feature films, television programming and other content online with low ad-income, which decreases company revenues.
Box office receipts have been rising while the growth rate of DVD sales have recently been declining, which affects Warner Bros.' growth prospects and revenues.[105]
Company names[edit]

Warner Bros. Pictures (1923–1967)
Seven Arts Productions (1957–1967)

Time Warner, Inc. is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered in New York City.[6] It is currently the world's third largest entertainment company in terms of revenue, after Comcast and The Walt Disney Company. It was also once the world's largest media conglomerate.[7] Time Warner was first founded in 1990, with the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The current company consists largely of the assets of the former Warner Communications (as well as HBO, a Time Inc. subsidiary prior to the merger), and the assets of Turner Broadcasting (which was acquired by the company in 1996). Time Warner currently has major operations in film and television, with a limited amount in publishing operations. Among its major assets are HBO, Turner Broadcasting System, The CW, Warner Bros., CNN, DC Comics, and as of August 2016, Hulu, owning 10%.[8] In the past, other major divisions of Time Warner included Time Inc., AOL, Time Warner Cable, Warner Books and Warner Music Group. All of these operations were either sold to other investors or spun off as independent companies from 2004 to 2014.
On October 22, 2016, AT&T announced its intent to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion (including assumed Time Warner debt).[9][10]

Home Entertainment Group works across platforms and outlets in the digital realm with video-on-demand, branded channels, original content, anti-piracy technology and broadband & wireless destinations. Each year Warner Bros. Pictures produces between 18 and 22 films. Warner Bros. has produced more than 50 television series in the 2012–2013 television season.

The DC Comics imprint, home to such iconic characters as Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash and Green Lantern, has launched digital versions of its top comic book and graphic novel titles, making them available for download on digital platforms.[21]
History[edit]
1920s[edit]
Time magazine made its debut in 1923 as the first weekly news magazine in the United States.[22] Four years later, in 1927, Warner Bros. released the world’s first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer.[23]
1960s[edit]
In 1963, recommendations from Time Inc. based on how it delivered magazines led to the introduction of ZIP codes by the United States Post Office.[citation needed]
1970s[edit]
In 1972, Kinney National Company spun off its non-entertainment assets due to a financial scandal over its parking operations and renamed itself Warner Communications Inc.[24]
It was the holding company for Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Music Group during the 1970s and 1980s. It also owned DC Comics and Mad, as well as a majority stake in Garden State National Bank (an investment it was ultimately required to sell pursuant to requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act). Warner's initial divestiture efforts led by Garden State CEO Charles A. Agemian were blocked by Garden State board member William A. Conway in 1978; a revised transaction was later completed in 1980.
In 1975, Home Box Office became the first TV network to broadcast nationally via satellite, debuting with the Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier “Thrilla in Manila” boxing match.[25]
In 1975, Warner expanded under the guidance of CEO Steve Ross and formed a joint venture with American Express, named Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, which held cable channels including MTV (launched 1981), Nickelodeon (launched 1979) and The Movie Channel. Warner Bros. bought out American Express's half in 1984, and sold the venture a year later to Viacom, which renamed it MTV Networks.[citation needed]
In 1976, the Turner–owned WTCG originated the "superstation" concept, transmitting via satellite to cable systems nationwide and pioneering the basic cable business model. WTCG was renamed WTBS in 1979.
In 1976, Nolan Bushnell sold Atari, Inc. to Warner Communications for an estimated $2–12 million. Warner made considerable profits (and later losses) with Atari, which it owned from 1976 to 1984. While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of Atari 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time.[26]
1980s[edit]
In 1980, Warner purchased The Franklin Mint for about $225 million. The combination was short lived: Warner sold The Franklin Mint in 1985 to American Protection Industries Inc. (API) for $167.5 million. However, Warner retained Franklin Mint’s Eastern Mountain Sports as well as The Franklin Mint Center, which it leased back to API.[27][28]
In 1980, Turner launched CNN, the first 24-hour all-news network, redefining the way the world received breaking news.[29]
In January 1983, Warner expanded their interests to baseball. Under the direction of Caesar P. Kimmel, executive vice president, bought 48 percent of the Pittsburgh Pirates for $10 million.[30] The company then put up its share for sale in November 1984 following losses of $6 million due to its failed attempt to launch a cable sports package. The team's majority owner, John W. Galbreath, soon followed suit after learning of Warner's actions.[31] Both Galbreath and Warner sold the Pirates to local investors in March 1986.
In 1984, due to major losses spurred by subsidiary Atari Inc.'s losses, Warner sold Atari Inc.'s Consumer Division assets to Jack Tramiel. It kept the rest of the company and named it Atari Games, eventually reducing it to just the Coin Division. They sold Atari Games to Namco in 1985, and repurchased it in 1992, renaming it Time-Warner Interactive, until it was sold to Midway Games in 1996. In a long-expected deal, Warner Communications announced on May 11, 1988, they were acquiring Lorimar-Telepictures; the acquisition was finalized on January 12, 1989.[32]
The merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications was announced on March 4, 1989.[33] During the summer of that same year, Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western) launched a $12.2 billion hostile bid to acquire Time, Inc. in an attempt to end a stock-swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications. This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9 Billion in cash and stock. Paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time/Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Paramount to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of the two companies' merger which was completed on January 10, 1990. However, instead of the companies becoming defunct, the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure, resulting in the new company being called "Time Warner".
1990s[edit]
US West partnered with Time Warner in 1993 to form what is now known as TW Telecom, initially known as Time Warner Communications (also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the ATC name), in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses. US West also took a 26% stake in the entertainment portion of the company, calling that division Time Warner Entertainment (or legally Time Warner Entertainment Company L.P.). US West's stake eventually passed to acquired cable company MediaOne, then to AT&T Broadband in 1999 when that company acquired MediaOne, then finally to Comcast in 2001 when that company bought the AT&T Broadband division. Comcast sold their stake in the company in 2003, relegating the name to a subdivision under Time Warner Cable.
Time Warner subsequently acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System in October 1996. Not only did this result in the company (in a way) re-entering the basic cable television industry (in regards to nationally available channels), but Warner Bros. also regained the rights to their pre-1950[34][35] film library, which by then had been owned by Turner (the films are still technically held by Turner, but WB is responsible for sales and distribution),[36] while Turner gained access to WB's post-1950 library, as well as other WB-owned properties.
Time Warner purchased the Six Flags Theme Parks chain in 1993. The company later sold all Six Flags parks and properties to Oklahoma-based Premier Parks on April 1, 1998.[37]
Dick Parsons, already a director on the board since 1991, was hired as Time Warner president in 1995, although the division operational heads continued to report directly to Chairman and CEO Gerald Levin.[38]
In 1991, HBO and Cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers, with companion channels supplementing the main networks.[39]
In 1993, HBO became the world's first digitally transmitted television service.[40]
In 1995, CNN introduced CNN.com which later became a leading destination for global digital news, both online and mobile.[41]
In 1996, Warner Bros. spearheaded the introduction of the DVD, which rapidly replaced VHS tapes as the standard for home video.[42]
In 1999, HBO became the first national cable TV network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel.[43]
2000s[edit]
Merger with AOL[edit]
In 2000, it was announced that AOL would purchase Time Warner for US$164 billion.[44] Due to the larger market capitalization of AOL, their shareholders would own 55% of the new company while Time Warner shareholders owned only 45%,[45] so in actual practice AOL had acquired Time Warner, even though Time Warner had far more assets and revenues. Time Warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution, while AOL wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets.[46]
The deal, announced on January 10, 2000[45] and officially filed on February 11, 2000,[47] employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity. The Federal Trade Commission cleared the deal on December 14, 2000,[48] and gave final approval on January 11, 2001; the company completed the merger later that day.[49] The deal was approved on the same day by the Federal Communications Commission,[47] and had already been cleared by the European Commission on October 11, 2000.[50]
AOL Time Warner Inc., as the company was then called, was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides. Gerald Levin, who had served as Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. Steve Case served as Executive Chairman of the board of directors, Robert W. Pittman (President and COO of AOL) and Dick Parsons (President of Time Warner) served as Co-Chief Operating Officers, and J. Michael Kelly (the CFO from AOL) became the Chief Financial Officer.[51]
According to AOL President and COO Bob Pittman, the slow-moving Time Warner would now take off at Internet speed, accelerated by AOL: "All you need to do is put a catalyst to [Time Warner], and in a short period, you can alter the growth rate. The growth rate will be like an Internet company." When the AOL Time Warner deal was announced, the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward; by tapping into AOL, Time Warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers. AOL would use Time Warner's high-speed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers Time Warner's branded magazines, books, music, and movies. This would have created 130 million subscription relationships.
Unfortunately, the growth and profitability of the AOL division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers. The value of the America Online division dropped significantly, not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell, and forced a goodwill write-off, causing AOL Time Warner to report a loss of $99 billion in 2002 — at the time, the largest loss ever reported by a company. The total value of AOL stock subsequently went from $226 billion to about $20 billion.[52]
An outburst by Vice Chairman Ted Turner at a board meeting prompted Steve Case to contact each of the directors and push for CEO Gerald Levin's ouster. Although Case's coup attempt was rebuffed by Parsons and several other directors, Levin became frustrated with being unable to "regain the rhythm" at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of 2001, effective in May 2002.[53] Although Co-COO Bob Pittman was the strongest supporter of Levin and largely seen as the heir-apparent, Dick Parsons was instead chosen as CEO. Time Warner CFO J. Michael Kelly was demoted to COO of the AOL division, and replaced as CFO by Wayne Pace. AOL Chairman and CEO Barry Schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new "content creation division", being replaced on an interim basis by Pittman, who was already serving as the sole COO after Parsons' promotion.
Many expected synergies between AOL and other Time Warner divisions never materialized, as most Time Warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger. A new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of AOL Time Warner, replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division, caused resentment among Time Warner division heads who blamed the AOL division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company. AOL Time Warner COO Pittman, who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives, who also criticized Pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for AOL Time Warner that were never met. Some of the attacks on Pittman were reported to come from the print media in the Time, Inc. division under Don Logan.[54] Furthermore, CEO Parsons' democratic style prevented Pittman from exercising authority over the "old-guard" division heads who resisted Pittman's synergy initiatives.[51][55]
Pittman announced his resignation as AOL Time Warner COO after July 4, 2002, being reportedly burned out by the AOL special assignment and almost hospitalized, unhappy about the criticism from Time Warner executives, and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as Parsons was firmly entrenched as CEO.[55] Pittman's departure was seen as a great victory to Time Warner executives who wanted to undo the merger. In a sign of AOL's diminishing importance to the media conglomerate, Pittman's responsibilities were divided between two Time Warner veterans; Jeffrey Bewkes who was CEO of Home Box Office, and Don Logan who had been CEO of Time. Logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group, overseeing America Online, Time, Time Warner Cable, the AOL Time Warner Book Group and the Interactive Video unit, relegating AOL to being just another division in the conglomerate. Bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group, comprising HBO, New Line Cinema, The WB, Turner Networks, Warner Bros. and Warner Music. Both Logan and Bewkes, who had initially opposed the merger, were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to AOL Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons.[54][56] Logan, generally admired at Time Warner and reviled by AOL for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker, moved to purge AOL of several "Pittman panzers".[53]
AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case took on added prominence as the co-head of a new strategy committee of the board, making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the Internet. However, under pressure from institutional investor vice president Gordon Crawford who lined up dissenters, Case announced in January 2003 that he would not stand for re-election as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting, making CEO Richard Parsons the chairman-elect. That year, the company dropped the "AOL" from its name, and spun off Time-Life's ownership under the legal name Direct Holdings Americas, Inc. Case resigned from the Time Warner board on October 31, 2005.[53][57] Jeff Bewkes, who eventually became CEO of Time Warner, described the 2001 merger with AOL as 'the biggest mistake in corporate history'.[58]
In 2005, Time Warner was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[59][60][61] On December 27, 2007, newly installed Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes discussed possible plans to spin off Time Warner Cable and sell off AOL and Time Inc. This would leave a smaller company made up of Turner Broadcasting, Warner Bros. and HBO.[62] On February 28, 2008, co-chairmen and co-CEOs of New Line Cinema Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne announced their resignations from the 40-year-old movie studio in response to Jeffrey Bewkes's demand for cost-cutting measures at the studio, which he intended to dissolve into Warner Bros.
On May 28, 2009, Time Warner announced that it would spin off AOL as a separate independent company, with the change occurring on December 9, 2009.
2010s[edit]
In 2010, Turner Sports, Inc. and the National Collegiate Athletic Association jointly announced the formation of NCAA Digital, a 14-year agreement in which Turner will manage and operate the NCAA’s digital portfolio and strengthen coverage of all 88 NCAA championships. NCAA Digital encompasses NCAA.com and additional NCAA digital platforms, including mobile web and applications, as well as other connected devices.[63]
On August 25, 2010, Time Warner's Latin American division bought Chilean nationwide terrestrial television station Chilevisión from Chile's elected president Sebastián Piñera. Time Warner already operates in the country with CNN Chile.[64]

In June 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid for Time Warner at $85 per share in stock and cash ($80 billion total) which Time Warner's board of directors turned down in July. Warner's CNN unit would have been sold to ease antitrust issues of the purchase.[66] On August 5, 2014, 21st Century Fox withdrew its offer to purchase Time Warner.
In January 2014, Time Warner, Related Companies, and Oxford Properties Group announced that Time Warner intends to relocate the Company’s corporate headquarters and its New York City-based employees to 30 Hudson Yards in the Hudson Yards neighborhood in Chelsea, Manhattan, and has accordingly made an initial financial commitment.[67] Time Warner sold its stake in the Columbus Circle building for $1.3 billion to Related and two wealth funds. The move will be completed in 2018.[68]

Planned acquisition by AT&T[edit]
On October 20, 2016, it was reported that AT&T was in talks to acquire Time Warner. The proposed deal would give AT&T significant holdings in the media industry; AT&T's competitor Comcast had previously acquired NBCUniversal in a similar bid to increase its media holdings, in concert with its ownership of television and internet providers.[88][89][9] On October 22, 2016, AT&T reached a deal to buy Time Warner for $108.7 billion. If approved by federal regulators, the merger would bring Time Warner's properties under the same umbrella as AT&T's telecommunication holdings, including satellite provider DirecTV.[90][91]
On February 15, 2017, Time Warner shareholders approved the merger,[92] which is still pending regulatory approval. On February 28, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that his agency will not review the deal, leaving the review to the US Department of Justice.[93]

On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner announced that they were to create a new broadcast network, The CW. The network officially debuted on September 18, 2006. The network formally debuted on September 20 with the 2-hour premiere of America's Next Top Model.
The network is the result of a merger of The WB (a Time Warner holding) and UPN (a CBS Corporation holding). CBS Corporation and Time Warner each own 50% of the network. Tribune Broadcasting (previously owned a 25% stake on The WB) and CBS Corporation contributed its stations as new network affiliates.
Commercial properties[edit]
Time Warner owns several large properties in New York City; certain buildings in the Rockefeller Center complex and adjacent office towers house its main offices; one of which houses a CNN news studio. In late 2003, Time Warner finished construction of a new twin-tower complex, designed to serve as additional office space, facing Columbus Circle on the southwestern edge of Central Park. Originally called the AOL Time Warner Center, the 755-foot (230 m), 55-floor mixed-use property was renamed Time Warner Center when the company itself was renamed.[95]

Competition[edit]
Time Warner faces industry competition from traditional media companies such as Sony, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, Viacom, The Walt Disney Company, and Comcast. Time Warner's and many of their competitions' business may be severely impacted by the increasing viewership of feature films, television programming and other content online with low ad-income, which decreases company revenues.
Box office receipts have been rising while the growth rate of DVD sales have recently been declining, which affects Warner Bros.' growth prospects and revenues.[105]

Warner Bros. Pictures (1923–1967)
Seven Arts Productions (1957–1967)

Time Warner, Inc. is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered in New York City.[6] It is currently the world's third largest entertainment company in terms of revenue, after Comcast and The Walt Disney Company. It was also once the world's largest media conglomerate.[7] Time Warner was first founded in 1990, with the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The current company consists largely of the assets of the former Warner Communications (as well as HBO, a Time Inc. subsidiary prior to the merger), and the assets of Turner Broadcasting (which was acquired by the company in 1996). Time Warner currently has major operations in film and television, with a limited amount in publishing operations. Among its major assets are HBO, Turner Broadcasting System, The CW, Warner Bros., CNN, DC Comics, and as of August 2016, Hulu, owning 10%.[8] In the past, other major divisions of Time Warner included Time Inc., AOL, Time Warner Cable, Warner Books and Warner Music Group. All of these operations were either sold to other investors or spun off as independent companies from 2004 to 2014.
On October 22, 2016, AT&T announced its intent to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion (including assumed Time Warner debt).[9][10]

The DC Comics imprint, home to such iconic characters as Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash and Green Lantern, has launched digital versions of its top comic book and graphic novel titles, making them available for download on digital platforms.[21]
History[edit]
1920s[edit]
Time magazine made its debut in 1923 as the first weekly news magazine in the United States.[22] Four years later, in 1927, Warner Bros. released the world’s first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer.[23]
1960s[edit]
In 1963, recommendations from Time Inc. based on how it delivered magazines led to the introduction of ZIP codes by the United States Post Office.[citation needed]
1970s[edit]
In 1972, Kinney National Company spun off its non-entertainment assets due to a financial scandal over its parking operations and renamed itself Warner Communications Inc.[24]
It was the holding company for Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Music Group during the 1970s and 1980s. It also owned DC Comics and Mad, as well as a majority stake in Garden State National Bank (an investment it was ultimately required to sell pursuant to requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act). Warner's initial divestiture efforts led by Garden State CEO Charles A. Agemian were blocked by Garden State board member William A. Conway in 1978; a revised transaction was later completed in 1980.
In 1975, Home Box Office became the first TV network to broadcast nationally via satellite, debuting with the Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier “Thrilla in Manila” boxing match.[25]
In 1975, Warner expanded under the guidance of CEO Steve Ross and formed a joint venture with American Express, named Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, which held cable channels including MTV (launched 1981), Nickelodeon (launched 1979) and The Movie Channel. Warner Bros. bought out American Express's half in 1984, and sold the venture a year later to Viacom, which renamed it MTV Networks.[citation needed]
In 1976, the Turner–owned WTCG originated the "superstation" concept, transmitting via satellite to cable systems nationwide and pioneering the basic cable business model. WTCG was renamed WTBS in 1979.
In 1976, Nolan Bushnell sold Atari, Inc. to Warner Communications for an estimated $2–12 million. Warner made considerable profits (and later losses) with Atari, which it owned from 1976 to 1984. While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of Atari 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time.[26]
1980s[edit]
In 1980, Warner purchased The Franklin Mint for about $225 million. The combination was short lived: Warner sold The Franklin Mint in 1985 to American Protection Industries Inc. (API) for $167.5 million. However, Warner retained Franklin Mint’s Eastern Mountain Sports as well as The Franklin Mint Center, which it leased back to API.[27][28]
In 1980, Turner launched CNN, the first 24-hour all-news network, redefining the way the world received breaking news.[29]
In January 1983, Warner expanded their interests to baseball. Under the direction of Caesar P. Kimmel, executive vice president, bought 48 percent of the Pittsburgh Pirates for $10 million.[30] The company then put up its share for sale in November 1984 following losses of $6 million due to its failed attempt to launch a cable sports package. The team's majority owner, John W. Galbreath, soon followed suit after learning of Warner's actions.[31] Both Galbreath and Warner sold the Pirates to local investors in March 1986.
In 1984, due to major losses spurred by subsidiary Atari Inc.'s losses, Warner sold Atari Inc.'s Consumer Division assets to Jack Tramiel. It kept the rest of the company and named it Atari Games, eventually reducing it to just the Coin Division. They sold Atari Games to Namco in 1985, and repurchased it in 1992, renaming it Time-Warner Interactive, until it was sold to Midway Games in 1996. In a long-expected deal, Warner Communications announced on May 11, 1988, they were acquiring Lorimar-Telepictures; the acquisition was finalized on January 12, 1989.[32]
The merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications was announced on March 4, 1989.[33] During the summer of that same year, Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western) launched a $12.2 billion hostile bid to acquire Time, Inc. in an attempt to end a stock-swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications. This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9 Billion in cash and stock. Paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time/Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Paramount to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of the two companies' merger which was completed on January 10, 1990. However, instead of the companies becoming defunct, the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure, resulting in the new company being called "Time Warner".
1990s[edit]
US West partnered with Time Warner in 1993 to form what is now known as TW Telecom, initially known as Time Warner Communications (also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the ATC name), in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses. US West also took a 26% stake in the entertainment portion of the company, calling that division Time Warner Entertainment (or legally Time Warner Entertainment Company L.P.). US West's stake eventually passed to acquired cable company MediaOne, then to AT&T Broadband in 1999 when that company acquired MediaOne, then finally to Comcast in 2001 when that company bought the AT&T Broadband division. Comcast sold their stake in the company in 2003, relegating the name to a subdivision under Time Warner Cable.
Time Warner subsequently acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System in October 1996. Not only did this result in the company (in a way) re-entering the basic cable television industry (in regards to nationally available channels), but Warner Bros. also regained the rights to their pre-1950[34][35] film library, which by then had been owned by Turner (the films are still technically held by Turner, but WB is responsible for sales and distribution),[36] while Turner gained access to WB's post-1950 library, as well as other WB-owned properties.
Time Warner purchased the Six Flags Theme Parks chain in 1993. The company later sold all Six Flags parks and properties to Oklahoma-based Premier Parks on April 1, 1998.[37]
Dick Parsons, already a director on the board since 1991, was hired as Time Warner president in 1995, although the division operational heads continued to report directly to Chairman and CEO Gerald Levin.[38]
In 1991, HBO and Cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers, with companion channels supplementing the main networks.[39]
In 1993, HBO became the world's first digitally transmitted television service.[40]
In 1995, CNN introduced CNN.com which later became a leading destination for global digital news, both online and mobile.[41]
In 1996, Warner Bros. spearheaded the introduction of the DVD, which rapidly replaced VHS tapes as the standard for home video.[42]
In 1999, HBO became the first national cable TV network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel.[43]
2000s[edit]
Merger with AOL[edit]
In 2000, it was announced that AOL would purchase Time Warner for US$164 billion.[44] Due to the larger market capitalization of AOL, their shareholders would own 55% of the new company while Time Warner shareholders owned only 45%,[45] so in actual practice AOL had acquired Time Warner, even though Time Warner had far more assets and revenues. Time Warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution, while AOL wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets.[46]
The deal, announced on January 10, 2000[45] and officially filed on February 11, 2000,[47] employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity. The Federal Trade Commission cleared the deal on December 14, 2000,[48] and gave final approval on January 11, 2001; the company completed the merger later that day.[49] The deal was approved on the same day by the Federal Communications Commission,[47] and had already been cleared by the European Commission on October 11, 2000.[50]
AOL Time Warner Inc., as the company was then called, was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides. Gerald Levin, who had served as Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. Steve Case served as Executive Chairman of the board of directors, Robert W. Pittman (President and COO of AOL) and Dick Parsons (President of Time Warner) served as Co-Chief Operating Officers, and J. Michael Kelly (the CFO from AOL) became the Chief Financial Officer.[51]
According to AOL President and COO Bob Pittman, the slow-moving Time Warner would now take off at Internet speed, accelerated by AOL: "All you need to do is put a catalyst to [Time Warner], and in a short period, you can alter the growth rate. The growth rate will be like an Internet company." When the AOL Time Warner deal was announced, the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward; by tapping into AOL, Time Warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers. AOL would use Time Warner's high-speed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers Time Warner's branded magazines, books, music, and movies. This would have created 130 million subscription relationships.
Unfortunately, the growth and profitability of the AOL division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers. The value of the America Online division dropped significantly, not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell, and forced a goodwill write-off, causing AOL Time Warner to report a loss of $99 billion in 2002 — at the time, the largest loss ever reported by a company. The total value of AOL stock subsequently went from $226 billion to about $20 billion.[52]
An outburst by Vice Chairman Ted Turner at a board meeting prompted Steve Case to contact each of the directors and push for CEO Gerald Levin's ouster. Although Case's coup attempt was rebuffed by Parsons and several other directors, Levin became frustrated with being unable to "regain the rhythm" at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of 2001, effective in May 2002.[53] Although Co-COO Bob Pittman was the strongest supporter of Levin and largely seen as the heir-apparent, Dick Parsons was instead chosen as CEO. Time Warner CFO J. Michael Kelly was demoted to COO of the AOL division, and replaced as CFO by Wayne Pace. AOL Chairman and CEO Barry Schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new "content creation division", being replaced on an interim basis by Pittman, who was already serving as the sole COO after Parsons' promotion.
Many expected synergies between AOL and other Time Warner divisions never materialized, as most Time Warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger. A new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of AOL Time Warner, replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division, caused resentment among Time Warner division heads who blamed the AOL division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company. AOL Time Warner COO Pittman, who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives, who also criticized Pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for AOL Time Warner that were never met. Some of the attacks on Pittman were reported to come from the print media in the Time, Inc. division under Don Logan.[54] Furthermore, CEO Parsons' democratic style prevented Pittman from exercising authority over the "old-guard" division heads who resisted Pittman's synergy initiatives.[51][55]
Pittman announced his resignation as AOL Time Warner COO after July 4, 2002, being reportedly burned out by the AOL special assignment and almost hospitalized, unhappy about the criticism from Time Warner executives, and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as Parsons was firmly entrenched as CEO.[55] Pittman's departure was seen as a great victory to Time Warner executives who wanted to undo the merger. In a sign of AOL's diminishing importance to the media conglomerate, Pittman's responsibilities were divided between two Time Warner veterans; Jeffrey Bewkes who was CEO of Home Box Office, and Don Logan who had been CEO of Time. Logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group, overseeing America Online, Time, Time Warner Cable, the AOL Time Warner Book Group and the Interactive Video unit, relegating AOL to being just another division in the conglomerate. Bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group, comprising HBO, New Line Cinema, The WB, Turner Networks, Warner Bros. and Warner Music. Both Logan and Bewkes, who had initially opposed the merger, were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to AOL Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons.[54][56] Logan, generally admired at Time Warner and reviled by AOL for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker, moved to purge AOL of several "Pittman panzers".[53]
AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case took on added prominence as the co-head of a new strategy committee of the board, making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the Internet. However, under pressure from institutional investor vice president Gordon Crawford who lined up dissenters, Case announced in January 2003 that he would not stand for re-election as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting, making CEO Richard Parsons the chairman-elect. That year, the company dropped the "AOL" from its name, and spun off Time-Life's ownership under the legal name Direct Holdings Americas, Inc. Case resigned from the Time Warner board on October 31, 2005.[53][57] Jeff Bewkes, who eventually became CEO of Time Warner, described the 2001 merger with AOL as 'the biggest mistake in corporate history'.[58]
In 2005, Time Warner was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[59][60][61] On December 27, 2007, newly installed Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes discussed possible plans to spin off Time Warner Cable and sell off AOL and Time Inc. This would leave a smaller company made up of Turner Broadcasting, Warner Bros. and HBO.[62] On February 28, 2008, co-chairmen and co-CEOs of New Line Cinema Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne announced their resignations from the 40-year-old movie studio in response to Jeffrey Bewkes's demand for cost-cutting measures at the studio, which he intended to dissolve into Warner Bros.
On May 28, 2009, Time Warner announced that it would spin off AOL as a separate independent company, with the change occurring on December 9, 2009.
2010s[edit]

Planned acquisition by AT&T[edit]
On October 20, 2016, it was reported that AT&T was in talks to acquire Time Warner. The proposed deal would give AT&T significant holdings in the media industry; AT&T's competitor Comcast had previously acquired NBCUniversal in a similar bid to increase its media holdings, in concert with its ownership of television and internet providers.[88][89][9] On October 22, 2016, AT&T reached a deal to buy Time Warner for $108.7 billion.

Main article: The CW




The CW logo.


On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner announced that they were to create a new broadcast network, The CW. The network officially debuted on September 18, 2006. The network formally debuted on September 20 with the 2-hour premiere of America's Next Top Model.
The network is the result of a merger of The WB (a Time Warner holding) and UPN (a CBS Corporation holding). CBS Corporation and Time Warner each own 50% of the network. Tribune Broadcasting (previously owned a 25% stake on The WB) and CBS Corporation contributed its stations as new network affiliates.
Commercial properties[edit]
Time Warner owns several large properties in New York City; certain buildings in the Rockefeller Center complex and adjacent office towers house its main offices; one of which houses a CNN news studio. In late 2003, Time Warner finished construction of a new twin-tower complex, designed to serve as additional office space, facing Columbus Circle on the southwestern edge of Central Park. Originally called the AOL Time Warner Center, the 755-foot (230 m), 55-floor mixed-use property was renamed Time Warner Center when the company itself was renamed.[95]
Notable people[edit]
Time Warner Inc.[edit]
Jeff Bewkes, Chairman and CEO[96]
And five executive vice presidents, most with additional, functional titles:

Paul T. Cappuccio, General Counsel[97]
Gary L. Ginsberg, Corporate Marketing and Communications[98]
Howard M. Averill, Chief Financial Officer[99]
Carol A. Melton, Global Public Policy[100]

Division CEOs[edit]

Richard Plepler, Chairman and CEO of Home Box Office[102]
John Martin, Chairman and CEO of Turner Broadcasting System[103]
Kevin Tsujihara, Chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.[104]

Competition[edit]
Time Warner faces industry competition from traditional media companies such as Sony, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, Viacom, The Walt Disney Company, and Comcast. Time Warner's and many of their competitions' business may be severely impacted by the increasing viewership of feature films, television programming and other content online with low ad-income, which decreases company revenues.
Box office receipts have been rising while the growth rate of DVD sales have recently been declining, which affects Warner Bros.' growth prospects and revenues.[105]
Company names[edit]

Warner Bros. Pictures (1923–1967)
Seven Arts Productions (1957–1967)
Kinney National Company (1966–1972)
Warner Bros.-Seven Arts (1967–1969)
Warner Communications (1972–1990)
Time Warner (1990–2001, 2003–present)
Time Warner Entertainment (1992–2001)
AOL Time Warner (2001–2003)

Restatement[edit]

Time Warner, Inc. is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered in New York City.[6] It is currently the world's third largest entertainment company in terms of revenue, after Comcast and The Walt Disney Company. It was also once the world's largest media conglomerate.[7] Time Warner was first founded in 1990, with the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The current company consists largely of the assets of the former Warner Communications (as well as HBO, a Time Inc. subsidiary prior to the merger), and the assets of Turner Broadcasting (which was acquired by the company in 1996). Time Warner currently has major operations in film and television, with a limited amount in publishing operations. Among its major assets are HBO, Turner Broadcasting System, The CW, Warner Bros., CNN, DC Comics, and as of August 2016, Hulu, owning 10%.[8] In the past, other major divisions of Time Warner included Time Inc., AOL, Time Warner Cable, Warner Books and Warner Music Group. All of these operations were either sold to other investors or spun off as independent companies from 2004 to 2014.
On October 22, 2016, AT&T announced its intent to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion (including assumed Time Warner debt).[9][10]

Main article: HBO
Home Box Office, Inc. operates the namesake HBO premium television service as well as sister service Cinemax. HBO- and Cinemax-branded channels are currently available in over 70 countries around the world, and HBO programming is licensed to other television networks in over 150 countries.[12]
In 2012, HBO was the #1 premium pay television service in primetime television and total day ratings.[12] In 2013, the network received five Golden Globes and 23 primetime Emmy Awards.[13]
HBO’s programming includes the airing of feature films, HBO Documentary Films, HBO original films, and HBO original programming, HBO Sports (live HBO Boxing events).

Main article: Warner Bros.
Warner Bros. businesses range from feature film and TV to home entertainment production and worldwide distribution to home video, digital distribution, animation, comic books, licensing and international cinemas and broadcasting. In 2012, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group grossed 4.3 billion dollars at the worldwide box office.[19] Home Video is the industry leader with a 21% market share in total DVD and Blu-ray sales.[20]

Home Entertainment Group works across platforms and outlets in the digital realm with video-on-demand, branded channels, original content, anti-piracy technology and broadband & wireless destinations. Each year Warner Bros. Pictures produces between 18 and 22 films. Warner Bros. has produced more than 50 television series in the 2012–2013 television season. Warner Bros. has also incorporated DC Comics content into Warner Bros. Entertainment via the creation of the DC Entertainment division, which was founded in 2009. DC Entertainment, which is wholly owned by the Company, is responsible for bringing the stories and characters from the DC Comics, Vertigo and MAD Magazine publishing portfolios into other Warner Bros. content and distribution businesses, including feature films, television programming, video games, direct-to-consumer platforms and consumer products. The DC Comics imprint, home to such iconic characters as Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash and Green Lantern, has launched digital versions of its top comic book and graphic novel titles, making them available for download on digital platforms.[21]
History[edit]
1920s[edit]
Time magazine made its debut in 1923 as the first weekly news magazine in the United States.[22] Four years later, in 1927, Warner Bros. released the world’s first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer.[23]
1960s[edit]
In 1963, recommendations from Time Inc. based on how it delivered magazines led to the introduction of ZIP codes by the United States Post Office.[citation needed]
1970s[edit]
In 1972, Kinney National Company spun off its non-entertainment assets due to a financial scandal over its parking operations and renamed itself Warner Communications Inc.[24]
It was the holding company for Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Music Group during the 1970s and 1980s. It also owned DC Comics and Mad, as well as a majority stake in Garden State National Bank (an investment it was ultimately required to sell pursuant to requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act). Warner's initial divestiture efforts led by Garden State CEO Charles A. Agemian were blocked by Garden State board member William A. Conway in 1978; a revised transaction was later completed in 1980.
In 1975, Home Box Office became the first TV network to broadcast nationally via satellite, debuting with the Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier “Thrilla in Manila” boxing match.[25]
In 1975, Warner expanded under the guidance of CEO Steve Ross and formed a joint venture with American Express, named Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, which held cable channels including MTV (launched 1981), Nickelodeon (launched 1979) and The Movie Channel. Warner Bros. bought out American Express's half in 1984, and sold the venture a year later to Viacom, which renamed it MTV Networks.[citation needed]
In 1976, the Turner–owned WTCG originated the "superstation" concept, transmitting via satellite to cable systems nationwide and pioneering the basic cable business model. WTCG was renamed WTBS in 1979.
In 1976, Nolan Bushnell sold Atari, Inc. to Warner Communications for an estimated $2–12 million. Warner made considerable profits (and later losses) with Atari, which it owned from 1976 to 1984. While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of Atari 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time.[26]
1980s[edit]
In 1980, Warner purchased The Franklin Mint for about $225 million. The combination was short lived: Warner sold The Franklin Mint in 1985 to American Protection Industries Inc. (API) for $167.5 million. However, Warner retained Franklin Mint’s Eastern Mountain Sports as well as The Franklin Mint Center, which it leased back to API.[27][28]
In 1980, Turner launched CNN, the first 24-hour all-news network, redefining the way the world received breaking news.[29]
In January 1983, Warner expanded their interests to baseball. Under the direction of Caesar P. Kimmel, executive vice president, bought 48 percent of the Pittsburgh Pirates for $10 million.[30] The company then put up its share for sale in November 1984 following losses of $6 million due to its failed attempt to launch a cable sports package. The team's majority owner, John W. Galbreath, soon followed suit after learning of Warner's actions.[31] Both Galbreath and Warner sold the Pirates to local investors in March 1986.
In 1984, due to major losses spurred by subsidiary Atari Inc.'s losses, Warner sold Atari Inc.'s Consumer Division assets to Jack Tramiel. It kept the rest of the company and named it Atari Games, eventually reducing it to just the Coin Division. They sold Atari Games to Namco in 1985, and repurchased it in 1992, renaming it Time-Warner Interactive, until it was sold to Midway Games in 1996. In a long-expected deal, Warner Communications announced on May 11, 1988, they were acquiring Lorimar-Telepictures; the acquisition was finalized on January 12, 1989.[32]
The merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications was announced on March 4, 1989.[33] During the summer of that same year, Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western) launched a $12.2 billion hostile bid to acquire Time, Inc. in an attempt to end a stock-swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications. This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9 Billion in cash and stock. Paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time/Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Paramount to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of the two companies' merger which was completed on January 10, 1990. However, instead of the companies becoming defunct, the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure, resulting in the new company being called "Time Warner".
1990s[edit]
US West partnered with Time Warner in 1993 to form what is now known as TW Telecom, initially known as Time Warner Communications (also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the ATC name), in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses. US West also took a 26% stake in the entertainment portion of the company, calling that division Time Warner Entertainment (or legally Time Warner Entertainment Company L.P.). US West's stake eventually passed to acquired cable company MediaOne, then to AT&T Broadband in 1999 when that company acquired MediaOne, then finally to Comcast in 2001 when that company bought the AT&T Broadband division. Comcast sold their stake in the company in 2003, relegating the name to a subdivision under Time Warner Cable.
Time Warner subsequently acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System in October 1996. Not only did this result in the company (in a way) re-entering the basic cable television industry (in regards to nationally available channels), but Warner Bros. also regained the rights to their pre-1950[34][35] film library, which by then had been owned by Turner (the films are still technically held by Turner, but WB is responsible for sales and distribution),[36] while Turner gained access to WB's post-1950 library, as well as other WB-owned properties.
Time Warner purchased the Six Flags Theme Parks chain in 1993. The company later sold all Six Flags parks and properties to Oklahoma-based Premier Parks on April 1, 1998.[37]
Dick Parsons, already a director on the board since 1991, was hired as Time Warner president in 1995, although the division operational heads continued to report directly to Chairman and CEO Gerald Levin.[38]
In 1991, HBO and Cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers, with companion channels supplementing the main networks.[39]
In 1993, HBO became the world's first digitally transmitted television service.[40]
In 1995, CNN introduced CNN.com which later became a leading destination for global digital news, both online and mobile.[41]
In 1996, Warner Bros. spearheaded the introduction of the DVD, which rapidly replaced VHS tapes as the standard for home video.[42]
In 1999, HBO became the first national cable TV network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel.[43]
2000s[edit]
Merger with AOL[edit]
In 2000, it was announced that AOL would purchase Time Warner for US$164 billion.[44] Due to the larger market capitalization of AOL, their shareholders would own 55% of the new company while Time Warner shareholders owned only 45%,[45] so in actual practice AOL had acquired Time Warner, even though Time Warner had far more assets and revenues. Time Warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution, while AOL wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets.[46]
The deal, announced on January 10, 2000[45] and officially filed on February 11, 2000,[47] employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity. The Federal Trade Commission cleared the deal on December 14, 2000,[48] and gave final approval on January 11, 2001; the company completed the merger later that day.[49] The deal was approved on the same day by the Federal Communications Commission,[47] and had already been cleared by the European Commission on October 11, 2000.[50]
AOL Time Warner Inc., as the company was then called, was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides. Gerald Levin, who had served as Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. Steve Case served as Executive Chairman of the board of directors, Robert W. Pittman (President and COO of AOL) and Dick Parsons (President of Time Warner) served as Co-Chief Operating Officers, and J. Michael Kelly (the CFO from AOL) became the Chief Financial Officer.[51]
According to AOL President and COO Bob Pittman, the slow-moving Time Warner would now take off at Internet speed, accelerated by AOL: "All you need to do is put a catalyst to [Time Warner], and in a short period, you can alter the growth rate. The growth rate will be like an Internet company." When the AOL Time Warner deal was announced, the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward; by tapping into AOL, Time Warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers. AOL would use Time Warner's high-speed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers Time Warner's branded magazines, books, music, and movies. This would have created 130 million subscription relationships.
Unfortunately, the growth and profitability of the AOL division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers. The value of the America Online division dropped significantly, not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell, and forced a goodwill write-off, causing AOL Time Warner to report a loss of $99 billion in 2002 — at the time, the largest loss ever reported by a company. The total value of AOL stock subsequently went from $226 billion to about $20 billion.[52]
An outburst by Vice Chairman Ted Turner at a board meeting prompted Steve Case to contact each of the directors and push for CEO Gerald Levin's ouster. Although Case's coup attempt was rebuffed by Parsons and several other directors, Levin became frustrated with being unable to "regain the rhythm" at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of 2001, effective in May 2002.[53] Although Co-COO Bob Pittman was the strongest supporter of Levin and largely seen as the heir-apparent, Dick Parsons was instead chosen as CEO. Time Warner CFO J. Michael Kelly was demoted to COO of the AOL division, and replaced as CFO by Wayne Pace. AOL Chairman and CEO Barry Schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new "content creation division", being replaced on an interim basis by Pittman, who was already serving as the sole COO after Parsons' promotion.
Many expected synergies between AOL and other Time Warner divisions never materialized, as most Time Warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger. A new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of AOL Time Warner, replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division, caused resentment among Time Warner division heads who blamed the AOL division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company. AOL Time Warner COO Pittman, who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives, who also criticized Pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for AOL Time Warner that were never met. Some of the attacks on Pittman were reported to come from the print media in the Time, Inc. division under Don Logan.[54] Furthermore, CEO Parsons' democratic style prevented Pittman from exercising authority over the "old-guard" division heads who resisted Pittman's synergy initiatives.[51][55]
Pittman announced his resignation as AOL Time Warner COO after July 4, 2002, being reportedly burned out by the AOL special assignment and almost hospitalized, unhappy about the criticism from Time Warner executives, and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as Parsons was firmly entrenched as CEO.[55] Pittman's departure was seen as a great victory to Time Warner executives who wanted to undo the merger. In a sign of AOL's diminishing importance to the media conglomerate, Pittman's responsibilities were divided between two Time Warner veterans; Jeffrey Bewkes who was CEO of Home Box Office, and Don Logan who had been CEO of Time. Logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group, overseeing America Online, Time, Time Warner Cable, the AOL Time Warner Book Group and the Interactive Video unit, relegating AOL to being just another division in the conglomerate. Bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group, comprising HBO, New Line Cinema, The WB, Turner Networks, Warner Bros. and Warner Music. Both Logan and Bewkes, who had initially opposed the merger, were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to AOL Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons.[54][56] Logan, generally admired at Time Warner and reviled by AOL for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker, moved to purge AOL of several "Pittman panzers".[53]
AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case took on added prominence as the co-head of a new strategy committee of the board, making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the Internet. However, under pressure from institutional investor vice president Gordon Crawford who lined up dissenters, Case announced in January 2003 that he would not stand for re-election as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting, making CEO Richard Parsons the chairman-elect. That year, the company dropped the "AOL" from its name, and spun off Time-Life's ownership under the legal name Direct Holdings Americas, Inc. Case resigned from the Time Warner board on October 31, 2005.[53][57] Jeff Bewkes, who eventually became CEO of Time Warner, described the 2001 merger with AOL as 'the biggest mistake in corporate history'.[58]
In 2005, Time Warner was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[59][60][61] On December 27, 2007, newly installed Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes discussed possible plans to spin off Time Warner Cable and sell off AOL and Time Inc. This would leave a smaller company made up of Turner Broadcasting, Warner Bros. and HBO.[62] On February 28, 2008, co-chairmen and co-CEOs of New Line Cinema Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne announced their resignations from the 40-year-old movie studio in response to Jeffrey Bewkes's demand for cost-cutting measures at the studio, which he intended to dissolve into Warner Bros.
On May 28, 2009, Time Warner announced that it would spin off AOL as a separate independent company, with the change occurring on December 9, 2009.
2010s[edit]
In 2010, Turner Sports, Inc. and the National Collegiate Athletic Association jointly announced the formation of NCAA Digital, a 14-year agreement in which Turner will manage and operate the NCAA’s digital portfolio and strengthen coverage of all 88 NCAA championships. NCAA Digital encompasses NCAA.com and additional NCAA digital platforms, including mobile web and applications, as well as other connected devices.[63]
On August 25, 2010, Time Warner's Latin American division bought Chilean nationwide terrestrial television station Chilevisión from Chile's elected president Sebastián Piñera. Time Warner already operates in the country with CNN Chile.[64]
In January 2012, Home Box Office and DISH Network LLC reached an agreement that will give DISH customers expanded access to HBO’s acclaimed programming.
In October 2012, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Media Distribution reached an agreement that will give Warner Bros. rights to Blu-ray and DVD distribution of several titles from Paramount in the US and Canada.[65]
In June 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid for Time Warner at $85 per share in stock and cash ($80 billion total) which Time Warner's board of directors turned down in July. Warner's CNN unit would have been sold to ease antitrust issues of the purchase.[66] On August 5, 2014, 21st Century Fox withdrew its offer to purchase Time Warner.
In January 2014, Time Warner, Related Companies, and Oxford Properties Group announced that Time Warner intends to relocate the Company’s corporate headquarters and its New York City-based employees to 30 Hudson Yards in the Hudson Yards neighborhood in Chelsea, Manhattan, and has accordingly made an initial financial commitment.[67] Time Warner sold its stake in the Columbus Circle building for $1.3 billion to Related and two wealth funds. The move will be completed in 2018.[68]
Transactions[edit]
On December 15, 2006, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. announced an investment in SCi Entertainment Group plc[69] the parent company of publishing label Eidos Interactive Ltd, representing 10.3 percent of the company's enlarged share capital.

Planned acquisition by AT&T[edit]
On October 20, 2016, it was reported that AT&T was in talks to acquire Time Warner. The proposed deal would give AT&T significant holdings in the media industry; AT&T's competitor Comcast had previously acquired NBCUniversal in a similar bid to increase its media holdings, in concert with its ownership of television and internet providers.[88][89][9] On October 22, 2016, AT&T reached a deal to buy Time Warner for $108.7 billion.

Time Warner owns several large properties in New York City; certain buildings in the Rockefeller Center complex and adjacent office towers house its main offices; one of which houses a CNN news studio. In late 2003, Time Warner finished construction of a new twin-tower complex, designed to serve as additional office space, facing Columbus Circle on the southwestern edge of Central Park. Originally called the AOL Time Warner Center, the 755-foot (230 m), 55-floor mixed-use property was renamed Time Warner Center when the company itself was renamed.[95]
Notable people[edit]
Time Warner Inc.[edit]
Jeff Bewkes, Chairman and CEO[96]
And five executive vice presidents, most with additional, functional titles:

Paul T. Cappuccio, General Counsel[97]
Gary L. Ginsberg, Corporate Marketing and Communications[98]
Howard M. Averill, Chief Financial Officer[99]
Carol A. Melton, Global Public Policy[100]
Ólaf Ólafsson, International and Corporate Strategy[101]

Division CEOs[edit]

Richard Plepler, Chairman and CEO of Home Box Office[102]
John Martin, Chairman and CEO of Turner Broadcasting System[103]
Kevin Tsujihara, Chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.[104]

Competition[edit]
Time Warner faces industry competition from traditional media companies such as Sony, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, Viacom, The Walt Disney Company, and Comcast. Time Warner's and many of their competitions' business may be severely impacted by the increasing viewership of feature films, television programming and other content online with low ad-income, which decreases company revenues.
Box office receipts have been rising while the growth rate of DVD sales have recently been declining, which affects Warner Bros.' growth prospects and revenues.[105]
Company names[edit]

Warner Bros. Pictures (1923–1967)
Seven Arts Productions (1957–1967)
Kinney National Company (1966–1972)
Warner Bros.-Seven Arts (1967–1969)
Warner Communications (1972–1990)
Time Warner (1990–2001, 2003–present)
Time Warner Entertainment (1992–2001)
AOL Time Warner (2001–2003)

Restatement[edit]
In March 2002, the company restated its financial statements to reflect the merger of MapQuest and other companies.[106]

Time Warner, Inc. is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered in New York City.[6] It is currently the world's third largest entertainment company in terms of revenue, after Comcast and The Walt Disney Company. It was also once the world's largest media conglomerate.[7] Time Warner was first founded in 1990, with the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The current company consists largely of the assets of the former Warner Communications (as well as HBO, a Time Inc. subsidiary prior to the merger), and the assets of Turner Broadcasting (which was acquired by the company in 1996). Time Warner currently has major operations in film and television, with a limited amount in publishing operations. Among its major assets are HBO, Turner Broadcasting System, The CW, Warner Bros., CNN, DC Comics, and as of August 2016, Hulu, owning 10%.[8] In the past, other major divisions of Time Warner included Time Inc., AOL, Time Warner Cable, Warner Books and Warner Music Group. All of these operations were either sold to other investors or spun off as independent companies from 2004 to 2014.
On October 22, 2016, AT&T announced its intent to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion (including assumed Time Warner debt).[9][10]

History[edit]
1920s[edit]
Time magazine made its debut in 1923 as the first weekly news magazine in the United States.[22] Four years later, in 1927, Warner Bros. released the world’s first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer.[23]
1960s[edit]
In 1963, recommendations from Time Inc. based on how it delivered magazines led to the introduction of ZIP codes by the United States Post Office.[citation needed]
1970s[edit]
In 1972, Kinney National Company spun off its non-entertainment assets due to a financial scandal over its parking operations and renamed itself Warner Communications Inc.[24]
It was the holding company for Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Music Group during the 1970s and 1980s. It also owned DC Comics and Mad, as well as a majority stake in Garden State National Bank (an investment it was ultimately required to sell pursuant to requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act). Warner's initial divestiture efforts led by Garden State CEO Charles A. Agemian were blocked by Garden State board member William A. Conway in 1978; a revised transaction was later completed in 1980.
In 1975, Home Box Office became the first TV network to broadcast nationally via satellite, debuting with the Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier “Thrilla in Manila” boxing match.[25]
In 1975, Warner expanded under the guidance of CEO Steve Ross and formed a joint venture with American Express, named Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, which held cable channels including MTV (launched 1981), Nickelodeon (launched 1979) and The Movie Channel. Warner Bros. bought out American Express's half in 1984, and sold the venture a year later to Viacom, which renamed it MTV Networks.[citation needed]
In 1976, the Turner–owned WTCG originated the "superstation" concept, transmitting via satellite to cable systems nationwide and pioneering the basic cable business model. WTCG was renamed WTBS in 1979.
In 1976, Nolan Bushnell sold Atari, Inc. to Warner Communications for an estimated $2–12 million. Warner made considerable profits (and later losses) with Atari, which it owned from 1976 to 1984. While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of Atari 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time.[26]
1980s[edit]
In 1980, Warner purchased The Franklin Mint for about $225 million. The combination was short lived: Warner sold The Franklin Mint in 1985 to American Protection Industries Inc. (API) for $167.5 million. However, Warner retained Franklin Mint’s Eastern Mountain Sports as well as The Franklin Mint Center, which it leased back to API.[27][28]
In 1980, Turner launched CNN, the first 24-hour all-news network, redefining the way the world received breaking news.[29]
In January 1983, Warner expanded their interests to baseball. Under the direction of Caesar P. Kimmel, executive vice president, bought 48 percent of the Pittsburgh Pirates for $10 million.[30] The company then put up its share for sale in November 1984 following losses of $6 million due to its failed attempt to launch a cable sports package. The team's majority owner, John W. Galbreath, soon followed suit after learning of Warner's actions.[31] Both Galbreath and Warner sold the Pirates to local investors in March 1986.
In 1984, due to major losses spurred by subsidiary Atari Inc.'s losses, Warner sold Atari Inc.'s Consumer Division assets to Jack Tramiel. It kept the rest of the company and named it Atari Games, eventually reducing it to just the Coin Division. They sold Atari Games to Namco in 1985, and repurchased it in 1992, renaming it Time-Warner Interactive, until it was sold to Midway Games in 1996. In a long-expected deal, Warner Communications announced on May 11, 1988, they were acquiring Lorimar-Telepictures; the acquisition was finalized on January 12, 1989.[32]
The merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications was announced on March 4, 1989.[33] During the summer of that same year, Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western) launched a $12.2 billion hostile bid to acquire Time, Inc. in an attempt to end a stock-swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications. This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9 Billion in cash and stock. Paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time/Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Paramount to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of the two companies' merger which was completed on January 10, 1990. However, instead of the companies becoming defunct, the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure, resulting in the new company being called "Time Warner".
1990s[edit]
US West partnered with Time Warner in 1993 to form what is now known as TW Telecom, initially known as Time Warner Communications (also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the ATC name), in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses. US West also took a 26% stake in the entertainment portion of the company, calling that division Time Warner Entertainment (or legally Time Warner Entertainment Company L.P.). US West's stake eventually passed to acquired cable company MediaOne, then to AT&T Broadband in 1999 when that company acquired MediaOne, then finally to Comcast in 2001 when that company bought the AT&T Broadband division. Comcast sold their stake in the company in 2003, relegating the name to a subdivision under Time Warner Cable.
Time Warner subsequently acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System in October 1996. Not only did this result in the company (in a way) re-entering the basic cable television industry (in regards to nationally available channels), but Warner Bros. also regained the rights to their pre-1950[34][35] film library, which by then had been owned by Turner (the films are still technically held by Turner, but WB is responsible for sales and distribution),[36] while Turner gained access to WB's post-1950 library, as well as other WB-owned properties.
Time Warner purchased the Six Flags Theme Parks chain in 1993. The company later sold all Six Flags parks and properties to Oklahoma-based Premier Parks on April 1, 1998.[37]
Dick Parsons, already a director on the board since 1991, was hired as Time Warner president in 1995, although the division operational heads continued to report directly to Chairman and CEO Gerald Levin.[38]
In 1991, HBO and Cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers, with companion channels supplementing the main networks.[39]
In 1993, HBO became the world's first digitally transmitted television service.[40]
In 1995, CNN introduced CNN.com which later became a leading destination for global digital news, both online and mobile.[41]
In 1996, Warner Bros. spearheaded the introduction of the DVD, which rapidly replaced VHS tapes as the standard for home video.[42]
In 1999, HBO became the first national cable TV network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel.[43]
2000s[edit]
Merger with AOL[edit]
In 2000, it was announced that AOL would purchase Time Warner for US$164 billion.[44] Due to the larger market capitalization of AOL, their shareholders would own 55% of the new company while Time Warner shareholders owned only 45%,[45] so in actual practice AOL had acquired Time Warner, even though Time Warner had far more assets and revenues. Time Warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution, while AOL wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets.[46]
The deal, announced on January 10, 2000[45] and officially filed on February 11, 2000,[47] employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity. The Federal Trade Commission cleared the deal on December 14, 2000,[48] and gave final approval on January 11, 2001; the company completed the merger later that day.[49] The deal was approved on the same day by the Federal Communications Commission,[47] and had already been cleared by the European Commission on October 11, 2000.[50]
AOL Time Warner Inc., as the company was then called, was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides. Gerald Levin, who had served as Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. Steve Case served as Executive Chairman of the board of directors, Robert W. Pittman (President and COO of AOL) and Dick Parsons (President of Time Warner) served as Co-Chief Operating Officers, and J. Michael Kelly (the CFO from AOL) became the Chief Financial Officer.[51]
According to AOL President and COO Bob Pittman, the slow-moving Time Warner would now take off at Internet speed, accelerated by AOL: "All you need to do is put a catalyst to [Time Warner], and in a short period, you can alter the growth rate. The growth rate will be like an Internet company." When the AOL Time Warner deal was announced, the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward; by tapping into AOL, Time Warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers. AOL would use Time Warner's high-speed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers Time Warner's branded magazines, books, music, and movies. This would have created 130 million subscription relationships.
Unfortunately, the growth and profitability of the AOL division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers. The value of the America Online division dropped significantly, not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell, and forced a goodwill write-off, causing AOL Time Warner to report a loss of $99 billion in 2002 — at the time, the largest loss ever reported by a company. The total value of AOL stock subsequently went from $226 billion to about $20 billion.[52]
An outburst by Vice Chairman Ted Turner at a board meeting prompted Steve Case to contact each of the directors and push for CEO Gerald Levin's ouster. Although Case's coup attempt was rebuffed by Parsons and several other directors, Levin became frustrated with being unable to "regain the rhythm" at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of 2001, effective in May 2002.[53] Although Co-COO Bob Pittman was the strongest supporter of Levin and largely seen as the heir-apparent, Dick Parsons was instead chosen as CEO. Time Warner CFO J. Michael Kelly was demoted to COO of the AOL division, and replaced as CFO by Wayne Pace. AOL Chairman and CEO Barry Schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new "content creation division", being replaced on an interim basis by Pittman, who was already serving as the sole COO after Parsons' promotion.
Many expected synergies between AOL and other Time Warner divisions never materialized, as most Time Warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger. A new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of AOL Time Warner, replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division, caused resentment among Time Warner division heads who blamed the AOL division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company. AOL Time Warner COO Pittman, who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives, who also criticized Pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for AOL Time Warner that were never met. Some of the attacks on Pittman were reported to come from the print media in the Time, Inc. division under Don Logan.[54] Furthermore, CEO Parsons' democratic style prevented Pittman from exercising authority over the "old-guard" division heads who resisted Pittman's synergy initiatives.[51][55]
Pittman announced his resignation as AOL Time Warner COO after July 4, 2002, being reportedly burned out by the AOL special assignment and almost hospitalized, unhappy about the criticism from Time Warner executives, and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as Parsons was firmly entrenched as CEO.[55] Pittman's departure was seen as a great victory to Time Warner executives who wanted to undo the merger. In a sign of AOL's diminishing importance to the media conglomerate, Pittman's responsibilities were divided between two Time Warner veterans; Jeffrey Bewkes who was CEO of Home Box Office, and Don Logan who had been CEO of Time. Logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group, overseeing America Online, Time, Time Warner Cable, the AOL Time Warner Book Group and the Interactive Video unit, relegating AOL to being just another division in the conglomerate. Bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group, comprising HBO, New Line Cinema, The WB, Turner Networks, Warner Bros. and Warner Music. Both Logan and Bewkes, who had initially opposed the merger, were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to AOL Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons.[54][56] Logan, generally admired at Time Warner and reviled by AOL for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker, moved to purge AOL of several "Pittman panzers".[53]
AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case took on added prominence as the co-head of a new strategy committee of the board, making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the Internet. However, under pressure from institutional investor vice president Gordon Crawford who lined up dissenters, Case announced in January 2003 that he would not stand for re-election as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting, making CEO Richard Parsons the chairman-elect. That year, the company dropped the "AOL" from its name, and spun off Time-Life's ownership under the legal name Direct Holdings Americas, Inc. Case resigned from the Time Warner board on October 31, 2005.[53][57] Jeff Bewkes, who eventually became CEO of Time Warner, described the 2001 merger with AOL as 'the biggest mistake in corporate history'.[58]
In 2005, Time Warner was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[59][60][61] On December 27, 2007, newly installed Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes discussed possible plans to spin off Time Warner Cable and sell off AOL and Time Inc. This would leave a smaller company made up of Turner Broadcasting, Warner Bros. and HBO.[62] On February 28, 2008, co-chairmen and co-CEOs of New Line Cinema Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne announced their resignations from the 40-year-old movie studio in response to Jeffrey Bewkes's demand for cost-cutting measures at the studio, which he intended to dissolve into Warner Bros.
On May 28, 2009, Time Warner announced that it would spin off AOL as a separate independent company, with the change occurring on December 9, 2009.
2010s[edit]
In 2010, Turner Sports, Inc. and the National Collegiate Athletic Association jointly announced the formation of NCAA Digital, a 14-year agreement in which Turner will manage and operate the NCAA’s digital portfolio and strengthen coverage of all 88 NCAA championships. NCAA Digital encompasses NCAA.com and additional NCAA digital platforms, including mobile web and applications, as well as other connected devices.[63]
On August 25, 2010, Time Warner's Latin American division bought Chilean nationwide terrestrial television station Chilevisión from Chile's elected president Sebastián Piñera. Time Warner already operates in the country with CNN Chile.[64]
In January 2012, Home Box Office and DISH Network LLC reached an agreement that will give DISH customers expanded access to HBO’s acclaimed programming.
In October 2012, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Media Distribution reached an agreement that will give Warner Bros. rights to Blu-ray and DVD distribution of several titles from Paramount in the US and Canada.[65]
In June 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid for Time Warner at $85 per share in stock and cash ($80 billion total) which Time Warner's board of directors turned down in July. Warner's CNN unit would have been sold to ease antitrust issues of the purchase.[66] On August 5, 2014, 21st Century Fox withdrew its offer to purchase Time Warner.
In January 2014, Time Warner, Related Companies, and Oxford Properties Group announced that Time Warner intends to relocate the Company’s corporate headquarters and its New York City-based employees to 30 Hudson Yards in the Hudson Yards neighborhood in Chelsea, Manhattan, and has accordingly made an initial financial commitment.[67] Time Warner sold its stake in the Columbus Circle building for $1.3 billion to Related and two wealth funds. The move will be completed in 2018.[68]
Transactions[edit]
On December 15, 2006, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. announced an investment in SCi Entertainment Group plc[69] the parent company of publishing label Eidos Interactive Ltd, representing 10.3 percent of the company's enlarged share capital.

Planned acquisition by AT&T[edit]
On October 20, 2016, it was reported that AT&T was in talks to acquire Time Warner. The proposed deal would give AT&T significant holdings in the media industry; AT&T's competitor Comcast had previously acquired NBCUniversal in a similar bid to increase its media holdings, in concert with its ownership of television and internet providers.[88][89][9] On October 22, 2016, AT&T reached a deal to buy Time Warner for $108.7 billion.

Main article: The CW




The CW logo.


On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner announced that they were to create a new broadcast network, The CW. The network officially debuted on September 18, 2006. The network formally debuted on September 20 with the 2-hour premiere of America's Next Top Model.
The network is the result of a merger of The WB (a Time Warner holding) and UPN (a CBS Corporation holding). CBS Corporation and Time Warner each own 50% of the network. Tribune Broadcasting (previously owned a 25% stake on The WB) and CBS Corporation contributed its stations as new network affiliates.
Commercial properties[edit]
Time Warner owns several large properties in New York City; certain buildings in the Rockefeller Center complex and adjacent office towers house its main offices; one of which houses a CNN news studio. In late 2003, Time Warner finished construction of a new twin-tower complex, designed to serve as additional office space, facing Columbus Circle on the southwestern edge of Central Park. Originally called the AOL Time Warner Center, the 755-foot (230 m), 55-floor mixed-use property was renamed Time Warner Center when the company itself was renamed.[95]

Competition[edit]
Time Warner faces industry competition from traditional media companies such as Sony, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, Viacom, The Walt Disney Company, and Comcast. Time Warner's and many of their competitions' business may be severely impacted by the increasing viewership of feature films, television programming and other content online with low ad-income, which decreases company revenues.
Box office receipts have been rising while the growth rate of DVD sales have recently been declining, which affects Warner Bros.' growth prospects and revenues.[105]
Company names[edit]

Warner Bros. Pictures (1923–1967)
Seven Arts Productions (1957–1967)
Kinney National Company (1966–1972)

Time Warner, Inc. is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered in New York City.[6] It is currently the world's third largest entertainment company in terms of revenue, after Comcast and The Walt Disney Company. It was also once the world's largest media conglomerate.[7] Time Warner was first founded in 1990, with the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The current company consists largely of the assets of the former Warner Communications (as well as HBO, a Time Inc. subsidiary prior to the merger), and the assets of Turner Broadcasting (which was acquired by the company in 1996). Time Warner currently has major operations in film and television, with a limited amount in publishing operations. Among its major assets are HBO, Turner Broadcasting System, The CW, Warner Bros., CNN, DC Comics, and as of August 2016, Hulu, owning 10%.[8] In the past, other major divisions of Time Warner included Time Inc., AOL, Time Warner Cable, Warner Books and Warner Music Group. All of these operations were either sold to other investors or spun off as independent companies from 2004 to 2014.
On October 22, 2016, AT&T announced its intent to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion (including assumed Time Warner debt).[9][10]

In 1963, recommendations from Time Inc. based on how it delivered magazines led to the introduction of ZIP codes by the United States Post Office.[citation needed]
1970s[edit]
In 1972, Kinney National Company spun off its non-entertainment assets due to a financial scandal over its parking operations and renamed itself Warner Communications Inc.[24]
It was the holding company for Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Music Group during the 1970s and 1980s. It also owned DC Comics and Mad, as well as a majority stake in Garden State National Bank (an investment it was ultimately required to sell pursuant to requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act). Warner's initial divestiture efforts led by Garden State CEO Charles A. Agemian were blocked by Garden State board member William A. Conway in 1978; a revised transaction was later completed in 1980.
In 1975, Home Box Office became the first TV network to broadcast nationally via satellite, debuting with the Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier “Thrilla in Manila” boxing match.[25]
In 1975, Warner expanded under the guidance of CEO Steve Ross and formed a joint venture with American Express, named Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, which held cable channels including MTV (launched 1981), Nickelodeon (launched 1979) and The Movie Channel. Warner Bros. bought out American Express's half in 1984, and sold the venture a year later to Viacom, which renamed it MTV Networks.[citation needed]
In 1976, the Turner–owned WTCG originated the "superstation" concept, transmitting via satellite to cable systems nationwide and pioneering the basic cable business model. WTCG was renamed WTBS in 1979.
In 1976, Nolan Bushnell sold Atari, Inc. to Warner Communications for an estimated $2–12 million. Warner made considerable profits (and later losses) with Atari, which it owned from 1976 to 1984. While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of Atari 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time.[26]
1980s[edit]
In 1980, Warner purchased The Franklin Mint for about $225 million. The combination was short lived: Warner sold The Franklin Mint in 1985 to American Protection Industries Inc. (API) for $167.5 million. However, Warner retained Franklin Mint’s Eastern Mountain Sports as well as The Franklin Mint Center, which it leased back to API.[27][28]
In 1980, Turner launched CNN, the first 24-hour all-news network, redefining the way the world received breaking news.[29]
In January 1983, Warner expanded their interests to baseball. Under the direction of Caesar P. Kimmel, executive vice president, bought 48 percent of the Pittsburgh Pirates for $10 million.[30] The company then put up its share for sale in November 1984 following losses of $6 million due to its failed attempt to launch a cable sports package. The team's majority owner, John W. Galbreath, soon followed suit after learning of Warner's actions.[31] Both Galbreath and Warner sold the Pirates to local investors in March 1986.
In 1984, due to major losses spurred by subsidiary Atari Inc.'s losses, Warner sold Atari Inc.'s Consumer Division assets to Jack Tramiel. It kept the rest of the company and named it Atari Games, eventually reducing it to just the Coin Division. They sold Atari Games to Namco in 1985, and repurchased it in 1992, renaming it Time-Warner Interactive, until it was sold to Midway Games in 1996. In a long-expected deal, Warner Communications announced on May 11, 1988, they were acquiring Lorimar-Telepictures; the acquisition was finalized on January 12, 1989.[32]
The merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications was announced on March 4, 1989.[33] During the summer of that same year, Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western) launched a $12.2 billion hostile bid to acquire Time, Inc. in an attempt to end a stock-swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications. This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9 Billion in cash and stock. Paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time/Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Paramount to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of the two companies' merger which was completed on January 10, 1990. However, instead of the companies becoming defunct, the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure, resulting in the new company being called "Time Warner".
1990s[edit]
US West partnered with Time Warner in 1993 to form what is now known as TW Telecom, initially known as Time Warner Communications (also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the ATC name), in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses. US West also took a 26% stake in the entertainment portion of the company, calling that division Time Warner Entertainment (or legally Time Warner Entertainment Company L.P.). US West's stake eventually passed to acquired cable company MediaOne, then to AT&T Broadband in 1999 when that company acquired MediaOne, then finally to Comcast in 2001 when that company bought the AT&T Broadband division. Comcast sold their stake in the company in 2003, relegating the name to a subdivision under Time Warner Cable.
Time Warner subsequently acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System in October 1996. Not only did this result in the company (in a way) re-entering the basic cable television industry (in regards to nationally available channels), but Warner Bros. also regained the rights to their pre-1950[34][35] film library, which by then had been owned by Turner (the films are still technically held by Turner, but WB is responsible for sales and distribution),[36] while Turner gained access to WB's post-1950 library, as well as other WB-owned properties.
Time Warner purchased the Six Flags Theme Parks chain in 1993. The company later sold all Six Flags parks and properties to Oklahoma-based Premier Parks on April 1, 1998.[37]
Dick Parsons, already a director on the board since 1991, was hired as Time Warner president in 1995, although the division operational heads continued to report directly to Chairman and CEO Gerald Levin.[38]
In 1991, HBO and Cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers, with companion channels supplementing the main networks.[39]
In 1993, HBO became the world's first digitally transmitted television service.[40]
In 1995, CNN introduced CNN.com which later became a leading destination for global digital news, both online and mobile.[41]
In 1996, Warner Bros. spearheaded the introduction of the DVD, which rapidly replaced VHS tapes as the standard for home video.[42]
In 1999, HBO became the first national cable TV network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel.[43]
2000s[edit]
Merger with AOL[edit]
In 2000, it was announced that AOL would purchase Time Warner for US$164 billion.[44] Due to the larger market capitalization of AOL, their shareholders would own 55% of the new company while Time Warner shareholders owned only 45%,[45] so in actual practice AOL had acquired Time Warner, even though Time Warner had far more assets and revenues. Time Warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution, while AOL wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets.[46]
The deal, announced on January 10, 2000[45] and officially filed on February 11, 2000,[47] employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity. The Federal Trade Commission cleared the deal on December 14, 2000,[48] and gave final approval on January 11, 2001; the company completed the merger later that day.[49] The deal was approved on the same day by the Federal Communications Commission,[47] and had already been cleared by the European Commission on October 11, 2000.[50]
AOL Time Warner Inc., as the company was then called, was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides. Gerald Levin, who had served as Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. Steve Case served as Executive Chairman of the board of directors, Robert W. Pittman (President and COO of AOL) and Dick Parsons (President of Time Warner) served as Co-Chief Operating Officers, and J. Michael Kelly (the CFO from AOL) became the Chief Financial Officer.[51]
According to AOL President and COO Bob Pittman, the slow-moving Time Warner would now take off at Internet speed, accelerated by AOL: "All you need to do is put a catalyst to [Time Warner], and in a short period, you can alter the growth rate. The growth rate will be like an Internet company." When the AOL Time Warner deal was announced, the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward; by tapping into AOL, Time Warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers. AOL would use Time Warner's high-speed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers Time Warner's branded magazines, books, music, and movies. This would have created 130 million subscription relationships.
Unfortunately, the growth and profitability of the AOL division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers. The value of the America Online division dropped significantly, not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell, and forced a goodwill write-off, causing AOL Time Warner to report a loss of $99 billion in 2002 — at the time, the largest loss ever reported by a company. The total value of AOL stock subsequently went from $226 billion to about $20 billion.[52]
An outburst by Vice Chairman Ted Turner at a board meeting prompted Steve Case to contact each of the directors and push for CEO Gerald Levin's ouster. Although Case's coup attempt was rebuffed by Parsons and several other directors, Levin became frustrated with being unable to "regain the rhythm" at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of 2001, effective in May 2002.[53] Although Co-COO Bob Pittman was the strongest supporter of Levin and largely seen as the heir-apparent, Dick Parsons was instead chosen as CEO. Time Warner CFO J. Michael Kelly was demoted to COO of the AOL division, and replaced as CFO by Wayne Pace. AOL Chairman and CEO Barry Schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new "content creation division", being replaced on an interim basis by Pittman, who was already serving as the sole COO after Parsons' promotion.
Many expected synergies between AOL and other Time Warner divisions never materialized, as most Time Warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger. A new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of AOL Time Warner, replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division, caused resentment among Time Warner division heads who blamed the AOL division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company. AOL Time Warner COO Pittman, who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives, who also criticized Pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for AOL Time Warner that were never met. Some of the attacks on Pittman were reported to come from the print media in the Time, Inc. division under Don Logan.[54] Furthermore, CEO Parsons' democratic style prevented Pittman from exercising authority over the "old-guard" division heads who resisted Pittman's synergy initiatives.[51][55]
Pittman announced his resignation as AOL Time Warner COO after July 4, 2002, being reportedly burned out by the AOL special assignment and almost hospitalized, unhappy about the criticism from Time Warner executives, and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as Parsons was firmly entrenched as CEO.[55] Pittman's departure was seen as a great victory to Time Warner executives who wanted to undo the merger. In a sign of AOL's diminishing importance to the media conglomerate, Pittman's responsibilities were divided between two Time Warner veterans; Jeffrey Bewkes who was CEO of Home Box Office, and Don Logan who had been CEO of Time. Logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group, overseeing America Online, Time, Time Warner Cable, the AOL Time Warner Book Group and the Interactive Video unit, relegating AOL to being just another division in the conglomerate. Bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group, comprising HBO, New Line Cinema, The WB, Turner Networks, Warner Bros. and Warner Music. Both Logan and Bewkes, who had initially opposed the merger, were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to AOL Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons.[54][56] Logan, generally admired at Time Warner and reviled by AOL for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker, moved to purge AOL of several "Pittman panzers".[53]
AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case took on added prominence as the co-head of a new strategy committee of the board, making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the Internet. However, under pressure from institutional investor vice president Gordon Crawford who lined up dissenters, Case announced in January 2003 that he would not stand for re-election as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting, making CEO Richard Parsons the chairman-elect. That year, the company dropped the "AOL" from its name, and spun off Time-Life's ownership under the legal name Direct Holdings Americas, Inc. Case resigned from the Time Warner board on October 31, 2005.[53][57] Jeff Bewkes, who eventually became CEO of Time Warner, described the 2001 merger with AOL as 'the biggest mistake in corporate history'.[58]
In 2005, Time Warner was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[59][60][61] On December 27, 2007, newly installed Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes discussed possible plans to spin off Time Warner Cable and sell off AOL and Time Inc. This would leave a smaller company made up of Turner Broadcasting, Warner Bros. and HBO.[62] On February 28, 2008, co-chairmen and co-CEOs of New Line Cinema Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne announced their resignations from the 40-year-old movie studio in response to Jeffrey Bewkes's demand for cost-cutting measures at the studio, which he intended to dissolve into Warner Bros.
On May 28, 2009, Time Warner announced that it would spin off AOL as a separate independent company, with the change occurring on December 9, 2009.
2010s[edit]
In 2010, Turner Sports, Inc. and the National Collegiate Athletic Association jointly announced the formation of NCAA Digital, a 14-year agreement in which Turner will manage and operate the NCAA’s digital portfolio and strengthen coverage of all 88 NCAA championships. NCAA Digital encompasses NCAA.com and additional NCAA digital platforms, including mobile web and applications, as well as other connected devices.[63]
On August 25, 2010, Time Warner's Latin American division bought Chilean nationwide terrestrial television station Chilevisión from Chile's elected president Sebastián Piñera. Time Warner already operates in the country with CNN Chile.[64]
In January 2012, Home Box Office and DISH Network LLC reached an agreement that will give DISH customers expanded access to HBO’s acclaimed programming.
In October 2012, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Media Distribution reached an agreement that will give Warner Bros. rights to Blu-ray and DVD distribution of several titles from Paramount in the US and Canada.[65]
In June 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid for Time Warner at $85 per share in stock and cash ($80 billion total) which Time Warner's board of directors turned down in July. Warner's CNN unit would have been sold to ease antitrust issues of the purchase.[66] On August 5, 2014, 21st Century Fox withdrew its offer to purchase Time Warner.
In January 2014, Time Warner, Related Companies, and Oxford Properties Group announced that Time Warner intends to relocate the Company’s corporate headquarters and its New York City-based employees to 30 Hudson Yards in the Hudson Yards neighborhood in Chelsea, Manhattan, and has accordingly made an initial financial commitment.[67] Time Warner sold its stake in the Columbus Circle building for $1.3 billion to Related and two wealth funds. The move will be completed in 2018.[68]
Transactions[edit]
On December 15, 2006, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. announced an investment in SCi Entertainment Group plc[69] the parent company of publishing label Eidos Interactive Ltd, representing 10.3 percent of the company's enlarged share capital. Additionally, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group and SCi have entered into an agreement for licensing and distribution of games based on select Warner Bros. Entertainment properties.

On February 19, 2009, Time Warner and Time Warner Cable completed the separation of the two companies through a spin-off.[75][76]
On March 17, 2009, Time Warner Inc. announced the legal and structural separation of Time Warner Cable Inc. (NYSE:TWC) from Time Warner through a tax-free spin-off that had become effective on March 12, 2009.
In the first quarter of 2010, Home Box Office purchased additional interests in HBO LAG for $217 million, which resulted in Home Box Office owning 80% of the equity interests of HBO LAG. In 2010, Home Box Office purchased the remainder of its partners’ interests in HBO Europe[77] (formerly HBO Central Europe) for $136 million, net of cash acquired.
On April 20, 2010, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group announced the acquisition of Turbine, Inc.,[78] a gaming studio in North America.

On March 6, 2013, Time Warner announced that it would spin off its publishing division Time Inc. as a separate, publicly traded company. The transaction was completed on June 6, 2014.[86][87]
Planned acquisition by AT&T[edit]
On October 20, 2016, it was reported that AT&T was in talks to acquire Time Warner. The proposed deal would give AT&T significant holdings in the media industry; AT&T's competitor Comcast had previously acquired NBCUniversal in a similar bid to increase its media holdings, in concert with its ownership of television and internet providers.[88][89][9] On October 22, 2016, AT&T reached a deal to buy Time Warner for $108.7 billion. If approved by federal regulators, the merger would bring Time Warner's properties under the same umbrella as AT&T's telecommunication holdings, including satellite provider DirecTV.[90][91]
On February 15, 2017, Time Warner shareholders approved the merger,[92] which is still pending regulatory approval. On February 28, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that his agency will not review the deal, leaving the review to the US Department of Justice.[93]

Main article: The CW




The CW logo.


On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner announced that they were to create a new broadcast network, The CW. The network officially debuted on September 18, 2006. The network formally debuted on September 20 with the 2-hour premiere of America's Next Top Model.
The network is the result of a merger of The WB (a Time Warner holding) and UPN (a CBS Corporation holding). CBS Corporation and Time Warner each own 50% of the network. Tribune Broadcasting (previously owned a 25% stake on The WB) and CBS Corporation contributed its stations as new network affiliates.
Commercial properties[edit]
Time Warner owns several large properties in New York City; certain buildings in the Rockefeller Center complex and adjacent office towers house its main offices; one of which houses a CNN news studio. In late 2003, Time Warner finished construction of a new twin-tower complex, designed to serve as additional office space, facing Columbus Circle on the southwestern edge of Central Park. Originally called the AOL Time Warner Center, the 755-foot (230 m), 55-floor mixed-use property was renamed Time Warner Center when the company itself was renamed.[95]

Competition[edit]
Time Warner faces industry competition from traditional media companies such as Sony, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, Viacom, The Walt Disney Company, and Comcast. Time Warner's and many of their competitions' business may be severely impacted by the increasing viewership of feature films, television programming and other content online with low ad-income, which decreases company revenues.
Box office receipts have been rising while the growth rate of DVD sales have recently been declining, which affects Warner Bros.' growth prospects and revenues.[105]
Company names[edit]

Warner Bros. Pictures (1923–1967)
Seven Arts Productions (1957–1967)

Time Warner, Inc. is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered in New York City.[6] It is currently the world's third largest entertainment company in terms of revenue, after Comcast and The Walt Disney Company. It was also once the world's largest media conglomerate.[7] Time Warner was first founded in 1990, with the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The current company consists largely of the assets of the former Warner Communications (as well as HBO, a Time Inc. subsidiary prior to the merger), and the assets of Turner Broadcasting (which was acquired by the company in 1996). Time Warner currently has major operations in film and television, with a limited amount in publishing operations. Among its major assets are HBO, Turner Broadcasting System, The CW, Warner Bros., CNN, DC Comics, and as of August 2016, Hulu, owning 10%.[8] In the past, other major divisions of Time Warner included Time Inc., AOL, Time Warner Cable, Warner Books and Warner Music Group. All of these operations were either sold to other investors or spun off as independent companies from 2004 to 2014.
On October 22, 2016, AT&T announced its intent to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion (including assumed Time Warner debt).[9][10]

History[edit]
1920s[edit]
Time magazine made its debut in 1923 as the first weekly news magazine in the United States.[22] Four years later, in 1927, Warner Bros. released the world’s first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer.[23]
1960s[edit]
In 1963, recommendations from Time Inc. based on how it delivered magazines led to the introduction of ZIP codes by the United States Post Office.[citation needed]
1970s[edit]
In 1972, Kinney National Company spun off its non-entertainment assets due to a financial scandal over its parking operations and renamed itself Warner Communications Inc.[24]
It was the holding company for Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Music Group during the 1970s and 1980s. It also owned DC Comics and Mad, as well as a majority stake in Garden State National Bank (an investment it was ultimately required to sell pursuant to requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act). Warner's initial divestiture efforts led by Garden State CEO Charles A. Agemian were blocked by Garden State board member William A. Conway in 1978; a revised transaction was later completed in 1980.
In 1975, Home Box Office became the first TV network to broadcast nationally via satellite, debuting with the Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier “Thrilla in Manila” boxing match.[25]
In 1975, Warner expanded under the guidance of CEO Steve Ross and formed a joint venture with American Express, named Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, which held cable channels including MTV (launched 1981), Nickelodeon (launched 1979) and The Movie Channel. Warner Bros. bought out American Express's half in 1984, and sold the venture a year later to Viacom, which renamed it MTV Networks.[citation needed]
In 1976, the Turner–owned WTCG originated the "superstation" concept, transmitting via satellite to cable systems nationwide and pioneering the basic cable business model. WTCG was renamed WTBS in 1979.
In 1976, Nolan Bushnell sold Atari, Inc. to Warner Communications for an estimated $2–12 million. Warner made considerable profits (and later losses) with Atari, which it owned from 1976 to 1984. While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of Atari 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time.[26]
1980s[edit]
In 1980, Warner purchased The Franklin Mint for about $225 million. The combination was short lived: Warner sold The Franklin Mint in 1985 to American Protection Industries Inc. (API) for $167.5 million. However, Warner retained Franklin Mint’s Eastern Mountain Sports as well as The Franklin Mint Center, which it leased back to API.[27][28]
In 1980, Turner launched CNN, the first 24-hour all-news network, redefining the way the world received breaking news.[29]
In January 1983, Warner expanded their interests to baseball. Under the direction of Caesar P. Kimmel, executive vice president, bought 48 percent of the Pittsburgh Pirates for $10 million.[30] The company then put up its share for sale in November 1984 following losses of $6 million due to its failed attempt to launch a cable sports package. The team's majority owner, John W. Galbreath, soon followed suit after learning of Warner's actions.[31] Both Galbreath and Warner sold the Pirates to local investors in March 1986.
In 1984, due to major losses spurred by subsidiary Atari Inc.'s losses, Warner sold Atari Inc.'s Consumer Division assets to Jack Tramiel. It kept the rest of the company and named it Atari Games, eventually reducing it to just the Coin Division. They sold Atari Games to Namco in 1985, and repurchased it in 1992, renaming it Time-Warner Interactive, until it was sold to Midway Games in 1996. In a long-expected deal, Warner Communications announced on May 11, 1988, they were acquiring Lorimar-Telepictures; the acquisition was finalized on January 12, 1989.[32]
The merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications was announced on March 4, 1989.[33] During the summer of that same year, Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western) launched a $12.2 billion hostile bid to acquire Time, Inc. in an attempt to end a stock-swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications. This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9 Billion in cash and stock. Paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time/Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Paramount to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of the two companies' merger which was completed on January 10, 1990. However, instead of the companies becoming defunct, the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure, resulting in the new company being called "Time Warner".
1990s[edit]
US West partnered with Time Warner in 1993 to form what is now known as TW Telecom, initially known as Time Warner Communications (also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the ATC name), in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses. US West also took a 26% stake in the entertainment portion of the company, calling that division Time Warner Entertainment (or legally Time Warner Entertainment Company L.P.). US West's stake eventually passed to acquired cable company MediaOne, then to AT&T Broadband in 1999 when that company acquired MediaOne, then finally to Comcast in 2001 when that company bought the AT&T Broadband division. Comcast sold their stake in the company in 2003, relegating the name to a subdivision under Time Warner Cable.
Time Warner subsequently acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System in October 1996. Not only did this result in the company (in a way) re-entering the basic cable television industry (in regards to nationally available channels), but Warner Bros. also regained the rights to their pre-1950[34][35] film library, which by then had been owned by Turner (the films are still technically held by Turner, but WB is responsible for sales and distribution),[36] while Turner gained access to WB's post-1950 library, as well as other WB-owned properties.
Time Warner purchased the Six Flags Theme Parks chain in 1993. The company later sold all Six Flags parks and properties to Oklahoma-based Premier Parks on April 1, 1998.[37]
Dick Parsons, already a director on the board since 1991, was hired as Time Warner president in 1995, although the division operational heads continued to report directly to Chairman and CEO Gerald Levin.[38]
In 1991, HBO and Cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers, with companion channels supplementing the main networks.[39]
In 1993, HBO became the world's first digitally transmitted television service.[40]
In 1995, CNN introduced CNN.com which later became a leading destination for global digital news, both online and mobile.[41]
In 1996, Warner Bros. spearheaded the introduction of the DVD, which rapidly replaced VHS tapes as the standard for home video.[42]
In 1999, HBO became the first national cable TV network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel.[43]
2000s[edit]
Merger with AOL[edit]
In 2000, it was announced that AOL would purchase Time Warner for US$164 billion.[44] Due to the larger market capitalization of AOL, their shareholders would own 55% of the new company while Time Warner shareholders owned only 45%,[45] so in actual practice AOL had acquired Time Warner, even though Time Warner had far more assets and revenues. Time Warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution, while AOL wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets.[46]
The deal, announced on January 10, 2000[45] and officially filed on February 11, 2000,[47] employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity. The Federal Trade Commission cleared the deal on December 14, 2000,[48] and gave final approval on January 11, 2001; the company completed the merger later that day.[49] The deal was approved on the same day by the Federal Communications Commission,[47] and had already been cleared by the European Commission on October 11, 2000.[50]
AOL Time Warner Inc., as the company was then called, was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides. Gerald Levin, who had served as Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. Steve Case served as Executive Chairman of the board of directors, Robert W. Pittman (President and COO of AOL) and Dick Parsons (President of Time Warner) served as Co-Chief Operating Officers, and J. Michael Kelly (the CFO from AOL) became the Chief Financial Officer.[51]
According to AOL President and COO Bob Pittman, the slow-moving Time Warner would now take off at Internet speed, accelerated by AOL: "All you need to do is put a catalyst to [Time Warner], and in a short period, you can alter the growth rate. The growth rate will be like an Internet company." When the AOL Time Warner deal was announced, the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward; by tapping into AOL, Time Warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers. AOL would use Time Warner's high-speed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers Time Warner's branded magazines, books, music, and movies. This would have created 130 million subscription relationships.
Unfortunately, the growth and profitability of the AOL division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers. The value of the America Online division dropped significantly, not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell, and forced a goodwill write-off, causing AOL Time Warner to report a loss of $99 billion in 2002 — at the time, the largest loss ever reported by a company. The total value of AOL stock subsequently went from $226 billion to about $20 billion.[52]
An outburst by Vice Chairman Ted Turner at a board meeting prompted Steve Case to contact each of the directors and push for CEO Gerald Levin's ouster. Although Case's coup attempt was rebuffed by Parsons and several other directors, Levin became frustrated with being unable to "regain the rhythm" at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of 2001, effective in May 2002.[53] Although Co-COO Bob Pittman was the strongest supporter of Levin and largely seen as the heir-apparent, Dick Parsons was instead chosen as CEO. Time Warner CFO J. Michael Kelly was demoted to COO of the AOL division, and replaced as CFO by Wayne Pace. AOL Chairman and CEO Barry Schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new "content creation division", being replaced on an interim basis by Pittman, who was already serving as the sole COO after Parsons' promotion.
Many expected synergies between AOL and other Time Warner divisions never materialized, as most Time Warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger. A new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of AOL Time Warner, replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division, caused resentment among Time Warner division heads who blamed the AOL division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company. AOL Time Warner COO Pittman, who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives, who also criticized Pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for AOL Time Warner that were never met. Some of the attacks on Pittman were reported to come from the print media in the Time, Inc. division under Don Logan.[54] Furthermore, CEO Parsons' democratic style prevented Pittman from exercising authority over the "old-guard" division heads who resisted Pittman's synergy initiatives.[51][55]
Pittman announced his resignation as AOL Time Warner COO after July 4, 2002, being reportedly burned out by the AOL special assignment and almost hospitalized, unhappy about the criticism from Time Warner executives, and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as Parsons was firmly entrenched as CEO.[55] Pittman's departure was seen as a great victory to Time Warner executives who wanted to undo the merger. In a sign of AOL's diminishing importance to the media conglomerate, Pittman's responsibilities were divided between two Time Warner veterans; Jeffrey Bewkes who was CEO of Home Box Office, and Don Logan who had been CEO of Time. Logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group, overseeing America Online, Time, Time Warner Cable, the AOL Time Warner Book Group and the Interactive Video unit, relegating AOL to being just another division in the conglomerate. Bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group, comprising HBO, New Line Cinema, The WB, Turner Networks, Warner Bros. and Warner Music. Both Logan and Bewkes, who had initially opposed the merger, were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to AOL Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons.[54][56] Logan, generally admired at Time Warner and reviled by AOL for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker, moved to purge AOL of several "Pittman panzers".[53]
AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case took on added prominence as the co-head of a new strategy committee of the board, making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the Internet. However, under pressure from institutional investor vice president Gordon Crawford who lined up dissenters, Case announced in January 2003 that he would not stand for re-election as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting, making CEO Richard Parsons the chairman-elect. That year, the company dropped the "AOL" from its name, and spun off Time-Life's ownership under the legal name Direct Holdings Americas, Inc. Case resigned from the Time Warner board on October 31, 2005.[53][57] Jeff Bewkes, who eventually became CEO of Time Warner, described the 2001 merger with AOL as 'the biggest mistake in corporate history'.[58]
In 2005, Time Warner was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[59][60][61] On December 27, 2007, newly installed Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes discussed possible plans to spin off Time Warner Cable and sell off AOL and Time Inc. This would leave a smaller company made up of Turner Broadcasting, Warner Bros. and HBO.[62] On February 28, 2008, co-chairmen and co-CEOs of New Line Cinema Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne announced their resignations from the 40-year-old movie studio in response to Jeffrey Bewkes's demand for cost-cutting measures at the studio, which he intended to dissolve into Warner Bros.
On May 28, 2009, Time Warner announced that it would spin off AOL as a separate independent company, with the change occurring on December 9, 2009.
2010s[edit]
In 2010, Turner Sports, Inc. and the National Collegiate Athletic Association jointly announced the formation of NCAA Digital, a 14-year agreement in which Turner will manage and operate the NCAA’s digital portfolio and strengthen coverage of all 88 NCAA championships. NCAA Digital encompasses NCAA.com and additional NCAA digital platforms, including mobile web and applications, as well as other connected devices.[63]
On August 25, 2010, Time Warner's Latin American division bought Chilean nationwide terrestrial television station Chilevisión from Chile's elected president Sebastián Piñera. Time Warner already operates in the country with CNN Chile.[64]
In January 2012, Home Box Office and DISH Network LLC reached an agreement that will give DISH customers expanded access to HBO’s acclaimed programming.
In October 2012, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Media Distribution reached an agreement that will give Warner Bros. rights to Blu-ray and DVD distribution of several titles from Paramount in the US and Canada.[65]
In June 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid for Time Warner at $85 per share in stock and cash ($80 billion total) which Time Warner's board of directors turned down in July. Warner's CNN unit would have been sold to ease antitrust issues of the purchase.[66] On August 5, 2014, 21st Century Fox withdrew its offer to purchase Time Warner.
In January 2014, Time Warner, Related Companies, and Oxford Properties Group announced that Time Warner intends to relocate the Company’s corporate headquarters and its New York City-based employees to 30 Hudson Yards in the Hudson Yards neighborhood in Chelsea, Manhattan, and has accordingly made an initial financial commitment.[67] Time Warner sold its stake in the Columbus Circle building for $1.3 billion to Related and two wealth funds. The move will be completed in 2018.[68]
Transactions[edit]
On December 15, 2006, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. announced an investment in SCi Entertainment Group plc[69] the parent company of publishing label Eidos Interactive Ltd, representing 10.3 percent of the company's enlarged share capital.

On March 17, 2009, Time Warner Inc. announced the legal and structural separation of Time Warner Cable Inc. (NYSE:TWC) from Time Warner through a tax-free spin-off that had become effective on March 12, 2009.
In the first quarter of 2010, Home Box Office purchased additional interests in HBO LAG for $217 million, which resulted in Home Box Office owning 80% of the equity interests of HBO LAG.

On March 6, 2013, Time Warner announced that it would spin off its publishing division Time Inc. as a separate, publicly traded company. The transaction was completed on June 6, 2014.[86][87]
Planned acquisition by AT&T[edit]
On October 20, 2016, it was reported that AT&T was in talks to acquire Time Warner. The proposed deal would give AT&T significant holdings in the media industry; AT&T's competitor Comcast had previously acquired NBCUniversal in a similar bid to increase its media holdings, in concert with its ownership of television and internet providers.[88][89][9] On October 22, 2016, AT&T reached a deal to buy Time Warner for $108.7 billion. If approved by federal regulators, the merger would bring Time Warner's properties under the same umbrella as AT&T's telecommunication holdings, including satellite provider DirecTV.[90][91]
On February 15, 2017, Time Warner shareholders approved the merger,[92] which is still pending regulatory approval. On February 28, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that his agency will not review the deal, leaving the review to the US Department of Justice.[93]

Main article: The CW




The CW logo.


On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner announced that they were to create a new broadcast network, The CW. The network officially debuted on September 18, 2006. The network formally debuted on September 20 with the 2-hour premiere of America's Next Top Model.
The network is the result of a merger of The WB (a Time Warner holding) and UPN (a CBS Corporation holding). CBS Corporation and Time Warner each own 50% of the network. Tribune Broadcasting (previously owned a 25% stake on The WB) and CBS Corporation contributed its stations as new network affiliates.
Commercial properties[edit]
Time Warner owns several large properties in New York City; certain buildings in the Rockefeller Center complex and adjacent office towers house its main offices; one of which houses a CNN news studio. In late 2003, Time Warner finished construction of a new twin-tower complex, designed to serve as additional office space, facing Columbus Circle on the southwestern edge of Central Park. Originally called the AOL Time Warner Center, the 755-foot (230 m), 55-floor mixed-use property was renamed Time Warner Center when the company itself was renamed.[95]

Competition[edit]
Time Warner faces industry competition from traditional media companies such as Sony, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, Viacom, The Walt Disney Company, and Comcast. Time Warner's and many of their competitions' business may be severely impacted by the increasing viewership of feature films, television programming and other content online with low ad-income, which decreases company revenues.
Box office receipts have been rising while the growth rate of DVD sales have recently been declining, which affects Warner Bros.' growth prospects and revenues.[105]
Company names[edit]

Warner Bros. Pictures (1923–1967)
Seven Arts Productions (1957–1967)

Time Warner, Inc. is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered in New York City.[6] It is currently the world's third largest entertainment company in terms of revenue, after Comcast and The Walt Disney Company. It was also once the world's largest media conglomerate.[7] Time Warner was first founded in 1990, with the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The current company consists largely of the assets of the former Warner Communications (as well as HBO, a Time Inc. subsidiary prior to the merger), and the assets of Turner Broadcasting (which was acquired by the company in 1996). Time Warner currently has major operations in film and television, with a limited amount in publishing operations. Among its major assets are HBO, Turner Broadcasting System, The CW, Warner Bros., CNN, DC Comics, and as of August 2016, Hulu, owning 10%.[8] In the past, other major divisions of Time Warner included Time Inc., AOL, Time Warner Cable, Warner Books and Warner Music Group. All of these operations were either sold to other investors or spun off as independent companies from 2004 to 2014.
On October 22, 2016, AT&T announced its intent to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion (including assumed Time Warner debt).[9][10]

HBO[edit]
Main article: HBO
Home Box Office, Inc. operates the namesake HBO premium television service as well as sister service Cinemax. HBO- and Cinemax-branded channels are currently available in over 70 countries around the world, and HBO programming is licensed to other television networks in over 150 countries.[12]
In 2012, HBO was the #1 premium pay television service in primetime television and total day ratings.[12] In 2013, the network received five Golden Globes and 23 primetime Emmy Awards.[13]
HBO’s programming includes the airing of feature films, HBO Documentary Films, HBO original films, and HBO original programming, HBO Sports (live HBO Boxing events). The network has developed content distribution platforms, like HBO GO[14] and Max GO to help support and deliver programming to users via online and mobile devices.
HBO's notable original programming includes Sex and the City, The Sopranos, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Wire, Entourage, Deadwood, True Blood, Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, Girls, Veep, Silicon Valley, and Westworld, as well as motion pictures, mini-series, boxing matches and sports programs, comedy specials, family programming and documentaries. In 2011, Cinemax launched its first original primetime series, Strike Back, and has subsequently launched the original primetime series, Hunted and Banshee.[15]
Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.[edit]
Main article: Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.
Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (Turner) operates international news, entertainment, animation, young adult and kids media networks as well as related businesses. Turner brands include CNN, HLN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, Turner Classic Movies, truTV, Turner Sports, and more. Turner's brands and sub brands reach broad domestic and international audiences.[16] In addition to television network programming, Turner manages digital sports entities, including bleacherreport.com NBA.com, PGA.com and NCAA.com. Turner’s TBS channel reaches large audiences in the 18- to 34-year-old bracket[17] and its news network, CNN, provides a 24-hour news network that delivers news and analysis to domestic and international audiences across multiple platforms. Turner Sports produces sports programming and content for the Turner Networks and related digital properties. Turner Sports’ television line-up includes NBA and MLB games, the NCAA Tournament Games, and the PGA Championship. Turner operates PGA.com and related digital properties of the PGA under agreements with the PGA. Turner and the NBA jointly manage a portfolio of the NBA’s digital businesses, including NBA TV, NBA.com, NBA League Pass, NBA Mobile and the NBA GameTime app. Also Turner and MLB jointly manage a portfolio of the MLB's digital businesses including MLB Network, MLB.com, MLB Extra Innings and the MLB Network App.[18]
Warner Bros.[edit]
Main article: Warner Bros.
Warner Bros. businesses range from feature film and TV to home entertainment production and worldwide distribution to home video, digital distribution, animation, comic books, licensing and international cinemas and broadcasting. In 2012, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group grossed 4.3 billion dollars at the worldwide box office.[19] Home Video is the industry leader with a 21% market share in total DVD and Blu-ray sales.[20]
The Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group works across platforms and outlets in the digital realm with video-on-demand, branded channels, original content, anti-piracy technology and broadband & wireless destinations. Each year Warner Bros. Pictures produces between 18 and 22 films. Warner Bros. has produced more than 50 television series in the 2012–2013 television season. Warner Bros. has also incorporated DC Comics content into Warner Bros. Entertainment via the creation of the DC Entertainment division, which was founded in 2009. DC Entertainment, which is wholly owned by the Company, is responsible for bringing the stories and characters from the DC Comics, Vertigo and MAD Magazine publishing portfolios into other Warner Bros. content and distribution businesses, including feature films, television programming, video games, direct-to-consumer platforms and consumer products. The DC Comics imprint, home to such iconic characters as Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash and Green Lantern, has launched digital versions of its top comic book and graphic novel titles, making them available for download on digital platforms.[21]
History[edit]
1920s[edit]
Time magazine made its debut in 1923 as the first weekly news magazine in the United States.[22] Four years later, in 1927, Warner Bros. released the world’s first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer.[23]
1960s[edit]
In 1963, recommendations from Time Inc. based on how it delivered magazines led to the introduction of ZIP codes by the United States Post Office.[citation needed]
1970s[edit]
In 1972, Kinney National Company spun off its non-entertainment assets due to a financial scandal over its parking operations and renamed itself Warner Communications Inc.[24]
It was the holding company for Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Music Group during the 1970s and 1980s. It also owned DC Comics and Mad, as well as a majority stake in Garden State National Bank (an investment it was ultimately required to sell pursuant to requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act). Warner's initial divestiture efforts led by Garden State CEO Charles A. Agemian were blocked by Garden State board member William A. Conway in 1978; a revised transaction was later completed in 1980.
In 1975, Home Box Office became the first TV network to broadcast nationally via satellite, debuting with the Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier “Thrilla in Manila” boxing match.[25]
In 1975, Warner expanded under the guidance of CEO Steve Ross and formed a joint venture with American Express, named Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, which held cable channels including MTV (launched 1981), Nickelodeon (launched 1979) and The Movie Channel. Warner Bros. bought out American Express's half in 1984, and sold the venture a year later to Viacom, which renamed it MTV Networks.[citation needed]
In 1976, the Turner–owned WTCG originated the "superstation" concept, transmitting via satellite to cable systems nationwide and pioneering the basic cable business model. WTCG was renamed WTBS in 1979.
In 1976, Nolan Bushnell sold Atari, Inc. to Warner Communications for an estimated $2–12 million. Warner made considerable profits (and later losses) with Atari, which it owned from 1976 to 1984. While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of Atari 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time.[26]
1980s[edit]
In 1980, Warner purchased The Franklin Mint for about $225 million. The combination was short lived: Warner sold The Franklin Mint in 1985 to American Protection Industries Inc. (API) for $167.5 million. However, Warner retained Franklin Mint’s Eastern Mountain Sports as well as The Franklin Mint Center, which it leased back to API.[27][28]
In 1980, Turner launched CNN, the first 24-hour all-news network, redefining the way the world received breaking news.[29]
In January 1983, Warner expanded their interests to baseball. Under the direction of Caesar P. Kimmel, executive vice president, bought 48 percent of the Pittsburgh Pirates for $10 million.[30] The company then put up its share for sale in November 1984 following losses of $6 million due to its failed attempt to launch a cable sports package. The team's majority owner, John W. Galbreath, soon followed suit after learning of Warner's actions.[31] Both Galbreath and Warner sold the Pirates to local investors in March 1986.
In 1984, due to major losses spurred by subsidiary Atari Inc.'s losses, Warner sold Atari Inc.'s Consumer Division assets to Jack Tramiel. It kept the rest of the company and named it Atari Games, eventually reducing it to just the Coin Division. They sold Atari Games to Namco in 1985, and repurchased it in 1992, renaming it Time-Warner Interactive, until it was sold to Midway Games in 1996. In a long-expected deal, Warner Communications announced on May 11, 1988, they were acquiring Lorimar-Telepictures; the acquisition was finalized on January 12, 1989.[32]
The merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications was announced on March 4, 1989.[33] During the summer of that same year, Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western) launched a $12.2 billion hostile bid to acquire Time, Inc. in an attempt to end a stock-swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications. This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9 Billion in cash and stock. Paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time/Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Paramount to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of the two companies' merger which was completed on January 10, 1990. However, instead of the companies becoming defunct, the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure, resulting in the new company being called "Time Warner".
1990s[edit]
US West partnered with Time Warner in 1993 to form what is now known as TW Telecom, initially known as Time Warner Communications (also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the ATC name), in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses. US West also took a 26% stake in the entertainment portion of the company, calling that division Time Warner Entertainment (or legally Time Warner Entertainment Company L.P.). US West's stake eventually passed to acquired cable company MediaOne, then to AT&T Broadband in 1999 when that company acquired MediaOne, then finally to Comcast in 2001 when that company bought the AT&T Broadband division. Comcast sold their stake in the company in 2003, relegating the name to a subdivision under Time Warner Cable.
Time Warner subsequently acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System in October 1996. Not only did this result in the company (in a way) re-entering the basic cable television industry (in regards to nationally available channels), but Warner Bros. also regained the rights to their pre-1950[34][35] film library, which by then had been owned by Turner (the films are still technically held by Turner, but WB is responsible for sales and distribution),[36] while Turner gained access to WB's post-1950 library, as well as other WB-owned properties.
Time Warner purchased the Six Flags Theme Parks chain in 1993. The company later sold all Six Flags parks and properties to Oklahoma-based Premier Parks on April 1, 1998.[37]
Dick Parsons, already a director on the board since 1991, was hired as Time Warner president in 1995, although the division operational heads continued to report directly to Chairman and CEO Gerald Levin.[38]
In 1991, HBO and Cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers, with companion channels supplementing the main networks.[39]
In 1993, HBO became the world's first digitally transmitted television service.[40]
In 1995, CNN introduced CNN.com which later became a leading destination for global digital news, both online and mobile.[41]
In 1996, Warner Bros. spearheaded the introduction of the DVD, which rapidly replaced VHS tapes as the standard for home video.[42]
In 1999, HBO became the first national cable TV network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel.[43]
2000s[edit]
Merger with AOL[edit]
In 2000, it was announced that AOL would purchase Time Warner for US$164 billion.[44] Due to the larger market capitalization of AOL, their shareholders would own 55% of the new company while Time Warner shareholders owned only 45%,[45] so in actual practice AOL had acquired Time Warner, even though Time Warner had far more assets and revenues. Time Warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution, while AOL wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets.[46]
The deal, announced on January 10, 2000[45] and officially filed on February 11, 2000,[47] employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity. The Federal Trade Commission cleared the deal on December 14, 2000,[48] and gave final approval on January 11, 2001; the company completed the merger later that day.[49] The deal was approved on the same day by the Federal Communications Commission,[47] and had already been cleared by the European Commission on October 11, 2000.[50]
AOL Time Warner Inc., as the company was then called, was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides. Gerald Levin, who had served as Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. Steve Case served as Executive Chairman of the board of directors, Robert W. Pittman (President and COO of AOL) and Dick Parsons (President of Time Warner) served as Co-Chief Operating Officers, and J. Michael Kelly (the CFO from AOL) became the Chief Financial Officer.[51]
According to AOL President and COO Bob Pittman, the slow-moving Time Warner would now take off at Internet speed, accelerated by AOL: "All you need to do is put a catalyst to [Time Warner], and in a short period, you can alter the growth rate. The growth rate will be like an Internet company." When the AOL Time Warner deal was announced, the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward; by tapping into AOL, Time Warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers. AOL would use Time Warner's high-speed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers Time Warner's branded magazines, books, music, and movies. This would have created 130 million subscription relationships.
Unfortunately, the growth and profitability of the AOL division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers. The value of the America Online division dropped significantly, not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell, and forced a goodwill write-off, causing AOL Time Warner to report a loss of $99 billion in 2002 — at the time, the largest loss ever reported by a company. The total value of AOL stock subsequently went from $226 billion to about $20 billion.[52]
An outburst by Vice Chairman Ted Turner at a board meeting prompted Steve Case to contact each of the directors and push for CEO Gerald Levin's ouster. Although Case's coup attempt was rebuffed by Parsons and several other directors, Levin became frustrated with being unable to "regain the rhythm" at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of 2001, effective in May 2002.[53] Although Co-COO Bob Pittman was the strongest supporter of Levin and largely seen as the heir-apparent, Dick Parsons was instead chosen as CEO. Time Warner CFO J. Michael Kelly was demoted to COO of the AOL division, and replaced as CFO by Wayne Pace. AOL Chairman and CEO Barry Schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new "content creation division", being replaced on an interim basis by Pittman, who was already serving as the sole COO after Parsons' promotion.
Many expected synergies between AOL and other Time Warner divisions never materialized, as most Time Warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger. A new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of AOL Time Warner, replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division, caused resentment among Time Warner division heads who blamed the AOL division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company. AOL Time Warner COO Pittman, who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives, who also criticized Pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for AOL Time Warner that were never met. Some of the attacks on Pittman were reported to come from the print media in the Time, Inc. division under Don Logan.[54] Furthermore, CEO Parsons' democratic style prevented Pittman from exercising authority over the "old-guard" division heads who resisted Pittman's synergy initiatives.[51][55]
Pittman announced his resignation as AOL Time Warner COO after July 4, 2002, being reportedly burned out by the AOL special assignment and almost hospitalized, unhappy about the criticism from Time Warner executives, and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as Parsons was firmly entrenched as CEO.[55] Pittman's departure was seen as a great victory to Time Warner executives who wanted to undo the merger. In a sign of AOL's diminishing importance to the media conglomerate, Pittman's responsibilities were divided between two Time Warner veterans; Jeffrey Bewkes who was CEO of Home Box Office, and Don Logan who had been CEO of Time. Logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group, overseeing America Online, Time, Time Warner Cable, the AOL Time Warner Book Group and the Interactive Video unit, relegating AOL to being just another division in the conglomerate. Bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group, comprising HBO, New Line Cinema, The WB, Turner Networks, Warner Bros. and Warner Music. Both Logan and Bewkes, who had initially opposed the merger, were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to AOL Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons.[54][56] Logan, generally admired at Time Warner and reviled by AOL for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker, moved to purge AOL of several "Pittman panzers".[53]
AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case took on added prominence as the co-head of a new strategy committee of the board, making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the Internet. However, under pressure from institutional investor vice president Gordon Crawford who lined up dissenters, Case announced in January 2003 that he would not stand for re-election as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting, making CEO Richard Parsons the chairman-elect. That year, the company dropped the "AOL" from its name, and spun off Time-Life's ownership under the legal name Direct Holdings Americas, Inc. Case resigned from the Time Warner board on October 31, 2005.[53][57] Jeff Bewkes, who eventually became CEO of Time Warner, described the 2001 merger with AOL as 'the biggest mistake in corporate history'.[58]
In 2005, Time Warner was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[59][60][61] On December 27, 2007, newly installed Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes discussed possible plans to spin off Time Warner Cable and sell off AOL and Time Inc. This would leave a smaller company made up of Turner Broadcasting, Warner Bros. and HBO.[62] On February 28, 2008, co-chairmen and co-CEOs of New Line Cinema Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne announced their resignations from the 40-year-old movie studio in response to Jeffrey Bewkes's demand for cost-cutting measures at the studio, which he intended to dissolve into Warner Bros.
On May 28, 2009, Time Warner announced that it would spin off AOL as a separate independent company, with the change occurring on December 9, 2009.
2010s[edit]
In 2010, Turner Sports, Inc. and the National Collegiate Athletic Association jointly announced the formation of NCAA Digital, a 14-year agreement in which Turner will manage and operate the NCAA’s digital portfolio and strengthen coverage of all 88 NCAA championships. NCAA Digital encompasses NCAA.com and additional NCAA digital platforms, including mobile web and applications, as well as other connected devices.[63]
On August 25, 2010, Time Warner's Latin American division bought Chilean nationwide terrestrial television station Chilevisión from Chile's elected president Sebastián Piñera. Time Warner already operates in the country with CNN Chile.[64]

On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner announced that they were to create a new broadcast network, The CW. The network officially debuted on September 18, 2006. The network formally debuted on September 20 with the 2-hour premiere of America's Next Top Model.
The network is the result of a merger of The WB (a Time Warner holding) and UPN (a CBS Corporation holding). CBS Corporation and Time Warner each own 50% of the network. Tribune Broadcasting (previously owned a 25% stake on The WB) and CBS Corporation contributed its stations as new network affiliates.
Commercial properties[edit]
Time Warner owns several large properties in New York City; certain buildings in the Rockefeller Center complex and adjacent office towers house its main offices; one of which houses a CNN news studio. In late 2003, Time Warner finished construction of a new twin-tower complex, designed to serve as additional office space, facing Columbus Circle on the southwestern edge of Central Park. Originally called the AOL Time Warner Center, the 755-foot (230 m), 55-floor mixed-use property was renamed Time Warner Center when the company itself was renamed.[95]
Notable people[edit]
Time Warner Inc.[edit]
Jeff Bewkes, Chairman and CEO[96]
And five executive vice presidents, most with additional, functional titles:

Gary L. Ginsberg, Corporate Marketing and Communications[98]
Howard M. Averill, Chief Financial Officer[99]

Division CEOs[edit]

Richard Plepler, Chairman and CEO of Home Box Office[102]
John Martin, Chairman and CEO of Turner Broadcasting System[103]

Competition[edit]
Time Warner faces industry competition from traditional media companies such as Sony, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, Viacom, The Walt Disney Company, and Comcast. Time Warner's and many of their competitions' business may be severely impacted by the increasing viewership of feature films, television programming and other content online with low ad-income, which decreases company revenues.
Box office receipts have been rising while the growth rate of DVD sales have recently been declining, which affects Warner Bros.' growth prospects and revenues.[105]
Company names[edit]

Warner Bros. Pictures (1923–1967)
Seven Arts Productions (1957–1967)
Kinney National Company (1966–1972)
Warner Bros.-Seven Arts (1967–1969)

Time Warner (1990–2001, 2003–present)

Bridgevine Privacy Policy for Time Warner Cable Special


The information Bridgevine collects about you at our websites, and the subdomains thereof (the "Sites" or "Websites") is used to administer the Website and to provide information to Website visitors about the Site’s various services and tools, and to provide general news, information, entertainment and ecommerce capability. Bridgevine, together with Bridgevine partners and operators, are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as "we," "us," "our" or other similar pronouns, or "Bridgevine."
What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") applies to your use of the Website, whether accessed through mobile or desktop applications, or otherwise. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Privacy Policy does not govern Bridgevine’s treatment of information it collects and receives about you other than through this Website, for example in connection with any other services provided to you by Bridgevine.
This Privacy Policy covers how Bridgevine treats information that Bridgevine collects and receives about you via this Website, or in email, text or other electronic messages between you and the Website, and including the personal information we collect through the various features, services, and software that we use to provide the Site to you. It does not apply to information collected by any third party, including through any application, feature, service, software or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Website. If you choose to take advantage of any third party offerings, you should read the privacy policies of such third parties.
How Does Bridgevine Collect and Use Information About You?
The information learned from this Website's users will help Bridgevine provide an enhanced online experience for its subscribers. Bridgevine tracks certain information about users (as further described below), including, but not limited to, the type of browser being used by the visitor (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system (e.g., Macintosh, Windows) in use by the visitor and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider (e.g., Bridgevine Internet). By having this information, Web pages optimized for a particular visitor's preferences are automatically made available to that visitor.
Personally identifiable data (as further described below) about visitors to this Site are collected by Bridgevine, for example, when users register or subscribe for newsletters, accounts or features, change services or service settings on our Website, make online purchases, enter sweepstakes and contests, complete surveys, contribute to a chat room, message board, blog, or other similar open forum on our Website, submit a comment or question to us using a "contact us" or similar feature on our Website, or send us an email, or in any other way submit personal information to us via our Website.
	We may use your personally identifiable information to send you notices (for example, in the form of emails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you, unless you choose to opt-out of these mailings (as described below).
Bridgevine sites (other than this Site), as well as any other third party sites linked to from this Site, may each have different privacy policies and practices. Bridgevine is not responsible for the information practices of non-Bridgevine sites, or channels or areas of this Site, that are operated by third parties. You should carefully review these other privacy policies in order to determine how each third party may use any personal information you provide.?
Choice/Opt-Out
Bridgevine does send product marketing email. We use your email address which may be entered for service qualifying order placement or via other email capture methods. Any email communication that you receive from Bridgevine, contains a prominent "Opt Out" link in the body of the email. By clicking on the "Opt-Out" link, you will have removed your email address from our mailing list, and you will not receive any further product marketing communications from Bridgevine.
This site gives users the following options for notifying Bridgevine of their choice not to receive future communications from us or our partners; or to no longer receive our service.

								1. You can send email Remove@Bridgevine.com.

Here are the types of information Bridgevine gathers and how this information is used:
Website Usage Information
Bridgevine receives and stores certain types of website usage information whenever you interact with and navigate through our Website. Here are the types of website usage information Bridgevine gathers and how it is used.
Cookies
We may use "cookies" to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies track where you travel on our Website and what you look at and purchase. They may store, for example, the information in your shopping cart, and/or your username and/or password. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Website.
Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies (technically known as Flash “local shared objects”). However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Website or certain areas or features of the Website.
Clear GIFs
We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, in the Website and/or in our communications with you, for example, to enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an email or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.
IP Address and Clickstream Data
Our server automatically collects data about your server's Internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you're on the Internet. When you request pages from our Website, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the site you visit after this Website; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Website or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.
Ads and Content displayed to you on the Site may be customized to your interests and preferences, based on your personal information and website usage information, including (but not limited to) non-personally identifying information, which we may obtain from you or from other sources.
	Any or all of these activities with regard to website usage Information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.
Short Message Service
We may make available a service through which you can receive messages on your wireless device via short message service (“SMS Service”). If you subscribe to one of our SMS Services, you thereby agree to receive SMS Service messages at the address you provide for such purposes from Bridgevine.
	Your wireless carrier’s standard rates apply to these messages, and you may change your mind at any time by following the instructions on the Site or in the message you receive. You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device you use to sign up for the SMS Service, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges. To use the SMS Service, you must be 18 years of age or older and reside in the United States. You must first register and provide all required Personal Information, which may include, for example, your name, SMS address, wireless carrier and, if fees are applicable to the SMS Service you subscribe to, billing information (either your credit card information or mobile service carrier information if applicable fees will be billed through your carrier). We may also obtain the date, time and content of your messages in the course of your use of the SMS Service. We will use the information we obtain in connection with our SMS Service in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies.
You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks. We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS Service. We may also access the content of your account and/or wireless account with your carrier for the purpose of identifying and resolving technical problems and/or service-related complaints.
Third Party Ad Services and Providers
We may use third-party advertising services companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (generally not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this Site and other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies may employ cookies and clear gifs to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and clear GIFs is generally not personally identifiable (unless, for example, you provide personally identifiable information to them through an ad or email message). We encourage you to read these businesses' privacy policies if you should have any concerns about how they will care for your personal information. We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, see the Network Advertising Initiative's consumer Website at  http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising.
Personal Information
Bridgevine also receives and stores information that may personally identify you. Visitors to the Website who decide to register or login in order to request a more personalized Website experience, or accept any of the various promotions and other product or service offerings (i.e., security downloads) that may be made available on the Website from time to time, may be asked to enter certain types of personally identifiable information that will allow Bridgevine to provide those promotions and offerings to the visitor. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected include: name, postal address, email address and phone number; Bridgevine account number, CPNI customer code, Website login, user ID and/or password information; social security number; short message service or text message address or other wireless device address; instant messaging address; credit card or other payment information; demographic information and/or other information that may identify you as an individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an individual. Certain other information collected, such as security questions, may be used by Bridgevine to verify your identity in the event that you lose or forget your Website login credentials.
Does Bridgevine Ever Share Information with Other Parties?
Disclosure of Information to Outside Parties:
Bridgevine will not disclose information about you to any other party except under the circumstances as described below, or as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy or required or permitted by law:
	Unless you opt-out, we may share your personally identifiable information with third parties (such as co-sponsors of our sweepstakes, contests and other offerings).
Bridgevine may share your information with its affiliates, service providers and other third parties that help to operate our business and this Website and deliver the products and services available on or through the Website.
When you contribute to a "public" area or feature of our Website, such as a chat room, bulletin board, blog or other open forum that we may make available on or through our Website, the information that you submit will be made available to other users. For this reason, we recommend that you not submit any sensitive information on these areas of the Site, including your full name, home address, phone number, financial information, or other information that would enable users to locate you.
	Bridgevine provides your information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Bridgevine and under confidentiality agreements to assist in order and rebate fulfillment, and for other purposes to assist Bridgevine. However, these companies do not have any independent right to use, sell or share this information.
When Bridgevine believes it should, it will respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, and to establish or exercise Bridgevine’s legal rights or defend against legal claims.
Bridgevine shares information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to Bridgevine’s property or the physical safety of any person, violations of Bridgevine’s terms of use or as otherwise allowed by law.
In the event that Bridgevine, or any affiliated entity, or substantially all of its assets related to a particular geographical region, are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, user information may be one of the transferred assets.
Bridgevine may disclose your information in any other way we may describe when you provide the information.
Security
Bridgevine will take steps to protect the security and integrity of all sensitive information provided to this Site. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.
You are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password and any Website login or user ID information, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use of the Site by you or any person or entity using your password, login or user ID, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website.
In the event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email.
Bridgevine online products and services and applications are for the sole use of Bridgevine customers in managing their accounts and the products and services they receive. If you choose to provide access to certain of your account data to third parties Bridgevine cannot be held responsible for any release of account or personal data that occurs as a result of such transmissions or access that you provide to others.

Do Not Call List Information
Effective October 3, 2003, telemarketing rules went into effect as promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission for the National Do Not Call Registry. If the person has not made a previous request, an outbound telemarketing call still may not be made if the person's number is on the "do-not-call" registry. 16 C.F.R. 310(b)(1)(iii)(B). There are two exceptions to the prohibition against calling a person on the "do-not-call" registry: (1) express agreement, in writing, including the telephone number to which calls may be placed and the signature of that person (which may include an electronic or digital signature), 16 C.F.R. 310.4(b)(1)(iii)(B)(i); (2) the seller has an "established business relationship" with the person and the person has not previously made a specific objection to receiving a call by or on behalf of the seller.
The FTC rules further define an "established business relationship" as including a "relationship between a seller and a consumer based on:… (2) the consumer's inquiry or application regarding a product or service offered by the seller, within the three (3) months immediately preceding the date of a telemarketing call." 16 C.F.R. 310.2(n)(2).
A seller cannot call a person who has "previously stated that he or she does not wish to receive an outbound telephone call made by or on behalf of the seller whose goods or services are being offered." 16 C.F.R. 310.4(b)(1)(iii)(A).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
