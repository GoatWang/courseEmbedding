(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion in their audit report dated April 6, 2015, which can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on April 6, 2015. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next 12 months. We do not anticipate generating significant revenues until we are able to open our first restaurant, which is presently under construction in St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies. Accordingly, we must raise additional cash from sources other than operations.  To meet our need for cash we are continually exploring new sources of financing, including raising funds through a secondary public offering, a private placement of securities and/or loans. If we are unable to secure additional financing, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other information included in this Quarterly Report as filed with the SEC on Form 10-Q.  Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital  There is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are an emerging growth business with limited operating history. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns, such as increases in marketing costs, increases in administration expenditures associated with daily operations, increases in accounting and audit fees, and increases in legal fees related to filings and regulatory compliance.  To become profitable and competitive, we have to successfully open operating restaurant properties throughout the Caribbean region. We anticipate relying on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations until we are able to generate sufficient revenues to cover our operating expenses, which may never happen. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our then existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to make any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities.  We are continually exploring new sources of financing to meet our need for additional cash, including raising funds through sales of our equity securities and loans. We cannot provide any assurances that our efforts to secure additional financing will be successful. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations. Further, future equity financing could result in additional and substantial dilution to existing shareholders.  Plan of Operations  Blue Water was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on June 27, 2013 under the name Stream Flow Media, Inc. On October 14, 2015 an Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation was filed changing the corporation name to Blue Water Bar & Grill, Inc. Blue Water is currently developing a chain of casual dining restaurants in popular tourist destinations throughout the Caribbean region under the Blue Water Bar & Grill(TM) brand name. The initial flagship location is presently under construction in St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies  The projected costs and other related expenses are estimates made by our management and our actual costs related to opening our proposed restaurant may differ significantly.  In addition to the foregoing, and unless otherwise noted, all of the cost estimates and forecasts throughout our business plan are mere estimates made by our management. Our actual costs related to opening and operating the proposed restaurants may differ significantly from our estimates, which could have a negative impact on our overall business, cause our business to fail, and result in you losing all of your investment.  Blue Water Bar & Grill(TM)  The Blue Water Bar & Grill(TM) restaurant concept is the Perfectly CaribbeanSM experience featuring a casual, open air Caribbean themed restaurant designed to offer customers a distinctive and relaxing island dining experience. Central to each restaurant will be a large covered outside patio area where customers can enjoy their drinks and food while overlooking a beautiful water view. The patio area will feature an inviting island styled walk up (and in some cases, swim up) bar and a  small stage area for live musical performances by local musicians and dancing.  Each restaurant will begin serving breakfast at 7am. On weekends the restaurant will promote an American styled breakfast buffet and feature a do-it-yourself Bloody Mary station. Lunch service will commence at 11am and will feature handmade burgers, gourmet sandwiches and salads, and Caribbean jerk styled dishes. Dinner service will start at 5pm and will feature hand-cut aged Certified Angus steaks and prime rib, fresh seafood caught by local fishermen, hand tossed pizzas, and specialty homemade desserts. The restaurant will close at 11pm nightly and the bar will close later at the manager's discretion.  During weekdays the bar will host a daily happy hour (4pm - 6pm) that will offer reduced priced drinks and appetizer specials. When the sun sets the patio will be outlined by tiki torches, which will promote a fun nighttime island atmosphere while helping ward off unwanted insects such as mosquitoes.  In addition, each restaurant will offer its customers specialty drinks in souvenir glasses, mugs, and shot glasses that come with the drink. These items, along with fun and unique t-shirts and other souvenirs, will be available for retail purchase in a separate souvenir hut that will be approximately 130 square feet in size. These souvenir items will be primarily marketed to the tourist customers. Based on our preliminary discussions with an importer of these types of souvenir items, we estimate selling this merchandise at a 300% - 600% retail markup, depending on the particular item.  St. Maarten Blue Water Bar & Grill(TM)  In February 2015 Blue Water broke ground on its first Blue Water Bar & Grill(TM) in St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies. The beachfront building site is located in the pristine eco-friendly Indigo Bay development and is the second restaurant approved for beachfront construction. More information about the Indigo Bay development be found through their website at www.indigo-bay.com.  Key elements to the design and site location include:  �  Blue Water's building site (Lot #L04) measures approximately 1,552 square meters (16,706 square feet) and is located on a picturesque white sand beach.  �  This Blue Water Bar & Grill(TM) location will feature a large, open-aired tiki roof, swimming pool with swim up bar stools, two fire pits, and beach and pool lounge chairs with full drink and food service.  �  The restaurant's foot print measures approximately 415 square meters (4,467 square feet) and seats up to 203 people:  �  98 under the main tiki roof, 64 under tropical cover, 26 at the bar, and 15 at the swim up bar.  �  Indigo Bay is an eco-friendly commercial and residential development encompassing approximately 150 acres of lush tropical and beachfront land.  �  Indigo Bay is St. Maarten's newest and closest attraction to the Port of St. Maarten and is just a quick ride by water taxi for cruise ship passengers.  �  Approximate GPS coordinates: 18?01'17.5 North and 63?04'33 West.  Keys for Success  To better achieve our business objectives and successfully compete with other restaurants, we have developed the following focal points and strategies we anticipate implementing in all of our future restaurants:  Create a Fun, Energetic, Destination Drinking and Dining Experience. We wish to create and promote a fun and socially open atmosphere whereby our customers can, if they choose to do so, openly interact with one another. Topics of discussion and frequent interest will often center around where each other is from, what activities have they done while on the island, and giving and receiving recommendations for future activities while on the island; sometimes the floor and bar staff will participate in these discussions and offer their own words of advice. We intend to accomplish this by utilizing sectional floor and foot traffic planning, whereby the bar area will promote social interaction among customers, a stage area will feature local live entertainment performers to create a lively and festive atmosphere, and more intimate dining tables will be located further in the back to provide separation for those who just wish to dine alone and enjoy the island atmosphere. We believe that if we are successful at achieving this goal, new customers - tourists, "local" ex-patriots and native locals alike - will become repeat, or "regular", customers and subsequently promote the restaurant by word-of-mouth to their friends and family.  Distinctive Concept. In each restaurant we wish to create a fun and consistent experience for our customers centered around our full bar service, dining offerings, and daily entertainment. The restaurant's concept will be carried throughout our customers' entire visit and will involve all aspects of the experience, including the exterior design of the building, interior layout and decorum, employee greetings and uniforms, specialty drinks and menu items, and fun and creative souvenirs such as interestingly shaped drink glasses and bright and flamboyant t-shirts that can remind the customer of their vacation or make an excellent gift for someone back home.  Comfortable Adult Atmosphere. Our restaurants will be primarily adult orientated. While children will be welcomed during daytime hours as long as they are accompanied by a responsible adult at all times during their visit, no one under 21 years of age (or the minimum legal drinking age as established by statute) will be allowed into our restaurants after 10pm. We believe  that this policy will help maintain a fun and relaxed atmosphere that appeals to adult customers, and will help attract groups such as private parties and business organizations.  High Standard of Customer Service. Because service is one the key areas restaurants differentiate themselves from one another - and a constant source of either compliments or complaints from customers - we intend to foster a high level of customer service among our employees, ranging from the general manager to the greeters, through intense training (cross training for all manager level employees and a one-week training course, complete with required testing on all food and drink offerings, operational procedures, and computer checkout for all other employees), constant monitoring (from the on-duty manager and surprise visits from "secret shoppers"), and emphasizing consideration of our customers first and foremost in all decisions. From the moment a customer walks into the front door, we want them to experience a high level of guest service provided by a knowledgeable, energetic staff. Bar tenders will be required to be able to free pour simultaneously from multiple liquor bottles and perform "flare" techniques (flipping, tossing, and twirling of liquor bottles) for our customers' entertainment; greeters and servers will be required to introduce customers to the concept, explain the drink and entree menus and daily specials, and generally set the stage for a fun and memorable experience for them.  Provide Dining Value. We believe that our restaurants should provide our customers with interesting, high quality, and generously portioned (covering the entire plate) menu items that are aesthetically appealing and result in the customer leaving fully satisfied. Complementing the dining aspect, we intend to offer the customer a unique variety of original drinks, each designed to perpetuate and immerse the customer in the restaurant's overall concept. It is our goal to generate at least a US$28 average check per guest, inclusive of food and drinks. We estimate that our overall gross sales will be comprised of 65% food and 35% drinks. We anticipate achieving and maintaining a 30% food cost and 18% liquor cost, which relates to our actual cost of the product compared to the gross revenue the product generates. For example, if we sold a fish entree for $20 our actual cost would be $6 and our gross profit would be $14. Prices for entrees will start at around $12 for a hamburger and rise to $42 for a prime rib steak dinner; prices for drinks will start at $3 for beer, $6 for basic well mixed drinks, and $8 for specialty drinks. These price points are competitive with the existing restaurants our management team has scouted in the Simpson Bay area of St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies, where we intend to open our first Blue Water Bar & Grill(TM) that will cater to the tourist and local ex-patriot alike.  It is important to note that although we aspire to operate at or below the above food and liquor costs, we cannot guarantee that we will ever achieve such food or liquor costs or, if achieved, will be able to maintain them.  Operations and Management  Our ability to effectively manage an operation including high volume restaurants (annual gross sales of US$1,000,000 or more) with live entertainment offerings is critical to our overall success. In order to maintain quality and consistency at each of our future restaurants we must carefully train and properly supervise our personnel and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation, entertainment productions and equipment, and maintenance of the restaurant facilities. We believe our current management is capable of overseeing our planned growth over the next two years. While staffing levels will vary from restaurant to restaurant depending on actual sales volumes, we anticipate our typical restaurant management staff to be comprised of a general manager, a kitchen manager (who also serves as the head chef) and a bar manager (who also serves as the head bartender); the kitchen manager and bar manager will also act as assistant general managers when the general manager is off-duty and will receive a slightly higher base salary compared to our other chefs and bartenders to compensate for their added responsibilities.  Recruiting. We will actively recruit and select individuals who share our passion for customer service. Our selection process includes testing and multiple interviews to aid in the selection of new employees, regardless of their prospective position. We will offer a competitive compensation plan to our managers that includes a base salary, bonuses for achieving performance objectives, and possibly incentive stock options once they have worked for us for at least one full year. For example, the general manager in our initial Blue Water Bar & Grill(TM) restaurant will most likely be offered a base salary of $1,500 a month, plus up to $1,000 a month in additional performance incentives for achieving minimum gross sales and exceeding the minimum targeted food, liquor, and labor costs, as determined by our executive management team. In addition, all employees are entitled to discount meals at any of our future restaurants.  Training. We believe that proper training is the key to exceptional customer service. Each new management hire will go through an extensive training program, which will include cross-training in all management duties. All non-management new hires will go through a standard training program where they will learn and be tested on all of our food and drink offerings, operational procedures, and our point-of-sale (POS) computer system.  Management Information Systems (MIS). All of our future restaurants will be equipped with a variety of integrated management information systems. These systems will include an easy-to-use point-of-sale (POS) computer system which facilitates the movement of customer food and drink orders between the customer areas and kitchen and bar operations, controls cash, handles credit card authorizations, keeps track of sales on a per employee basis for incentive awards purposes, and provides on-site and executive level management with real-time sales and inventory data. Additionally, we intend to implement a centralized accounting system that will include a food cost program and a labor scheduling and tracking program. Physical inventories of food and drink items will be performed on a weekly basis. Further, daily, weekly, and monthly financial information will be provided to executive level management for analysis and comparison to our budget and to comparable restaurants. By closely monitoring each restaurant's gross sales, cost of sales, labor, and other cost trends we will be better able to control our costs, inventory levels, and identify problems with individual operations, if any, early on.  Secret Shopper. Because we believe exceptional customer service is paramount to our success, we intend to implement a "secret shopper" program to monitor the quality control at all of our future restaurants. Secret shoppers are independent persons who test the quality of our food, drink, and service as paying customers without the knowledge of the restaurant's management or employees. Secret shoppers then report their unbiased experiences to our executive level management.  Long-Term Growth Plan (5 Years)  Over the next five years we plan to focus on a disciplined growth strategy of opening one new Blue Water Bar & Grill(TM) restaurant each year. Aside from the Blue Water Bar & Grill(TM) currently under development in St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies, we have also identified the following Caribbean islands we intend to eventually open a Blue Water Bar & Grill(TM) restaurant:  �  Aruba, Dutch West Indies;  �  Nassau, Bahamas;  �  Cozumel, Mexico;  �  Grand Cayman; and  �  Barbados.  We estimate that we will need to raise an aggregate of between $4 - $5 million to open the proposed restaurants on each of the listed Caribbean islands. This capital will most likely be raised through the sales of additional equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders.  Sales and Marketing  Our marketing strategy is aimed at attracting new customers through both traditional and creative avenues. We intend to focus on building a reputation among local customers (those living on the island) while directing our marketing efforts toward tourists staying on the island or visiting for the day on a cruise ship. We intend to accomplish this through:  �  Grand opening promotions;  �  Traditional paid advertising (e.g. radio, television, newspaper, etc.);  �  Free media exposure (e.g. hosting charity events, food reviews, etc.); and  �  Working directly with tourism bureau representatives and transportation representatives (taxi association, bus association, day sail and charter businesses, etc.).  When opening a new Blue Water Bar & Grill(TM) restaurant we intend to host grand opening parties for local leaders, media personalities, hospitality employees such as resort and hotel staff, and tourism bureau representatives (inclusive of cruise ship industry representatives and hotel/resort industry representatives).  Afterwards we will sustain awareness through more traditional marketing methods, including radio and television spots, newspaper ads, billboards and road signs, and resort and hotel concierge promotional cards and discount coupons.  If our strategy is successful it will lead to "word of mouth" referrals, which is our ultimate goal. This is accomplished by providing our customers with consistently excellent service and quality food and drinks.  While we do not have a fixed marketing budget, we do anticipate launching each new restaurant with a marketing blitz campaign and tapering it down to less than 5% of the restaurant's annual gross sales once it is sufficiently established with regular and recurring revenue.  Financing  We are presently seeking additional sources of capital necessary for us to achieve our stated business objectives and meet our projected expenditures over the next 12 months and beyond. However, we can provide no assurances that any such financing can be obtained or, if obtained, on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to generate profits or unable to obtain additional funds to meet our working capital needs, we may need to cease or curtail our business operations.  Government Regulation  The restaurant industry is subject to many various laws which directly affect our organization and planned operations. Each restaurant we open must comply with various licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which typically include health, safety and fire authorities in the municipality where our restaurant is located. The development and operation of a successful restaurant depends upon selecting and acquiring a suitable location, which is normally subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic, and other regulations. Further, our operations will also be subject to various laws governing such matters as wages, health insurance requirements, working conditions, citizenship and work permit requirements, and mandatory overtime pay, all of which will directly affect our labor costs.  Additionally, because we anticipate a significant portion of our revenue to be generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages, we must comply with any and all regulations governing their sale. Typically this requires the proper licensing at each restaurant location (in many cases it needs to be renewed on an annual basis). Such licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. These regulations often relate to many aspects of the restaurant, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. The failure of any of our future restaurants to obtain and retain such a license would limit its ability to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability at that particular location, which could subsequently impact our business's overall revenues and ability to achieve (and if achieved, maintain) profitability.  Compliance with Environmental Laws  We have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any expenses associated with environmental laws.  Patents and Trademarks  We are presently using the following trademarks and service marks "Blue Water Bar & Grill" and "Perfectly Caribbean".

Stocks: 15 minute delay, EST. Futures and Forex: 10 minute delay, CST.) and new delayed trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash").  Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related ETFs Find exchange traded funds (ETFs) whose sector aligns with the same commodity grouping as the symbol you are viewing.

	 Forward-Looking Statements



	 



	Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations.  Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements of the Registrant to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.  The Registrants plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving it continuing as a going concern and executing on its stated business plan and objectives.  Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Registrant.  Although the Registrant believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate.  In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Registrant or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Registrant will be achieved.







	As used in this Quarterly Report, the terms "we", "us", "our", "Tiger Reef", Registrant, and Issuer mean Tiger Reef, Inc. (formerly Blue Water Bar & Grill, Inc.) unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	September 30, 2016


	(unaudited)









	NOTE 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies







	Organization






	Tiger Reef, Inc. (

	Company

	 or 

	Tiger Reef

	) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on June 27, 2013 under the name Stream Flow Media, Inc.  The Company amended its Articles of Incorporation on October 14, 2015 to change its name to Blue Water Bar & Grill, Inc. and further amended its Articles of Incorporation on October 24, 2016 to change its name to Tiger Reef, Inc.  The Company is a diversified producer of ultra premium rums under the Tiger Reef® brand and a developer of Caribbean casual dining restaurant properties.






	Unaudited Interim Financial Information






	The unaudited condensed interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (

	GAAP

	) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.


	 


	The condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from audited financial statements.


	 


	Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Companys Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 7, 2016.






	Basis of Presentation






	The Company is a diversified producer of ultra premium rums under the Tiger Reef® brand and a developer of Caribbean casual dining restaurant properties.





	The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, there is no assurance that once open the Companys restaurants will be well received or that the Company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund continued operations.


	 


	The above factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.





	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tiger Reef, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Tiger Reef, Ltd. (hereafter referred collectively as the 

	Company

	 or 

	Tiger Reef

	).





	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.






	Use of Estimates






	The accompanying financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.  Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment.  Actual results may vary from these estimates.









	8














	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no cash equivalents.






	Property, Plant and Equipment






	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 3 to 20 years.  Leasehold improvements and leased equipment are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement or equipment.






	Fair Value of Financial Instruments






	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  It establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.  A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  It prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:




















	Level





	 





	Description







	 




	 




	 






	Level 1




	 




	Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.






	Level 2




	 




	Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.






	Level 3




	 




	Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.










	The estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 are as follows:

	Net Loss per Share Calculation






	Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.   Diluted earnings per shares is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding.






	Revenue Recognition






	The Company follows the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 605 for revenue recognition.  In general, the Company recognizes revenue on four basic criteria that must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.  Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectability of those fees.  Revenue is generally recognized at the time of sale and is expected to consist of sales of food, beverages and general merchandise and souvenirs.






	Discontinued Operations






	The Company follows the policy of segregating the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries or lines of business on its balance sheet from the assets and liabilities of continuing subsidiaries or lines of business when it is decided to close or dispose of a subsidiary or line of business.  The Company also follows the policy of separately disclosing the assets and liabilities and the net operations of a subsidiary or line of business in its financial statements when it is decided to close or dispose of a subsidiary or line of business.






	Income Taxes






	The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes.  Under FASB ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes.  The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences.


	 


	The Company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets.  The Company establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration the Companys financial position and results of operations for the current period.  Future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period under the Federal tax laws.






	10













	 


	Changes in circumstances, such as the Company generating taxable income, could cause a change in judgment about its ability to realize the related deferred tax asset.  Any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change in estimate.






	Fiscal Year






	The Company elected December 31st for its fiscal year end.






	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	There are various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.






	NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN






	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements during nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has not established a source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs, and as such, has incurred an operating loss since its inception.  Further, as of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated net loss of ($1,089,117).  These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.





	The Companys existence is dependent upon managements ability to develop profitable operations and to obtain additional sources of financing. There can be no assurance that the Companys financing efforts will result in profitable operations or the resolution of the Companys liquidity problems. The accompanying statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.






	NOTE 3  STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY







	Preferred stock



	 


	The Company has authorized 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value.

	 

	The Companys Board of Directors is authorized, without further action by the shareholders, to issue shares of preferred stock and to fix the designations, number, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences and sinking fund terms.





	On November 2, 2015, the Companys board of directors designated 250,000 shares of preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock at $0.001 par value.  Series A Preferred Stock ranks superior to all other classes of stock including common and other future classes of preferred in regard to liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. The Series A Preferred Stock shall participate in all legal dividends declared by the board of directors, has 5,000 votes per share in all voting matters, and is convertible and redeemable by the Company into shares of common stock at a ratio of 5,000 shares of common stock for each share of Series A Preferred.





	On November 2, 2015, the Company issued 97,625 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Taurus Financial Partners, LLC (

	Taurus

	) as payment towards outstanding accounts payable to Taurus amounting to $97,625.  This transaction was mutually rescinded retroactively by both parties on February 25, 2016 resulting in the reinstatement of $97,625 in accounts payable to Taurus.  The accounts payable balance owed to Taurus was converted into and has been accounted for as a short-term note payable to a related party.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, this short-term note payable had accrued $16,010 and $8,694, respectively, in imputed interest.  This imputed interest has been recorded in the financial statements as additional paid-in capital.  No shares of Series A Preferred Stock were issued hereunder.





	As of September 30, 2016, the Company had -0- shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding; there were no other shares or classes of preferred stock authorized or outstanding.

	Item 2.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations







	Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion in their audit report dated March 7, 2016, which can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (

	SEC

	) on March 7, 2016.  This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next 12 months.  We do not anticipate generating significant revenues until we are able to open our first restaurant.  Accordingly, we must raise additional cash from sources other than operations.





	To meet our need for cash we are continually exploring new sources of financing, including raising funds through a secondary public offering, a private placement of securities and/or loans.  If we are unable to secure additional financing, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely.





	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other information included in this Quarterly Report as filed with the SEC on Form 10-Q.






	Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital






	There is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance.  We are an emerging growth business with limited operating history.  We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations.  Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns, such as increases in marketing costs, increases in administration expenditures associated with daily operations, increases in accounting and audit fees, and increases in legal fees related to filings and regulatory compliance.


	 


	To become profitable and competitive, we have to successfully open operating restaurant properties throughout the Caribbean region and have our ultra premium rums available to consumers worldwide.  We anticipate relying on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations until we are able to generate sufficient revenues to cover our operating expenses, which may never happen.  Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our then existing stockholders.  There is no assurance that we will be able to make any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities.


	 


	We are continually exploring new sources of financing to meet our need for additional cash, including raising funds through sales of our equity securities and loans.  We cannot provide any assurances that our efforts to secure additional financing will be successful.  We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms.  If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations.  Further, future equity financing could result in additional and substantial dilution to existing shareholders.






	Plan of Operations






	Tiger Reef was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on June 27, 2013 under the name Stream Flow Media, Inc.  We amended our Articles of Incorporation on October 14, 2015 to change our name to Blue Water Bar & Grill, Inc. and further amended its Articles of Incorporation on October 24, 2016 to change its name to Tiger Reef, Inc.  Tiger Reef is a diversified producer of ultra premium rums under the Tiger Reef® brand and a developer of casual dining restaurant properties in the Caribbean.






	The projected costs and other related expenses are estimates made by our management and our actual costs related to opening our proposed restaurants may differ significantly.






	In addition to the foregoing, and unless otherwise noted, all of the cost estimates and forecasts throughout our business plan are mere estimates made by our management.  Our actual costs related to opening and operating the proposed restaurants may differ significantly from our estimates, which could have a negative impact on our overall business, cause our business to fail, and result in you losing all of your investment.









	16














	Tiger Reef® Ultra Premium Rums






	Tiger Reef has worked closely with a distinguished and multi-award winning Cuban

	Maestro Ronero

	(master rum maker) to formulate three new and very special ultra premium rums specifically for the US market.  These rums will be produced and bottled in the Dominican Republic and are expected to be available to US consumers as early as Summer 2017.






	Casual Dining Caribbean Restaurants






	Tiger Reef is currently in discussions for a leased restaurant space on the island of St. Maarten.  Tiger Reef anticipates these discussions will result in an executed lease agreement sometime in Q1 2017.  Updates on these material discussions and the ultimate Caribbean restaurant concept will be provided to shareholders in a timely manner.






	Keys for Success






	To better achieve our business objectives and successfully compete with other restaurants, we have developed the following focal points and strategies we anticipate implementing in all of our future restaurants:






	Create a Fun, Energetic, Destination Drinking and Dining Experience

	.  We wish to create and promote a fun and socially open atmosphere whereby our customers can, if they choose to do so, openly interact with one another.  Topics of discussion and frequent interest will often center around where each other is from, what activities have they done while on the island, and giving and receiving recommendations for future activities while on the island; sometimes the floor and bar staff will participate in these discussions and offer their own words of advice.  We intend to accomplish this by utilizing sectional floor and foot traffic planning, whereby the bar area will promote social interaction among customers, a stage area will feature local live entertainment performers to create a lively and festive atmosphere, and more intimate dining tables will be located further in the back to provide separation for those who just wish to dine alone and enjoy the island atmosphere.  We believe that if we are successful at achieving this goal, new customers  tourists, local ex-patriots and native locals alike  will become repeat, or regular, customers and subsequently promote the restaurant by word-of-mouth to their friends and family.






	Distinctive Concept

	.  In each restaurant we wish to create a fun and consistent experience for our customers centered around our full bar service, dining offerings, and daily entertainment.  The restaurants concept will be carried throughout our customers entire visit and will involve all aspects of the experience, including the exterior design of the building, interior layout and decorum, employee greetings and uniforms, specialty drinks and menu items, and fun and creative souvenirs such as interestingly shaped drink glasses and bright and flamboyant t-shirts that can remind the customer of their vacation or make an excellent gift for someone back home.






	Comfortable Adult Atmosphere

	.  Our restaurants will be primarily adult orientated.  While children will be welcomed during daytime hours as long as they are accompanied by a responsible adult at all times during their visit, no one under 21 years of age (or the minimum legal drinking age as established by statute) will be allowed into our restaurants after 10pm.  We believe that this policy will help maintain a fun and relaxed atmosphere that appeals to adult customers, and will help attract groups such as private parties and business organizations.






	High Standard of Customer Service

	.  Because service is one the key areas restaurants differentiate themselves from one another  and a constant source of either compliments or complaints from customers  we intend to foster a high level of customer service among our employees, ranging from the general manager to the greeters, through intense training (cross training for all manager level employees and a one-week training course, complete with required testing on all food and drink offerings, operational procedures, and computer checkout for all other employees), constant monitoring (from the on-duty manager and surprise visits from secret shoppers), and emphasizing consideration of our customers first and foremost in all decisions.  From the moment a customer walks into the front door, we want them to experience a high level of guest service provided by a knowledgeable, energetic staff.  Bar tenders will be required to be able to free pour simultaneously from multiple liquor bottles and perform flare techniques (flipping, tossing, and twirling of liquor bottles) for our customers entertainment; greeters and servers will be required to introduce customers to the concept, explain the drink and entree menus and daily specials, and generally set the stage for a fun and memorable experience for them.






	Provide Dining Value

	.  We believe that our restaurants should provide our customers with interesting, high quality, and generously portioned (covering the entire plate) menu items that are aesthetically appealing and result in the customer leaving fully satisfied.  Complementing the dining aspect, we intend to offer the customer a unique variety of original drinks, each designed to perpetuate and immerse the customer in the restaurants overall concept.  It is our goal to generate at least a US$28 average check per guest, inclusive of food and drinks.  We estimate that our overall gross sales will be comprised of






	17













	65% food and 35% drinks.  We anticipate achieving and maintaining a 30% food cost and 18% liquor cost, which relates to our actual cost of the product compared to the gross revenue the product generates.  For example, if we sold a fish entree for $20 our actual cost would be $6 and our gross profit would be $14.  Prices for entrees will start at around $12 for a hamburger and rise to $42 for a prime rib steak dinner; prices for drinks will start at $3 for beer, $6 for basic well mixed drinks, and $8 for specialty drinks.





	It is important to note that although we aspire to operate at or below the above food and liquor costs, we cannot guarantee that we will ever achieve such food or liquor costs or, if achieved, will be able to maintain them.






	Operations and Management






	Our ability to effectively manage an operation including high volume restaurants (annual gross sales of US$1,000,000 or more) with live entertainment offerings is critical to our overall success.  In order to maintain quality and consistency at each of our future restaurants we must carefully train and properly supervise our personnel and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation, entertainment productions and equipment, and maintenance of the restaurant facilities.  We believe our current management is capable of overseeing our planned growth over the next two years.  While staffing levels will vary from restaurant to restaurant depending on actual sales volumes, we anticipate our typical restaurant management staff to be comprised of a general manager, a kitchen manager (who also serves as the head chef) and a bar manager (who also serves as the head bartender); the kitchen manager and bar manager will also act as assistant general managers when the general manager is off-duty and will receive a slightly higher base salary compared to our other chefs and bartenders to compensate for their added responsibilities.






	Recruiting

	.  We will actively recruit and select individuals who share our passion for customer service.  Our selection process includes testing and multiple interviews to aid in the selection of new employees, regardless of their prospective position.  We will offer a competitive compensation plan to our managers that includes a base salary, bonuses for achieving performance objectives, and possibly incentive stock options once they have worked for us for at least one full year.  For example, the general manager in our initial restaurant will most likely be offered a base salary of $3,500 a month, plus up to $1,000 a month in additional performance incentives for achieving minimum gross sales and exceeding the minimum targeted food, liquor, and labor costs, as determined by our executive management team.  In addition, all employees are entitled to discount meals at any of our future restaurants.






	Training

	.  We believe that proper training is the key to exceptional customer service.  Each new management hire will go through an extensive training program, which will include cross-training in all management duties.  All non-management new hires will go through a standard training program where they will learn and be tested on all of our food and drink offerings, operational procedures, and our point-of-sale (POS) computer system.






	Management Information Systems (MIS)

	.  All of our future restaurants will be equipped with a variety of integrated management information systems.  These systems will include an easy-to-use point-of-sale (POS) computer system which facilitates the movement of customer food and drink orders between the customer areas and kitchen and bar operations, controls cash, handles credit card authorizations, keeps track of sales on a per employee basis for incentive awards purposes, and provides on-site and executive level management with real-time sales and inventory data.  Additionally, we intend to implement a centralized accounting system that will include a food cost program and a labor scheduling and tracking program.  Physical inventories of food and drink items will be performed on a weekly basis.  Further, daily, weekly, and monthly financial information will be provided to executive level management for analysis and comparison to our budget and to comparable restaurants.  By closely monitoring each restaurants gross sales, cost of sales, labor, and other cost trends we will be better able to control our costs, inventory levels, and identify problems with individual operations, if any, early on.






	Secret Shopper

	.  Because we believe exceptional customer service is paramount to our success, we intend to implement a secret shopper program to monitor the quality control at all of our future restaurants.  Secret shoppers are independent persons who test the quality of our food, drink, and service as paying customers without the knowledge of the restaurants management or employees.  Secret shoppers then report their unbiased experiences to our executive level management.






	Long-Term Growth Plan (5+ Years)







	Ultra Premium Rums






	Over the next five years we plan to expand and grow the Tiger Reef® brand of ultra premium rums into new territories, including:









	18














	·


	Asia;


	·


	European Union;


	·


	Caribbean Region;


	·


	Australia; and


	·


	India.






	Caribbean Restaurants






	Over the next five years we plan to focus on a disciplined growth strategy of opening one new Caribbean restaurant each year.  We have also identified the following Caribbean islands we intend to eventually open a Caribbean restaurant:





	·


	St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies


	·


	Aruba, Dutch West Indies;


	·


	Nassau, Bahamas;


	·


	Cozumel, Mexico;


	·


	Grand Cayman; and


	·


	Barbados.





	We estimate that we will need to raise approximately $5 million to achieve the above listed goals and milestones.  This capital will most likely be raised through the sales of additional equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders.






	Sales and Marketing






	Our marketing strategy is aimed at attracting new customers through both traditional and creative avenues.  We intend to focus on building a reputation among local customers (those living on the island) while directing our marketing efforts toward tourists staying on the island or visiting for the day on a cruise ship.  We intend to accomplish this through:





	·


	Grand opening promotions;


	 


	·


	Traditional paid advertising (e.g. radio, television, newspaper, etc.);





	·


	Free media exposure (e.g. hosting charity events, food reviews, etc.); and





	·


	Working directly with tourism bureau representatives and transportation representatives (taxi association, bus association, day sail and charter businesses, etc.).





	When opening a new restaurant we intend to host grand opening parties for local leaders, media personalities, hospitality employees such as resort and hotel staff, and tourism bureau representatives (inclusive of cruise ship industry representatives and hotel/resort industry representatives).  Our goal with courting these groups is to introduce them to our concept and court them to refer new customers to our restaurants and provide us with free future media exposure.





	Afterwards we will sustain awareness through more traditional marketing methods, including radio and television spots, newspaper ads, billboards and road signs, and resort and hotel concierge promotional cards and discount coupons.





	If our strategy is successful it will lead to word of mouth referrals, which is our ultimate goal.  This is accomplished by providing our customers with consistently excellent service and quality food and drinks.





	While we do not have a fixed marketing budget, we do anticipate launching each new restaurant with a marketing blitz campaign and tapering it down to less than 5% of the restaurants annual gross sales once it is sufficiently established with regular and recurring revenue.


	 



	Financing






	In order to proceed with our long-term plans we anticipate that we will need to generate at least between $5 million in additional long-term financing.









	19













	We presently do not have an established or dependable source of financing.  Currently we are exploring various sources of new financing to meet our basic working capital needs and provide for our planned capital expenditures.  Without limiting our available options, future financings will most likely be through the sale of additional shares of our common stock.  It is possible that we could also offer warrants, options and/or rights in conjunction with any future issuances of our common stock.  However, we can give no assurance that sufficient financing will be available to us, and if available to us, in amounts or on terms acceptable to us.  If we are unable to obtain additional funds to meet our basic working capital needs, we may need to cease or curtail our business operations.  






	Government Regulation






	The restaurant industry is subject to many various laws which directly affect our organization and planned operations.  Each restaurant we open must comply with various licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which typically include health, safety and fire authorities in the municipality where our restaurant is located.  The development and operation of a successful restaurant depends upon selecting and acquiring a suitable location, which is normally subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic, and other regulations.  Further, our operations will also be subject to various laws governing such matters as wages, health insurance requirements, working conditions, citizenship and work permit requirements, and mandatory overtime pay, all of which will directly affect our labor costs.





	Additionally, because we anticipate a significant portion of our revenue to be generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages, we must comply with any and all regulations governing their sale.  Typically this requires the proper licensing at each restaurant location (in many cases it needs to be renewed on an annual basis).  Such licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time.  These regulations often relate to many aspects of the restaurant, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.   The failure of any of our future restaurants to obtain and retain such a license would limit its ability to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability at that particular location, which could subsequently impact our businesss overall revenues and ability to achieve (and if achieved, maintain) profitability.






	Compliance with Environmental Laws






	We have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any expenses associated with environmental laws.






	Patents and Trademarks






	We currently intend to use the

	Tiger Reef

	trademark.  We have applied to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (

	USPTO

	) to register our

	Tiger Reef

	trademark and logo.  The USPTO has issued this mark and logo a serial number of 87158477.  This trademark is owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tiger Reef Spirits, Ltd., an Anguilla International Business Company (

	IBC

	Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act






	In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ("

	JOBS Act

	") was enacted into law.  The JOBS Act provides, among other things:





	·


	Exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies;


	 


	·


	Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;





	·


	Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings;





	·


	Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and





	·


	Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements.





	In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering ("

	IPO

	") of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of:





	(i)


	the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,


	 


	(ii)


	the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company's IPO;





	(iii)


	the company's issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or





	(iv)


	the company becoming a "larger accelerated filer" as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.





	The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact Tiger Reef are discussed below.






	Financial Disclosure

	. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:





	(i)


	audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years;


	 


	(ii)


	selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited; and





	(iii)


	executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies. (A smaller reporting company is one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter)





	However, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. Tiger Reef is a smaller reporting company.  Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.





	The JOBS Act also exempts the company's independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("

	PCAOB

	") after the date of the JOBS Act's enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.









	21













	The JOBS Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the company's accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.






	Internal Control Attestation

	.  The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the company's independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the company's internal control over financial reporting, although management of the company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the company's internal control over financial reporting.





	Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.






	Other Items of the JOBS Act

	.  The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement.  The JOBS Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision.  In addition the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company IPO.





	Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Securities Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show.  This is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.






	Election to Opt Out of Transition Period

	.  Section 102(b) (1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.





	The JOBS Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable.  Tiger Reef has elected not to opt out of the transition period pursuant to Section 107(b).






	Results of Operations







	Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

	.  Our total operating expenses for three months ended September 30, 2016 were $126,160 compared to $90,970 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, which represents an increase of $35,190, or 38.7%.  The increase in operating expenses are the result of (i) terminating operations and divesting ourselves of the Blue Water Bar & Grill, N.V. subsidiary, (ii) establishment of Tiger Reef Spirits, Ltd. subsidiary and related development work on our forthcoming line of ultra premium rums to be sold under the Tiger Reef® brand, and (iii) continued cost increases related to our complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements, which have consisted primarily of legal, accounting and outside consulting fees.






	Loss From Operations

	.  We generated an operating loss of ($126,160) from operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an operating loss of ($90,970) during the three months ended September 30, 2015, which represents an increase of $35,190, or 38.7%.  The increase in operating loss from operations are the result of (i) terminating operations and divesting ourselves of the Blue Water Bar & Grill, N.V. subsidiary, (ii) establishment of Tiger Reef Spirits, Ltd. subsidiary and related development work on our forthcoming line of ultra premium rums to be sold under the Tiger Reef® brand, and (iii) continued cost increases related to our complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements, which have consisted primarily of legal, accounting and outside consulting fees.

	Operating Expenses

	.  Our total operating expenses for nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $251,096 compared to $161,827 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which represents an increase of $89,269, or 55.2%.  The increase in operating expenses are the result of (i) terminating operations and divesting ourselves of the Blue Water Bar & Grill, N.V. subsidiary, (ii) establishment of Tiger Reef Spirits, Ltd. subsidiary and related development work on our forthcoming line of ultra premium rums to be sold under the Tiger Reef® brand, and (iii) continued cost increases related to our complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements, which have consisted primarily of legal, accounting and outside consulting fees.

	.  We generated an operating loss of ($251,096) from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an operating loss of ($161,827) during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which represents an increase of $89,269, or 55.2%.  The increase in operating loss from operations are the result of (i) terminating operations and divesting ourselves of the Blue Water Bar & Grill, N.V. subsidiary, (ii) establishment of Tiger Reef Spirits, Ltd. subsidiary and related development work on our forthcoming line of ultra premium rums to be sold under the Tiger Reef® brand, and (iii) continued cost increases related to our complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements, which have consisted primarily of legal, accounting and outside consulting fees.

	Net Loss

	.  We realized a net loss of ($333,376) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of ($161,835) during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which represents an increase of $171,541, or 106.0%.  The increase in the net loss is the result of (i) terminating operations and divesting ourselves of the Blue Water Bar & Grill, N.V. subsidiary, (ii) establishment of Tiger Reef Spirits, Ltd. subsidiary and related development work on our forthcoming line of ultra premium rums to be sold under the Tiger Reef® brand, and (iii) continued cost increases related to our complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements, which have consisted primarily of legal, accounting and outside consulting fees.






	Total Stockholders Deficit

	.  Our stockholders deficit was ($256,877) as of September 30, 2016.






	Liquidity and Capital Resources






	As of September 30, 2016, we had assets totaling $835, which was comprised solely of cash.





	As of September 30, 2016, we had total liabilities of ($257,712), which consisted of accounts payable of ($176,172), notes payable to related party Taurus Financial Partners, LLC for ($36,840), and notes payable to an unrelated party for ($44,700).  Further, we had no external credit facilities (i.e. bank loans, revolving lines of credit, etc.), but are continuing to explore the possibility of obtaining such a credit facility from a traditional lending institution.





	We estimate that we will need to generate at least $1.0 million in additional financing in order to meet our planned 2016 capital expenditures.  Further, in order to proceed with our long-term plans, we anticipate that we will need to generate at least between $4 and $5 million in additional long-term financing.





	We presently do not have an established or dependable source of financing.  Currently we are exploring various sources of new financing to meet our basic working capital needs and provide for our planned capital expenditures.  Without limiting






	23













	our available options, future financings will most likely be through the sale of additional shares of our common stock.  It is possible that we could also offer warrants, options and/or rights in conjunction with any future issuances of our common stock.  However, we can give no assurance that sufficient financing will be available to us, and if available to us, in amounts or on terms acceptable to us.  If we are unable to obtain additional funds to meet our basic working capital needs, we may need to cease or curtail our business operations.






	Going Concern Consideration






	Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion in their audit report dated March 7, 2016, which can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (

	SEC

	) on March 7, 2016.  This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next 12 months.






	Off Balance Sheet Operations






	As of September 30, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet activities or operations.






	Critical Accounting Policies







	Use of Estimates






	The accompanying financial statements of Tiger Reef have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.  Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment.  Actual results may vary from these estimates.






	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, Tiger Reef considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Tiger Reef had no cash equivalents.






	Fair Value of Financial Instruments






	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  It establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.  A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  It prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:




















	Level

	Level 1




	 




	Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.






	Level 2




	 




	Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.






	Level 3




	 




	Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

	Net Loss per Share Calculation






	Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.   Diluted earnings per shares is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.  During the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 Tiger Reef had no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding.






	Revenue Recognition






	Tiger Reef recognizes revenue on four basic criteria that must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.  Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on Managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectability of those fees.

	Tiger Reef accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes.  Under FASB ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes.  The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences.


	 


	Tiger Reef maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets.  Tiger Reef establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration Tiger Reefs financial position and results of operations for the current period.  Future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period under the Federal tax laws.


	 


	Changes in circumstances, such as Tiger Reef generating taxable income, could cause a change in judgment about its ability to realize the related deferred tax asset.  Any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change in estimate.






	Election to Use Extended Transitional Period Under Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (



	JOBS Act



	)






	We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act, that allows us to delay the  adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies.  As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.






	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	There are various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on Tiger Reef's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.






	Contractual Obligations






	As of September 30, 2016 Tiger Reef had no contractual obligations.







	Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk







	Not applicable since we are a smaller reporting company.







	Item 4.  Controls and Procedures








	Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	For the period covered by this report we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and sole director, J. Scott Sitra, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act).





	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be presented or detected on a timely basis.





	Based on managements assessment, we have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in timely alerting management to the material information relating to us required to be included in our annual and interim filings with the SEC.





	Management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures had the following material weaknesses:





	·


	We were unable to maintain any segregation of duties within our financial operations due to our reliance on limited personnel in the finance function.  While this control deficiency has not resulted in any audit adjustments to our






	26













	interim or annual financial statements, it could have resulted in a material misstatement that might have been prevented or detected by a segregation of duties;


	 


	·


	Tiger Reef lacks sufficient resources to perform the internal audit function and does not have an Audit Committee;





	·


	We do not have an independent Board of Directors, nor do we have a board member designated as an independent financial expert to Tiger Reef.  The Board of Directors is comprised of one (1) member who also serves as Tiger Reefs principal executive officer.  As a result, there is a lack of independent oversight of the management team, lack of independent review of our operating and financial results, and lack of independent review of disclosures made by Tiger Reef; and





	·


	Documentation of all proper accounting procedures is not yet complete.





	These weaknesses have existed since our inception on June 27, 2013 and, as of September 30, 2016, have not been remedied.





	To the extent reasonably possible given our limited resources, we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned material weaknesses, including, but not limited to, the following:





	·


	Considering the engagement of consultants to assist in ensuring that accounting policies and procedures are consistent across the organization and that we have adequate control over financial statement disclosures;


	 


	·


	Hiring additional qualified financial personnel, including a Chief Financial Officer, on a full-time basis;





	·


	Expanding our current board of directors to include additional independent individuals willing to perform directorial functions; and





	·


	Increasing our workforce in preparation for exiting the development stage and commencing revenue producing operations.





	Since the recited remedial actions will require that we hire or engage additional personnel, these material weaknesses may not be overcome in the near-term due to our limited financial resources.  Until such remedial actions can be realized, we will continue to rely on the limited advice of outside professionals and consultants.






	Changes in Controls and Procedures






	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.











	PART II










	Item 1.  Legal Proceedings







	During the past ten years no director, person nominated to become a director or executive officer, or promoter of Tiger Reef has been involved in any legal proceeding that would require disclosure hereunder.





	From time to time, we may become subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities.  However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties for which the outcome cannot be predicted.  Any adverse result in these or other legal matters could arise and cause harm to our business.  We currently are not party to any claim or litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business.










	Item 1A.  Risk Factors







	Not applicable since we are a smaller reporting company.









	27


















	Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds







	None.










	Item 3.  Default Upon Senior Securities







	None.










	Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures







	Not Applicable.

	 Forward-Looking Statements



	 



	Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations.  Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements of the Registrant to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.  The Registrants plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving it continuing as a going concern and executing on its stated business plan and objectives.  Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Registrant.  Although the Registrant believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate.  In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Registrant or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Registrant will be achieved.







	As used in this Quarterly Report, the terms "we", "us", "our", "Blue Water", Registrant, and Issuer mean Blue Water Bar & Grill, Inc. (formerly Stream Flow Media, Inc.) unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

	BLUE WATER BAR & GRILL, INC.





	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	June 30, 2016


	(unaudited)









	NOTE 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies







	Organization






	Blue Water Bar & Grill, Inc. (

	Company

	 or 

	Blue Water

	) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on June 27, 2013 under the name Stream Flow Media, Inc.  The Company amended its Articles of Incorporation on October 14, 2015 to change its name to Blue Water Bar & Grill, Inc.  The Company is currently developing a chain of casual dining restaurants in popular tourist destinations throughout the Caribbean region under the Blue Water Bar & Grill brand name.






	Unaudited Interim Financial Information






	The unaudited condensed interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (

	GAAP

	) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.


	 


	The condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from audited financial statements.


	 


	Operating results for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Companys Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 7, 2016.






	Basis of Presentation






	The Company is currently developing a chain of casual dining restaurants in popular tourist destinations throughout the Caribbean region under the Blue Water Bar & Grill brand.





	The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, there is no assurance that once open the Companys restaurants will be well received or that the Company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund continued operations.


	 


	The above factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.





	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Blue Water Bar & Grill, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Blue Water Bar & Grill, N.V. (hereafter referred collectively as the 

	Company

	 or 

	Blue Water

	).





	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.






	Use of Estimates






	The accompanying financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.  Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment.  Actual results may vary from these estimates.









	8














	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no cash equivalents.






	Property, Plant and Equipment






	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 3 to 20 years.  Leasehold improvements and leased equipment are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement or equipment.





	On June 30, 2016 the Company incurred a one-time write-off of $644,115 to reflect the full impairment of the unfinished St. Maarten Blue Water Bar & Grill in Indigo Bay.  Indigo Bay no longer desired the Company to complete this restaurant project.  Instead Indigo Bay intends to demolish the unfinished restaurant building and construct a 450 room all-inclusive hotel on the entire beach front area.  Rather than get into a lengthy and costly legal battle with an uncertain outcome, the Company determined its long-term interests would be best served by fully impairing this project and preserving its working capital for new opportunities.






	Fair Value of Financial Instruments






	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  It establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.  A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  It prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:




















	Level





	 





	Description







	 




	 




	 






	Level 1




	 




	Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.






	Level 2




	 




	Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.






	Level 3




	 




	Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.










	The estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments as of June 30, 2016 are as follows:

	Net Loss per Share Calculation






	Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.   Diluted earnings per shares is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.  As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding.






	Revenue Recognition






	The Company follows the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 605 for revenue recognition.  In general, the Company recognizes revenue on four basic criteria that must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.  Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectability of those fees.  Revenue is generally recognized at the time of sale and is expected to consist of sales of food, beverages and general merchandise and souvenirs.






	Income Taxes






	The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes.  Under FASB ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes.  The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences.


	 


	The Company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets.  The Company establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration the Companys financial position and results of operations for the current period.  Future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period under the Federal tax laws.


	 


	Changes in circumstances, such as the Company generating taxable income, could cause a change in judgment about its ability to realize the related deferred tax asset.  Any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change in estimate.






	Fiscal Year






	The Company elected December 31st for its fiscal year end.









	10














	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	There are various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.






	NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN






	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements during six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company has not established a source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs, and as such, has incurred an operating loss since its inception.  Further, as of June 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated net loss of ($1,542,294).  These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.





	The Companys existence is dependent upon managements ability to develop profitable operations and to obtain additional sources of financing. There can be no assurance that the Companys financing efforts will result in profitable operations or the resolution of the Companys liquidity problems. The accompanying statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.






	NOTE 3  STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY







	Preferred stock



	 


	The Company has authorized 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value.

	 

	The Companys Board of Directors is authorized, without further action by the shareholders, to issue shares of preferred stock and to fix the designations, number, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences and sinking fund terms.





	On November 2, 2015, the Companys board of directors designated 250,000 shares of preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock at $0.001 par value.  Series A Preferred Stock ranks superior to all other classes of stock including common and other future classes of preferred in regard to liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. The Series A Preferred Stock shall participate in all legal dividends declared by the board of directors, has 5,000 votes per share in all voting matters, and is convertible and redeemable by the Company into shares of common stock at a ratio of 5,000 shares of common stock for each share of Series A Preferred.





	On November 2, 2015, the Company issued 97,625 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Taurus Financial Partners, LLC (

	Taurus

	) as payment towards outstanding accounts payable to Taurus amounting to $97,625.  This transaction was mutually rescinded retroactively by both parties on February 25, 2016 resulting in the reinstatement of $97,625 in accounts payable to Taurus.  The accounts payable balance owed to Taurus was converted into and has been accounted for as a short-term note payable to a related party.  As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, this short-term note payable had accrued $14,113 and $8,694, respectively, in imputed interest.  This imputed interest has been recorded in the financial statements as additional paid-in capital.  No shares of Series A Preferred Stock were issued hereunder.





	As of June 30, 2016, the Company had -0- shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding; there were no other shares or classes of preferred stock authorized or outstanding.

	During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 650,000 shares of its common stock for an aggregate of $102,500 in cash, or an average price of $0.1577 per share.

	As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding notes payable to Taurus Financial Partners, LLC (

	Taurus

	) aggregating $76,449 and $102,749, respectively, for expenses paid on behalf of the Company which has been accounted for as a short-term note payable to a related party.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company reduced the aggregate amount owed to Taurus by ($26,300).  Also during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company imputed $5,419 and $5 in interest, respectively.  The imputed interest has been recorded in the financial statements as additional paid-in capital.

	The Company accounted for this transaction as a common controlled acquisition.





	J. Scott Sitra, our sole officer and director, was the control person of all entities prior to and subsequent to this acquisition.  Hence, this acquisition did not result in a change of control with any of the parties involved.

	Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.  Construction in process is comprised of the accumulated costs of construction of a Blue Water Bar & Grill restaurant in St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies.





	When property and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition, is reflected in earnings.





	On June 30, 2016 the Company incurred a one-time write-off of $644,115 to reflect the full impairment of the unfinished St. Maarten Blue Water Bar & Grill in Indigo Bay.  Indigo Bay no longer desired the Company to complete this restaurant project.  Instead Indigo Bay intends to demolish the unfinished restaurant building and construct a 450 room all-inclusive hotel on the entire beach front area.  Rather than get into a lengthy and costly legal battle with an uncertain outcome, the Company determined its long-term interests would be best served by fully impairing this project and preserving its working capital for new opportunities.


	 


	Depreciation expense was $-0- and $-0- for the periods ended June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.






	NOTE 6  CONTINGENCY/LEGAL






	As of June 30, 2016, and during the preceding ten years, no director, person nominated to become a director or executive officer, or promoter of the Company has been involved in any legal proceeding that would require disclosure hereunder.





	From time to time, the Company may become subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities.  However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties for which the outcome cannot be predicted.  Any adverse result in these or other legal matters could arise and cause harm to the Companys business.  The Company currently is not party to any claim or litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to the Company, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys business.






	NOTE 7  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS






	During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, Blue Water Global Group, Inc. paid $11,200 and $32,686, respectively, in expenses on behalf of the Company.  Since inception on July 27, 2013, Blue Water Global Group paid an aggregate of $621,003 in expenses on behalf of the Company before it went out of business.  These expenses were included in the financial statements under Additional Paid-In Capital.





	On December 15, 2015 we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares (comprised of 30 common shares with a par value of $100 per share) of Blue Water Bar & Grill, N.V., a St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies limited liability company from Blue Water Global Group, Inc., a related party.  These shares were valued at an aggregate of $3,000, or $100 per share, which was paid by Taurus Financial Partners, LLC (

	Taurus

	), a related party.  This transaction was accounted for as a common controlled acquisition.





	As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding notes payable to Taurus Financial Partners, LLC (

	Taurus

	) aggregating $76,449 and $102,749, respectively, for expenses paid on behalf of the Company which has been accounted for as a short-term note payable to a related party.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company reduced the aggregate amount owed to Taurus by ($26,300).  Also during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company imputed $5,419 and $5 in interest, respectively.  The imputed interest has been recorded in the financial statements as additional paid-in capital.





	During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had a note payable to a related party stockholder in the amount of $100.  This note was paid in full on December 4, 2015.  During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 this note accrued $11 in imputed interest that has been recorded in the financial statements as additional paid-in capital.

	NOTE 8  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS






	Subsequent to the fiscal period ended June 30, 2016, the Company sold and transferred its 30 shares of Blue Water Bar & Grill, N.V. to an unrelated third party on July 1, 2016 in exchange for the assumption of $15,000 in outstanding accounts payable.  The Company no longer has a vested interest or affiliation with Blue Water Bar & Grill, N.V.





	On July 14, 2016, the Company sold 200,000 shares of its common stock in exchange for $50,000 in cash, or $0.25 per share.  This equity sale was made pursuant to an effective Registration Statement on Form S-1 (SEC File No. 333-209989) and bore no restrictive legend.





	No other material events or transactions have occurred during this subsequent event reporting period which required recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.

	Item 2.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations







	Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion in their audit report dated March 7, 2016, which can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (

	SEC

	) on March 7, 2016.  This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next 12 months.  We do not anticipate generating significant revenues until we are able to open our first restaurant.  Accordingly, we must raise additional cash from sources other than operations.





	To meet our need for cash we are continually exploring new sources of financing, including raising funds through a secondary public offering, a private placement of securities and/or loans.  If we are unable to secure additional financing, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely.





	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other information included in this Quarterly Report as filed with the SEC on Form 10-Q.






	Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital






	There is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance.  We are an emerging growth business with limited operating history.  We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations.  Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns, such as increases in marketing costs, increases in administration expenditures associated with daily operations, increases in accounting and audit fees, and increases in legal fees related to filings and regulatory compliance.


	 


	To become profitable and competitive, we have to successfully open operating restaurant properties throughout the Caribbean region.  We anticipate relying on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations until we are able to generate sufficient revenues to cover our operating expenses, which may never happen.  Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our then existing stockholders.  There is no assurance that we will be able to make any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities.


	 


	We are continually exploring new sources of financing to meet our need for additional cash, including raising funds through sales of our equity securities and loans.  We cannot provide any assurances that our efforts to secure additional financing will be successful.  We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms.  If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations.  Further, future equity financing could result in additional and substantial dilution to existing shareholders.






	Plan of Operations






	Blue Water was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on June 27, 2013 under the name Stream Flow Media, Inc.  We amended our Articles of Incorporation on October 14, 2015 to change our name to Blue Water Bar & Grill, Inc.  Subsequent to the name change, Blue Water acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Blue Water Bar & Grill, N.V., a St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies limited liability company, on December 15, 2015.  Presently we are developing a chain of casual dining restaurants in popular tourist destinations throughout the Caribbean region under the Blue Water Bar & Grill brand name.






	The projected costs and other related expenses are estimates made by our management and our actual costs related to opening our proposed restaurants may differ significantly.






	In addition to the foregoing, and unless otherwise noted, all of the cost estimates and forecasts throughout our business plan are mere estimates made by our management.  Our actual costs related to opening and operating the proposed restaurants may differ significantly from our estimates, which could have a negative impact on our overall business, cause our business to fail, and result in you losing all of your investment.

	Blue Water Bar & Grill






	The Blue Water Bar & Grill restaurant concept is the

	Perfectly Caribbean

	SM


	experience featuring a casual, open air Caribbean themed restaurant designed to offer customers a distinctive and relaxing island dining experience.  Central to each restaurant will be a large covered outside patio area where customers can enjoy their drinks and food while overlooking a beautiful water view.  The patio area will feature an inviting island styled walk up (and in some cases, swim up) bar and a small stage area for live musical performances by local musicians and dancing.  Each restaurant will have an open aired kitchen so customers can see their food being prepared.





	Each restaurant will begin serving breakfast at 7am.  On weekends the restaurant will promote an American styled breakfast buffet and feature a do-it-yourself Bloody Mary station.  Lunch service will commence at 11am and will feature handmade burgers, gourmet sandwiches and salads, and Caribbean jerk styled dishes.  Dinner service will start at 5pm and will feature hand-cut aged Certified Angus steaks and prime rib, fresh seafood caught by local fishermen, hand tossed pizzas, and specialty homemade desserts.  The restaurant will close at 11pm nightly and the bar will close later at the managers discretion.





	During weekdays the bar will host a daily happy hour (4pm  6pm) that will offer reduced priced drinks and appetizer specials.  When the sun sets the patio will be outlined by tiki torches, which will promote a fun nighttime island atmosphere while helping ward off unwanted insects such as mosquitoes.





	In addition, each restaurant will offer its customers specialty drinks in souvenir glasses, mugs, and shot glasses that come with the drink.  These items, along with fun and unique t-shirts and other souvenirs, will be available for retail purchase in a separate souvenir hut that will be approximately 130 square feet in size.  These souvenir items will be primarily marketed to the tourist customers.  Based on our preliminary discussions with an importer of these types of souvenir items, we estimate selling this merchandise at a 300% - 600% retail markup, depending on the particular item.






	Keys for Success






	To better achieve our business objectives and successfully compete with other restaurants, we have developed the following focal points and strategies we anticipate implementing in all of our future restaurants:






	Create a Fun, Energetic, Destination Drinking and Dining Experience

	.  We wish to create and promote a fun and socially open atmosphere whereby our customers can, if they choose to do so, openly interact with one another.  Topics of discussion and frequent interest will often center around where each other is from, what activities have they done while on the island, and giving and receiving recommendations for future activities while on the island; sometimes the floor and bar staff will participate in these discussions and offer their own words of advice.  We intend to accomplish this by utilizing sectional floor and foot traffic planning, whereby the bar area will promote social interaction among customers, a stage area will feature local live entertainment performers to create a lively and festive atmosphere, and more intimate dining tables will be located further in the back to provide separation for those who just wish to dine alone and enjoy the island atmosphere.  We believe that if we are successful at achieving this goal, new customers  tourists, local ex-patriots and native locals alike  will become repeat, or regular, customers and subsequently promote the restaurant by word-of-mouth to their friends and family.






	Distinctive Concept

	.  In each restaurant we wish to create a fun and consistent experience for our customers centered around our full bar service, dining offerings, and daily entertainment.  The restaurants concept will be carried throughout our customers entire visit and will involve all aspects of the experience, including the exterior design of the building, interior layout and decorum, employee greetings and uniforms, specialty drinks and menu items, and fun and creative souvenirs such as interestingly shaped drink glasses and bright and flamboyant t-shirts that can remind the customer of their vacation or make an excellent gift for someone back home.






	Comfortable Adult Atmosphere

	.  Our restaurants will be primarily adult orientated.  While children will be welcomed during daytime hours as long as they are accompanied by a responsible adult at all times during their visit, no one under 21 years of age (or the minimum legal drinking age as established by statute) will be allowed into our restaurants after 10pm.  We believe that this policy will help maintain a fun and relaxed atmosphere that appeals to adult customers, and will help attract groups such as private parties and business organizations.






	High Standard of Customer Service

	.  Because service is one the key areas restaurants differentiate themselves from one another  and a constant source of either compliments or complaints from customers  we intend to foster a high level of customer service among our employees, ranging from the general manager to the greeters, through intense training (cross






	17













	training for all manager level employees and a one-week training course, complete with required testing on all food and drink offerings, operational procedures, and computer checkout for all other employees), constant monitoring (from the on-duty manager and surprise visits from secret shoppers), and emphasizing consideration of our customers first and foremost in all decisions.  From the moment a customer walks into the front door, we want them to experience a high level of guest service provided by a knowledgeable, energetic staff.  Bar tenders will be required to be able to free pour simultaneously from multiple liquor bottles and perform flare techniques (flipping, tossing, and twirling of liquor bottles) for our customers entertainment; greeters and servers will be required to introduce customers to the concept, explain the drink and entree menus and daily specials, and generally set the stage for a fun and memorable experience for them.






	Provide Dining Value

	.  We believe that our restaurants should provide our customers with interesting, high quality, and generously portioned (covering the entire plate) menu items that are aesthetically appealing and result in the customer leaving fully satisfied.  Complementing the dining aspect, we intend to offer the customer a unique variety of original drinks, each designed to perpetuate and immerse the customer in the restaurants overall concept.  It is our goal to generate at least a US$28 average check per guest, inclusive of food and drinks.  We estimate that our overall gross sales will be comprised of 65% food and 35% drinks.  We anticipate achieving and maintaining a 30% food cost and 18% liquor cost, which relates to our actual cost of the product compared to the gross revenue the product generates.  For example, if we sold a fish entree for $20 our actual cost would be $6 and our gross profit would be $14.  Prices for entrees will start at around $12 for a hamburger and rise to $42 for a prime rib steak dinner; prices for drinks will start at $3 for beer, $6 for basic well mixed drinks, and $8 for specialty drinks.  These price points are competitive with the existing restaurants our management team has scouted in the Simpson Bay area of St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies, where we intend to open our first Blue Water Bar & Grill that will cater to the tourist and local ex-patriot alike.





	It is important to note that although we aspire to operate at or below the above food and liquor costs, we cannot guarantee that we will ever achieve such food or liquor costs or, if achieved, will be able to maintain them.






	Operations and Management






	Our ability to effectively manage an operation including high volume restaurants (annual gross sales of US$1,000,000 or more) with live entertainment offerings is critical to our overall success.  In order to maintain quality and consistency at each of our future restaurants we must carefully train and properly supervise our personnel and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation, entertainment productions and equipment, and maintenance of the restaurant facilities.  We believe our current management is capable of overseeing our planned growth over the next two years.  While staffing levels will vary from restaurant to restaurant depending on actual sales volumes, we anticipate our typical restaurant management staff to be comprised of a general manager, a kitchen manager (who also serves as the head chef) and a bar manager (who also serves as the head bartender); the kitchen manager and bar manager will also act as assistant general managers when the general manager is off-duty and will receive a slightly higher base salary compared to our other chefs and bartenders to compensate for their added responsibilities.






	Recruiting

	.  We will actively recruit and select individuals who share our passion for customer service.  Our selection process includes testing and multiple interviews to aid in the selection of new employees, regardless of their prospective position.  We will offer a competitive compensation plan to our managers that includes a base salary, bonuses for achieving performance objectives, and possibly incentive stock options once they have worked for us for at least one full year.  For example, the general manager in our initial Blue Water Bar & Grill restaurant will most likely be offered a base salary of $3,500 a month, plus up to $1,000 a month in additional performance incentives for achieving minimum gross sales and exceeding the minimum targeted food, liquor, and labor costs, as determined by our executive management team.  In addition, all employees are entitled to discount meals at any of our future restaurants.






	Training

	.  We believe that proper training is the key to exceptional customer service.  Each new management hire will go through an extensive training program, which will include cross-training in all management duties.  All non-management new hires will go through a standard training program where they will learn and be tested on all of our food and drink offerings, operational procedures, and our point-of-sale (POS) computer system.






	Management Information Systems (MIS)

	.  All of our future restaurants will be equipped with a variety of integrated management information systems.  These systems will include an easy-to-use point-of-sale (POS) computer system which facilitates the movement of customer food and drink orders between the customer areas and kitchen and bar operations, controls cash, handles credit card authorizations, keeps track of sales on a per employee basis for incentive awards purposes, and provides on-site and executive level management with real-time sales and inventory data.  Additionally, we intend to implement a centralized accounting system that will include a food cost program and a labor scheduling and tracking program.  Physical inventories of food and drink items will be performed on a weekly basis.  Further, daily, weekly, and






	18













	monthly financial information will be provided to executive level management for analysis and comparison to our budget and to comparable restaurants.  By closely monitoring each restaurants gross sales, cost of sales, labor, and other cost trends we will be better able to control our costs, inventory levels, and identify problems with individual operations, if any, early on.






	Secret Shopper

	.  Because we believe exceptional customer service is paramount to our success, we intend to implement a secret shopper program to monitor the quality control at all of our future restaurants.  Secret shoppers are independent persons who test the quality of our food, drink, and service as paying customers without the knowledge of the restaurants management or employees.  Secret shoppers then report their unbiased experiences to our executive level management.






	Long-Term Growth Plan (5 Years)






	Over the next five years we plan to focus on a disciplined growth strategy of opening one new Blue Water Bar & Grill restaurant each year.  We have also identified the following Caribbean islands we intend to eventually open a Blue Water Bar & Grill restaurant:





	·


	St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies


	·


	Aruba, Dutch West Indies;


	·


	Nassau, Bahamas;


	·


	Cozumel, Mexico;


	·


	Grand Cayman; and


	·


	Barbados.





	We estimate that we will need to raise approximately $4 - $5 million to open all of the above proposed restaurants.  This capital will most likely be raised through the sales of additional equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders.






	Sales and Marketing






	Our marketing strategy is aimed at attracting new customers through both traditional and creative avenues.  We intend to focus on building a reputation among local customers (those living on the island) while directing our marketing efforts toward tourists staying on the island or visiting for the day on a cruise ship.  We intend to accomplish this through:





	·


	Grand opening promotions;


	 


	·


	Traditional paid advertising (e.g. radio, television, newspaper, etc.);





	·


	Free media exposure (e.g. hosting charity events, food reviews, etc.); and





	·


	Working directly with tourism bureau representatives and transportation representatives (taxi association, bus association, day sail and charter businesses, etc.).





	When opening a new Blue Water Bar & Grill restaurant we intend to host grand opening parties for local leaders, media personalities, hospitality employees such as resort and hotel staff, and tourism bureau representatives (inclusive of cruise ship industry representatives and hotel/resort industry representatives).  Our goal with courting these groups is to introduce them to our concept and court them to refer new customers to our restaurants and provide us with free future media exposure.





	Afterwards we will sustain awareness through more traditional marketing methods, including radio and television spots, newspaper ads, billboards and road signs, and resort and hotel concierge promotional cards and discount coupons.





	If our strategy is successful it will lead to word of mouth referrals, which is our ultimate goal.  This is accomplished by providing our customers with consistently excellent service and quality food and drinks.





	While we do not have a fixed marketing budget, we do anticipate launching each new restaurant with a marketing blitz campaign and tapering it down to less than 5% of the restaurants annual gross sales once it is sufficiently established with regular and recurring revenue.


	 






	19














	Financing






	We estimate that we will need to generate at least $1.0 million in additional financing in order to meet our planned 2016 capital expenditures.  Further, in order to proceed with our long-term plans, we anticipate that we will need to generate at least between $4 and $5 million in additional long-term financing.  





	Without limiting our available options, future financings will most likely be through the sale of additional shares of our common stock.  It is possible that we could also offer warrants, options and/or rights in conjunction with any future issuances of our common stock.  However, we can give no assurance that financing will be available to us, and if available to us, in amounts or on terms acceptable to us.  If we are unable to generate profits or unable to obtain additional funds to meet our working capital needs, we may need to cease or curtail our business operations.  Further, there is no assurance that the net proceeds from any successful financing arrangement will be sufficient to cover our projected expenditures over the next 12 months.






	Government Regulation






	The restaurant industry is subject to many various laws which directly affect our organization and planned operations.  Each restaurant we open must comply with various licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which typically include health, safety and fire authorities in the municipality where our restaurant is located.  The development and operation of a successful restaurant depends upon selecting and acquiring a suitable location, which is normally subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic, and other regulations.  Further, our operations will also be subject to various laws governing such matters as wages, health insurance requirements, working conditions, citizenship and work permit requirements, and mandatory overtime pay, all of which will directly affect our labor costs.





	Additionally, because we anticipate a significant portion of our revenue to be generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages, we must comply with any and all regulations governing their sale.  Typically this requires the proper licensing at each restaurant location (in many cases it needs to be renewed on an annual basis).  Such licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time.  These regulations often relate to many aspects of the restaurant, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.   The failure of any of our future restaurants to obtain and retain such a license would limit its ability to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability at that particular location, which could subsequently impact our businesss overall revenues and ability to achieve (and if achieved, maintain) profitability.






	Compliance with Environmental Laws






	We have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any expenses associated with environmental laws.






	Patents and Trademarks






	We are presently using the following trademarks and service marks Blue Water Bar & Grill and Perfectly Caribbean.  We have not taken any steps to register either of these marks.






	Property and Equipment






	Our principal executive office is located at Wellsburg Street #7, Cole Bay, St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies.

	Exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies;


	 


	·


	Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;





	·


	Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings;





	·


	Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and





	·


	Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements.





	In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering ("

	IPO

	") of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of:





	(i)


	the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,


	 


	(ii)


	the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company's IPO;





	(iii)


	the company's issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or





	(iv)


	the company becoming a "larger accelerated filer" as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.





	The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact Blue Water are discussed below.






	Financial Disclosure

	. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:





	(i)


	audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years;


	 


	(ii)


	selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited; and





	(iii)


	executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies. (A smaller reporting company is one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter)





	However, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. Blue Water is a smaller reporting company.  Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.






	21
















	The JOBS Act also exempts the company's independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("

	PCAOB

	") after the date of the JOBS Act's enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.





	The JOBS Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the company's accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.






	Internal Control Attestation

	.  The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the company's independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the company's internal control over financial reporting, although management of the company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the company's internal control over financial reporting.





	Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.






	Other Items of the JOBS Act

	.  The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement.  The JOBS Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision.  In addition the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company IPO.





	Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Securities Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show.  This is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.






	Election to Opt Out of Transition Period

	.  Section 102(b) (1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.





	The JOBS Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable.  Blue Water has elected not to opt out of the transition period pursuant to Section 107(b).

	Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015







	Revenues

	.  We did not generate any revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.






	Operating Expenses

	.  Our total operating expenses for six months ended June 30, 2016 were $124,936 compared to $70,857 for the six months ended June 30, 2015, which represents an increase of $54,079, or 76.3%.  The increase in operating expenses are the result of general cost increases related to our complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements, which have consisted primarily of legal, accounting and outside consulting fees.






	Loss From Operations

	.  We generated a loss of ($124,936) from operations during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to an operating loss of ($70,857) during the six months ended June 30, 2015, which represents an increase of $54,079, or 76.3%.  The increase in loss from operations the result of general cost increases related to our complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements, which have consisted primarily of legal, accounting and outside consulting fees.






	Other income (expenses)

	.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 we recorded ($649,534) and ($5), respectively, in other expenses.  These other expenses were comprised of a ($644,115) one-time write-off related to the impairment of a restaurant project and ($5,419) in imputed interest during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and ($5) in imputed interest during the six months ended June 30, 2015.  The imputed interest was recorded in our financial statements under additional paid-in capital.






	Net Loss

	.  We realized a net loss of ($774,470) during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of ($70,862) during the six months ended June 30, 2015, which represents an increase of $703,608, or 992.9%.  The increase in net loss is the result of a ($644,115) one-time write-off related to the impairment of a restaurant project and general cost increases related to our complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements, which have consisted primarily of legal, accounting and outside consulting fees.






	Total Stockholders Deficit

	.  Our stockholders deficit was ($248,067) as of June 30, 2016.






	Liquidity and Capital Resources






	As of June 30, 2016, we had assets totaling $19,043, which was comprised solely of cash.





	As of June 30, 2016, we had total liabilities of ($267,110), which consisted of accounts payable of ($190,661) and a short-term related party payable due to Taurus Financial Partners, LLC for ($76,449).  Further, we had no external credit facilities (i.e. bank loans, revolving lines of credit, etc.), but are continuing to explore the possibility of obtaining such a credit facility from a traditional lending institution.





	We expect to incur continued losses through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, possibly even longer.  We estimate that we will need to generate at least $1.0 million in additional financing in order to meet our planned 2016 capital expenditures.  Further, in order to proceed with our long-term plans, we anticipate that we will need to generate at least between $4 and $5 million in additional long-term financing.





	Without limiting our available options, future financings will most likely be through the sale of additional shares of our common stock.  It is possible that we could also offer warrants, options and/or rights in conjunction with any future issuances of our common stock.  However, we can give no assurance that financing will be available to us, and if available to us, in amounts or on terms acceptable to us.  If we cannot secure adequate financing we may be forced to cease operations and you will lose your entire investment.









	23














	Going Concern Consideration






	Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion in their audit report dated March 7, 2016, which can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (

	SEC

	) on March 7, 2016.  This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next 12 months.






	Off Balance Sheet Operations






	As of June 30, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet activities or operations.






	Critical Accounting Policies







	Use of Estimates






	The accompanying financial statements of Blue Water have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.  Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment.  Actual results may vary from these estimates.






	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, Blue Water considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Blue Water had no cash equivalents.






	Fair Value of Financial Instruments






	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  It establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.  A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  It prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:




















	Level





	 





	Description







	 




	 




	 






	Level 1




	 




	Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.






	Level 2




	 




	Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.






	Level 3




	 




	Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

	Net Loss per Share Calculation






	Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.   Diluted earnings per shares is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.  During the periods ended June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 Blue Water had no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding.






	Revenue Recognition






	Blue Water recognizes revenue on four basic criteria that must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.  Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on Managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectability of those fees.









	25














	Income Taxes






	Blue Water accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes.  Under FASB ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes.  The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences.


	 


	Blue Water maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets.  Blue Water establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration Blue Waters financial position and results of operations for the current period.  Future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period under the Federal tax laws.


	 


	Changes in circumstances, such as Blue Water generating taxable income, could cause a change in judgment about its ability to realize the related deferred tax asset.  Any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change in estimate.






	Election to Use Extended Transitional Period Under Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (



	JOBS Act



	)






	We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act, that allows us to delay the  adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies.  As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.






	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	There are various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on Blue Water's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.






	Contractual Obligations






	As of June 30, 2016 Blue Water had no contractual obligations.







	Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk







	Not applicable since we are a smaller reporting company.







	Item 4.  Controls and Procedures








	Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	For the period covered by this report we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and sole director, J. Scott Sitra, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act).





	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be presented or detected on a timely basis.





	Based on managements assessment, we have concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in timely alerting management to the material information relating to us required to be included in our annual and interim filings with the SEC.





	Management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures had the following material weaknesses:





	·


	We were unable to maintain any segregation of duties within our financial operations due to our reliance on limited personnel in the finance function.  While this control deficiency has not resulted in any audit adjustments to our interim or annual financial statements, it could have resulted in a material misstatement that might have been prevented or detected by a segregation of duties;






	26













	 


	·


	Blue Water lacks sufficient resources to perform the internal audit function and does not have an Audit Committee;





	·


	We do not have an independent Board of Directors, nor do we have a board member designated as an independent financial expert to Blue Water.  The Board of Directors is comprised of one (1) member who also serves as Blue Waters principal executive officer.  As a result, there is a lack of independent oversight of the management team, lack of independent review of our operating and financial results, and lack of independent review of disclosures made by Blue Water; and





	·


	Documentation of all proper accounting procedures is not yet complete.





	These weaknesses have existed since our inception on June 27, 2013 and, as of June 30, 2016, have not been remedied.





	To the extent reasonably possible given our limited resources, we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned material weaknesses, including, but not limited to, the following:





	·


	Considering the engagement of consultants to assist in ensuring that accounting policies and procedures are consistent across the organization and that we have adequate control over financial statement disclosures;


	 


	·


	Hiring additional qualified financial personnel, including a Chief Financial Officer, on a full-time basis;





	·


	Expanding our current board of directors to include additional independent individuals willing to perform directorial functions; and





	·


	Increasing our workforce in preparation for exiting the development stage and commencing revenue producing operations.





	Since the recited remedial actions will require that we hire or engage additional personnel, these material weaknesses may not be overcome in the near-term due to our limited financial resources.  Until such remedial actions can be realized, we will continue to rely on the limited advice of outside professionals and consultants.






	Changes in Controls and Procedures






	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.











	PART II










	Item 1.  Legal Proceedings







	During the past ten years no director, person nominated to become a director or executive officer, or promoter of Blue Water has been involved in any legal proceeding that would require disclosure hereunder.





	From time to time, we may become subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities.  However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties for which the outcome cannot be predicted.  Any adverse result in these or other legal matters could arise and cause harm to our business.  We currently are not party to any claim or litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business.

	5.


	The Registrants other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Registrants auditors and the audit committee of Registrants board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):





	a)


	all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrants ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and


	 


	b)


	any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrants internal control over financial reporting.
