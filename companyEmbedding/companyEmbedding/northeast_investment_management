Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (9.75% upside)

Important Notice
May 19, 2017
Dear Fellow Shareholder:
For more than 30 years, Northeast Investors Growth Fund (the “Fund”) has sought to help shareholders build and preserve wealth. The Fund has survived market fluctuations, wide economic swings and a myriad of domestic and foreign political upheavals. Our mission has always been to consider first and foremost the long-term interest of our shareholders. In keeping with this mission, on May 18, 2017, the Board of Trustees of the Fund (the “Board”) approved the involuntary redemption of all the Fund’s shares outstanding as of June 29, 2017. The Board also approved the subsequent liquidation and dissolution of the Fund.  

For some time, the Fund’s investment advisor, Northeast Management and Research Co., Inc. (the “Advisor”) and the Board have been monitoring the Fund’s size and have taken many steps to reduce the Fund’s expenses.  The death of Billy Oates, the sole owner of the Advisor and President of the Fund, accelerated this discussion.  The Board approved an interim contract allowing the Advisor to continue managing the Fund through July 14, 2017.  However, in order to continue managing the Fund after that date, a meeting of the shareholders and subsequent vote to approve a new investment advisory agreement is required. The estimated cost of this effort would be high relative to the size of the Fund and such cost would be borne by the Fund’s shareholders. The Advisor and the Board considered alternatives to the Fund’s liquidation, including the possibility of the Advisor’s acquisition and the Fund’s combination with another mutual fund, but the Board determined that the Fund’s liquidation was in the best interests of the shareholders. Additionally, as you the shareholder know, the Fund is not part of a larger fund complex. It is a stand-alone Fund that does not afford investors different investment opportunities, making it less attractive to new investors. Finally, increasing regulatory burdens and associated costs of operating mutual funds have made it very difficult for the Fund to compete with larger funds that have the scale to manage these costs. After careful consideration, the Advisor recommended liquidation to the Board and the Board concluded that liquidation was in the best interest of the shareholders.  

Prior to June 29, 2017, shareholders may continue to redeem their shares at their net asset value in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Fund’s Prospectus. 
All shareholders will receive a package in the mail which will include this letter and a Transaction Request form with instructions on how to redeem their shares. IRA owners will receive this letter and an IRA Distribution form plus additional information regarding their redemption options.
All shares that are not redeemed prior to June 29, 2017 will be involuntarily redeemed at their net asset value on that date without any approval or action of shareholders.
We thank you for the time that you were a shareholder of the Fund and remind you that we at Northeast Management and Research Company, Inc. and our affiliated investment adviser, Northeast Investment Management, Inc., remain committed to providing a high level of service to all of our clients. If you have any questions, please call us at 1-855-755-6344 Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time or visit our website at www.northeastinvestorsgrowthfund.com.
Sincerely,
Nancy M. Mulligan
President
