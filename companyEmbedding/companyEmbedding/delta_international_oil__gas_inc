The Delta Board of Directors appreciates the time and efforts expended by Mr. Sherman over the past two years that Malcolm has served as CEO during the transition after the loss of Dr. Peralta.

Smith Chairman.
"Santiago Peralta will serve as the interim CEO until we have sufficient time to conclude some current business opportunities that Malcolm has uncovered for the Company," stated Phillips W. Smith.

The common shares of the Company are currently listed on the OTCC Market (symbol: DLTZ ). For further details on the Company readers are referred to the Company's web site (www.deltamutual.com), and to the United States regulatory filings on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.

Welcome to Delta International Oil & Gas Inc.
If this is your first visit to our website, welcome!
Delta International Oil & Gas Inc. is in the beginning stage of executing a new US-based energy strategy with the following core principles:

 
In the past, Delta had primarily focused on Oil and Gas properties in Argentina due to the transfer of power in Argentina regarding Oil and Gas leases from the Federal Government to the Provinces. By placing control locally in the various Provinces, Delta was able to acquire several Concessions in the Northern Province of Salta. Five of the concessions owned partially by Delta saw exploratory and work-over drills during this time.
Currently, Delta is using its expertise in oil and gas to acquire exciting properties in the US that have been overlooked. With the new strategy in place, Delta is expecting to acquire new assets every year that each fulfills a number of the target criteria, but as a whole complement each other to create a more crisis-resistant portfolio with adequate growth for our shareholders. 
Looking further into the future, Delta has chosen to make small investments into water-related technology companies that could prove revolutionary for the industry. 
We will publish new information on the Company website, as it becomes available, to keep our Shareholders apprised of our continuing endeavors to grow the Company.

Delta International Oil And Gas, Inc. Invests In Second Chance Oil For Reworks In California









PR Newswire




Jun 2, 2017 10:27 AM EDT













 


















































  SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., June 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Delta International Oil and Gas, Inc. (OTCQB: DLTZ) ("Delta") is pleased to announce that it has closed its first investment in Second Chance Oil (SCO). The investment was made via an 18-month 9% Promissory Note. Additionally, Delta will hold a 3.5% equity interest in Second Chance Oil. This note is intended to fund the first two rework gas wells that SCO has proposed to drill in June on a northern California property. The wells have historically produced from the lower formation- the K1- leaving other formations untouched. The first rework will cap the current production from the K1 reservoir, and will perforate two other reservoirs- that have not produced yet. The second rework will follow a similar plan. SCO has already contracted Snows OilField Services to perform the workovers. "Although there may be some energy-related technology aspects that we might eventually explore, there are E&P opportunities here in the US that could bring the Company substantial value," stated Santiago Peralta, CEO of Delta.  "As we keep progressing in the sale of our properties in Argentina, this is an excellent first step to build a US-focused energy portfolio. We look forward to executing our inorganic growth strategy over the next 24-36 months."  About Second Chance Oil, LLC SCO is an oil and gas company that focuses on workover projects in California. Its management team is composed of geologists, drillers, and land men that have around 200 years of oil and gas experience in northern California. SCO's current project involves a potential of up to 20 workover wells in a gas field close to Sacramento that has produced over 200 BCF of natural gas and is still in production.     Forward Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which may include statements about business strategy and development plans, plans for entering new business, anticipated sources of funds, including proceeds from future operations and plans, objectives, expectations and intentions contained in the Press Release that are not historical facts such as "estimated gross…prospective resources, will be sold, etc." Because these forward looking statements involve risk and uncertainties, actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the Press Release. These risks are outlined in our SEC filings.

PR Newswire
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 5, 2016

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Delta International Oil & Gas, Inc. (OTCQB: DLTZ) is pleased to announce its acquisition of a 10% interest in MHD Technology Corporation through its wholly owned subsidiary Neptune Industries LLC.
MHD Technology is developing a cutting edge water transportation and desalination technology.  MHD Technology's next steps are to perform a simulation of its product and then to build the first prototype. Delta's subsidiary, Neptune Industries, will initially be involved in both of these steps as well as in some administrative capacity. The technology developed will lower desalination plant operating costs by drastically reducing the energy requirements of the desalination process, as well as the water transportation costs.  
The technology is expected to be ready for commercial application by the third quarter of 2016. Once the initial steps are finished, Delta's subsidiary will take on more of a distributor role. "The energy industry is currently focused on small efficiency gains," Mr. Santiago Peralta, CEO of Delta, mentioned, "this investment has the potential to be a major disruptor. And water transportation is just the beginning." 
About Delta International Oil & Gas, Inc.
Delta International Oil & Gas, Inc., headquartered in Scottsdale, AZ is an International company specializing in energy. The Company holds interests in exploratory oil and gas blocks in Argentina and explores them via joint ventures. Delta's investment in MHD Technology helps broaden Delta's reach in the energy field.  
About MHD Technology Corporation
MHD Technology Corporation is a New York company that seeks to apply its patented technology in MagnetoHydroDynamics to water pipelines in the continental US.  The company will license this technology to desalination plants in order to reduce their expenses of desalination and transportation.

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Delta International Oil & Gas Inc. (OTCQB: DLTZ) ("Delta") is pleased to announce that it has signed a Letter of Intent ("LOI")  to acquire Naptech Test Equipment, Inc. ("Naptech") in collaboration with Bayberry Capital, Inc. ("Bayberry"). The signing of the LOI is the first step in a strategic acquisition plan of technology companies that Delta has developed. 








Under the LOI, Delta will acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Naptech in exchange for a combination of preferred and common stock of Delta.  As part of the transaction, Bayberry Capital principals Jay Wright and Bill Forkner will become advisors to and shareholders of Delta.   Throughout the process, the current Delta shareholders will maintain control of management, the board, and the majority of the outstanding shares of the company.  Following signing the LOI, there is a 30-day due diligence period and Delta's auditors will review Naptech's financials prior to closing. Once the definitive agreement is executed and the transaction closes, Delta will invest in Naptech to help accelerate its growth. 
"We're really excited to move the company into the next step," stated Santiago Peralta, CEO of Delta.  "As we are in the process of selling our existing properties in Argentina, it will be great to have the Bayberry team with their extensive M&A expertise involved with Delta as we seek to grow the company over the next 24-36 months. Naptech, led by Roger Briggs, has deep IT experience and appears to be a great first candidate to work with us to execute our strategy."
About Naptech Test Equipment, Inc.
Naptech has been in the IT and Test Equipment business for over 23 years. The company focuses on providing IT services and selling enhanced test equipment to both government customers and commercial clients in industries ranging from Telecom to Utilities.  During its time in business, Naptech has generated over $70 million in total revenue with gross margins of up to 68%.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, FaucetDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require FaucetDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at FaucetDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					FaucetDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. FaucetDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, FaucetDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require FaucetDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at FaucetDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					FaucetDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. FaucetDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, FaucetDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require FaucetDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at FaucetDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					FaucetDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. FaucetDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.
