ShareConditions Commonly Seen in PatientsThe following information is provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for the year 2014 and depicts the rates of sixteen chronic conditions found in Dr. Dei's Medicare patients. It should be noted that the prevalence of conditions listed below may not be characteristic of the provider's entire patient population, and in some cases information has been redacted from the original data source to protect patient information.Most Frequently SeenMoreMost Frequently SeenThroughout 2014, Dr. Dei saw the greatest relative rate of patients with Type 2 Diabetes (50% of Medicare patients) compared to averages for all physicians in his state, likely indicating he is experienced in managing treatment and complications associated with this condition.Overview of Type 2 Diabetes:seriousnessModerateprevalenceVery Commonmonetary costModerate

There are two types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 2 diabetes is caused either by the pancreas not producing enough insulin, or the body becoming resistant to the insulin that the pancreas does produce. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes result in blood sugar levels that are too high, which can lead to serious health complications.

Full Description


Diabetes mellitus is an incurable condition where a person’s blood sugar levels can become too high.  In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce any insulin, which causes the blood sugar (glucose) levels in the body to rise dangerously high. Nerves, blood vessels, and organs in the body can be damaged when blood glucose levels are too high. By comparison, type 2 diabetes appears later in life. This page focuses on diabetes mellitus type 2.   There are two possible causes of type 2 diabetes:  the pancreas does not create enough insulin; or, the body develops a resistance to insulin   As many as 90% of diabetes cases in adults are type 2 diabetes. It is more common in adults over the age of 40 and in people of African, Afro-Caribbean, Middle Eastern, and South Asian descent.

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                N
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).

Safeway's Randall Dei Named Dairy Council of California Board Chair
Three Additional New Board Members Also Appointed




SACRAMENTO, Calif., Feb. 14, 2013 /PR Newswire/ — Adding exceptional industry experience to the list of advisers, Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture Karen Ross names Safeway executive Randall Dei chair of Dairy Council of California’s board of directors.

Crystal Creamery President and CEO Frank Otis and producers Arlene Vander Eyk of Pixley, Calif., and Gregory “Butch” Dias of Visalia, Calif., have also been appointed to the board.

Dei, Safeway’s director of U.S. ice cream/industry relations, supervises the manufacturer’s two ice cream plants and is in charge of all raw milk procurement, serving as liaison between the company and producers. He will serve a 2-year term as chairman of Dairy Council of California’s board.

“Randall grew up working on his family’s dairy farm and has spent his entire life committed to milk and dairy products,” said Tammy Anderson-Wise, Dairy Council of California CEO. “He is perfectly positioned to partner with us in our nutrition education efforts to cement dairy and its irreplaceable package of nutrients as one of the foundations of a healthy diet.”

Dei strongly believes in industry support of Dairy Council of California and its programs.

“The nutrition education programs we have in California schools are worth the investment the industry makes in Dairy Council of California because they reach more than 2 million students a year with healthy eating messages that highlight the nutritional importance of consuming milk,” said Dei. 

In addition to serving as Dairy Council of California’s board chair, Dei sits on the boards of a number of major industry organizations, including serving as a board member of the California Milk Processors Board and the International Ice Cream Association arm of International Dairy Foods Association. He is also past president of the Washington State Dairy Council and the Dairy Institute of California.  
New Board Members
New board member Otis was named head of Modesto-based Crystal Creamery in April 2012. The company’s products include milk, butter, ice cream, powdered milk and sour cream.

Producer Vander Eyk was raised on dairy farms and has been in business for more than 30 years. Vander Eyk also serves on the California Milk Advisory Board (CMAB).

Dias has owned Delta View Farms, a dairy and farming operation, since 1972. Dias has been involved with a number of dairy organizations, including a term as chairman of CMAB, and is currently chairman of the California Dairy Research Foundation. 

About Dairy Council of California
