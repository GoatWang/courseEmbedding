Verizon Communications, Inc. ( listen (help·info)) (/vəˈraɪzən/ və-RY-zən) (simply known as Verizon, stylized as verizon), is an American multinational telecommunications conglomerate and the largest U.S. wireless communications service provider as of September 2014[update],[7] and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[8] The company is based at 1095 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan, New York City,[2] but is incorporated in Delaware.
What eventually became Verizon was founded as Bell Atlantic, which was one of the seven Baby Bells that were formed after AT&T Corporation was forced to relinquish its control of the Bell System by order of the Justice Department of the United States.[9] Bell Atlantic came into existence in 1984 with a footprint from New Jersey to Virginia, with each area having a separate operating company (consisting of New Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone, and C&P Telephone).
As part of the rebranding that the Baby Bells took in the mid-1990s, all of the operating companies assumed the Bell Atlantic name. In 1997, Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX. Although Bell Atlantic was the surviving company, the merged company moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to NYNEX's old headquarters in New York City.
In 2000, Bell Atlantic acquired GTE, which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic's footprint. Bell Atlantic, the surviving company, changed its name to "Verizon", a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for "truth") and horizon.[10]
As of 2016[update], Verizon is one of three companies that had their roots in the former Baby Bells. The other two, like Verizon, exist as a result of mergers among fellow former Baby Bell members. One, SBC Communications, bought out the Bells former parent AT&T Corporation and assumed the AT&T name. The other, CenturyLink, was formed initially in 2011 by the acquisition of Qwest (formerly named US West).
On June 13, 2017 Verizon announced that some of Yahoo! Inc's internet assets would be combined under a new subsidiary, Oath.[11][12]

History[edit]
Bell Atlantic (1983–2000)[edit]




Bell Atlantic's final logo used from 1997-2000






Bell Atlantic logo, 1983–1997


Bell Atlantic Corporation was created as one of the original Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) in 1984, during the breakup of the Bell System. Bell Atlantic's original roster of operating companies included:

The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania
New Jersey Bell
Diamond State Telephone
C&P Telephone (itself comprising four subsidiaries)

Bell Atlantic originally operated in the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia, as well as Washington, DC.
In 1994, Bell Atlantic became the first RBOC to entirely drop the original names of its original operating companies.
In 1996, CEO and Chairman Raymond W. Smith orchestrated Bell Atlantic's merger with NYNEX. When it merged, it moved its corporate headquarters from Philadelphia to New York City. NYNEX was consolidated into this name by 1997.
Acquisition of GTE (2000–2002)[edit]
Bell Atlantic changed its name to Verizon Communications in June 2000 when the Federal Communications Commission approved a US$64.7 billion acquisition of telephone company GTE, nearly two years after the deal was proposed in July 1998.[13] The approval came with 25 stipulations to preserve competition between local phone carriers, including investing in new markets and broadband technologies.[13] The new entity was headed by co-CEOs Charles Lee, formerly the CEO of GTE, and Bell Atlantic CEO Ivan Seidenberg.[13]
Upon the acquisition, Verizon became the largest local telephone company in the United States, operating 63 million telephone lines in 40 states.[14] The company also inherited 25 million mobile phone customers.[14] Additionally, Verizon offered internet services and long-distance calling in New York, before expanding long-distance operations to other states.[13][15]
The name Verizon derives from the combination of the words veritas, Latin for truth, and horizon.[16] The name was chosen from 8,500 candidates and the company spent $300 million on marketing the new brand.[16][17]
Two months before the FCC gave final approval on the formation of Verizon Communications, Bell Atlantic formed Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with the British telecommunications company Vodafone in April 2000.[17][18][19] The companies established Verizon Wireless as its own business operated by Bell Atlantic, which owned 55% of the venture.[18] Vodafone retained 45% of the company.[18] The deal was valued at approximately $70 billion and created a mobile carrier with 23 million customers.[17][18] Verizon Wireless merged Bell Atlantic's wireless network, Vodafone's AirTouch and PrimeCo holdings, and the wireless division of GTE.[18][20][21] Due to its size, Verizon Wireless was able to offer national coverage at competitive rates, giving it an advantage over regional providers typical of the time.[17]
During its first operational year, Verizon Wireless released Mobile Web, an Internet service that allowed customers to access partner sites such as E*Trade, ABC News, ESPN, Amazon.com, Ticketmaster and MSN,[19] as well as the "New Every Two" program, which gave customers a free phone with every two-year service contract.[22] In another partnership with MSN in 2002, Verizon Wireless launched the mobile content service "VZW with MSN" and a phone that utilized the Microsoft Windows operating system.[23]
In August 2000, approximately 85,000 Verizon workers went on an 18-day labor strike after their union contracts expired.[24][25] The strike affected quarterly revenues,[26] resulting in Verizon Wireless' postponement of the company's IPO[26] (the IPO was ultimately cancelled in 2003, because the company no longer needed to raise revenue for Verizon Wireless due to increased profits[27] ), and created a backlog of repairs.[25] Verizon launched 3G service in 2002, which doubled the Internet speeds of the time to 144kb a second.[28] In August 2002, Verizon began offering local, long-distance, and mobile calling, as well as Internet service, in a bundle. It was initially only available to customers in New York and Massachusetts.[15]
2003–2005[edit]
In June 2003, Verizon Wireless backed an FCC-issued portability requirement that permitted consumers to take their phone numbers with them across carriers.[29] The company gained 1.5 million new subscribers the following quarter, partially due to the rule change.[30] The following year, in April 2004, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added Verizon Communications to its stock market index.[31] Verizon replaced telecom competitor AT&T, which had been a part of the index since the Great Depression.[31]
On December 22, 2004, mail servers at Verizon.net were configured not to accept connections from Europe, by default, in an attempt to reduce spam email that was originating from the region. Individual domains would only be unblocked upon request.[32]
Verizon launched its FiOS Internet service, which transmits data over fiber optic cables in Keller, Texas.[33] (Since divested Frontier) The company launched FiOS TV in September 2005, also in Keller, Texas. Twenty percent of qualified homes signed up by the end of the year.[34] By January 2006, FiOS offered over 350 channels in eight states, including 20 high-definition television channels as well as video on demand.[34]
MCI acquisition[edit]
Verizon began negotiations to purchase long distance carrier MCI in 2005. MCI accepted the company's initial $6.75 billion offer in February 2005, but then received a higher offer from Qwest Communications. Verizon increased its bid to $7.6 billion (or $23.50 a share), which MCI accepted on March 29, 2005.[35] The acquisition gave the company access to MCI's one million corporate clients and international holdings, expanding Verizon's presence into global markets.[35][36] As a result, Verizon Business was established as a new division to serve the company's business and government customers.[37] The FCC approved the deal on November 5, 2005, valuing it at $8.5 billion.[38] Verizon's 2006 revenues rose by as much as 20% following the purchase.[39]
2006–2010[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that Verizon, as well as AT&T and BellSouth, had given the National Security Agency landline phone records following the September 11 attacks.[40][41] That same month, a $50 billion lawsuit was filed by two lawyers on behalf of all Verizon subscribers for privacy violations and to prevent the company from releasing additional records without consent or warrant.[40][41] Protesters staged the National Day of Out(R)age due in part to the controversy.[42] Verizon stated in 2007 that the company fulfilled only "lawful demands" for information,[43] though also acknowledged surrendering customer information to government agencies without court orders or warrants 720 times between 2005 and 2007.[44]
Verizon won a lawsuit against Vonage in March 2007 for patent infringement. The three patents named were filed by Bell Atlantic in 1997 and relate to the conversion of IP addresses into phone numbers, a key technology of Vonage's business.[45] The company was awarded US$58 million in damages and future royalties.[45] Vonage later lost an appeal and was ordered to pay Verizon $120 million.[46]
In May 2007, Verizon acquired Cybertrust, a privately held provider of global information security services.[47] This purchase represented Verizon's intent to offer security solutions to its global enterprise customers.
Verizon Wireless reversed a controversial decision in September 2007 to deny NARAL Pro-Choice America a short code through which the organization could text consumers who had signed up for messaging from the group. They had initially refused the group access to a code by reserving the right to block "controversial or unsavory" messages.[48]
In November 2007, Verizon opened its networks for the first time to third party apps and devices,[49] a decision that allowed it to participate in the FCC's 2008 700 MHz auction of "open access" spectrum.[49][50] During that auction, the company bid $9.4 billion and won the bulk of national and local licenses for airwaves reaching approximately 469 million people.[50][51] Verizon utilized the increased spectrum for its 4G service.[50]
Verizon Wireless purchased wireless carrier Alltel for $28.1 billion in June 2008. The acquisition included 13 million customers, which allowed Verizon Wireless to surpass AT&T in number of customers and reach new markets in rural areas.[52]
In October 2010, Verizon Wireless paid $77.8 million in refunds and FCC penalties for overcharging 15 million customers for data services. The company stated the overcharges were accidental and only amounted to a few dollars per customer.[53][54]
On February 4, 2010, 4chan started receiving reports from Verizon Wireless customers that they were having difficulties accessing the site's image boards. 4chan administrators found that only traffic on port 80 to the boards.4chan.org domain was affected, leading them to believe that the block was intentional. On February 7, 2010, Verizon Wireless confirmed that 4chan.org was "explicitly blocked"[55] after Verizon's security and external experts detected sweep attacks coming from an IP address associated with the 4chan network. Traffic was restored several days later.[56]
In August 2010, the chairmen of Verizon and Google agreed that network neutrality should be defined and limited.[57][58]
Verizon introduced its 4G LTE network in 38 markets in December 2010, as well as in airports in seven additional cities. The company planned on a three-year continuous expansion of the 4G service.[59]
Selling wirelines (2005–2010 & 2015)[edit]
Between 2005 and 2010, Verizon divested wireline operations in several states in order to focus on its wireless, FiOS internet and FiOS TV businesses.[39] It sold 700,000 lines in Hawaii in 2005,[39][60] and spun off lines in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in January 2007 that were then purchased by FairPoint Communications for $2.72 billion.[39] In 2009, the company spun off wirelines in 14 states into a company that then merged with Frontier Communications in a deal valued at $8.6 billion.[61] Verizon also shed its telephone directory business in 2006.[62]
In May 2009, Verizon announced that it was selling off its wireline operations in Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. And in 2015, they announced they were selling its wireline operations in Texas, Florida, and California to Frontier.[63]
2011–present[edit]




Verizon logo, 2000–2015


On January 27, 2011, Verizon acquired Terremark, an information technology services company for $1.4 billion.[64] Ivan Seidenberg stepped down as Verizon's CEO on August 1, 2011. Lowell McAdam succeeded him.[65]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Verizon for its tax avoidance procedures after it spent $52.34 million on lobbying while collecting $951 million in tax rebates between 2008 and 2010 and making a profit of $32.5 billion. The same report also criticized Verizon for increasing executive pay by 167% in 2010 for its top five executives while laying off 21,308 workers between 2008 and 2010.[66] However, in its Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2012, Verizon reported having paid more than $11.1 billion in taxes (including income, employment and property taxes) from 2009 to 2011. In addition, the company reported in the 10-K that most of the drop in employment since 2008 was due to a voluntary retirement offer.[67]
In June 2012, as part of its strategy to expand into new growth areas in its wireless business, Verizon purchased Hughes Telematics—a company that produces wireless features for automobiles—for $612 million.[68] Also in June 2012, Verizon's E-911 service failed in the aftermath of the June 2012 derecho storm in several northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., with some problems lasting several days.[69] The FCC conducted an investigation[69] and in January 2013 released a report detailing the problems that led to the failure. Verizon reported that it had already addressed or was addressing a number of the issues related to the FCC report, including the causes of generator failures, conducting audits of backup systems and making its monitoring systems less centralized,[70] although the FCC indicated that Verizon still needed to make additional improvements.[71]
In July 2012, the FCC ruled that Verizon must stop charging users an added fee for using 4G smartphones and tablets as Wi-Fi hotspots (known as "tethering"). Verizon had been charging its customers, even those with "unlimited" plans, $20 per month for tethering. As part of the settlement, Verizon made a voluntary payment of $1.25 million to the U.S. Treasury.[72]
In August 2012, the Department of Justice approved Verizon's purchase of Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum from a consortium of cable companies, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, for $3.9 billion.[73] Verizon began expanding its LTE network utilizing these extra airwaves in October 2013.[74]
On June 5, 2013, The Guardian reported it had obtained an order by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and approved by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that required Verizon to provide the NSA with telephone metadata for all calls originating in the U.S.[75][76] Verizon Wireless was not part of the NSA data collection for wireless accounts due to foreign ownership issues.[77] (see also MAINWAY article)
In September 2013, Verizon purchased the 45% stake in Verizon Wireless owned by Vodafone for $130 billion.[78] The deal closed on February 21, 2014, becoming the third largest corporate deal ever signed, giving Verizon Communications sole ownership of Verizon Wireless.[79]
On January 14, 2014, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the FCC's net neutrality rules after Verizon filed suit against them in January 2010.[80][81] In June 2016, in an 184-page ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld, by a 2–1 vote, the FCC's net neutrality rules and the FCC's determination that broadband access is a public utility, rather than a luxury. AT&T and the telecom industry said that they would seek to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.[82]
On January 22, 2014 the Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon received more than 1,000 requests for information about its subscribers on national security grounds via National Security Letters. In total, Verizon received 321,545 requests from federal, state and local law enforcement for U.S. customer information.[83] In May 2015, Verizon agreed to pay $90 million "to settle federal and state investigations into allegations mobile customers were improperly billed for premium text messages."[84]
In August 2015, Verizon launched Hum, a service and device offering vehicle diagnostic and monitoring tools for vehicles.[85] On August 1, 2016, Verizon announced its acquisition of Fleetmatics, a fleet telematics system company in Dublin, Ireland, for $2.4 billion, to build products that it offers to enterprises for logistics and mobile workforces.[86] On September 12, 2016, Verizon announced its acquisition of Sensity, a startup for LED sensors, in an effort to bolster its IoT portfolio.[87]
In October 2016, Verizon was accused by Communications Workers of America of deliberately refusing to maintain its copper telephone service. The organization released internal memos and other documents stating that Verizon workers in Pennsylvania were being instructed to, in areas with network problems, migrate voice-only customers to VoiceLink—a system that delivers telephone service over the Verizon Wireless network, and not to repair the copper lines. VoiceLink has limitations, including incompatibility with services or devices that require the transmission of data over the telephone line, and a dependency on a battery backup in case of power failure. The memo warned that technicians who do not follow this procedure would be subject to "disciplinary action up to and including dismissal". A Verizon spokesperson responded to the allegations, stating that the company's top priority was to restore service to customers as quickly as possible, and that VoiceLink was a means of doing so in the event that larger repairs have to be done to the infrastructure. The spokesperson stated that it was "hard to argue with disciplining someone who intentionally leaves a customer without service".[88][89]
In November 2016, Verizon acquired mapping startup SocialRadar; its technology will be integrated with MapQuest.[90]
On January 26, 2017, The Washington Post reported that Verizon was in talks to merge with Charter Communications.[91]
On March 13, 2017, Verizon was sued by New York City for violating its cable franchise agreement, which required the provider to pass a fiberoptic network to all households in the city by June 30, 2014. Verizon disputed the claims, citing landlords not granting permission to install the equipment on their properties, and an understanding with the government that the fiber network would follow the same routes as its copper lines, and did not necessarily mean it would have to pass the lines in front of every property.[92]
On April 27, 2017 Verizon invested $10 million in Renovo Auto, a Campbell, California-based autonomous vehicle company.[93]
Acquisition of AOL and Yahoo[edit]
On May 12, 2015, Verizon announced they would acquire AOL at $50 per share, for a deal valued around $4.4 billion.[94][95] The following year, Verizon announced that it would acquire the core internet business of Yahoo for $4.83 billion.[96][97][98] Following the completion of the latter acquisition, Verizon intends to operate AOL and Yahoo under a new division known as Oath.[99] The sale does not include Yahoo's stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan.[100][101]
On March 16, 2017, Verizon announced that it would discontinue the e-mail services provided for its internet subscribers, and migrate them to AOL Mail.[102]
On May 23, 2017, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam confirms company's plan to launch a streaming TV service later 2017.[103] The integrated AOL-Yahoo operation, housed under the newly created Oath division, will be organized around key content-based pillars.[104]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo! shareholders approved the sale of some of the company's internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[105][106][107][11][12]
Divisions and Subsidiaries[edit]




Verizon service van


As of 2017, Verizon Communications' operations are divided into three divisions:
Media and Telematics[edit]
Media and Telematics will focus on integrating, scaling and growing Verizon’s portfolio of new businesses in digital media and telematics. Marni Walden will be responsible for quickly scaling these businesses into major contributors to Verizon’s future growth.
The combination of AOL with the assets of Yahoo under the Oath subsidiary will give Verizon more than 1.3 billion digital media users and generate $7 billion in revenue. Walden’s team will be responsible for integrating these businesses and building brand and market share in this growing market.
In addition, Walden will continue to lead Verizon’s integration and expansion of its Verizon Telematics (connected car and fleet management) portfolio. Through acquisitions of Hughes Telematics, Fleetmatics and Telogis, Verizon is already the world’s leading telematics provider, with customers in 30 countries around the globe.
Network and Technology[edit]
Hans Vestberg -- who served for six years as CEO of Ericsson, a multinational networking and telecommunications equipment and services company headquartered in Sweden that provides 35 percent of the world’s 2G, 3G and 4G mobile network infrastructures – will lead a U.S.-based team responsible for further developing the architecture for Verizon’s fiber-centric networks. Network and Technology will focus on delivering seamless network experiences for customers, whether on wifi, fiber, 4G, 5G or future technologies.
Verizon’s network assets consist of a 4G LTE network, a 5G test-bed in the U.S., the nation’s biggest residential fiber network, a global internet backbone and undersea cable network carrying much of the world’s internet traffic, and – with the recent acquisition of XO Communications – fiber assets in 45 of the top 50 markets in the U.S.
Customer and Product Operations[edit]
The Customer and Product Operations team will focus on operating and growing Verizon’s established businesses, which include: Verizon Wireless, Verizon Enterprise Solutions, Verizon Partner Solutions, Verizon Consumer Markets and Verizon Business Markets. These businesses generate more than $120 billion in annual revenue and serve more than 120 million customers.
John Stratton will focus on growing these core businesses, while accelerating Verizon’s shift toward a digital-first model. Stratton will also lead operations and sales for the Internet of Things products and services, including smart communities
Landline operating companies[edit]
Verizon inherited multiple incumbent local exchange carriers that remain part of the company's operations, these are:

Bell System companies


Verizon Delaware
Verizon Maryland
Verizon New England (Massachusetts and Rhode Island)
Verizon New Jersey
Verizon New York
Verizon Pennsylvania
Verizon Virginia
Verizon Washington, DC


GTE companies


Verizon North (Pennsylvania)
Verizon South (Virginia and North Carolina)

Marketing campaigns[edit]
Since its inception, Verizon Communications has run several marketing campaigns, including:
Can you hear me now?[edit]
The "Can you hear me now?" campaign, which was created for the newly formed Verizon Wireless, started running in 2001 and featured actor Paul Marcarelli in the role of "Test Man," a character based on a Verizon network tester who travels the country asking "Can you hear me now?"[108][109][110] The campaign, originally conceived by the agency Bozell in New York, ran from early 2001 to September 2010.[111][112] Data from the technology tracking firm The Yankee Group shows that, in the early years of the campaign, net customers grew 10% to 32.5 million in 2002 and 15% more to 37.5 million in 2003. In addition, customer turnover dropped to 1.8% in 2001, down from 2.5% in 2000.[110] In 2011, Marcarelli parted ways with Verizon and is now a spokesperson for Sprint.[113]
There's a map for that[edit]
The "There's a map for that" campaign was launched in late 2009. It was designed as a parody of AT&T's "There's an app for that" adverts. The ads depicted a side-by-side comparison of Verizon and AT&T network coverage maps.[114] AT&T filed a lawsuit in Atlanta federal court early in November 2009, claiming that the coverage maps being used in the ads were misleading.[115] The suit was dropped later that month in conjunction with Verizon dropping a similar suit against AT&T.[114]
That's not cool[edit]
In 2009, Verizon joined with the Ad Council, in partnership with the Family Violence Prevention Fund and the Office on Violence Against Women, to create the "That's not cool" campaign. This public service advertising campaign was designed to help teens recognize and prevent digital dating abuse. Verizon ran the ads on its Wireless' Mobile Web service, Verizon FiOS Internet, and Verizon FiOS TV.[116][117]
Powerful Answers[edit]
In January 2013, Verizon launched the "Powerful Answers" campaign designed by agency McGarryBowen.[118] The campaign centered around a contest in which $10 million in prizes was offered to individuals for finding solutions to "the world's biggest challenges" by making use of Verizon's cloud, broadband, and wireless networks.[119][120] Winners of the inaugural competition were announced at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show.[119] Israel-based TinyTap won the education category, Smart Vision Labs of Newport, Rhode Island won in the healthcare category, and Mosaic Inc. of Oakland, California won in the sustainability category.[119]
Inspire Her Mind[edit]
Verizon launched its "Inspire Her Mind" ad in June 2014. The ad, created by the agency AKQA, was designed to encourage girls' interest in science, technology, engineering and math.[121] It aimed to address findings from the National Science Foundation, whose research showed that 66 percent of fourth-grade girls said they like science and math, yet only 18 percent of college students in engineering and math are women.[122][123]
Flipside Stories (#NeverSettle)[edit]
Verizon launched its Flipside Stories ad campaign in February 2015 featuring the #NeverSettle hashtag. The ads show dramatized "testimonials" of people with and without Verizon Wireless or Verizon FiOS services.[124][125][126]
Better Matters[edit]
In 2016, Verizon started using the slogan "Better Matters" in reference to its wireless and FiOS networks. For wireless, it relies heavily on its larger coverage map, and its RootMetrics RootScore awards. For FiOS, it relies on the fact that "FiOS is wired differently [than cable]", being that FiOS is fiber to the home, and its local competitors are not.
Corporate governance[edit]
Board of Directors[edit]
The current Board of Directors is comprised as follows as of February 2017:[127]
Lowell McAdam, CEO of Verizon (chairman of the board)
Shellye Archambeau, CEO of MetricStream

Marni Walden, EVP & President of Verizon Media and Telematics
Hans Vestberg, EVP & President of Verizon Network and Technology
John Stratton, EVP & President of Verizon Customer and Product Operations
Corporate Responsibility[edit]
The Verizon Foundation is the philanthropic arm of Verizon Communications, donating about $70 million per year to nonprofit organizations, with a focus on education, domestic violence prevention, and energy management.[128] Verizon's educational initiatives have focused on STEM fields,[129] including: a national competition for students to develop mobile application concepts;[129] the Verizon Innovative Learning Schools program, providing professional development for teachers in underserved areas;[130] and providing students with wireless hardware and services as part of President Obama's ConnectED program.[131] The company also runs HopeLine, which has provided mobile phones to approximately 180,000 victims of domestic violence,[132][133] and a program that offers grants for victims of domestic violence to start or grow home-based businesses.[134] As part of an initiative to reduce the company's carbon intensity metrics by 50 percent by 2020, Verizon announced planned investment in solar panels and natural gas fuel cells at its facilities.[135] The increased capacity would make Verizon the leading solar power producer among U.S. communications companies.[136]
Sponsorships and venues[edit]
Verizon is the title sponsor of several large performance and sports venues as well as a sponsor of several major sporting organizations.
National Hockey League[edit]
In January 2007, Verizon secured exclusive marketing and promotional rights with the National Hockey League.[137] The deal was extended for another three years in 2012 and included new provisions for the league to provide exclusive content through Verizon's GameCenter app.[138]
Motorsports[edit]
In 2009 and 2010 Verizon sponsored Justin Allgaier in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, before they chose to opt out of a two-year-old NASCAR team sponsorship with Penske Racing in order to pursue an expanded presence with the IndyCar Series.[139] In March 2014 Verizon signed a multiyear deal making them the title sponsor of the IndyCar Series, now called the Verizon IndyCar Series.[140] In 2012 Verizon was featured on the side of both McLaren cars at the US Grand Prix.
National Football League[edit]
In late 2010, Verizon Communications joined with Vodafone Group in a joint partnership to replace Sprint as the official wireless telecommunications partner of the National Football League.[141] The four-year deal was estimated at $720 million. In June 2013, Verizon announced a four-year extension with the NFL in a deal reportedly valued at $1 billion. The new agreement gave Verizon the right to stream every NFL regular-season and playoff game.[142]
Venues[edit]
Verizon is the title sponsor for a number of sporting and entertainment arenas including the Verizon Center in Washington, DC;[143] the Verizon Arena in North Little Rock, Arkansas;[144] and the Verizon Center in Mankato, Minnesota.[145] SNHU Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire was originally known as the Verizon Wireless Arena until September 2016, when Southern New Hampshire University acquired the naming rights for a period of at least 10 years.[146]
Verizon is also currently the title sponsor of five entertainment amphitheaters in locations throughout the United States, four being individually referred to as the "Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre": in Irvine, California; Maryland Heights, Missouri; Selma, Texas; and Alpharetta, Georgia. The fifth is the Verizon Theatre at Grand Prairie, Texas.

Verizon Communications, Inc. ( listen (help·info)) (/vəˈraɪzən/ və-RY-zən) (simply known as Verizon, stylized as verizon), is an American multinational telecommunications conglomerate and the largest U.S. wireless communications service provider as of September 2014[update],[7] and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[8] The company is based at 1095 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan, New York City,[2] but is incorporated in Delaware.
What eventually became Verizon was founded as Bell Atlantic, which was one of the seven Baby Bells that were formed after AT&T Corporation was forced to relinquish its control of the Bell System by order of the Justice Department of the United States.[9] Bell Atlantic came into existence in 1984 with a footprint from New Jersey to Virginia, with each area having a separate operating company (consisting of New Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone, and C&P Telephone).
As part of the rebranding that the Baby Bells took in the mid-1990s, all of the operating companies assumed the Bell Atlantic name. In 1997, Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX. Although Bell Atlantic was the surviving company, the merged company moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to NYNEX's old headquarters in New York City.
In 2000, Bell Atlantic acquired GTE, which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic's footprint. Bell Atlantic, the surviving company, changed its name to "Verizon", a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for "truth") and horizon.[10]
As of 2016[update], Verizon is one of three companies that had their roots in the former Baby Bells. The other two, like Verizon, exist as a result of mergers among fellow former Baby Bell members. One, SBC Communications, bought out the Bells former parent AT&T Corporation and assumed the AT&T name. The other, CenturyLink, was formed initially in 2011 by the acquisition of Qwest (formerly named US West).
On June 13, 2017 Verizon announced that some of Yahoo! Inc's internet assets would be combined under a new subsidiary, Oath.[11][12]

History[edit]
Bell Atlantic (1983–2000)[edit]

Bell Atlantic logo, 1983–1997


Bell Atlantic Corporation was created as one of the original Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) in 1984, during the breakup of the Bell System. Bell Atlantic's original roster of operating companies included:

The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania
New Jersey Bell
Diamond State Telephone
C&P Telephone (itself comprising four subsidiaries)

Bell Atlantic originally operated in the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia, as well as Washington, DC.
In 1994, Bell Atlantic became the first RBOC to entirely drop the original names of its original operating companies.
In 1996, CEO and Chairman Raymond W. Smith orchestrated Bell Atlantic's merger with NYNEX. When it merged, it moved its corporate headquarters from Philadelphia to New York City. NYNEX was consolidated into this name by 1997.
Acquisition of GTE (2000–2002)[edit]
Bell Atlantic changed its name to Verizon Communications in June 2000 when the Federal Communications Commission approved a US$64.7 billion acquisition of telephone company GTE, nearly two years after the deal was proposed in July 1998.[13] The approval came with 25 stipulations to preserve competition between local phone carriers, including investing in new markets and broadband technologies.[13] The new entity was headed by co-CEOs Charles Lee, formerly the CEO of GTE, and Bell Atlantic CEO Ivan Seidenberg.[13]
Upon the acquisition, Verizon became the largest local telephone company in the United States, operating 63 million telephone lines in 40 states.[14] The company also inherited 25 million mobile phone customers.[14] Additionally, Verizon offered internet services and long-distance calling in New York, before expanding long-distance operations to other states.[13][15]
The name Verizon derives from the combination of the words veritas, Latin for truth, and horizon.[16] The name was chosen from 8,500 candidates and the company spent $300 million on marketing the new brand.[16][17]
Two months before the FCC gave final approval on the formation of Verizon Communications, Bell Atlantic formed Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with the British telecommunications company Vodafone in April 2000.[17][18][19] The companies established Verizon Wireless as its own business operated by Bell Atlantic, which owned 55% of the venture.[18] Vodafone retained 45% of the company.[18] The deal was valued at approximately $70 billion and created a mobile carrier with 23 million customers.[17][18] Verizon Wireless merged Bell Atlantic's wireless network, Vodafone's AirTouch and PrimeCo holdings, and the wireless division of GTE.[18][20][21] Due to its size, Verizon Wireless was able to offer national coverage at competitive rates, giving it an advantage over regional providers typical of the time.[17]
During its first operational year, Verizon Wireless released Mobile Web, an Internet service that allowed customers to access partner sites such as E*Trade, ABC News, ESPN, Amazon.com, Ticketmaster and MSN,[19] as well as the "New Every Two" program, which gave customers a free phone with every two-year service contract.[22] In another partnership with MSN in 2002, Verizon Wireless launched the mobile content service "VZW with MSN" and a phone that utilized the Microsoft Windows operating system.[23]
In August 2000, approximately 85,000 Verizon workers went on an 18-day labor strike after their union contracts expired.[24][25] The strike affected quarterly revenues,[26] resulting in Verizon Wireless' postponement of the company's IPO[26] (the IPO was ultimately cancelled in 2003, because the company no longer needed to raise revenue for Verizon Wireless due to increased profits[27] ), and created a backlog of repairs.[25] Verizon launched 3G service in 2002, which doubled the Internet speeds of the time to 144kb a second.[28] In August 2002, Verizon began offering local, long-distance, and mobile calling, as well as Internet service, in a bundle. It was initially only available to customers in New York and Massachusetts.[15]
2003–2005[edit]
In June 2003, Verizon Wireless backed an FCC-issued portability requirement that permitted consumers to take their phone numbers with them across carriers.[29] The company gained 1.5 million new subscribers the following quarter, partially due to the rule change.[30] The following year, in April 2004, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added Verizon Communications to its stock market index.[31] Verizon replaced telecom competitor AT&T, which had been a part of the index since the Great Depression.[31]
On December 22, 2004, mail servers at Verizon.net were configured not to accept connections from Europe, by default, in an attempt to reduce spam email that was originating from the region. Individual domains would only be unblocked upon request.[32]
Verizon launched its FiOS Internet service, which transmits data over fiber optic cables in Keller, Texas.[33] (Since divested Frontier) The company launched FiOS TV in September 2005, also in Keller, Texas. Twenty percent of qualified homes signed up by the end of the year.[34] By January 2006, FiOS offered over 350 channels in eight states, including 20 high-definition television channels as well as video on demand.[34]
MCI acquisition[edit]
Verizon began negotiations to purchase long distance carrier MCI in 2005. MCI accepted the company's initial $6.75 billion offer in February 2005, but then received a higher offer from Qwest Communications. Verizon increased its bid to $7.6 billion (or $23.50 a share), which MCI accepted on March 29, 2005.[35] The acquisition gave the company access to MCI's one million corporate clients and international holdings, expanding Verizon's presence into global markets.[35][36] As a result, Verizon Business was established as a new division to serve the company's business and government customers.[37] The FCC approved the deal on November 5, 2005, valuing it at $8.5 billion.[38] Verizon's 2006 revenues rose by as much as 20% following the purchase.[39]
2006–2010[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that Verizon, as well as AT&T and BellSouth, had given the National Security Agency landline phone records following the September 11 attacks.[40][41] That same month, a $50 billion lawsuit was filed by two lawyers on behalf of all Verizon subscribers for privacy violations and to prevent the company from releasing additional records without consent or warrant.[40][41] Protesters staged the National Day of Out(R)age due in part to the controversy.[42] Verizon stated in 2007 that the company fulfilled only "lawful demands" for information,[43] though also acknowledged surrendering customer information to government agencies without court orders or warrants 720 times between 2005 and 2007.[44]
Verizon won a lawsuit against Vonage in March 2007 for patent infringement. The three patents named were filed by Bell Atlantic in 1997 and relate to the conversion of IP addresses into phone numbers, a key technology of Vonage's business.[45] The company was awarded US$58 million in damages and future royalties.[45] Vonage later lost an appeal and was ordered to pay Verizon $120 million.[46]
In May 2007, Verizon acquired Cybertrust, a privately held provider of global information security services.[47] This purchase represented Verizon's intent to offer security solutions to its global enterprise customers.
Verizon Wireless reversed a controversial decision in September 2007 to deny NARAL Pro-Choice America a short code through which the organization could text consumers who had signed up for messaging from the group. They had initially refused the group access to a code by reserving the right to block "controversial or unsavory" messages.[48]
In November 2007, Verizon opened its networks for the first time to third party apps and devices,[49] a decision that allowed it to participate in the FCC's 2008 700 MHz auction of "open access" spectrum.[49][50] During that auction, the company bid $9.4 billion and won the bulk of national and local licenses for airwaves reaching approximately 469 million people.[50][51] Verizon utilized the increased spectrum for its 4G service.[50]
Verizon Wireless purchased wireless carrier Alltel for $28.1 billion in June 2008. The acquisition included 13 million customers, which allowed Verizon Wireless to surpass AT&T in number of customers and reach new markets in rural areas.[52]
In October 2010, Verizon Wireless paid $77.8 million in refunds and FCC penalties for overcharging 15 million customers for data services. The company stated the overcharges were accidental and only amounted to a few dollars per customer.[53][54]
On February 4, 2010, 4chan started receiving reports from Verizon Wireless customers that they were having difficulties accessing the site's image boards. 4chan administrators found that only traffic on port 80 to the boards.4chan.org domain was affected, leading them to believe that the block was intentional. On February 7, 2010, Verizon Wireless confirmed that 4chan.org was "explicitly blocked"[55] after Verizon's security and external experts detected sweep attacks coming from an IP address associated with the 4chan network. Traffic was restored several days later.[56]
In August 2010, the chairmen of Verizon and Google agreed that network neutrality should be defined and limited.[57][58]
Verizon introduced its 4G LTE network in 38 markets in December 2010, as well as in airports in seven additional cities. The company planned on a three-year continuous expansion of the 4G service.[59]
Selling wirelines (2005–2010 & 2015)[edit]
Between 2005 and 2010, Verizon divested wireline operations in several states in order to focus on its wireless, FiOS internet and FiOS TV businesses.[39] It sold 700,000 lines in Hawaii in 2005,[39][60] and spun off lines in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in January 2007 that were then purchased by FairPoint Communications for $2.72 billion.[39] In 2009, the company spun off wirelines in 14 states into a company that then merged with Frontier Communications in a deal valued at $8.6 billion.[61] Verizon also shed its telephone directory business in 2006.[62]
In May 2009, Verizon announced that it was selling off its wireline operations in Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. And in 2015, they announced they were selling its wireline operations in Texas, Florida, and California to Frontier.[63]
2011–present[edit]




Verizon logo, 2000–2015


On January 27, 2011, Verizon acquired Terremark, an information technology services company for $1.4 billion.[64] Ivan Seidenberg stepped down as Verizon's CEO on August 1, 2011. Lowell McAdam succeeded him.[65]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Verizon for its tax avoidance procedures after it spent $52.34 million on lobbying while collecting $951 million in tax rebates between 2008 and 2010 and making a profit of $32.5 billion. The same report also criticized Verizon for increasing executive pay by 167% in 2010 for its top five executives while laying off 21,308 workers between 2008 and 2010.[66] However, in its Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2012, Verizon reported having paid more than $11.1 billion in taxes (including income, employment and property taxes) from 2009 to 2011. In addition, the company reported in the 10-K that most of the drop in employment since 2008 was due to a voluntary retirement offer.[67]
In June 2012, as part of its strategy to expand into new growth areas in its wireless business, Verizon purchased Hughes Telematics—a company that produces wireless features for automobiles—for $612 million.[68] Also in June 2012, Verizon's E-911 service failed in the aftermath of the June 2012 derecho storm in several northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., with some problems lasting several days.[69] The FCC conducted an investigation[69] and in January 2013 released a report detailing the problems that led to the failure. Verizon reported that it had already addressed or was addressing a number of the issues related to the FCC report, including the causes of generator failures, conducting audits of backup systems and making its monitoring systems less centralized,[70] although the FCC indicated that Verizon still needed to make additional improvements.[71]
In July 2012, the FCC ruled that Verizon must stop charging users an added fee for using 4G smartphones and tablets as Wi-Fi hotspots (known as "tethering"). Verizon had been charging its customers, even those with "unlimited" plans, $20 per month for tethering. As part of the settlement, Verizon made a voluntary payment of $1.25 million to the U.S. Treasury.[72]
In August 2012, the Department of Justice approved Verizon's purchase of Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum from a consortium of cable companies, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, for $3.9 billion.[73] Verizon began expanding its LTE network utilizing these extra airwaves in October 2013.[74]
On June 5, 2013, The Guardian reported it had obtained an order by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and approved by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that required Verizon to provide the NSA with telephone metadata for all calls originating in the U.S.[75][76] Verizon Wireless was not part of the NSA data collection for wireless accounts due to foreign ownership issues.[77] (see also MAINWAY article)
In September 2013, Verizon purchased the 45% stake in Verizon Wireless owned by Vodafone for $130 billion.[78] The deal closed on February 21, 2014, becoming the third largest corporate deal ever signed, giving Verizon Communications sole ownership of Verizon Wireless.[79]
On January 14, 2014, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the FCC's net neutrality rules after Verizon filed suit against them in January 2010.[80][81] In June 2016, in an 184-page ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld, by a 2–1 vote, the FCC's net neutrality rules and the FCC's determination that broadband access is a public utility, rather than a luxury. AT&T and the telecom industry said that they would seek to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.[82]
On January 22, 2014 the Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon received more than 1,000 requests for information about its subscribers on national security grounds via National Security Letters. In total, Verizon received 321,545 requests from federal, state and local law enforcement for U.S. customer information.[83] In May 2015, Verizon agreed to pay $90 million "to settle federal and state investigations into allegations mobile customers were improperly billed for premium text messages."[84]
In August 2015, Verizon launched Hum, a service and device offering vehicle diagnostic and monitoring tools for vehicles.[85] On August 1, 2016, Verizon announced its acquisition of Fleetmatics, a fleet telematics system company in Dublin, Ireland, for $2.4 billion, to build products that it offers to enterprises for logistics and mobile workforces.[86] On September 12, 2016, Verizon announced its acquisition of Sensity, a startup for LED sensors, in an effort to bolster its IoT portfolio.[87]
In October 2016, Verizon was accused by Communications Workers of America of deliberately refusing to maintain its copper telephone service. The organization released internal memos and other documents stating that Verizon workers in Pennsylvania were being instructed to, in areas with network problems, migrate voice-only customers to VoiceLink—a system that delivers telephone service over the Verizon Wireless network, and not to repair the copper lines. VoiceLink has limitations, including incompatibility with services or devices that require the transmission of data over the telephone line, and a dependency on a battery backup in case of power failure. The memo warned that technicians who do not follow this procedure would be subject to "disciplinary action up to and including dismissal". A Verizon spokesperson responded to the allegations, stating that the company's top priority was to restore service to customers as quickly as possible, and that VoiceLink was a means of doing so in the event that larger repairs have to be done to the infrastructure. The spokesperson stated that it was "hard to argue with disciplining someone who intentionally leaves a customer without service".[88][89]
In November 2016, Verizon acquired mapping startup SocialRadar; its technology will be integrated with MapQuest.[90]
On January 26, 2017, The Washington Post reported that Verizon was in talks to merge with Charter Communications.[91]
On March 13, 2017, Verizon was sued by New York City for violating its cable franchise agreement, which required the provider to pass a fiberoptic network to all households in the city by June 30, 2014. Verizon disputed the claims, citing landlords not granting permission to install the equipment on their properties, and an understanding with the government that the fiber network would follow the same routes as its copper lines, and did not necessarily mean it would have to pass the lines in front of every property.[92]
On April 27, 2017 Verizon invested $10 million in Renovo Auto, a Campbell, California-based autonomous vehicle company.[93]
Acquisition of AOL and Yahoo[edit]
On May 12, 2015, Verizon announced they would acquire AOL at $50 per share, for a deal valued around $4.4 billion.[94][95] The following year, Verizon announced that it would acquire the core internet business of Yahoo for $4.83 billion.[96][97][98] Following the completion of the latter acquisition, Verizon intends to operate AOL and Yahoo under a new division known as Oath.[99] The sale does not include Yahoo's stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan.[100][101]
On March 16, 2017, Verizon announced that it would discontinue the e-mail services provided for its internet subscribers, and migrate them to AOL Mail.[102]
On May 23, 2017, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam confirms company's plan to launch a streaming TV service later 2017.[103] The integrated AOL-Yahoo operation, housed under the newly created Oath division, will be organized around key content-based pillars.[104]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo! shareholders approved the sale of some of the company's internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[105][106][107][11][12]
Divisions and Subsidiaries[edit]




Verizon service van


As of 2017, Verizon Communications' operations are divided into three divisions:
Media and Telematics[edit]
Media and Telematics will focus on integrating, scaling and growing Verizon’s portfolio of new businesses in digital media and telematics. Marni Walden will be responsible for quickly scaling these businesses into major contributors to Verizon’s future growth.
The combination of AOL with the assets of Yahoo under the Oath subsidiary will give Verizon more than 1.3 billion digital media users and generate $7 billion in revenue. Walden’s team will be responsible for integrating these businesses and building brand and market share in this growing market.
In addition, Walden will continue to lead Verizon’s integration and expansion of its Verizon Telematics (connected car and fleet management) portfolio. Through acquisitions of Hughes Telematics, Fleetmatics and Telogis, Verizon is already the world’s leading telematics provider, with customers in 30 countries around the globe.
Network and Technology[edit]
Hans Vestberg -- who served for six years as CEO of Ericsson, a multinational networking and telecommunications equipment and services company headquartered in Sweden that provides 35 percent of the world’s 2G, 3G and 4G mobile network infrastructures – will lead a U.S.-based team responsible for further developing the architecture for Verizon’s fiber-centric networks. Network and Technology will focus on delivering seamless network experiences for customers, whether on wifi, fiber, 4G, 5G or future technologies.
Verizon’s network assets consist of a 4G LTE network, a 5G test-bed in the U.S., the nation’s biggest residential fiber network, a global internet backbone and undersea cable network carrying much of the world’s internet traffic, and – with the recent acquisition of XO Communications – fiber assets in 45 of the top 50 markets in the U.S.
Customer and Product Operations[edit]
The Customer and Product Operations team will focus on operating and growing Verizon’s established businesses, which include: Verizon Wireless, Verizon Enterprise Solutions, Verizon Partner Solutions, Verizon Consumer Markets and Verizon Business Markets. These businesses generate more than $120 billion in annual revenue and serve more than 120 million customers.
John Stratton will focus on growing these core businesses, while accelerating Verizon’s shift toward a digital-first model. Stratton will also lead operations and sales for the Internet of Things products and services, including smart communities
Landline operating companies[edit]
Verizon inherited multiple incumbent local exchange carriers that remain part of the company's operations, these are:

Bell System companies


Verizon Delaware
Verizon Maryland
Verizon New England (Massachusetts and Rhode Island)
Verizon New Jersey
Verizon New York
Verizon Pennsylvania
Verizon Virginia
Verizon Washington, DC


GTE companies


Verizon North (Pennsylvania)
Verizon South (Virginia and North Carolina)

Marketing campaigns[edit]
Since its inception, Verizon Communications has run several marketing campaigns, including:
Can you hear me now?[edit]
The "Can you hear me now?" campaign, which was created for the newly formed Verizon Wireless, started running in 2001 and featured actor Paul Marcarelli in the role of "Test Man," a character based on a Verizon network tester who travels the country asking "Can you hear me now?"[108][109][110] The campaign, originally conceived by the agency Bozell in New York, ran from early 2001 to September 2010.[111][112] Data from the technology tracking firm The Yankee Group shows that, in the early years of the campaign, net customers grew 10% to 32.5 million in 2002 and 15% more to 37.5 million in 2003. In addition, customer turnover dropped to 1.8% in 2001, down from 2.5% in 2000.[110] In 2011, Marcarelli parted ways with Verizon and is now a spokesperson for Sprint.[113]
There's a map for that[edit]
The "There's a map for that" campaign was launched in late 2009. It was designed as a parody of AT&T's "There's an app for that" adverts. The ads depicted a side-by-side comparison of Verizon and AT&T network coverage maps.[114] AT&T filed a lawsuit in Atlanta federal court early in November 2009, claiming that the coverage maps being used in the ads were misleading.[115] The suit was dropped later that month in conjunction with Verizon dropping a similar suit against AT&T.[114]
That's not cool[edit]
In 2009, Verizon joined with the Ad Council, in partnership with the Family Violence Prevention Fund and the Office on Violence Against Women, to create the "That's not cool" campaign. This public service advertising campaign was designed to help teens recognize and prevent digital dating abuse. Verizon ran the ads on its Wireless' Mobile Web service, Verizon FiOS Internet, and Verizon FiOS TV.[116][117]
Powerful Answers[edit]
In January 2013, Verizon launched the "Powerful Answers" campaign designed by agency McGarryBowen.[118] The campaign centered around a contest in which $10 million in prizes was offered to individuals for finding solutions to "the world's biggest challenges" by making use of Verizon's cloud, broadband, and wireless networks.[119][120] Winners of the inaugural competition were announced at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show.[119] Israel-based TinyTap won the education category, Smart Vision Labs of Newport, Rhode Island won in the healthcare category, and Mosaic Inc. of Oakland, California won in the sustainability category.[119]
Inspire Her Mind[edit]
Verizon launched its "Inspire Her Mind" ad in June 2014. The ad, created by the agency AKQA, was designed to encourage girls' interest in science, technology, engineering and math.[121] It aimed to address findings from the National Science Foundation, whose research showed that 66 percent of fourth-grade girls said they like science and math, yet only 18 percent of college students in engineering and math are women.[122][123]
Flipside Stories (#NeverSettle)[edit]
Verizon launched its Flipside Stories ad campaign in February 2015 featuring the #NeverSettle hashtag. The ads show dramatized "testimonials" of people with and without Verizon Wireless or Verizon FiOS services.[124][125][126]
Better Matters[edit]
In 2016, Verizon started using the slogan "Better Matters" in reference to its wireless and FiOS networks. For wireless, it relies heavily on its larger coverage map, and its RootMetrics RootScore awards. For FiOS, it relies on the fact that "FiOS is wired differently [than cable]", being that FiOS is fiber to the home, and its local competitors are not.
Corporate governance[edit]
Board of Directors[edit]
The current Board of Directors is comprised as follows as of February 2017:[127]
Lowell McAdam, CEO of Verizon (chairman of the board)
Shellye Archambeau, CEO of MetricStream
Mark Bertolini, CEO of Aetna
Richard Carrión, CEO of Popular, Inc.
Melanie Healey, former President of Procter & Gamble
Frances Keeth, former Executive Vice President of Royal Dutch Shell
Karl-Ludwig Kley, former CEO and Chairman of Merck Group
Clarence Otis, Jr., former CEO and Chairman of Darden Restaurants
Rodney E. Slater, former United States Secretary of Transportation and current partner at Squire Patton Boggs
Kathryn Tesija, former Executive Vice President of Target Corporation
Gregory Wasson, former CEO and Chairman of Walgreens Boots Alliance
Gregory Weaver, former CEO of Deloitte's audit and enterprise risk division
Division Executives[edit]
As of April 3 2017:
Marni Walden, EVP & President of Verizon Media and Telematics
Hans Vestberg, EVP & President of Verizon Network and Technology
John Stratton, EVP & President of Verizon Customer and Product Operations
Corporate Responsibility[edit]
The Verizon Foundation is the philanthropic arm of Verizon Communications, donating about $70 million per year to nonprofit organizations, with a focus on education, domestic violence prevention, and energy management.[128] Verizon's educational initiatives have focused on STEM fields,[129] including: a national competition for students to develop mobile application concepts;[129] the Verizon Innovative Learning Schools program, providing professional development for teachers in underserved areas;[130] and providing students with wireless hardware and services as part of President Obama's ConnectED program.[131] The company also runs HopeLine, which has provided mobile phones to approximately 180,000 victims of domestic violence,[132][133] and a program that offers grants for victims of domestic violence to start or grow home-based businesses.[134] As part of an initiative to reduce the company's carbon intensity metrics by 50 percent by 2020, Verizon announced planned investment in solar panels and natural gas fuel cells at its facilities.[135] The increased capacity would make Verizon the leading solar power producer among U.S. communications companies.[136]
Sponsorships and venues[edit]
Verizon is the title sponsor of several large performance and sports venues as well as a sponsor of several major sporting organizations.
National Hockey League[edit]
In January 2007, Verizon secured exclusive marketing and promotional rights with the National Hockey League.[137] The deal was extended for another three years in 2012 and included new provisions for the league to provide exclusive content through Verizon's GameCenter app.[138]
Motorsports[edit]
In 2009 and 2010 Verizon sponsored Justin Allgaier in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, before they chose to opt out of a two-year-old NASCAR team sponsorship with Penske Racing in order to pursue an expanded presence with the IndyCar Series.[139] In March 2014 Verizon signed a multiyear deal making them the title sponsor of the IndyCar Series, now called the Verizon IndyCar Series.[140] In 2012 Verizon was featured on the side of both McLaren cars at the US Grand Prix.
National Football League[edit]
In late 2010, Verizon Communications joined with Vodafone Group in a joint partnership to replace Sprint as the official wireless telecommunications partner of the National Football League.[141] The four-year deal was estimated at $720 million. In June 2013, Verizon announced a four-year extension with the NFL in a deal reportedly valued at $1 billion. The new agreement gave Verizon the right to stream every NFL regular-season and playoff game.[142]
Venues[edit]
Verizon is the title sponsor for a number of sporting and entertainment arenas including the Verizon Center in Washington, DC;[143] the Verizon Arena in North Little Rock, Arkansas;[144] and the Verizon Center in Mankato, Minnesota.[145] SNHU Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire was originally known as the Verizon Wireless Arena until September 2016, when Southern New Hampshire University acquired the naming rights for a period of at least 10 years.[146]
Verizon is also currently the title sponsor of five entertainment amphitheaters in locations throughout the United States, four being individually referred to as the "Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre": in Irvine, California; Maryland Heights, Missouri; Selma, Texas; and Alpharetta, Georgia. The fifth is the Verizon Theatre at Grand Prairie, Texas.

Charting a bull-trend whipsaw, Nasdaq’s key reversal fuels sector rotation (again)
Technically speaking, familiar 2017 cross currents have resurfaced to conclude July.  On a headline basis, the Nasdaq Composite has formed its latest key reversal — a bearish technical pattern, in isolation — while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has concurrently tagged its latest all-time high against a still bullish bigger-picture backdrop.

Dow ends at record, but tech slump weighs on S&P 500, Nasdaq

Breaking            
Nasdaq Composite pivots sharply lower in afternoon trade
The Nasdaq on Thursday afternoon turned sharply lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was most recently down 72 points, or 1.1%, as the index was jolted suddenly lower, with some investors and traders citing a combination of concerns about valuations and market participants taking some money off the table following a brisk run for the high-flying sector. The abrupt retreat for the tech-centric gauge came as the other main equity benchmarks pared an earlier advance. All three equity gauges notched all-time intraday trading highs at the open, but the S&P 500 index  was most recently down 0.5% at 2,464 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  traded flat at 21,710, buoyed by gains in Verizon Communication , while Dow component and tech-giant Apple Inc. , sold off by 2.7%, cutting about 30 points from the blue-chip gauge.  The popular tech-focused exchange-traded fund, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF , was trading down 1% in recent trade.

Breaking            
Popular biotech ETF on pace for steepest daily drop in a month 
A popular way to bet on the the biotech sector was trading sharply lower on Thursday and on track to register its worst one-day in a month. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF was down 1.8%, led by an about 11% decline in Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Corp.  and Novavax Inc. , with its shares off 6.4% on the session. The drop for the biotech group came amid a broad and sudden selloff in the overall technology sector  that put the Nasdaq Composite Index  on pace to log it sharpest daily fall since June 9, when the tech sector underwent a similar retreat, fueled on concerns about valuations among some of the group's biggest companies, including Apple Inc. , Amazon.com Inc., and Facebook Inc., which reported better-than-expected earnings late Wednesday. More broadly, the overall market was under pressure but off its worst levels of the day. The S&P 500 index  was down 0.3% at 2,469, the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was trading modestly higher, fueled by gains in Verizon Communications Inc. , which saw its shares up nearly 8%, more than offsetting a 2.3% decline in Apple's stock.

Telecom sector on track for biggest one-day gain since 2009
The S&P telecom sector soared on Thursday and was on track for its biggest one-day percentage increase in more than eight years, boosted by strong results from some of its biggest components. The sector jumped 4.8%, its best day since March 2009, according to FactSet data. Thursday marks the third straight daily increase for the industry, a period over which it has gained about 8%. Despite that, telecom remains one of the laggards of the year, down 8.7% for 2017. The rally came after Verizon Communications Inc.  popped 6.9% on the back of second-quarter revenue that beat expectations, as well as an expansion of its unlimited wireless data plan, which helped it recover from a net subscriber loss in the first quarter. AT&T Inc.  gained 3.3% on Thursday, building on a rally the shares had on Wednesday, which came in the wake of the company's own results, when it posted a profit that topped analyst forecasts. The S&P 500  dipped 0.4% on Thursday.

Verizon matches profit expectations but beats on revenue
Verizon Communications Inc.  reported second-quarter net profit of $4.48 billion, or $1.07 a share, compared with $831 million, or 17 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 96 cents, matching the FactSet consensus. Revenue rose to $30.55 billion from $30.53 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $29.86 billion as a 2.2% decline in service revenue to $26.25 billion was offset by a 16% increase in wireless equipment revenue to $4.30 billion. Wireless retail postpaid connections base grew 1.2%, while retail prepaid connections increased 1.4%. Total retail postpaid churn was 0.94%, in line with a year ago. Wireline revenue rose 1.2% to $7.8 billion, with Fios revenue rising 4.4% to $2.9 billion. The company expects 2017 organic revenue to be consistent with 2016. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has tumbled 17% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 9.9%.

Verizon Communications, Inc. ( listen (help·info)) (/vəˈraɪzən/ və-RY-zən) (simply known as Verizon, stylized as verizon), is an American multinational telecommunications conglomerate and the largest U.S. wireless communications service provider as of September 2014[update],[7] and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[8] The company is based at 1095 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan, New York City,[2] but is incorporated in Delaware.
What eventually became Verizon was founded as Bell Atlantic, which was one of the seven Baby Bells that were formed after AT&T Corporation was forced to relinquish its control of the Bell System by order of the Justice Department of the United States.[9] Bell Atlantic came into existence in 1984 with a footprint from New Jersey to Virginia, with each area having a separate operating company (consisting of New Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone, and C&P Telephone).
As part of the rebranding that the Baby Bells took in the mid-1990s, all of the operating companies assumed the Bell Atlantic name. In 1997, Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX. Although Bell Atlantic was the surviving company, the merged company moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to NYNEX's old headquarters in New York City.
In 2000, Bell Atlantic acquired GTE, which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic's footprint. Bell Atlantic, the surviving company, changed its name to "Verizon", a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for "truth") and horizon.[10]
As of 2016[update], Verizon is one of three companies that had their roots in the former Baby Bells. The other two, like Verizon, exist as a result of mergers among fellow former Baby Bell members. One, SBC Communications, bought out the Bells former parent AT&T Corporation and assumed the AT&T name. The other, CenturyLink, was formed initially in 2011 by the acquisition of Qwest (formerly named US West).
On June 13, 2017 Verizon announced that some of Yahoo! Inc's internet assets would be combined under a new subsidiary, Oath.[11][12]

History[edit]
Bell Atlantic (1983–2000)[edit]




Bell Atlantic's final logo used from 1997-2000






Bell Atlantic logo, 1983–1997


Bell Atlantic Corporation was created as one of the original Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) in 1984, during the breakup of the Bell System. Bell Atlantic's original roster of operating companies included:

The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania
New Jersey Bell
Diamond State Telephone
C&P Telephone (itself comprising four subsidiaries)

Bell Atlantic originally operated in the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia, as well as Washington, DC.
In 1994, Bell Atlantic became the first RBOC to entirely drop the original names of its original operating companies.
In 1996, CEO and Chairman Raymond W. Smith orchestrated Bell Atlantic's merger with NYNEX. When it merged, it moved its corporate headquarters from Philadelphia to New York City. NYNEX was consolidated into this name by 1997.
Acquisition of GTE (2000–2002)[edit]
Bell Atlantic changed its name to Verizon Communications in June 2000 when the Federal Communications Commission approved a US$64.7 billion acquisition of telephone company GTE, nearly two years after the deal was proposed in July 1998.[13] The approval came with 25 stipulations to preserve competition between local phone carriers, including investing in new markets and broadband technologies.[13] The new entity was headed by co-CEOs Charles Lee, formerly the CEO of GTE, and Bell Atlantic CEO Ivan Seidenberg.[13]
Upon the acquisition, Verizon became the largest local telephone company in the United States, operating 63 million telephone lines in 40 states.[14] The company also inherited 25 million mobile phone customers.[14] Additionally, Verizon offered internet services and long-distance calling in New York, before expanding long-distance operations to other states.[13][15]
The name Verizon derives from the combination of the words veritas, Latin for truth, and horizon.[16] The name was chosen from 8,500 candidates and the company spent $300 million on marketing the new brand.[16][17]
Two months before the FCC gave final approval on the formation of Verizon Communications, Bell Atlantic formed Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with the British telecommunications company Vodafone in April 2000.[17][18][19] The companies established Verizon Wireless as its own business operated by Bell Atlantic, which owned 55% of the venture.[18] Vodafone retained 45% of the company.[18] The deal was valued at approximately $70 billion and created a mobile carrier with 23 million customers.[17][18] Verizon Wireless merged Bell Atlantic's wireless network, Vodafone's AirTouch and PrimeCo holdings, and the wireless division of GTE.[18][20][21] Due to its size, Verizon Wireless was able to offer national coverage at competitive rates, giving it an advantage over regional providers typical of the time.[17]
During its first operational year, Verizon Wireless released Mobile Web, an Internet service that allowed customers to access partner sites such as E*Trade, ABC News, ESPN, Amazon.com, Ticketmaster and MSN,[19] as well as the "New Every Two" program, which gave customers a free phone with every two-year service contract.[22] In another partnership with MSN in 2002, Verizon Wireless launched the mobile content service "VZW with MSN" and a phone that utilized the Microsoft Windows operating system.[23]
In August 2000, approximately 85,000 Verizon workers went on an 18-day labor strike after their union contracts expired.[24][25] The strike affected quarterly revenues,[26] resulting in Verizon Wireless' postponement of the company's IPO[26] (the IPO was ultimately cancelled in 2003, because the company no longer needed to raise revenue for Verizon Wireless due to increased profits[27] ), and created a backlog of repairs.[25] Verizon launched 3G service in 2002, which doubled the Internet speeds of the time to 144kb a second.[28] In August 2002, Verizon began offering local, long-distance, and mobile calling, as well as Internet service, in a bundle. It was initially only available to customers in New York and Massachusetts.[15]
2003–2005[edit]
In June 2003, Verizon Wireless backed an FCC-issued portability requirement that permitted consumers to take their phone numbers with them across carriers.[29] The company gained 1.5 million new subscribers the following quarter, partially due to the rule change.[30] The following year, in April 2004, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added Verizon Communications to its stock market index.[31] Verizon replaced telecom competitor AT&T, which had been a part of the index since the Great Depression.[31]
On December 22, 2004, mail servers at Verizon.net were configured not to accept connections from Europe, by default, in an attempt to reduce spam email that was originating from the region. Individual domains would only be unblocked upon request.[32]
Verizon launched its FiOS Internet service, which transmits data over fiber optic cables in Keller, Texas.[33] (Since divested Frontier) The company launched FiOS TV in September 2005, also in Keller, Texas. Twenty percent of qualified homes signed up by the end of the year.[34] By January 2006, FiOS offered over 350 channels in eight states, including 20 high-definition television channels as well as video on demand.[34]
MCI acquisition[edit]
Verizon began negotiations to purchase long distance carrier MCI in 2005. MCI accepted the company's initial $6.75 billion offer in February 2005, but then received a higher offer from Qwest Communications. Verizon increased its bid to $7.6 billion (or $23.50 a share), which MCI accepted on March 29, 2005.[35] The acquisition gave the company access to MCI's one million corporate clients and international holdings, expanding Verizon's presence into global markets.[35][36] As a result, Verizon Business was established as a new division to serve the company's business and government customers.[37] The FCC approved the deal on November 5, 2005, valuing it at $8.5 billion.[38] Verizon's 2006 revenues rose by as much as 20% following the purchase.[39]
2006–2010[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that Verizon, as well as AT&T and BellSouth, had given the National Security Agency landline phone records following the September 11 attacks.[40][41] That same month, a $50 billion lawsuit was filed by two lawyers on behalf of all Verizon subscribers for privacy violations and to prevent the company from releasing additional records without consent or warrant.[40][41] Protesters staged the National Day of Out(R)age due in part to the controversy.[42] Verizon stated in 2007 that the company fulfilled only "lawful demands" for information,[43] though also acknowledged surrendering customer information to government agencies without court orders or warrants 720 times between 2005 and 2007.[44]
Verizon won a lawsuit against Vonage in March 2007 for patent infringement. The three patents named were filed by Bell Atlantic in 1997 and relate to the conversion of IP addresses into phone numbers, a key technology of Vonage's business.[45] The company was awarded US$58 million in damages and future royalties.[45] Vonage later lost an appeal and was ordered to pay Verizon $120 million.[46]
In May 2007, Verizon acquired Cybertrust, a privately held provider of global information security services.[47] This purchase represented Verizon's intent to offer security solutions to its global enterprise customers.
Verizon Wireless reversed a controversial decision in September 2007 to deny NARAL Pro-Choice America a short code through which the organization could text consumers who had signed up for messaging from the group. They had initially refused the group access to a code by reserving the right to block "controversial or unsavory" messages.[48]
In November 2007, Verizon opened its networks for the first time to third party apps and devices,[49] a decision that allowed it to participate in the FCC's 2008 700 MHz auction of "open access" spectrum.[49][50] During that auction, the company bid $9.4 billion and won the bulk of national and local licenses for airwaves reaching approximately 469 million people.[50][51] Verizon utilized the increased spectrum for its 4G service.[50]
Verizon Wireless purchased wireless carrier Alltel for $28.1 billion in June 2008. The acquisition included 13 million customers, which allowed Verizon Wireless to surpass AT&T in number of customers and reach new markets in rural areas.[52]
In October 2010, Verizon Wireless paid $77.8 million in refunds and FCC penalties for overcharging 15 million customers for data services. The company stated the overcharges were accidental and only amounted to a few dollars per customer.[53][54]
On February 4, 2010, 4chan started receiving reports from Verizon Wireless customers that they were having difficulties accessing the site's image boards. 4chan administrators found that only traffic on port 80 to the boards.4chan.org domain was affected, leading them to believe that the block was intentional. On February 7, 2010, Verizon Wireless confirmed that 4chan.org was "explicitly blocked"[55] after Verizon's security and external experts detected sweep attacks coming from an IP address associated with the 4chan network. Traffic was restored several days later.[56]
In August 2010, the chairmen of Verizon and Google agreed that network neutrality should be defined and limited.[57][58]
Verizon introduced its 4G LTE network in 38 markets in December 2010, as well as in airports in seven additional cities. The company planned on a three-year continuous expansion of the 4G service.[59]
Selling wirelines (2005–2010 & 2015)[edit]
Between 2005 and 2010, Verizon divested wireline operations in several states in order to focus on its wireless, FiOS internet and FiOS TV businesses.[39] It sold 700,000 lines in Hawaii in 2005,[39][60] and spun off lines in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in January 2007 that were then purchased by FairPoint Communications for $2.72 billion.[39] In 2009, the company spun off wirelines in 14 states into a company that then merged with Frontier Communications in a deal valued at $8.6 billion.[61] Verizon also shed its telephone directory business in 2006.[62]
In May 2009, Verizon announced that it was selling off its wireline operations in Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. And in 2015, they announced they were selling its wireline operations in Texas, Florida, and California to Frontier.[63]
2011–present[edit]




Verizon logo, 2000–2015


On January 27, 2011, Verizon acquired Terremark, an information technology services company for $1.4 billion.[64] Ivan Seidenberg stepped down as Verizon's CEO on August 1, 2011. Lowell McAdam succeeded him.[65]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Verizon for its tax avoidance procedures after it spent $52.34 million on lobbying while collecting $951 million in tax rebates between 2008 and 2010 and making a profit of $32.5 billion. The same report also criticized Verizon for increasing executive pay by 167% in 2010 for its top five executives while laying off 21,308 workers between 2008 and 2010.[66] However, in its Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2012, Verizon reported having paid more than $11.1 billion in taxes (including income, employment and property taxes) from 2009 to 2011. In addition, the company reported in the 10-K that most of the drop in employment since 2008 was due to a voluntary retirement offer.[67]
In June 2012, as part of its strategy to expand into new growth areas in its wireless business, Verizon purchased Hughes Telematics—a company that produces wireless features for automobiles—for $612 million.[68] Also in June 2012, Verizon's E-911 service failed in the aftermath of the June 2012 derecho storm in several northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., with some problems lasting several days.[69] The FCC conducted an investigation[69] and in January 2013 released a report detailing the problems that led to the failure. Verizon reported that it had already addressed or was addressing a number of the issues related to the FCC report, including the causes of generator failures, conducting audits of backup systems and making its monitoring systems less centralized,[70] although the FCC indicated that Verizon still needed to make additional improvements.[71]
In July 2012, the FCC ruled that Verizon must stop charging users an added fee for using 4G smartphones and tablets as Wi-Fi hotspots (known as "tethering"). Verizon had been charging its customers, even those with "unlimited" plans, $20 per month for tethering. As part of the settlement, Verizon made a voluntary payment of $1.25 million to the U.S. Treasury.[72]
In August 2012, the Department of Justice approved Verizon's purchase of Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum from a consortium of cable companies, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, for $3.9 billion.[73] Verizon began expanding its LTE network utilizing these extra airwaves in October 2013.[74]
On June 5, 2013, The Guardian reported it had obtained an order by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and approved by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that required Verizon to provide the NSA with telephone metadata for all calls originating in the U.S.[75][76] Verizon Wireless was not part of the NSA data collection for wireless accounts due to foreign ownership issues.[77] (see also MAINWAY article)
In September 2013, Verizon purchased the 45% stake in Verizon Wireless owned by Vodafone for $130 billion.[78] The deal closed on February 21, 2014, becoming the third largest corporate deal ever signed, giving Verizon Communications sole ownership of Verizon Wireless.[79]
On January 14, 2014, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the FCC's net neutrality rules after Verizon filed suit against them in January 2010.[80][81] In June 2016, in an 184-page ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld, by a 2–1 vote, the FCC's net neutrality rules and the FCC's determination that broadband access is a public utility, rather than a luxury. AT&T and the telecom industry said that they would seek to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.[82]
On January 22, 2014 the Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon received more than 1,000 requests for information about its subscribers on national security grounds via National Security Letters. In total, Verizon received 321,545 requests from federal, state and local law enforcement for U.S. customer information.[83] In May 2015, Verizon agreed to pay $90 million "to settle federal and state investigations into allegations mobile customers were improperly billed for premium text messages."[84]
In August 2015, Verizon launched Hum, a service and device offering vehicle diagnostic and monitoring tools for vehicles.[85] On August 1, 2016, Verizon announced its acquisition of Fleetmatics, a fleet telematics system company in Dublin, Ireland, for $2.4 billion, to build products that it offers to enterprises for logistics and mobile workforces.[86] On September 12, 2016, Verizon announced its acquisition of Sensity, a startup for LED sensors, in an effort to bolster its IoT portfolio.[87]
In October 2016, Verizon was accused by Communications Workers of America of deliberately refusing to maintain its copper telephone service. The organization released internal memos and other documents stating that Verizon workers in Pennsylvania were being instructed to, in areas with network problems, migrate voice-only customers to VoiceLink—a system that delivers telephone service over the Verizon Wireless network, and not to repair the copper lines. VoiceLink has limitations, including incompatibility with services or devices that require the transmission of data over the telephone line, and a dependency on a battery backup in case of power failure. The memo warned that technicians who do not follow this procedure would be subject to "disciplinary action up to and including dismissal". A Verizon spokesperson responded to the allegations, stating that the company's top priority was to restore service to customers as quickly as possible, and that VoiceLink was a means of doing so in the event that larger repairs have to be done to the infrastructure. The spokesperson stated that it was "hard to argue with disciplining someone who intentionally leaves a customer without service".[88][89]
In November 2016, Verizon acquired mapping startup SocialRadar; its technology will be integrated with MapQuest.[90]
On January 26, 2017, The Washington Post reported that Verizon was in talks to merge with Charter Communications.[91]
On March 13, 2017, Verizon was sued by New York City for violating its cable franchise agreement, which required the provider to pass a fiberoptic network to all households in the city by June 30, 2014. Verizon disputed the claims, citing landlords not granting permission to install the equipment on their properties, and an understanding with the government that the fiber network would follow the same routes as its copper lines, and did not necessarily mean it would have to pass the lines in front of every property.[92]
On April 27, 2017 Verizon invested $10 million in Renovo Auto, a Campbell, California-based autonomous vehicle company.[93]
Acquisition of AOL and Yahoo[edit]
On May 12, 2015, Verizon announced they would acquire AOL at $50 per share, for a deal valued around $4.4 billion.[94][95] The following year, Verizon announced that it would acquire the core internet business of Yahoo for $4.83 billion.[96][97][98] Following the completion of the latter acquisition, Verizon intends to operate AOL and Yahoo under a new division known as Oath.[99] The sale does not include Yahoo's stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan.[100][101]
On March 16, 2017, Verizon announced that it would discontinue the e-mail services provided for its internet subscribers, and migrate them to AOL Mail.[102]
On May 23, 2017, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam confirms company's plan to launch a streaming TV service later 2017.[103] The integrated AOL-Yahoo operation, housed under the newly created Oath division, will be organized around key content-based pillars.[104]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo! shareholders approved the sale of some of the company's internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[105][106][107][11][12]
Divisions and Subsidiaries[edit]




Verizon service van


As of 2017, Verizon Communications' operations are divided into three divisions:
Media and Telematics[edit]
Media and Telematics will focus on integrating, scaling and growing Verizon’s portfolio of new businesses in digital media and telematics. Marni Walden will be responsible for quickly scaling these businesses into major contributors to Verizon’s future growth.
The combination of AOL with the assets of Yahoo under the Oath subsidiary will give Verizon more than 1.3 billion digital media users and generate $7 billion in revenue. Walden’s team will be responsible for integrating these businesses and building brand and market share in this growing market.
In addition, Walden will continue to lead Verizon’s integration and expansion of its Verizon Telematics (connected car and fleet management) portfolio. Through acquisitions of Hughes Telematics, Fleetmatics and Telogis, Verizon is already the world’s leading telematics provider, with customers in 30 countries around the globe.
Network and Technology[edit]
Hans Vestberg -- who served for six years as CEO of Ericsson, a multinational networking and telecommunications equipment and services company headquartered in Sweden that provides 35 percent of the world’s 2G, 3G and 4G mobile network infrastructures – will lead a U.S.-based team responsible for further developing the architecture for Verizon’s fiber-centric networks. Network and Technology will focus on delivering seamless network experiences for customers, whether on wifi, fiber, 4G, 5G or future technologies.
Verizon’s network assets consist of a 4G LTE network, a 5G test-bed in the U.S., the nation’s biggest residential fiber network, a global internet backbone and undersea cable network carrying much of the world’s internet traffic, and – with the recent acquisition of XO Communications – fiber assets in 45 of the top 50 markets in the U.S.
Customer and Product Operations[edit]
The Customer and Product Operations team will focus on operating and growing Verizon’s established businesses, which include: Verizon Wireless, Verizon Enterprise Solutions, Verizon Partner Solutions, Verizon Consumer Markets and Verizon Business Markets. These businesses generate more than $120 billion in annual revenue and serve more than 120 million customers.
John Stratton will focus on growing these core businesses, while accelerating Verizon’s shift toward a digital-first model. Stratton will also lead operations and sales for the Internet of Things products and services, including smart communities
Landline operating companies[edit]

Marketing campaigns[edit]
Since its inception, Verizon Communications has run several marketing campaigns, including:
Can you hear me now?[edit]
The "Can you hear me now?" campaign, which was created for the newly formed Verizon Wireless, started running in 2001 and featured actor Paul Marcarelli in the role of "Test Man," a character based on a Verizon network tester who travels the country asking "Can you hear me now?"[108][109][110] The campaign, originally conceived by the agency Bozell in New York, ran from early 2001 to September 2010.[111][112] Data from the technology tracking firm The Yankee Group shows that, in the early years of the campaign, net customers grew 10% to 32.5 million in 2002 and 15% more to 37.5 million in 2003. In addition, customer turnover dropped to 1.8% in 2001, down from 2.5% in 2000.[110] In 2011, Marcarelli parted ways with Verizon and is now a spokesperson for Sprint.[113]
There's a map for that[edit]
The "There's a map for that" campaign was launched in late 2009. It was designed as a parody of AT&T's "There's an app for that" adverts. The ads depicted a side-by-side comparison of Verizon and AT&T network coverage maps.[114] AT&T filed a lawsuit in Atlanta federal court early in November 2009, claiming that the coverage maps being used in the ads were misleading.[115] The suit was dropped later that month in conjunction with Verizon dropping a similar suit against AT&T.[114]
That's not cool[edit]
In 2009, Verizon joined with the Ad Council, in partnership with the Family Violence Prevention Fund and the Office on Violence Against Women, to create the "That's not cool" campaign. This public service advertising campaign was designed to help teens recognize and prevent digital dating abuse. Verizon ran the ads on its Wireless' Mobile Web service, Verizon FiOS Internet, and Verizon FiOS TV.[116][117]
Powerful Answers[edit]
In January 2013, Verizon launched the "Powerful Answers" campaign designed by agency McGarryBowen.[118] The campaign centered around a contest in which $10 million in prizes was offered to individuals for finding solutions to "the world's biggest challenges" by making use of Verizon's cloud, broadband, and wireless networks.[119][120] Winners of the inaugural competition were announced at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show.[119] Israel-based TinyTap won the education category, Smart Vision Labs of Newport, Rhode Island won in the healthcare category, and Mosaic Inc. of Oakland, California won in the sustainability category.[119]
Inspire Her Mind[edit]
Verizon launched its "Inspire Her Mind" ad in June 2014. The ad, created by the agency AKQA, was designed to encourage girls' interest in science, technology, engineering and math.[121] It aimed to address findings from the National Science Foundation, whose research showed that 66 percent of fourth-grade girls said they like science and math, yet only 18 percent of college students in engineering and math are women.[122][123]
Flipside Stories (#NeverSettle)[edit]
Verizon launched its Flipside Stories ad campaign in February 2015 featuring the #NeverSettle hashtag. The ads show dramatized "testimonials" of people with and without Verizon Wireless or Verizon FiOS services.[124][125][126]
Better Matters[edit]
In 2016, Verizon started using the slogan "Better Matters" in reference to its wireless and FiOS networks. For wireless, it relies heavily on its larger coverage map, and its RootMetrics RootScore awards. For FiOS, it relies on the fact that "FiOS is wired differently [than cable]", being that FiOS is fiber to the home, and its local competitors are not.
Corporate governance[edit]
Board of Directors[edit]
The current Board of Directors is comprised as follows as of February 2017:[127]

Corporate Responsibility[edit]
The Verizon Foundation is the philanthropic arm of Verizon Communications, donating about $70 million per year to nonprofit organizations, with a focus on education, domestic violence prevention, and energy management.[128] Verizon's educational initiatives have focused on STEM fields,[129] including: a national competition for students to develop mobile application concepts;[129] the Verizon Innovative Learning Schools program, providing professional development for teachers in underserved areas;[130] and providing students with wireless hardware and services as part of President Obama's ConnectED program.[131] The company also runs HopeLine, which has provided mobile phones to approximately 180,000 victims of domestic violence,[132][133] and a program that offers grants for victims of domestic violence to start or grow home-based businesses.[134] As part of an initiative to reduce the company's carbon intensity metrics by 50 percent by 2020, Verizon announced planned investment in solar panels and natural gas fuel cells at its facilities.[135] The increased capacity would make Verizon the leading solar power producer among U.S. communications companies.[136]
Sponsorships and venues[edit]
Verizon is the title sponsor of several large performance and sports venues as well as a sponsor of several major sporting organizations.
National Hockey League[edit]
In January 2007, Verizon secured exclusive marketing and promotional rights with the National Hockey League.[137] The deal was extended for another three years in 2012 and included new provisions for the league to provide exclusive content through Verizon's GameCenter app.[138]
Motorsports[edit]
In 2009 and 2010 Verizon sponsored Justin Allgaier in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, before they chose to opt out of a two-year-old NASCAR team sponsorship with Penske Racing in order to pursue an expanded presence with the IndyCar Series.[139] In March 2014 Verizon signed a multiyear deal making them the title sponsor of the IndyCar Series, now called the Verizon IndyCar Series.[140] In 2012 Verizon was featured on the side of both McLaren cars at the US Grand Prix.
National Football League[edit]
In late 2010, Verizon Communications joined with Vodafone Group in a joint partnership to replace Sprint as the official wireless telecommunications partner of the National Football League.[141] The four-year deal was estimated at $720 million. In June 2013, Verizon announced a four-year extension with the NFL in a deal reportedly valued at $1 billion. The new agreement gave Verizon the right to stream every NFL regular-season and playoff game.[142]
Venues[edit]
Verizon is the title sponsor for a number of sporting and entertainment arenas including the Verizon Center in Washington, DC;[143] the Verizon Arena in North Little Rock, Arkansas;[144] and the Verizon Center in Mankato, Minnesota.[145] SNHU Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire was originally known as the Verizon Wireless Arena until September 2016, when Southern New Hampshire University acquired the naming rights for a period of at least 10 years.[146]
Verizon is also currently the title sponsor of five entertainment amphitheaters in locations throughout the United States, four being individually referred to as the "Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre": in Irvine, California; Maryland Heights, Missouri; Selma, Texas; and Alpharetta, Georgia. The fifth is the Verizon Theatre at Grand Prairie, Texas.

Verizon Communications, Inc. ( listen (help·info)) (/vəˈraɪzən/ və-RY-zən) (simply known as Verizon, stylized as verizon), is an American multinational telecommunications conglomerate and the largest U.S. wireless communications service provider as of September 2014[update],[7] and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[8] The company is based at 1095 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan, New York City,[2] but is incorporated in Delaware.
What eventually became Verizon was founded as Bell Atlantic, which was one of the seven Baby Bells that were formed after AT&T Corporation was forced to relinquish its control of the Bell System by order of the Justice Department of the United States.[9] Bell Atlantic came into existence in 1984 with a footprint from New Jersey to Virginia, with each area having a separate operating company (consisting of New Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone, and C&P Telephone).
As part of the rebranding that the Baby Bells took in the mid-1990s, all of the operating companies assumed the Bell Atlantic name. In 1997, Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX. Although Bell Atlantic was the surviving company, the merged company moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to NYNEX's old headquarters in New York City.
In 2000, Bell Atlantic acquired GTE, which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic's footprint. Bell Atlantic, the surviving company, changed its name to "Verizon", a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for "truth") and horizon.[10]
As of 2016[update], Verizon is one of three companies that had their roots in the former Baby Bells. The other two, like Verizon, exist as a result of mergers among fellow former Baby Bell members. One, SBC Communications, bought out the Bells former parent AT&T Corporation and assumed the AT&T name. The other, CenturyLink, was formed initially in 2011 by the acquisition of Qwest (formerly named US West).
On June 13, 2017 Verizon announced that some of Yahoo! Inc's internet assets would be combined under a new subsidiary, Oath.[11][12]

History[edit]
Bell Atlantic (1983–2000)[edit]




Bell Atlantic's final logo used from 1997-2000






Bell Atlantic logo, 1983–1997


Bell Atlantic Corporation was created as one of the original Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) in 1984, during the breakup of the Bell System. Bell Atlantic's original roster of operating companies included:

The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania
New Jersey Bell
Diamond State Telephone
C&P Telephone (itself comprising four subsidiaries)

Bell Atlantic originally operated in the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia, as well as Washington, DC.
In 1994, Bell Atlantic became the first RBOC to entirely drop the original names of its original operating companies.
In 1996, CEO and Chairman Raymond W. Smith orchestrated Bell Atlantic's merger with NYNEX. When it merged, it moved its corporate headquarters from Philadelphia to New York City. NYNEX was consolidated into this name by 1997.
Acquisition of GTE (2000–2002)[edit]
Bell Atlantic changed its name to Verizon Communications in June 2000 when the Federal Communications Commission approved a US$64.7 billion acquisition of telephone company GTE, nearly two years after the deal was proposed in July 1998.[13] The approval came with 25 stipulations to preserve competition between local phone carriers, including investing in new markets and broadband technologies.[13] The new entity was headed by co-CEOs Charles Lee, formerly the CEO of GTE, and Bell Atlantic CEO Ivan Seidenberg.[13]
Upon the acquisition, Verizon became the largest local telephone company in the United States, operating 63 million telephone lines in 40 states.[14] The company also inherited 25 million mobile phone customers.[14] Additionally, Verizon offered internet services and long-distance calling in New York, before expanding long-distance operations to other states.[13][15]
The name Verizon derives from the combination of the words veritas, Latin for truth, and horizon.[16] The name was chosen from 8,500 candidates and the company spent $300 million on marketing the new brand.[16][17]
Two months before the FCC gave final approval on the formation of Verizon Communications, Bell Atlantic formed Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with the British telecommunications company Vodafone in April 2000.[17][18][19] The companies established Verizon Wireless as its own business operated by Bell Atlantic, which owned 55% of the venture.[18] Vodafone retained 45% of the company.[18] The deal was valued at approximately $70 billion and created a mobile carrier with 23 million customers.[17][18] Verizon Wireless merged Bell Atlantic's wireless network, Vodafone's AirTouch and PrimeCo holdings, and the wireless division of GTE.[18][20][21] Due to its size, Verizon Wireless was able to offer national coverage at competitive rates, giving it an advantage over regional providers typical of the time.[17]
During its first operational year, Verizon Wireless released Mobile Web, an Internet service that allowed customers to access partner sites such as E*Trade, ABC News, ESPN, Amazon.com, Ticketmaster and MSN,[19] as well as the "New Every Two" program, which gave customers a free phone with every two-year service contract.[22] In another partnership with MSN in 2002, Verizon Wireless launched the mobile content service "VZW with MSN" and a phone that utilized the Microsoft Windows operating system.[23]
In August 2000, approximately 85,000 Verizon workers went on an 18-day labor strike after their union contracts expired.[24][25] The strike affected quarterly revenues,[26] resulting in Verizon Wireless' postponement of the company's IPO[26] (the IPO was ultimately cancelled in 2003, because the company no longer needed to raise revenue for Verizon Wireless due to increased profits[27] ), and created a backlog of repairs.[25] Verizon launched 3G service in 2002, which doubled the Internet speeds of the time to 144kb a second.[28] In August 2002, Verizon began offering local, long-distance, and mobile calling, as well as Internet service, in a bundle. It was initially only available to customers in New York and Massachusetts.[15]
2003–2005[edit]
In June 2003, Verizon Wireless backed an FCC-issued portability requirement that permitted consumers to take their phone numbers with them across carriers.[29] The company gained 1.5 million new subscribers the following quarter, partially due to the rule change.[30] The following year, in April 2004, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added Verizon Communications to its stock market index.[31] Verizon replaced telecom competitor AT&T, which had been a part of the index since the Great Depression.[31]
On December 22, 2004, mail servers at Verizon.net were configured not to accept connections from Europe, by default, in an attempt to reduce spam email that was originating from the region. Individual domains would only be unblocked upon request.[32]
Verizon launched its FiOS Internet service, which transmits data over fiber optic cables in Keller, Texas.[33] (Since divested Frontier) The company launched FiOS TV in September 2005, also in Keller, Texas. Twenty percent of qualified homes signed up by the end of the year.[34] By January 2006, FiOS offered over 350 channels in eight states, including 20 high-definition television channels as well as video on demand.[34]
MCI acquisition[edit]
Verizon began negotiations to purchase long distance carrier MCI in 2005. MCI accepted the company's initial $6.75 billion offer in February 2005, but then received a higher offer from Qwest Communications. Verizon increased its bid to $7.6 billion (or $23.50 a share), which MCI accepted on March 29, 2005.[35] The acquisition gave the company access to MCI's one million corporate clients and international holdings, expanding Verizon's presence into global markets.[35][36] As a result, Verizon Business was established as a new division to serve the company's business and government customers.[37] The FCC approved the deal on November 5, 2005, valuing it at $8.5 billion.[38] Verizon's 2006 revenues rose by as much as 20% following the purchase.[39]
2006–2010[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that Verizon, as well as AT&T and BellSouth, had given the National Security Agency landline phone records following the September 11 attacks.[40][41] That same month, a $50 billion lawsuit was filed by two lawyers on behalf of all Verizon subscribers for privacy violations and to prevent the company from releasing additional records without consent or warrant.[40][41] Protesters staged the National Day of Out(R)age due in part to the controversy.[42] Verizon stated in 2007 that the company fulfilled only "lawful demands" for information,[43] though also acknowledged surrendering customer information to government agencies without court orders or warrants 720 times between 2005 and 2007.[44]
Verizon won a lawsuit against Vonage in March 2007 for patent infringement. The three patents named were filed by Bell Atlantic in 1997 and relate to the conversion of IP addresses into phone numbers, a key technology of Vonage's business.[45] The company was awarded US$58 million in damages and future royalties.[45] Vonage later lost an appeal and was ordered to pay Verizon $120 million.[46]
In May 2007, Verizon acquired Cybertrust, a privately held provider of global information security services.[47] This purchase represented Verizon's intent to offer security solutions to its global enterprise customers.
Verizon Wireless reversed a controversial decision in September 2007 to deny NARAL Pro-Choice America a short code through which the organization could text consumers who had signed up for messaging from the group. They had initially refused the group access to a code by reserving the right to block "controversial or unsavory" messages.[48]
In November 2007, Verizon opened its networks for the first time to third party apps and devices,[49] a decision that allowed it to participate in the FCC's 2008 700 MHz auction of "open access" spectrum.[49][50] During that auction, the company bid $9.4 billion and won the bulk of national and local licenses for airwaves reaching approximately 469 million people.[50][51] Verizon utilized the increased spectrum for its 4G service.[50]
Verizon Wireless purchased wireless carrier Alltel for $28.1 billion in June 2008. The acquisition included 13 million customers, which allowed Verizon Wireless to surpass AT&T in number of customers and reach new markets in rural areas.[52]
In October 2010, Verizon Wireless paid $77.8 million in refunds and FCC penalties for overcharging 15 million customers for data services. The company stated the overcharges were accidental and only amounted to a few dollars per customer.[53][54]
On February 4, 2010, 4chan started receiving reports from Verizon Wireless customers that they were having difficulties accessing the site's image boards. 4chan administrators found that only traffic on port 80 to the boards.4chan.org domain was affected, leading them to believe that the block was intentional. On February 7, 2010, Verizon Wireless confirmed that 4chan.org was "explicitly blocked"[55] after Verizon's security and external experts detected sweep attacks coming from an IP address associated with the 4chan network. Traffic was restored several days later.[56]
In August 2010, the chairmen of Verizon and Google agreed that network neutrality should be defined and limited.[57][58]
Verizon introduced its 4G LTE network in 38 markets in December 2010, as well as in airports in seven additional cities. The company planned on a three-year continuous expansion of the 4G service.[59]
Selling wirelines (2005–2010 & 2015)[edit]
Between 2005 and 2010, Verizon divested wireline operations in several states in order to focus on its wireless, FiOS internet and FiOS TV businesses.[39] It sold 700,000 lines in Hawaii in 2005,[39][60] and spun off lines in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in January 2007 that were then purchased by FairPoint Communications for $2.72 billion.[39] In 2009, the company spun off wirelines in 14 states into a company that then merged with Frontier Communications in a deal valued at $8.6 billion.[61] Verizon also shed its telephone directory business in 2006.[62]
In May 2009, Verizon announced that it was selling off its wireline operations in Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. And in 2015, they announced they were selling its wireline operations in Texas, Florida, and California to Frontier.[63]
2011–present[edit]




Verizon logo, 2000–2015


On January 27, 2011, Verizon acquired Terremark, an information technology services company for $1.4 billion.[64] Ivan Seidenberg stepped down as Verizon's CEO on August 1, 2011. Lowell McAdam succeeded him.[65]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Verizon for its tax avoidance procedures after it spent $52.34 million on lobbying while collecting $951 million in tax rebates between 2008 and 2010 and making a profit of $32.5 billion. The same report also criticized Verizon for increasing executive pay by 167% in 2010 for its top five executives while laying off 21,308 workers between 2008 and 2010.[66] However, in its Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2012, Verizon reported having paid more than $11.1 billion in taxes (including income, employment and property taxes) from 2009 to 2011. In addition, the company reported in the 10-K that most of the drop in employment since 2008 was due to a voluntary retirement offer.[67]
In June 2012, as part of its strategy to expand into new growth areas in its wireless business, Verizon purchased Hughes Telematics—a company that produces wireless features for automobiles—for $612 million.[68] Also in June 2012, Verizon's E-911 service failed in the aftermath of the June 2012 derecho storm in several northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., with some problems lasting several days.[69] The FCC conducted an investigation[69] and in January 2013 released a report detailing the problems that led to the failure. Verizon reported that it had already addressed or was addressing a number of the issues related to the FCC report, including the causes of generator failures, conducting audits of backup systems and making its monitoring systems less centralized,[70] although the FCC indicated that Verizon still needed to make additional improvements.[71]
In July 2012, the FCC ruled that Verizon must stop charging users an added fee for using 4G smartphones and tablets as Wi-Fi hotspots (known as "tethering"). Verizon had been charging its customers, even those with "unlimited" plans, $20 per month for tethering. As part of the settlement, Verizon made a voluntary payment of $1.25 million to the U.S. Treasury.[72]
In August 2012, the Department of Justice approved Verizon's purchase of Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum from a consortium of cable companies, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, for $3.9 billion.[73] Verizon began expanding its LTE network utilizing these extra airwaves in October 2013.[74]
On June 5, 2013, The Guardian reported it had obtained an order by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and approved by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that required Verizon to provide the NSA with telephone metadata for all calls originating in the U.S.[75][76] Verizon Wireless was not part of the NSA data collection for wireless accounts due to foreign ownership issues.[77] (see also MAINWAY article)
In September 2013, Verizon purchased the 45% stake in Verizon Wireless owned by Vodafone for $130 billion.[78] The deal closed on February 21, 2014, becoming the third largest corporate deal ever signed, giving Verizon Communications sole ownership of Verizon Wireless.[79]
On January 14, 2014, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the FCC's net neutrality rules after Verizon filed suit against them in January 2010.[80][81] In June 2016, in an 184-page ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld, by a 2–1 vote, the FCC's net neutrality rules and the FCC's determination that broadband access is a public utility, rather than a luxury. AT&T and the telecom industry said that they would seek to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.[82]
On January 22, 2014 the Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon received more than 1,000 requests for information about its subscribers on national security grounds via National Security Letters. In total, Verizon received 321,545 requests from federal, state and local law enforcement for U.S. customer information.[83] In May 2015, Verizon agreed to pay $90 million "to settle federal and state investigations into allegations mobile customers were improperly billed for premium text messages."[84]
In August 2015, Verizon launched Hum, a service and device offering vehicle diagnostic and monitoring tools for vehicles.[85] On August 1, 2016, Verizon announced its acquisition of Fleetmatics, a fleet telematics system company in Dublin, Ireland, for $2.4 billion, to build products that it offers to enterprises for logistics and mobile workforces.[86] On September 12, 2016, Verizon announced its acquisition of Sensity, a startup for LED sensors, in an effort to bolster its IoT portfolio.[87]
In October 2016, Verizon was accused by Communications Workers of America of deliberately refusing to maintain its copper telephone service. The organization released internal memos and other documents stating that Verizon workers in Pennsylvania were being instructed to, in areas with network problems, migrate voice-only customers to VoiceLink—a system that delivers telephone service over the Verizon Wireless network, and not to repair the copper lines. VoiceLink has limitations, including incompatibility with services or devices that require the transmission of data over the telephone line, and a dependency on a battery backup in case of power failure. The memo warned that technicians who do not follow this procedure would be subject to "disciplinary action up to and including dismissal". A Verizon spokesperson responded to the allegations, stating that the company's top priority was to restore service to customers as quickly as possible, and that VoiceLink was a means of doing so in the event that larger repairs have to be done to the infrastructure. The spokesperson stated that it was "hard to argue with disciplining someone who intentionally leaves a customer without service".[88][89]
In November 2016, Verizon acquired mapping startup SocialRadar; its technology will be integrated with MapQuest.[90]
On January 26, 2017, The Washington Post reported that Verizon was in talks to merge with Charter Communications.[91]
On March 13, 2017, Verizon was sued by New York City for violating its cable franchise agreement, which required the provider to pass a fiberoptic network to all households in the city by June 30, 2014. Verizon disputed the claims, citing landlords not granting permission to install the equipment on their properties, and an understanding with the government that the fiber network would follow the same routes as its copper lines, and did not necessarily mean it would have to pass the lines in front of every property.[92]
On April 27, 2017 Verizon invested $10 million in Renovo Auto, a Campbell, California-based autonomous vehicle company.[93]
Acquisition of AOL and Yahoo[edit]
On May 12, 2015, Verizon announced they would acquire AOL at $50 per share, for a deal valued around $4.4 billion.[94][95] The following year, Verizon announced that it would acquire the core internet business of Yahoo for $4.83 billion.[96][97][98] Following the completion of the latter acquisition, Verizon intends to operate AOL and Yahoo under a new division known as Oath.[99] The sale does not include Yahoo's stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan.[100][101]
On March 16, 2017, Verizon announced that it would discontinue the e-mail services provided for its internet subscribers, and migrate them to AOL Mail.[102]
On May 23, 2017, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam confirms company's plan to launch a streaming TV service later 2017.[103] The integrated AOL-Yahoo operation, housed under the newly created Oath division, will be organized around key content-based pillars.[104]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo! shareholders approved the sale of some of the company's internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[105][106][107][11][12]
Divisions and Subsidiaries[edit]




Verizon service van


As of 2017, Verizon Communications' operations are divided into three divisions:
Media and Telematics[edit]
Media and Telematics will focus on integrating, scaling and growing Verizon’s portfolio of new businesses in digital media and telematics. Marni Walden will be responsible for quickly scaling these businesses into major contributors to Verizon’s future growth.
The combination of AOL with the assets of Yahoo under the Oath subsidiary will give Verizon more than 1.3 billion digital media users and generate $7 billion in revenue. Walden’s team will be responsible for integrating these businesses and building brand and market share in this growing market.
In addition, Walden will continue to lead Verizon’s integration and expansion of its Verizon Telematics (connected car and fleet management) portfolio. Through acquisitions of Hughes Telematics, Fleetmatics and Telogis, Verizon is already the world’s leading telematics provider, with customers in 30 countries around the globe.
Network and Technology[edit]
Hans Vestberg -- who served for six years as CEO of Ericsson, a multinational networking and telecommunications equipment and services company headquartered in Sweden that provides 35 percent of the world’s 2G, 3G and 4G mobile network infrastructures – will lead a U.S.-based team responsible for further developing the architecture for Verizon’s fiber-centric networks. Network and Technology will focus on delivering seamless network experiences for customers, whether on wifi, fiber, 4G, 5G or future technologies.
Verizon’s network assets consist of a 4G LTE network, a 5G test-bed in the U.S., the nation’s biggest residential fiber network, a global internet backbone and undersea cable network carrying much of the world’s internet traffic, and – with the recent acquisition of XO Communications – fiber assets in 45 of the top 50 markets in the U.S.
Customer and Product Operations[edit]
The Customer and Product Operations team will focus on operating and growing Verizon’s established businesses, which include: Verizon Wireless, Verizon Enterprise Solutions, Verizon Partner Solutions, Verizon Consumer Markets and Verizon Business Markets. These businesses generate more than $120 billion in annual revenue and serve more than 120 million customers.
John Stratton will focus on growing these core businesses, while accelerating Verizon’s shift toward a digital-first model. Stratton will also lead operations and sales for the Internet of Things products and services, including smart communities
Landline operating companies[edit]
Verizon inherited multiple incumbent local exchange carriers that remain part of the company's operations, these are:

Bell System companies


Verizon Delaware
Verizon Maryland
Verizon New England (Massachusetts and Rhode Island)
Verizon New Jersey
Verizon New York

The "Can you hear me now?" campaign, which was created for the newly formed Verizon Wireless, started running in 2001 and featured actor Paul Marcarelli in the role of "Test Man," a character based on a Verizon network tester who travels the country asking "Can you hear me now?"[108][109][110] The campaign, originally conceived by the agency Bozell in New York, ran from early 2001 to September 2010.[111][112] Data from the technology tracking firm The Yankee Group shows that, in the early years of the campaign, net customers grew 10% to 32.5 million in 2002 and 15% more to 37.5 million in 2003. In addition, customer turnover dropped to 1.8% in 2001, down from 2.5% in 2000.[110] In 2011, Marcarelli parted ways with Verizon and is now a spokesperson for Sprint.[113]
There's a map for that[edit]
The "There's a map for that" campaign was launched in late 2009. It was designed as a parody of AT&T's "There's an app for that" adverts. The ads depicted a side-by-side comparison of Verizon and AT&T network coverage maps.[114] AT&T filed a lawsuit in Atlanta federal court early in November 2009, claiming that the coverage maps being used in the ads were misleading.[115] The suit was dropped later that month in conjunction with Verizon dropping a similar suit against AT&T.[114]
That's not cool[edit]
In 2009, Verizon joined with the Ad Council, in partnership with the Family Violence Prevention Fund and the Office on Violence Against Women, to create the "That's not cool" campaign. This public service advertising campaign was designed to help teens recognize and prevent digital dating abuse. Verizon ran the ads on its Wireless' Mobile Web service, Verizon FiOS Internet, and Verizon FiOS TV.[116][117]
Powerful Answers[edit]
In January 2013, Verizon launched the "Powerful Answers" campaign designed by agency McGarryBowen.[118] The campaign centered around a contest in which $10 million in prizes was offered to individuals for finding solutions to "the world's biggest challenges" by making use of Verizon's cloud, broadband, and wireless networks.[119][120] Winners of the inaugural competition were announced at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show.[119] Israel-based TinyTap won the education category, Smart Vision Labs of Newport, Rhode Island won in the healthcare category, and Mosaic Inc. of Oakland, California won in the sustainability category.[119]
Inspire Her Mind[edit]
Verizon launched its "Inspire Her Mind" ad in June 2014. The ad, created by the agency AKQA, was designed to encourage girls' interest in science, technology, engineering and math.[121] It aimed to address findings from the National Science Foundation, whose research showed that 66 percent of fourth-grade girls said they like science and math, yet only 18 percent of college students in engineering and math are women.[122][123]
Flipside Stories (#NeverSettle)[edit]
Verizon launched its Flipside Stories ad campaign in February 2015 featuring the #NeverSettle hashtag. The ads show dramatized "testimonials" of people with and without Verizon Wireless or Verizon FiOS services.[124][125][126]
Better Matters[edit]
In 2016, Verizon started using the slogan "Better Matters" in reference to its wireless and FiOS networks. For wireless, it relies heavily on its larger coverage map, and its RootMetrics RootScore awards. For FiOS, it relies on the fact that "FiOS is wired differently [than cable]", being that FiOS is fiber to the home, and its local competitors are not.
Corporate governance[edit]
Board of Directors[edit]
The current Board of Directors is comprised as follows as of February 2017:[127]

Corporate Responsibility[edit]
The Verizon Foundation is the philanthropic arm of Verizon Communications, donating about $70 million per year to nonprofit organizations, with a focus on education, domestic violence prevention, and energy management.[128] Verizon's educational initiatives have focused on STEM fields,[129] including: a national competition for students to develop mobile application concepts;[129] the Verizon Innovative Learning Schools program, providing professional development for teachers in underserved areas;[130] and providing students with wireless hardware and services as part of President Obama's ConnectED program.[131] The company also runs HopeLine, which has provided mobile phones to approximately 180,000 victims of domestic violence,[132][133] and a program that offers grants for victims of domestic violence to start or grow home-based businesses.[134] As part of an initiative to reduce the company's carbon intensity metrics by 50 percent by 2020, Verizon announced planned investment in solar panels and natural gas fuel cells at its facilities.[135] The increased capacity would make Verizon the leading solar power producer among U.S. communications companies.[136]
Sponsorships and venues[edit]
Verizon is the title sponsor of several large performance and sports venues as well as a sponsor of several major sporting organizations.
National Hockey League[edit]
In January 2007, Verizon secured exclusive marketing and promotional rights with the National Hockey League.[137] The deal was extended for another three years in 2012 and included new provisions for the league to provide exclusive content through Verizon's GameCenter app.[138]
Motorsports[edit]
In 2009 and 2010 Verizon sponsored Justin Allgaier in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, before they chose to opt out of a two-year-old NASCAR team sponsorship with Penske Racing in order to pursue an expanded presence with the IndyCar Series.[139] In March 2014 Verizon signed a multiyear deal making them the title sponsor of the IndyCar Series, now called the Verizon IndyCar Series.[140] In 2012 Verizon was featured on the side of both McLaren cars at the US Grand Prix.
National Football League[edit]
In late 2010, Verizon Communications joined with Vodafone Group in a joint partnership to replace Sprint as the official wireless telecommunications partner of the National Football League.[141] The four-year deal was estimated at $720 million. In June 2013, Verizon announced a four-year extension with the NFL in a deal reportedly valued at $1 billion. The new agreement gave Verizon the right to stream every NFL regular-season and playoff game.[142]
Venues[edit]
Verizon is the title sponsor for a number of sporting and entertainment arenas including the Verizon Center in Washington, DC;[143] the Verizon Arena in North Little Rock, Arkansas;[144] and the Verizon Center in Mankato, Minnesota.[145] SNHU Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire was originally known as the Verizon Wireless Arena until September 2016, when Southern New Hampshire University acquired the naming rights for a period of at least 10 years.[146]
Verizon is also currently the title sponsor of five entertainment amphitheaters in locations throughout the United States, four being individually referred to as the "Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre": in Irvine, California; Maryland Heights, Missouri; Selma, Texas; and Alpharetta, Georgia. The fifth is the Verizon Theatre at Grand Prairie, Texas.

Verizon Communications, Inc. ( listen (help·info)) (/vəˈraɪzən/ və-RY-zən) (simply known as Verizon, stylized as verizon), is an American multinational telecommunications conglomerate and the largest U.S. wireless communications service provider as of September 2014[update],[7] and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[8] The company is based at 1095 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan, New York City,[2] but is incorporated in Delaware.
What eventually became Verizon was founded as Bell Atlantic, which was one of the seven Baby Bells that were formed after AT&T Corporation was forced to relinquish its control of the Bell System by order of the Justice Department of the United States.[9] Bell Atlantic came into existence in 1984 with a footprint from New Jersey to Virginia, with each area having a separate operating company (consisting of New Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone, and C&P Telephone).
As part of the rebranding that the Baby Bells took in the mid-1990s, all of the operating companies assumed the Bell Atlantic name. In 1997, Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX. Although Bell Atlantic was the surviving company, the merged company moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to NYNEX's old headquarters in New York City.
In 2000, Bell Atlantic acquired GTE, which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic's footprint. Bell Atlantic, the surviving company, changed its name to "Verizon", a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for "truth") and horizon.[10]
As of 2016[update], Verizon is one of three companies that had their roots in the former Baby Bells. The other two, like Verizon, exist as a result of mergers among fellow former Baby Bell members. One, SBC Communications, bought out the Bells former parent AT&T Corporation and assumed the AT&T name. The other, CenturyLink, was formed initially in 2011 by the acquisition of Qwest (formerly named US West).
On June 13, 2017 Verizon announced that some of Yahoo! Inc's internet assets would be combined under a new subsidiary, Oath.[11][12]

History[edit]
Bell Atlantic (1983–2000)[edit]




Bell Atlantic's final logo used from 1997-2000






Bell Atlantic logo, 1983–1997


Bell Atlantic Corporation was created as one of the original Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) in 1984, during the breakup of the Bell System. Bell Atlantic's original roster of operating companies included:

The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania
New Jersey Bell
Diamond State Telephone
C&P Telephone (itself comprising four subsidiaries)

Bell Atlantic originally operated in the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia, as well as Washington, DC.
In 1994, Bell Atlantic became the first RBOC to entirely drop the original names of its original operating companies.
In 1996, CEO and Chairman Raymond W. Smith orchestrated Bell Atlantic's merger with NYNEX. When it merged, it moved its corporate headquarters from Philadelphia to New York City. NYNEX was consolidated into this name by 1997.
Acquisition of GTE (2000–2002)[edit]
Bell Atlantic changed its name to Verizon Communications in June 2000 when the Federal Communications Commission approved a US$64.7 billion acquisition of telephone company GTE, nearly two years after the deal was proposed in July 1998.[13] The approval came with 25 stipulations to preserve competition between local phone carriers, including investing in new markets and broadband technologies.[13] The new entity was headed by co-CEOs Charles Lee, formerly the CEO of GTE, and Bell Atlantic CEO Ivan Seidenberg.[13]
Upon the acquisition, Verizon became the largest local telephone company in the United States, operating 63 million telephone lines in 40 states.[14] The company also inherited 25 million mobile phone customers.[14] Additionally, Verizon offered internet services and long-distance calling in New York, before expanding long-distance operations to other states.[13][15]
The name Verizon derives from the combination of the words veritas, Latin for truth, and horizon.[16] The name was chosen from 8,500 candidates and the company spent $300 million on marketing the new brand.[16][17]
Two months before the FCC gave final approval on the formation of Verizon Communications, Bell Atlantic formed Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with the British telecommunications company Vodafone in April 2000.[17][18][19] The companies established Verizon Wireless as its own business operated by Bell Atlantic, which owned 55% of the venture.[18] Vodafone retained 45% of the company.[18] The deal was valued at approximately $70 billion and created a mobile carrier with 23 million customers.[17][18] Verizon Wireless merged Bell Atlantic's wireless network, Vodafone's AirTouch and PrimeCo holdings, and the wireless division of GTE.[18][20][21] Due to its size, Verizon Wireless was able to offer national coverage at competitive rates, giving it an advantage over regional providers typical of the time.[17]
During its first operational year, Verizon Wireless released Mobile Web, an Internet service that allowed customers to access partner sites such as E*Trade, ABC News, ESPN, Amazon.com, Ticketmaster and MSN,[19] as well as the "New Every Two" program, which gave customers a free phone with every two-year service contract.[22] In another partnership with MSN in 2002, Verizon Wireless launched the mobile content service "VZW with MSN" and a phone that utilized the Microsoft Windows operating system.[23]
In August 2000, approximately 85,000 Verizon workers went on an 18-day labor strike after their union contracts expired.[24][25] The strike affected quarterly revenues,[26] resulting in Verizon Wireless' postponement of the company's IPO[26] (the IPO was ultimately cancelled in 2003, because the company no longer needed to raise revenue for Verizon Wireless due to increased profits[27] ), and created a backlog of repairs.[25] Verizon launched 3G service in 2002, which doubled the Internet speeds of the time to 144kb a second.[28] In August 2002, Verizon began offering local, long-distance, and mobile calling, as well as Internet service, in a bundle. It was initially only available to customers in New York and Massachusetts.[15]
2003–2005[edit]
In June 2003, Verizon Wireless backed an FCC-issued portability requirement that permitted consumers to take their phone numbers with them across carriers.[29] The company gained 1.5 million new subscribers the following quarter, partially due to the rule change.[30] The following year, in April 2004, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added Verizon Communications to its stock market index.[31] Verizon replaced telecom competitor AT&T, which had been a part of the index since the Great Depression.[31]
On December 22, 2004, mail servers at Verizon.net were configured not to accept connections from Europe, by default, in an attempt to reduce spam email that was originating from the region. Individual domains would only be unblocked upon request.[32]
Verizon launched its FiOS Internet service, which transmits data over fiber optic cables in Keller, Texas.[33] (Since divested Frontier) The company launched FiOS TV in September 2005, also in Keller, Texas. Twenty percent of qualified homes signed up by the end of the year.[34] By January 2006, FiOS offered over 350 channels in eight states, including 20 high-definition television channels as well as video on demand.[34]
MCI acquisition[edit]
Verizon began negotiations to purchase long distance carrier MCI in 2005. MCI accepted the company's initial $6.75 billion offer in February 2005, but then received a higher offer from Qwest Communications. Verizon increased its bid to $7.6 billion (or $23.50 a share), which MCI accepted on March 29, 2005.[35] The acquisition gave the company access to MCI's one million corporate clients and international holdings, expanding Verizon's presence into global markets.[35][36] As a result, Verizon Business was established as a new division to serve the company's business and government customers.[37] The FCC approved the deal on November 5, 2005, valuing it at $8.5 billion.[38] Verizon's 2006 revenues rose by as much as 20% following the purchase.[39]
2006–2010[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that Verizon, as well as AT&T and BellSouth, had given the National Security Agency landline phone records following the September 11 attacks.[40][41] That same month, a $50 billion lawsuit was filed by two lawyers on behalf of all Verizon subscribers for privacy violations and to prevent the company from releasing additional records without consent or warrant.[40][41] Protesters staged the National Day of Out(R)age due in part to the controversy.[42] Verizon stated in 2007 that the company fulfilled only "lawful demands" for information,[43] though also acknowledged surrendering customer information to government agencies without court orders or warrants 720 times between 2005 and 2007.[44]
Verizon won a lawsuit against Vonage in March 2007 for patent infringement. The three patents named were filed by Bell Atlantic in 1997 and relate to the conversion of IP addresses into phone numbers, a key technology of Vonage's business.[45] The company was awarded US$58 million in damages and future royalties.[45] Vonage later lost an appeal and was ordered to pay Verizon $120 million.[46]
In May 2007, Verizon acquired Cybertrust, a privately held provider of global information security services.[47] This purchase represented Verizon's intent to offer security solutions to its global enterprise customers.
Verizon Wireless reversed a controversial decision in September 2007 to deny NARAL Pro-Choice America a short code through which the organization could text consumers who had signed up for messaging from the group. They had initially refused the group access to a code by reserving the right to block "controversial or unsavory" messages.[48]
In November 2007, Verizon opened its networks for the first time to third party apps and devices,[49] a decision that allowed it to participate in the FCC's 2008 700 MHz auction of "open access" spectrum.[49][50] During that auction, the company bid $9.4 billion and won the bulk of national and local licenses for airwaves reaching approximately 469 million people.[50][51] Verizon utilized the increased spectrum for its 4G service.[50]
Verizon Wireless purchased wireless carrier Alltel for $28.1 billion in June 2008. The acquisition included 13 million customers, which allowed Verizon Wireless to surpass AT&T in number of customers and reach new markets in rural areas.[52]
In October 2010, Verizon Wireless paid $77.8 million in refunds and FCC penalties for overcharging 15 million customers for data services. The company stated the overcharges were accidental and only amounted to a few dollars per customer.[53][54]
On February 4, 2010, 4chan started receiving reports from Verizon Wireless customers that they were having difficulties accessing the site's image boards. 4chan administrators found that only traffic on port 80 to the boards.4chan.org domain was affected, leading them to believe that the block was intentional. On February 7, 2010, Verizon Wireless confirmed that 4chan.org was "explicitly blocked"[55] after Verizon's security and external experts detected sweep attacks coming from an IP address associated with the 4chan network. Traffic was restored several days later.[56]
In August 2010, the chairmen of Verizon and Google agreed that network neutrality should be defined and limited.[57][58]
Verizon introduced its 4G LTE network in 38 markets in December 2010, as well as in airports in seven additional cities. The company planned on a three-year continuous expansion of the 4G service.[59]
Selling wirelines (2005–2010 & 2015)[edit]
Between 2005 and 2010, Verizon divested wireline operations in several states in order to focus on its wireless, FiOS internet and FiOS TV businesses.[39] It sold 700,000 lines in Hawaii in 2005,[39][60] and spun off lines in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in January 2007 that were then purchased by FairPoint Communications for $2.72 billion.[39] In 2009, the company spun off wirelines in 14 states into a company that then merged with Frontier Communications in a deal valued at $8.6 billion.[61] Verizon also shed its telephone directory business in 2006.[62]
In May 2009, Verizon announced that it was selling off its wireline operations in Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. And in 2015, they announced they were selling its wireline operations in Texas, Florida, and California to Frontier.[63]
2011–present[edit]




Verizon logo, 2000–2015


On January 27, 2011, Verizon acquired Terremark, an information technology services company for $1.4 billion.[64] Ivan Seidenberg stepped down as Verizon's CEO on August 1, 2011. Lowell McAdam succeeded him.[65]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Verizon for its tax avoidance procedures after it spent $52.34 million on lobbying while collecting $951 million in tax rebates between 2008 and 2010 and making a profit of $32.5 billion. The same report also criticized Verizon for increasing executive pay by 167% in 2010 for its top five executives while laying off 21,308 workers between 2008 and 2010.[66] However, in its Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2012, Verizon reported having paid more than $11.1 billion in taxes (including income, employment and property taxes) from 2009 to 2011. In addition, the company reported in the 10-K that most of the drop in employment since 2008 was due to a voluntary retirement offer.[67]
In June 2012, as part of its strategy to expand into new growth areas in its wireless business, Verizon purchased Hughes Telematics—a company that produces wireless features for automobiles—for $612 million.[68] Also in June 2012, Verizon's E-911 service failed in the aftermath of the June 2012 derecho storm in several northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., with some problems lasting several days.[69] The FCC conducted an investigation[69] and in January 2013 released a report detailing the problems that led to the failure. Verizon reported that it had already addressed or was addressing a number of the issues related to the FCC report, including the causes of generator failures, conducting audits of backup systems and making its monitoring systems less centralized,[70] although the FCC indicated that Verizon still needed to make additional improvements.[71]
In July 2012, the FCC ruled that Verizon must stop charging users an added fee for using 4G smartphones and tablets as Wi-Fi hotspots (known as "tethering"). Verizon had been charging its customers, even those with "unlimited" plans, $20 per month for tethering. As part of the settlement, Verizon made a voluntary payment of $1.25 million to the U.S. Treasury.[72]
In August 2012, the Department of Justice approved Verizon's purchase of Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum from a consortium of cable companies, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, for $3.9 billion.[73] Verizon began expanding its LTE network utilizing these extra airwaves in October 2013.[74]
On June 5, 2013, The Guardian reported it had obtained an order by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and approved by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that required Verizon to provide the NSA with telephone metadata for all calls originating in the U.S.[75][76] Verizon Wireless was not part of the NSA data collection for wireless accounts due to foreign ownership issues.[77] (see also MAINWAY article)
In September 2013, Verizon purchased the 45% stake in Verizon Wireless owned by Vodafone for $130 billion.[78] The deal closed on February 21, 2014, becoming the third largest corporate deal ever signed, giving Verizon Communications sole ownership of Verizon Wireless.[79]
On January 14, 2014, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the FCC's net neutrality rules after Verizon filed suit against them in January 2010.[80][81] In June 2016, in an 184-page ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld, by a 2–1 vote, the FCC's net neutrality rules and the FCC's determination that broadband access is a public utility, rather than a luxury. AT&T and the telecom industry said that they would seek to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.[82]
On January 22, 2014 the Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon received more than 1,000 requests for information about its subscribers on national security grounds via National Security Letters. In total, Verizon received 321,545 requests from federal, state and local law enforcement for U.S. customer information.[83] In May 2015, Verizon agreed to pay $90 million "to settle federal and state investigations into allegations mobile customers were improperly billed for premium text messages."[84]
In August 2015, Verizon launched Hum, a service and device offering vehicle diagnostic and monitoring tools for vehicles.[85] On August 1, 2016, Verizon announced its acquisition of Fleetmatics, a fleet telematics system company in Dublin, Ireland, for $2.4 billion, to build products that it offers to enterprises for logistics and mobile workforces.[86] On September 12, 2016, Verizon announced its acquisition of Sensity, a startup for LED sensors, in an effort to bolster its IoT portfolio.[87]
In October 2016, Verizon was accused by Communications Workers of America of deliberately refusing to maintain its copper telephone service. The organization released internal memos and other documents stating that Verizon workers in Pennsylvania were being instructed to, in areas with network problems, migrate voice-only customers to VoiceLink—a system that delivers telephone service over the Verizon Wireless network, and not to repair the copper lines. VoiceLink has limitations, including incompatibility with services or devices that require the transmission of data over the telephone line, and a dependency on a battery backup in case of power failure. The memo warned that technicians who do not follow this procedure would be subject to "disciplinary action up to and including dismissal". A Verizon spokesperson responded to the allegations, stating that the company's top priority was to restore service to customers as quickly as possible, and that VoiceLink was a means of doing so in the event that larger repairs have to be done to the infrastructure. The spokesperson stated that it was "hard to argue with disciplining someone who intentionally leaves a customer without service".[88][89]
In November 2016, Verizon acquired mapping startup SocialRadar; its technology will be integrated with MapQuest.[90]
On January 26, 2017, The Washington Post reported that Verizon was in talks to merge with Charter Communications.[91]
On March 13, 2017, Verizon was sued by New York City for violating its cable franchise agreement, which required the provider to pass a fiberoptic network to all households in the city by June 30, 2014. Verizon disputed the claims, citing landlords not granting permission to install the equipment on their properties, and an understanding with the government that the fiber network would follow the same routes as its copper lines, and did not necessarily mean it would have to pass the lines in front of every property.[92]
On April 27, 2017 Verizon invested $10 million in Renovo Auto, a Campbell, California-based autonomous vehicle company.[93]
Acquisition of AOL and Yahoo[edit]
On May 12, 2015, Verizon announced they would acquire AOL at $50 per share, for a deal valued around $4.4 billion.[94][95] The following year, Verizon announced that it would acquire the core internet business of Yahoo for $4.83 billion.[96][97][98] Following the completion of the latter acquisition, Verizon intends to operate AOL and Yahoo under a new division known as Oath.[99] The sale does not include Yahoo's stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan.[100][101]
On March 16, 2017, Verizon announced that it would discontinue the e-mail services provided for its internet subscribers, and migrate them to AOL Mail.[102]
On May 23, 2017, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam confirms company's plan to launch a streaming TV service later 2017.[103] The integrated AOL-Yahoo operation, housed under the newly created Oath division, will be organized around key content-based pillars.[104]
On June 8, 2017, Yahoo! shareholders approved the sale of some of the company's internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.[105][106][107][11][12]
Divisions and Subsidiaries[edit]




Verizon service van


As of 2017, Verizon Communications' operations are divided into three divisions:
Media and Telematics[edit]
Media and Telematics will focus on integrating, scaling and growing Verizon’s portfolio of new businesses in digital media and telematics. Marni Walden will be responsible for quickly scaling these businesses into major contributors to Verizon’s future growth.
The combination of AOL with the assets of Yahoo under the Oath subsidiary will give Verizon more than 1.3 billion digital media users and generate $7 billion in revenue. Walden’s team will be responsible for integrating these businesses and building brand and market share in this growing market.
In addition, Walden will continue to lead Verizon’s integration and expansion of its Verizon Telematics (connected car and fleet management) portfolio. Through acquisitions of Hughes Telematics, Fleetmatics and Telogis, Verizon is already the world’s leading telematics provider, with customers in 30 countries around the globe.
Network and Technology[edit]
Hans Vestberg -- who served for six years as CEO of Ericsson, a multinational networking and telecommunications equipment and services company headquartered in Sweden that provides 35 percent of the world’s 2G, 3G and 4G mobile network infrastructures – will lead a U.S.-based team responsible for further developing the architecture for Verizon’s fiber-centric networks. Network and Technology will focus on delivering seamless network experiences for customers, whether on wifi, fiber, 4G, 5G or future technologies.
Verizon’s network assets consist of a 4G LTE network, a 5G test-bed in the U.S., the nation’s biggest residential fiber network, a global internet backbone and undersea cable network carrying much of the world’s internet traffic, and – with the recent acquisition of XO Communications – fiber assets in 45 of the top 50 markets in the U.S.
Customer and Product Operations[edit]
The Customer and Product Operations team will focus on operating and growing Verizon’s established businesses, which include: Verizon Wireless, Verizon Enterprise Solutions, Verizon Partner Solutions, Verizon Consumer Markets and Verizon Business Markets. These businesses generate more than $120 billion in annual revenue and serve more than 120 million customers.
John Stratton will focus on growing these core businesses, while accelerating Verizon’s shift toward a digital-first model. Stratton will also lead operations and sales for the Internet of Things products and services, including smart communities
Landline operating companies[edit]
Verizon inherited multiple incumbent local exchange carriers that remain part of the company's operations, these are:

Bell System companies


Verizon Delaware
Verizon Maryland
Verizon New England (Massachusetts and Rhode Island)
Verizon New Jersey
Verizon New York
Verizon Pennsylvania
Verizon Virginia
Verizon Washington, DC


GTE companies


Verizon North (Pennsylvania)
Verizon South (Virginia and North Carolina)

Marketing campaigns[edit]
Since its inception, Verizon Communications has run several marketing campaigns, including:
Can you hear me now?[edit]
The "Can you hear me now?" campaign, which was created for the newly formed Verizon Wireless, started running in 2001 and featured actor Paul Marcarelli in the role of "Test Man," a character based on a Verizon network tester who travels the country asking "Can you hear me now?"[108][109][110] The campaign, originally conceived by the agency Bozell in New York, ran from early 2001 to September 2010.[111][112] Data from the technology tracking firm The Yankee Group shows that, in the early years of the campaign, net customers grew 10% to 32.5 million in 2002 and 15% more to 37.5 million in 2003. In addition, customer turnover dropped to 1.8% in 2001, down from 2.5% in 2000.[110] In 2011, Marcarelli parted ways with Verizon and is now a spokesperson for Sprint.[113]
There's a map for that[edit]
The "There's a map for that" campaign was launched in late 2009. It was designed as a parody of AT&T's "There's an app for that" adverts. The ads depicted a side-by-side comparison of Verizon and AT&T network coverage maps.[114] AT&T filed a lawsuit in Atlanta federal court early in November 2009, claiming that the coverage maps being used in the ads were misleading.[115] The suit was dropped later that month in conjunction with Verizon dropping a similar suit against AT&T.[114]
That's not cool[edit]
In 2009, Verizon joined with the Ad Council, in partnership with the Family Violence Prevention Fund and the Office on Violence Against Women, to create the "That's not cool" campaign. This public service advertising campaign was designed to help teens recognize and prevent digital dating abuse. Verizon ran the ads on its Wireless' Mobile Web service, Verizon FiOS Internet, and Verizon FiOS TV.[116][117]
Powerful Answers[edit]
In January 2013, Verizon launched the "Powerful Answers" campaign designed by agency McGarryBowen.[118] The campaign centered around a contest in which $10 million in prizes was offered to individuals for finding solutions to "the world's biggest challenges" by making use of Verizon's cloud, broadband, and wireless networks.[119][120] Winners of the inaugural competition were announced at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show.[119] Israel-based TinyTap won the education category, Smart Vision Labs of Newport, Rhode Island won in the healthcare category, and Mosaic Inc. of Oakland, California won in the sustainability category.[119]
Inspire Her Mind[edit]
Verizon launched its "Inspire Her Mind" ad in June 2014. The ad, created by the agency AKQA, was designed to encourage girls' interest in science, technology, engineering and math.[121] It aimed to address findings from the National Science Foundation, whose research showed that 66 percent of fourth-grade girls said they like science and math, yet only 18 percent of college students in engineering and math are women.[122][123]
Flipside Stories (#NeverSettle)[edit]
Verizon launched its Flipside Stories ad campaign in February 2015 featuring the #NeverSettle hashtag. The ads show dramatized "testimonials" of people with and without Verizon Wireless or Verizon FiOS services.[124][125][126]
Better Matters[edit]
In 2016, Verizon started using the slogan "Better Matters" in reference to its wireless and FiOS networks. For wireless, it relies heavily on its larger coverage map, and its RootMetrics RootScore awards. For FiOS, it relies on the fact that "FiOS is wired differently [than cable]", being that FiOS is fiber to the home, and its local competitors are not.
Corporate governance[edit]
Board of Directors[edit]
The current Board of Directors is comprised as follows as of February 2017:[127]
Lowell McAdam, CEO of Verizon (chairman of the board)

Corporate Responsibility[edit]
The Verizon Foundation is the philanthropic arm of Verizon Communications, donating about $70 million per year to nonprofit organizations, with a focus on education, domestic violence prevention, and energy management.[128] Verizon's educational initiatives have focused on STEM fields,[129] including: a national competition for students to develop mobile application concepts;[129] the Verizon Innovative Learning Schools program, providing professional development for teachers in underserved areas;[130] and providing students with wireless hardware and services as part of President Obama's ConnectED program.[131] The company also runs HopeLine, which has provided mobile phones to approximately 180,000 victims of domestic violence,[132][133] and a program that offers grants for victims of domestic violence to start or grow home-based businesses.[134] As part of an initiative to reduce the company's carbon intensity metrics by 50 percent by 2020, Verizon announced planned investment in solar panels and natural gas fuel cells at its facilities.[135] The increased capacity would make Verizon the leading solar power producer among U.S. communications companies.[136]
Sponsorships and venues[edit]
Verizon is the title sponsor of several large performance and sports venues as well as a sponsor of several major sporting organizations.
National Hockey League[edit]
In January 2007, Verizon secured exclusive marketing and promotional rights with the National Hockey League.[137] The deal was extended for another three years in 2012 and included new provisions for the league to provide exclusive content through Verizon's GameCenter app.[138]
Motorsports[edit]
In 2009 and 2010 Verizon sponsored Justin Allgaier in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, before they chose to opt out of a two-year-old NASCAR team sponsorship with Penske Racing in order to pursue an expanded presence with the IndyCar Series.[139] In March 2014 Verizon signed a multiyear deal making them the title sponsor of the IndyCar Series, now called the Verizon IndyCar Series.[140] In 2012 Verizon was featured on the side of both McLaren cars at the US Grand Prix.
National Football League[edit]
In late 2010, Verizon Communications joined with Vodafone Group in a joint partnership to replace Sprint as the official wireless telecommunications partner of the National Football League.[141] The four-year deal was estimated at $720 million. In June 2013, Verizon announced a four-year extension with the NFL in a deal reportedly valued at $1 billion. The new agreement gave Verizon the right to stream every NFL regular-season and playoff game.[142]
Venues[edit]
Verizon is the title sponsor for a number of sporting and entertainment arenas including the Verizon Center in Washington, DC;[143] the Verizon Arena in North Little Rock, Arkansas;[144] and the Verizon Center in Mankato, Minnesota.[145] SNHU Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire was originally known as the Verizon Wireless Arena until September 2016, when Southern New Hampshire University acquired the naming rights for a period of at least 10 years.[146]
Verizon is also currently the title sponsor of five entertainment amphitheaters in locations throughout the United States, four being individually referred to as the "Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre": in Irvine, California; Maryland Heights, Missouri; Selma, Texas; and Alpharetta, Georgia. The fifth is the Verizon Theatre at Grand Prairie, Texas.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Charting a bull-trend whipsaw, Nasdaq’s key reversal fuels sector rotation (again)
Technically speaking, familiar 2017 cross currents have resurfaced to conclude July.  On a headline basis, the Nasdaq Composite has formed its latest key reversal — a bearish technical pattern, in isolation — while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has concurrently tagged its latest all-time high against a still bullish bigger-picture backdrop.

Dow ends at record, but tech slump weighs on S&P 500, Nasdaq

Jul. 27, 2017 at 5:05 p.m. ET

Breaking            
Nasdaq Composite pivots sharply lower in afternoon trade
The Nasdaq on Thursday afternoon turned sharply lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was most recently down 72 points, or 1.1%, as the index was jolted suddenly lower, with some investors and traders citing a combination of concerns about valuations and market participants taking some money off the table following a brisk run for the high-flying sector. The abrupt retreat for the tech-centric gauge came as the other main equity benchmarks pared an earlier advance. All three equity gauges notched all-time intraday trading highs at the open, but the S&P 500 index  was most recently down 0.5% at 2,464 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  traded flat at 21,710, buoyed by gains in Verizon Communication , while Dow component and tech-giant Apple Inc. , sold off by 2.7%, cutting about 30 points from the blue-chip gauge.  The popular tech-focused exchange-traded fund, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF , was trading down 1% in recent trade.

Breaking            
Popular biotech ETF on pace for steepest daily drop in a month 
A popular way to bet on the the biotech sector was trading sharply lower on Thursday and on track to register its worst one-day in a month. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF was down 1.8%, led by an about 11% decline in Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Corp.  and Novavax Inc. , with its shares off 6.4% on the session. The drop for the biotech group came amid a broad and sudden selloff in the overall technology sector  that put the Nasdaq Composite Index  on pace to log it sharpest daily fall since June 9, when the tech sector underwent a similar retreat, fueled on concerns about valuations among some of the group's biggest companies, including Apple Inc. , Amazon.com Inc., and Facebook Inc., which reported better-than-expected earnings late Wednesday. More broadly, the overall market was under pressure but off its worst levels of the day. The S&P 500 index  was down 0.3% at 2,469, the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was trading modestly higher, fueled by gains in Verizon Communications Inc. , which saw its shares up nearly 8%, more than offsetting a 2.3% decline in Apple's stock.

Telecom sector on track for biggest one-day gain since 2009
The S&P telecom sector soared on Thursday and was on track for its biggest one-day percentage increase in more than eight years, boosted by strong results from some of its biggest components. The sector jumped 4.8%, its best day since March 2009, according to FactSet data. Thursday marks the third straight daily increase for the industry, a period over which it has gained about 8%. Despite that, telecom remains one of the laggards of the year, down 8.7% for 2017. The rally came after Verizon Communications Inc.  popped 6.9% on the back of second-quarter revenue that beat expectations, as well as an expansion of its unlimited wireless data plan, which helped it recover from a net subscriber loss in the first quarter. AT&T Inc.  gained 3.3% on Thursday, building on a rally the shares had on Wednesday, which came in the wake of the company's own results, when it posted a profit that topped analyst forecasts. The S&P 500  dipped 0.4% on Thursday.

Verizon matches profit expectations but beats on revenue
Verizon Communications Inc.  reported second-quarter net profit of $4.48 billion, or $1.07 a share, compared with $831 million, or 17 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 96 cents, matching the FactSet consensus. Revenue rose to $30.55 billion from $30.53 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $29.86 billion as a 2.2% decline in service revenue to $26.25 billion was offset by a 16% increase in wireless equipment revenue to $4.30 billion. Wireless retail postpaid connections base grew 1.2%, while retail prepaid connections increased 1.4%. Total retail postpaid churn was 0.94%, in line with a year ago. Wireline revenue rose 1.2% to $7.8 billion, with Fios revenue rising 4.4% to $2.9 billion. The company expects 2017 organic revenue to be consistent with 2016. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has tumbled 17% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 9.9%.
