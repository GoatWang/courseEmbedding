About BRT













 
 










Lucian BoldeaVice President & General Manager of Additives & Functional Products, Eastman Chemical Company 




Child of the Cold War Builds American FutureGrowing up in Communist Romania, Lucian Boldea came to believe that the United States was the place where anyone could succeed, regardless of background. After the Ceausescu regime fell, that belief inspired him and his wife to leave home to attend the University of West Florida on student visas. After receiving political asylum and permanent residency, Dr. Boldea earned a doctorate from the University of Florida before beginning his career at Eastman Chemical.
He became a U.S. citizen in 2000 and completed his Master of Business Administration degree at the Wharton School in 2007. Dr. Boldea has been at the forefront of several cutting-edge Eastman products, including sustainable plastics that bring great benefits to customers, and he continues to look for innovative applications. Today, he oversees a unit that generates almost $2 billion in annual revenue. In his view, two valuable attributes immigrants bring to the U.S. economy are their hunger to succeed and willingness to take calculated risks — traits he clearly exemplifies.

That historic success is at risk, however, because the current U.S. immigration system is broken. The U.S. Congress has been considering reforms to strengthen national security and boost economic growth for years but so far has failed to act.This report outlines the economic benefits that accompany sensible immigration reform and tells the stories of several business leaders who came to America as immigrants.
