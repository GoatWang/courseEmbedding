PRODUCT LITERATURE







Designed for the Patient, Optimized for the LabTM
While many systems claim sample-to-answer capabilities, only ePlex is able to integrate the entire process from order-to-report to better realize the patient and laboratory benefits of rapid, multiplex molecular diagnostics. ePlex offers a number of unique solutions that were thoughtfully engineered to address the biggest challenges facing the clinical laboratory and to support hospital systems in delivering patient centered, value-based care.




True Sample-to-Answer Workflow
ePlex is the only sample-to-answer system on the market that streamlines the diagnostic workflow from physician order entry to the release of the final report with accurate, actionable test results. ePlex is the True Sample-to-Answer Solution because it improves true turnaround time with end-to-end integration that includes:

Bi-directional LIS to automate and accelerate order entry and results reporting
Random and continuous access and a modular, scalable design to ensure capacity that meets peak season demand
Independently validated shortest hands-on time in the lab
Remote alerts to notify practitioners test results are available
Intuitive user interface with guided workflows to enable operation on every shift
Remote service capability to minimize system downtime and ensure patients and physicians have access to rapid test results

Order-to-Report Is what Matters Most

The green time stamps are commonly documented in hospital and laboratory information systems. ePlex is designed for order-to-report with a LEAN workflow by eliminating manual steps and staging of samples that often delay and complicate efficient test processing and results reporting. 
Designed for the Patient: Reduce Avoidable Medical Errors
Preventable medical errors are now the third leading cause of death in the United States at more than 250,000 per year.[1] Automating information transfer has been shown to be effective in reducing many common errors, including patient identity checking and order transcription.[2] ePlex is uniquely designed with patient safety features to help address this challenge in the lab. ePlex’s patented positive patient ID feature reduces the potential for patient sample mix-up. ePlex’s shortest hands-on-time and guided workflows reduce the chance of pre-analytical errors. Bi-directional LIS can help eliminate transcription errors in both order entry and results reporting. With ePlex, labs and physicians can have confidence that they have the right patient, with the right test, and the right result…every time.
Optimized for the Lab: Maximize Lab Efficiency by Reducing Administrative Overhead
Monitoring and reporting quality control testing is both a requirement and a best practice to ensure accuracy of patient testing results and compliance with lab standards. With on-board QC tracking capabilities, ePlex provides safeguards to ensure labs not only run controls when required, but can easily track and report compliance. In addition to automated QC tracking, ePlex provides the following compliance and data management tools:

Integrated data analytics to easily monitor lab performance
On-demand epidemiology reports for export and simplified analysis in Excel
Fully configurable, auto-release of test results

All of these unique capabilities of the ePlex system allow Lab Directors to reduce their time spent on routine administrative tasks and focus their limited resources on high-value activities that impact patient care and the bottom line.
