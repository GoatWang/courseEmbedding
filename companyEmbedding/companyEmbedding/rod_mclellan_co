Fewer acres for orchids

Back to Gallery
















1998-01-26 04:00:00 PDT SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO; SAN MATEO -- THE ROD MCLELLAN CO., world renowned for its orchids, has sold its 35-acre "Acres of Orchids" in South San Francisco to a housing developer and has moved its retail store and headquarters to San Mateo. 





The move marks the end of an era and reflects a Bay Area trend. The company was the last major agricultural operation on the Bay side of the Peninsula, where farming and flower-growing once flourished. As development pressures increased, however, the land became too valuable to use for agriculture. Housing tracts replaced greenhouses. 



Latest business videos




 
That scenario is being repeated in South San Francisco, where Greystone Homes has bought the land on Hickey Boulevard and plans to build 179 detached houses, said Steve Delva, president of Greystone's South Bay division. In addition, Midpeninsula Housing Coalition plans 34 attached houses to be sold at below-market rates. Also planned is a 10-acre city park. 
The fact that BART plans to build a new station across the street as part of its airport extension makes the land even more valuable. Delva said, "We think it's an excellent location." 
McLellan's new 10,000-square-foot site in San Mateo opened Saturday. It includes a retail store, corporate offices and propagation lab, where orchids are grown by germinating seed or by cloning, said Marvell Sherrill, director of tours. 
Customers also can drop off and pick up their orchids for McLellan's orchid spa, a boarding service that provides optimum conditions for orchids when they're not blooming. 
While those orchids were formerly tended in McLellan's South City greenhouses, now they're going to Watsonville, where the company is consolidating its growing operations. The company has had 112 acres in Watsonville since 1963 and initially grew carnations and garlic. As its orchid business expanded, the company grew the plants in both South City and Watsonville. 
Lower land costs and consolidation will mean lower production costs, said Jeff Britt, president and chief executive officer of Rod McLellan Co. 
Another McLellan product, decorative preserved eucalyptus, also will be produced solely in Watsonville. 
Production of McLellan's other major product, bagged Supersoilpotting mix, will move from South City to a new plant in Lathrop, near Stockton. This location will mean better access to Sacramento as well as the Bay Area because traffic is so bad on the freeways around South City that trucks are often delayed, Britt said. 
Supersoil, which the company developed with researchers at the University of California in 1955, also is made at a company-owned plant in Bakersfield, which will remain open. 
McLellan will keep its retail store at the San Francisco Flower Market and hopes to open a new store near the South City property. The present South City store will remain open through the end of February. 
The company has about 250 employees. Of the 85 in South City, some will move with the company, while others have opted not to, Britt said. He said, "It really hasn't had a huge effect on our employee base." 
In the meantime, the land is being annexed to the city, which has approved the tentative subdivision map, Delva said. Demolition will begin soon, and home sales are expected to start in August or September, with occupancy early next year. Prices probably will range from the low $300,000s to the low $400,000s. 
McLellan officials had realized a move was inevitable, but it came sooner than expected when Greystone expressed interest, Britt said. 
Lorraine McLellan, vice chairman of the board of directors and widow of Rod McLellan, said her husband had told her the land probably would be have to sold after his death, but that was 21 years ago. "I'm pleased we could keep it so long," she said last week during a preview of the San Mateo store. 
She and three other family members - daughter Lorraine McLellan, vice president; daughter Lynn McLellan, secretary; and grandson Roderick Taylor, who represents the family's fifth generation - serve on the board of directors along with chairman William Eames. Except for the San Mateo site, which is leased, the family owns all of the land and leases it to the company, Britt said. 
The McLellan saga began in 1850 when Rod's grandfather, David, arrived in San Francisco from New York and bought 20 acres at what is now Third and Market streets. There he grew fruits and vegetables for The City's booming population. 
In 1860 he traded that land for 188 acres in what is now the Hillsdale area of San Mateo, where he started a dairy and produce business. His son, Edgar, began growing flowers in 1888. 
Nine years later Edgar bought seven acres in Burlingame to grow roses, carnations and chrysanthemums. By 1900 the E.W. McLellan Co. had 324,000 square feet of greenhouses, the most west of the Mississippi. In 1915 the company became the first to ship cut flowers on ice in railroad cars. 
His son Rod became involved after graduating from Stanford in 1926, the same year that the company moved to South City. 
Rod McLellan produced more floral business firsts in 1937 when he developed the gardenia corsage and began using paper shipping cartons and cellophane wrapping. 
Orchids entered the picture in 1940, when Rod realized 
"they could be grown by anyone; they weren't just the domain of the rich," said tour director Sherrill. 
He established the Rod McLellan Co. in 1948 and published its first "Acres of Orchids" catalog. Since then the company has attracted thousands of visitors every year from all walks of life, including royalty like Queen Ingrid of Denmark (1960) and first lady Mamie Eisenhower (1957), who has a McLellan orchid named in her honor. 
With that history, "people are so sad that the South San Francisco venue is not going to be there," said Sherrill, who has been with the company for 25 years. 
However, to celebrate its 101st anniversary as a family-owned business and to emphasize its intentions to stay on the Peninsula, the company will host an orchid show March 14 and 15 at the San Mateo County Expo Center in San Mateo. 

The new Rod McLellan Co. store is at 914 S. Claremont St., San Mateo; (650) 373-3900. Its Web address is www.rodmclellan.com.&lt;

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
