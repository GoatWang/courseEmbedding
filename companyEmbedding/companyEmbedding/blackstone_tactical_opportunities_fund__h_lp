Tactical Opportunities
Differentiated Investment Solutions for a Rapidly Evolving Investment Landscape





Overview
Tactical Opportunities (Tac Opps) is an opportunistic investing platform seeking to capitalize on global investment opportunities that are time-sensitive, complex, or in dislocated markets where we believe risk is fundamentally mispriced. 

The Tac Opps’ team invests globally across asset classes, industries and geographies, and can leverage intellectual capital from across Blackstone’s businesses to inform investment due diligence and execution. Our flexible investment mandate enables us to dynamically adjust to changing market conditions and to focus on deep value opportunities that may be overlooked by less nimble market participants.








				A Message from David Blitzer, Senior Managing Director & Head of Tactical Opportunities
			



















Flexible Mandate

Designed to take advantage of a rapidly evolving investment landscape, we serve as a source of differentiated investment opportunities for our investors and an innovative solution provider to sellers.


 
Breadth
Leveraging the strength of the firm’s global platform, our portfolios provide exposure to timely investment themes across asset classes, industries and geographies.



Nimble and Decisive
Identifying and executing on diverse opportunities requires a broad, deep and experienced perspective balanced by the ability to act in a nimble, decisive manner.






Blackstone's leading alternative asset platform yields compelling insights and synergies that inform our investment decisions.







 Tactical Opportunities  In a world where the most attractive investment opportunities are often short-lived and difficult to source, analyze and execute, Tac Opps is positioned to thrive. Tac Opps is one of the world’s leading opportunistic investment platforms with a dedicated team of 60 professionals who marshal the resources and insights of Blackstone to identify and execute differentiated investments on behalf of our investors. As our investments typically fall outside traditional alternative investment categories, we strive to deliver less correlated returns and lower volatility across our portfolio. 
  




 Our Approach    Investment flexibility Tactical Opportunities’ flexible mandate is designed to allow our team to adjust to changing market circumstances, facilitating the creation of a balanced, complementary portfolio with an attractive overall risk/return profile.   Strong governance The Tactical Opportunities Investment Committee is comprised of the firm’s senior leadership to ensure strong firm-wide collaboration, robust investment analysis and a consistent investment approach.   Taking advantage of synergies The Tactical Opportunities team leverages intellectual capital embedded in businesses that cover every major alternative asset. This enables us to assess and synthesize a broad range of market information into actionable investment ideas.   Focus on managing risk With little tolerance for capital loss, our investment process seeks to identify opportunities with asymmetric return profiles often characterized by downside protection.

Private Equity
Putting Capital to Work, Making Companies Stronger.





Overview Our investments span a wide range of industries around the world in established and growth-oriented businesses alike. Playing a vital role in helping companies realize their growth potential, we uncover value by identifying great companies and enhancing their performance by providing patient capital and operating support to strong management teams. Our approach helps our portfolio companies grow core businesses, launch new initiatives, make transformative acquisitions and upgrade technologies and systems to support their long-term strategy.   
We provide more than just capital. We seek to make the companies we invest in stronger through a bottoms-up strategy of transformation. Crucially, we bring the expertise of our Portfolio Operations Group to provide strategic guidance on a variety of operational improvements, including revenue growth, procurement, leadership development, lean process and IT optimization, energy sustainability, and employee health care.
  







				A Message from Joe Baratta, Global Head of Private Equity
			










DRIVING
Transformative Impact  We strive to create value by investing in great businesses where our capital, strategic insight, global relationships and operational support can drive transformation that unlocks the company’s potential. In addition to benefiting our investors, the improvements in growth and global competitiveness benefit workers, communities and other stakeholders. 
We are patient investors who practice the art of the long view, and are committed to achieving the best long-term outcomes for our businesses and our investors. 
 


DISCIPLINED
Due Diligence  Our investment approach is based on a disciplined due diligence process that measures risk while identifying the catalysts for increased value. We purposefully engage only in friendly transactions and work with talented management teams to achieve transformative results. Our specialized Portfolio Operations Group helps to maximize value by improving processes across varied elements of a business’s operations.    
The returns that these investments earn for our investors – pension funds, academic and charitable institutions, governments and other institutions, as well as retail investors – help to secure and grow the assets needed to support retirees and fund essential programs.
 











$100 billion AUM

Blackstone is a global leader in private equity, with $100 billion in assets under management through our opportunistic and private equity segments.






82 Portfolio 
Companies 
Our portfolio of 82 companies with over $66 billion in combined annual revenue employs more than 511,000 people around the world.


 
 Over 250 Private Equity 
Professionals

Our team of over 250 private equity professionals around the world are based out of offices in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
All numbers are as of June 30, 2017. 








 $37.5billion
Available Capital to Invest




“ “We are constantly looking for situations where we see something, or we are able to add value in a way that our competitors don't. Our people feel the obligation to go out there and find special situations where we can intervene to drive change.”  - Joseph Baratta Global Head of Private Equity   











   
Pro-active, targeted sourcing  Sector-based, theme-driven deal sourcing is the primary responsibility and mandate of our investment professionals. We aim to source high-quality and proprietary investment opportunities by proactively developing and leveraging strong relationships with companies and key deal intermediaries. At regular pipeline meetings with sector teams, we review potential opportunities and determine what resources – both internal and external – are best suited to pursue those opportunities.  




   
Value-oriented discipline In determining value for new investments, we focus on a business’s current outlook and judge the predictability of that outlook over time, while also factoring in what we can do for the business to drive even better outcomes after our acquisition. 
  




   
Transformational operating improvements 
We actively target companies in which significant value can be created through clear strategic and operational change, and created our Portfolio Operations Group to provide hands-on support to help our portfolio companies become more productive, efficient and valuable. Once a company joins the portfolio, we help management craft a plan to reach their full potential over the long term, and provide assistance as they put this plan into practice.  




Our Portfolio


We are proud of Blackstone’s role as a positive economic catalyst for the companies in our Corporate Private Equity portfolio. We work to identify, invest in and enhance the value of great businesses.


Global in scope, our Corporate Private Equity group has offices in Toronto, New York, London, Dusseldorf, Mumbai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Sydney. As of June 30, 2017, our Corporate Private Equity funds held interests in 82 companies.

Traditional Leveraged Buyouts 












Traditional Leveraged Buyouts 

We pursue control leveraged buyouts of both large and mid-cap companies globally

                Our large buyouts tend to be in companies of global scale with strong brands and high relative market shares, where we can still drive growth and operating improvements.  Our mid-cap buyouts tend to be of companies that are differentiated vs. larger competitors and have protected market niches and multiple avenues of growth and operating improvements.

Blackstone Group Invests $700 Million in Greek Shipping Group With New LPG Joint Venture





















–

Stephen Schwarzman / Getty
–
Greek shipping company Eletson Holdings (Eletson),    which is based in Paraeus,    has just announced a US$700 million deal with giant,    publicly listed,    investment management company Blackstone Group to create a new LPG (liquid petroleum gas) shipping company as a joint venture.
The Greek element of the Euro crisis has played out over the last two years with great drama and potential for tragedy – fittingly enough given the contributions to literature of Aeschylous,    Sophocles and Euripides. As it turns out however,    it seems the Euro has survived,    Greece has survived and many of the players on the scene there are picking themselves up again off the floor ready to do business. US private equity is looking very seriously at Europe in general these days,    as European banks are anxiously reducing the size of their balance sheets to come with new regulatory ratio requirements under Basel III. And the bravest of US private equity firms are looking at Greece in particular with great interest,    buying their bonds and investing in their businesses.
Repairing balance sheets which became strained during the crisis becomes a priority even for Greek shipping companies,    who stand at the apex of the totem pole in Greek industrial circles. As a result the words “recapitalization” or “joint venture” become music to the ears of a shipping magnate,    and so it has been with mid sized Greek shipping company Eletson.
Eletson has therefore made a deal with giant,    publicly listed,    investment management company Blackstone Group to create a new LPG (liquid petroleum gas) shipping company – which will be called Eletson Gas.
Eletson is contributing its existing fleet of five medium-size LPG gas carriers to the new company,    and Blackstone will inject US$700 million of equity capital to finance the growth of the company through the construction of several more new ships,    and by purchase of an existing ship as well. Eletson will provide operating and technical management for the Eletson Gas LPG fleet.
Eletson Gas,    which is to be majority owned by Eletson,    has now signed contracts with shipbuilders to build eight new vessels. Five 12,   000 cubic metre,    ethylene-capable,    semi refrigerated ships will be built at Korea’s Hyundai Mipo Dockyard. Three 22,   000 cubic metre,    ethylene-capable,    semi refrigerated ships will also be built at China’s Sinopacific Offshore & Engineering shipyard. Eletson Gas also holds options to build two more 22,   000 cubic metre ships at Sinopacific. All eight of the first of these new-build vessels are scheduled to be delivered in 2015 and early 2016. Eletson also expects to purchase one existing 22,   000 cubic metre semi refrigerated ship.
Lascarina J. Karastamati,    President of Eletson Holdings,    said,    “We are delighted to partner with Blackstone as we look to expand Eletson’s existing LPG platform. Our partner’s expertise and global reach,    including its exposure to the U.S. energy sector,    will help to grow the business successfully into new and existing markets.”
Jasvinder Khaira of Blackstone’s Tactical Opportunities Fund replied for his part: “Through this partnership,    we are committed to building a best-in-class,    global owner and operator of LPG vessels that is a leader in its market segment,   “…”We are thrilled to join Eletson and its strong management team in this new venture.
 
About Eletson
Eletson owns and operates one of the world’s largest privately owned fleets of medium and long-range product tankers. The fleet presently comprises twenty-two double hull tankers. In addition,    majority-owned Eletson Gas presently owns and operates five LPG/Ammonia carriers,    which is the world’s most modern and second largest midsize LPG fleet. Eletson Gas has acquired a semi refrigerated handymax vessel (40-50,   000 tons) and has on order eight brand-new handysize (<40,   000 tons) and handymax ethylene-capable semi refrigerated vessels scheduled for delivery in 2015 and 2016,    with options for two more. All of the Eletson and Eletson Gas ships are Greek flagged
