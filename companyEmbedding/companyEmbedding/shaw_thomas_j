Further, his strategic knowledge of the Company and its competitive environment arising from his ongoing services as its CEO is vital to the successful supervision of the Company by the Board of Directors.  Finally, Mr. Shaw's educational background in both Engineering and Accounting is helpful to Board deliberations.  In addition to his duties overseeing our Management, he continues to lead our design team in product development of other medical safety devices that utilize, among other things, his unique patented friction ring technology.  Mr. Shaw has extensive experience in industrial product design and has developed several solutions to complicated mechanical engineering challenges.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

The Lord gave us all two very special people in Frances and J.C. ['Jake'] Thomas, and He has now called them both Home. They have touched so many lives, most certainly mine.




			
				
				Posted by: Jim Minor - Denver,  NC   Mar 20, 2017
			










How sorry I am to learn of Frances' passing.  I lived across the street from Jake and Frances for 15 years, and they were wonderful neighbors.  I have fond memories of them both, and when I think of my days gardening and keeping up the house on Chaney Road, they are front and center in my thoughts.

In Benic v New South Wales [2010] NSWSC 1039 the risk of harm was the plaintiff, a police officer, suffering psychiatric injury as a result of receiving a threat to his life in the course of his work. The alleged breach was the failure to provide prompt and appropriate psychological or psychiatric assistance. The court noted that whether the risk was not insignificant was to be analysed from the perspective of the defendant and was to be prospective: at [411]. The evidence was that the Commissioner of Police had taken a series of steps to address stress, including psychiatric illness, amongst police officers. This evidence satisfied Garling J that the risk of psychiatric illness from the defendant’s perspective was not insignificant: at [414]. It was reasoned that the risk of psychiatric harm:

… might affect up to one third of officers exposed to traumatic events, and it was seen by the Commissioner as sufficient to warrant the expenditure of monies … I doubt that the Commissioner would have taken these steps if the risk was an insignificant one: at [414].

Shaw v Thomas [2010] NSWCA 169 involved a 10-year-old child being injured by falling off a bunk bed when staying at a friend’s house. The risk was defined as the respondent ‘falling and injuring himself whilst descending from the top bunk of the bed in question’: at [45]. It was held that no reference should be made to the relevant Australian Standards in respect of bunk beds or a publication by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that referred to evidence of bunk bed injuries to children, when assessing whether the risk was not insignificant as the appellants had no knowledge of such. At [46] Macfarlan JA stated that whether the risk was not insignificant ‘was to be determined by reference to the circumstances of which reasonable people in the position of the appellants would have been aware’. 11.45 Section 48(3) of the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) attempts to give some guidance on the meaning of...

...Assessment  Item  1
Supreme Court of New South Wales Decision

Peter Smythe v Vincent Thomas (2007) NSW SC 844 (3 August 2007)

Part A

Question 1
The case was heard in the New South Wales Supreme Court, Equity Division.

Question 2
The name of the judge was Nigel Rein
Nigel Rein was an Acting Judge of the Supreme Court of NSW (Equity Division). 

Question 3
Plaintiff is: Peter Smythe
Council for the Plaintiff is: B Kasep
Defendant is: Vincent
 Thomas
Council for the Defendant is: DM Lowenstein

Question 4
The particular circumstances which led Acting Judge Rein to doubt the credibility of the defendant’s version of events is noted in the judgement under 18(3) by no mention of an offer of $150000 being made by the plaintiff  in the defendants affidavit but such being said in an answer whilst the defendant was cross examined. Furthermore 18(5)contradicts the defendants version by stating that the aircraft would not be sold unless the buyer inspected  it, however the defendant listed said aircraft on ebay for sale without buyer should inspect first indicator. 18(6) further shows contradiction in regard to inspection of said aircraft by the defendant.
Question 5
The components of his argument were point 22(1),(2),(3) & (4) being contracts existed only between ebay and plaintiff and ebay and defendant but not plaintiff and defendant; plaintiff only made offer to treat; as time of payment was to be negotiated no...

...consideration and sufficiency within the context of contract law, with references to the matter of Thomas v Thomas from 1842.    In assigning significance to these matters, it is noted that Sir John Patteson, a judge in 1830 who was appointed to the Court of King's Bench, (later the Privy Council) was knighted shortly after making the landmark decision regarding the doctrine of consideration in the case of Thomas.  The ratio decidendi
 in Thomas,    was ‘[c]onsideration must be of value and involve benefit or detriment’ postulating further that ‘although consideration must be sufficient, it need not be adequate.’  
 
CONSIDERATION  
Eleanor Thomas sued the executors of her husband’s estate where the court ruled the agreement entered into, was neither nominal nor a voluntary gift, but sufficient in consideration.   Consideration is the intention to create legal relations through a bargaining process affording a mutual exchange of a promise for a promise.    In Beaton v McDivitt,  it is evident that if a transfer was a gift, the essential component of bargaining would be absent.   Consideration must be quid pro quo  and result in a transfer between the promisor and the promisee,  and result in the creation of a relationship of cause and effect.   

Only the parties involved can enforce the agreement.  Consideration may also be a promise to refrain from doing something as...

                                                Essay on John Locke V Thomas Hobbes                                            

...Locke and Hobbes both had detailed accounts as to what the state of nature is.  I will start with Hobbes and what he felt the state of nature is made up of.  Hobbes believed in defining the state of nature as what it is instead of what it ought to be.  So he focused in on the nature of people and came to a very descriptive conclusion as to how survive in this particular state of nature.  He stated that man was equal in ambition, cruelty, and treachery, which in turn makes humans equal in
 the ability to kill each other.  This is important because he believes that people can not live in peace in the state of nature because of those reasons.  Also because of this he states that there are three principals of quarrels; competition, diffidence, and glory.  Hobbes feels that because of human nature these three reasons to fight would take over and make the state of nature a state of war.
            Locke also has an opinion to the state of nature.  He feels that men would respond to things and people around them with reason and rationality.  Therefore he feels that a state of nature for the most part peaceful and pleasant.  He also states that the natural law would guide humans in a state of nature.  He thinks that people know right from wrong and are capable of doing both but it is upon the individual to carry out these values.  
            In order to deal with the state of nature each of the two suggests a social contract.  Whatever the contract is should be the obligations...

Thomas Wolsey fell from his extreme height of power in 1529, but how? Wolsey had famously grown from a butchers son to one of the most powerful people in England at that time so what brought him to be accused of treason. Henry VIII trusted Wolsey as his right hand man for a long time and it has been argued that he saw him as his personal trust worthy servant but there have also
 been different opinions stating that Wolsey was the one who was manipulating the King to get what he wanted as he had an extreme amount of power, some argue even more than the King. "Wolsey was destroyed because he had become a liability in the eyes of the king and was expendable. This has fundamental implications for reassessing his relationship with Henry." (John Guy).
When Wolsey wasn’t able to get a divorce for King Henry and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, he become angry and disappointed with him as he had not been able to do what he requested, even though Wolsey did offer a different solution to the problem Henry refused to listen and demanded that he was to get it done his way. As Wolsey wasn’t able to give the king what he demanded and was unable to change his mind on how to address the subject, he lost a lot of Henrys respect and trust. Peter Gwynn argues that Wolsey’s disappointing the king was the main reason that he fell as he states ‘the real architect of Wolsey’s fall is...

Thomas Hariot was said to have been born in Oxford. He was a mathematician who studied at St. Mary's Hall. After Hariot had achieved his degree he ventured to London. There he was employed by Sir Walter Ralegh to go on the expedition to Virginia. Sir Walter Ralegh had been
 interested in colonizing America as early as 1560. This trip, which he organized, was meant to get an accurate map of Virginia as well as document it. The expedition lasted 12 months through the years 1585-86. Once returning to London, Thomas Hariot wrote about what he found in "A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia".
        Hariot's report consisted of many various things he found in Virginia. Some things that Hariot describes consist of: cedar, wine, dear skins, iron, copper, Pearl, sugar cane, and oade. All of these things Hariot describe as being useful and it is implied that it is plentiful. Hariot lists all the positive aspects of Virginia. "Oade. A thing of so great vent and vse amongst English Diers, which cannot bee yeelded sufficiently in our owne countrey for spare of ground; may bee planted in Virginia, there being ground enough.

Market Analysis

There is an increasing number of dormitories, apartments and condominium units that are housing students and families. This is because of the presence of universities, colleges, and secondary schools in the area.

They also observed the growing number of business establishments such as Internet cafes, laundromats, cafeterias, sari-sari stores and water stations.

In the map of proposed site illustrated by Mar, there are 2 schools near the area,
 the University of Sto. Tomas and Dominican School and three adjacent building that has 150 residents in Building A, Building B has 50 residents and 70 for Building X. These indicates that the location is accessible to these target markets.

Mar also obtained some demographic information from the National Statistics Office. There is a total of 1.6 M population around the area with the highest age group from 20-29 that compose mostly of college students and young professionals.

Industry Analysis

Convenience stores started in the early 1980s and became prevalent in areas with high foot traffic. These included sites near schools, churches, public maarkets, residential communities, gasoline stations, and loading and unloading areas of public transport. Most of these stores offered ready to eat siopao, hotdogs, donuts, cold and hot drinks. A small place was even provided for customers who wish to eat inside the store.

Mar went around Sampaloc to survey the business establishments in the...

...﻿But These Things Also

‘But these things also’ brings “to the centre of attention what has previously overlooked”, as Judy Kendall writes. Thomas explores his fascination with the unimportant in this poem and looks at the connection and merging together of Spring and Winter. Much like his other poetry, here, Thomas struggles to put his finger on precisely what he means. This is shown by his inability to separate and distinguish between the two seasons. 
	The
 poem begins with the first two lines focussing on Spring, however, by following this with two lines focussing on Winter, Thomas explodes our first expectations of usual ‘spring poetry’ of bright and beautiful images. Instead,  he catches the limbo between the two seasons and we are presented with the idea of the grass being ‘long dead’ and ‘greyer now’. This pessimistic tone is not what one usually connotes with springtime, but with the cold and bleak winter. By putting the images of the two seasons so close together in this stanza, Thomas reinforces his presentation of their connection. The last line of the stanza, ‘than all the winter it was’, changes the natural syntax of the words. The stress focuses of ‘it was’, emphasising what has past, which creates a sense of longing, introducing the idea that, like in ‘March’, Thomas is desperate to find ‘the key’  the last two lines of the first stanza finish with the words ‘now and ‘was’, bringing...

Assignment 2 – Weekly Case Law Critique

WEEK 2 CASE LAW ON
DONOGHUE V STEVENSON (1932)
Summary
On August 26th 1928, Donoghue (plaintiff) and a friend were at a case in Glasgow, Scotland. Her friend
ordered / purchased a bottle of ginger beer for Donoghue. The bottle was in an opaque bottle (dark glass
material) as Donoghue was not aware of the contents. After, Donoghue drank some and her friend lifted
the bottle to pour the
 remainder of the ginger beer into the glass. A remains of a snail in a state of
decomposition dropped out of the bottle into the glass. Donoghue later complained of stomach pain and
was diagnosed with gastroenteritis and being in a state of severe shock by a doctor. Donoghue
subsequently took legal action seeking £500 damages against the manufacturer of the ginger beer,
Stevenson (Defendant). She was unsuccessful at trial and appealed the decision to the House of Lords.
Issue
1. Is there liability in negligence for injury caused by another in the absence of a contract?
2. Does the manufacturer of a product owe duty of care to the consumer to take reasonable care that
the product is free from defect?
Judgement
The issue was complex because her friend had purchased the drink, and that a contract had not been
breached. So Donoghue’s lawyers had to claim that Stevenson had a duty of care to his consumers and
that he had caused injury through negligence. The leading judgement, delivered by Lord...
