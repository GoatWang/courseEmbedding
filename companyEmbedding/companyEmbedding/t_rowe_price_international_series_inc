Asia Opportunities Fund


      Subscribe





Invests at least 80% in stocks issued by companies that are located in, or that have economic ties to, Asia (excluding Japan). May purchase stocks issued by companies of any size, but typically focuses on large-and mid-cap stocks. The fund is "nondiversified", meaning it may invest a greater portion of assets in a single company and own more of the company's voting securities than is permissible for a "diversified" fund. Further, the fund’s relatively limited geographic orientation and exposure to emerging markets increase its risk level. The fund price is subject to market risk in addition to risks associated with unfavorable currency exchange rates and political or economic uncertainty abroad.

The fund invests in companies of any size, but generally seeks stocks of larger companies that are undervalued. Investing in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves special risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. International securities tend to be more volatile and less liquid than investments in U.S. securities and may lose value because of adverse political, social, or economic developments overseas, or due to changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. In addition, international investments are subject to settlement practices and regulatory and financial reporting standards that differ from those of the U.S.

Invests at least 80% in common stocks, with an emphasis on large-capitalization stocks that have a strong track record of paying dividends or that are believed to be undervalued. Broadly diversify sector exposure to minimize volatility. By investing in common stocks, the fund is subject to declines in stock prices. The value approach carries the risk that the market may not realize a security's value for a long time, or that a stock judged to be undervalued is actually appropriately priced.

Invests at least 80% in the common stocks of financial services companies. The fund may also invest in companies deriving substantial revenues from conducting business with the industry. The fund is less diversified than stock funds investing in a broader range of industries, so it could experience significant volatility. However, dividends paid by financial services firms may moderate this risk. Financial services companies may be hurt when interest rates rise sharply and may be vulnerable to rapidly rising inflation.

Global Consumer Fund


      Subscribe





Invests in securities issued by companies in the consumer sector. The adviser has flexibility in allocating investments between the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors and seeks to identify the best risk adjusted opportunities for the fund based on market conditions and consumer sentiment.Investing in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves special risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. International securities tend to be more volatile and less liquid than investments in U.S. securities and may lose value because of adverse local, political, social, or economic developments overseas, or due to changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A fund that focuses its investments in specific industries or sectors is more susceptible to developments affecting those industries and sectors than a more broadly diversified fund. Because the fund invests significantly in companies connected to the consumer staples and consumer discretionary sectors, the fund may perform poorly during a downturn in one or more consumer-related industries and is more exposed to the economic, business or other developments that could adversely impact those industries.

Global Growth Stock Fund


      Subscribe





Invests in target blue chip companies in at least five different countries, including the U.S. It takes a growth approach to investing, seeking opportunities that have potential for above-average earnings. Since the fund invests overseas, its foreign holdings could be affected by declining foreign currencies or adverse political or economic events. The fund’s growth approach carries risk: Because growth funds have higher valuations and lower dividend yields than slower-growth or cyclical companies, the share price volatility may be higher. As such, fund prices could decline further in market downturns than those of non growth-oriented funds.

Global Real Estate Fund

Invests primarily in stocks of real estate companies throughout the world, providing exposure in at least five different countries, including the United States. Changes in tax or zoning laws, overbuilding, environmental issues, changes in interest rates, the quality of property management (REITs), and other factors could hurt the fund. Real estate is affected by general economic conditions. When growth is slowing, demand for property decreases and prices may decline. Rising interest rates, which drive up mortgage and financing costs, can restrain construction and buying and selling activity and may reduce the appeal of real estate investments. Since the fund can invest substantially in foreign securities, it will also be subject to the risks inherent in non-U.S. issues.

      Subscribe





Individuals seeking long-term growth of capital who can accept the possibility of more share price volatility than is associated with larger companies or the broad market averages. Appropriate for both regular and tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs.Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by small-and mid-cap companies, it is likely to be more volatile than a fund that focuses on securities issued by larger companies. Small- and medium-sized companies often have less experienced management, narrower product lines, more limited financial resources, and less publicly available information than larger companies. In addition, smaller companies are typically more sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions and their securities may be difficult to trade. The fund's strategy relies heavily on quantitative models to analyze data and construct investment portfolios. Relying on quantitative models entails the risk that the models themselves may be limited or incorrect, that the data that the models rely on may be incorrect or incomplete, and that the adviser may not be successful in selecting companies for investment or determining the weighting of particular stocks.

Mutual Fund

Real Assets Fund


      Subscribe





Invests at least 80% in "real assets" and securities of companies that are engaged in activities related to, or have substantial ownership of, real assets. Real assets include any assets that have physical properties, real estate, basic materials, equipment, utilities and infrastructure, and commodities. Because the fund focuses its investments in certain industries that involve activities related to real assets, the fund is more susceptible to adverse developments affecting one or more of these industries and may perform poorly during a downturn in any of those industries. During periods of low inflation, the fund's goal of investing in companies that offer some protection from accelerating inflation could lessen relative returns and cause the fund to underperform other stock funds. Since there is no limit on the fund's investments in foreign securities or emerging markets, it will be subject to the risk that some holdings will lose value because of unfavorable currency exchange rates or adverse political or economic developments overseas.

Invests in both growth and value stocks. Stocks will be selected that have the most favorable combination of company fundamentals, earnings potential and valuation. Stocks with growth characteristics can have sharp price declines as a result of earnings disappointments. Stocks with value characteristics carry the risk that the market will not recognize their intrinsic value for a long time or that they are actually appropriately priced at a low level. The fund’s fairly concentrated portfolio means poor performance by several fund holdings could affect the fund more than a fund holding a larger number of companies.

Invests at least 80% in bonds, and seeks to offer some protection against rising interest rates and a low correlation with the equity markets. May invest in a variety of debt securities, obligations issued by U.S. and foreign corporations, as well as bank loans.The Fund is subject to the risk that rising interest rates will cause bond prices to fall. The fund is “nondiversified” so its share price can be expected to fluctuate more than that of a “diversified” fund. Investments in foreign bonds are subject to special risks, including potentially adverse overseas political and economic developments, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. The fund’s use of derivatives may expose it to additional volatility in comparison to investing directly in bonds and other debt securities.

Invests in a broadly diversified global portfolio of investments including developed and emerging market equities, a wide range of global developed and emerging market fixed income strategies, plus various diversifying strategies providing exposure to hedge funds, currency hedging, and equity index call writing.The fund is subject to the unique risks of international investing, including unfavorable currency exchange rates and political or economic uncertainty abroad. To the extent the fund has investments in emerging market countries; it will be subject to abrupt and severe price declines. The portfolio’s investments in alternative investments and hedge funds are difficult to value and monitor when compared with more traditional investments, and may increase the fund’s liquidity risks. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Derivatives are used in the fund for selective market exposures.

The T. Rowe Price Funds - I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund (the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown above) and the actual performance results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed over the periods shown, would have been higher. 



All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Please visit a fund’s profile page for additional information on its investment objective, strategies, and risks. 



The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown next to the gross and net expense ratio values above. Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus. 



Closed to new investors except for a direct rollover from a retirement plan into a T. Rowe Price IRA invested in this fund.



Certain limited exceptions may apply to these scenarios. The funds reserve the right, when in the judgment of T. Rowe Price, it is not adverse to a fund's interest, to permit certain types of investors to open new accounts in a fund, to impose further restrictions, or to close a fund to any additional investments, all without notice.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

The verification report is available upon request. Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
    

      TRP is a U.S. investment management firm with various investment advisers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, and other regulatory bodies in various countries and holds itself out as such to potential clients for GIPS purposes.

Net of fees performance reflects the deduction of the highest applicable management fee ("Model Net Fee") that would be charged based on the fee schedule appropriate to you for this mandate, without the benefit of breakpoints. Please be advised that the composite may include other investment products that are subject to management fees that are inapplicable to you but are in excess of the Model Net Fee. Therefore, the actual performance of all the portfolios in the composite on a net fee basis will be different, and may be lower, than the Model Net Fee performance. However, such Model Net Fee performance is intended to provide the most appropriate example of the impact management fees would have by applying management fees relevant to you to the gross performance of the composite. Past performance cannot guarantee future results. 



Returns for time periods greater than one year are annualized.

GIPS® Information

      T. Rowe Price ("TRP") claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). TRP has been independently verified for the 10-year period ended June 30, 2016 by KPMG LLP. The verification report is available upon request. Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
    

      TRP is a U.S. investment management firm with various investment advisers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, and other regulatory bodies in various countries and holds itself out as such to potential clients for GIPS purposes. TRP further defines itself under GIPS as a discretionary investment manager providing services primarily to institutional clients with regard to various mandates, which include U.S, international, and global strategies but excluding the services of the Private Asset Management group.
    

      A complete list and description of all of the Firm's composites and/or a presentation that adheres to the GIPS® standards are 
      available upon request. 
      Additional information regarding the firm's policies and procedures for calculating and reporting performance results is 
      available upon request.

All investments involve risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Retirement savers should consider their financial situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance before making an investment decision. Also, retirement savers may want to consult a tax advisor before selecting a tax-advantaged account.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

Strategy






Investment Objective
		The fund seeks long-term growth of capital through investments primarily in the common stocks of companies located (or with primary operations) in Latin America.



Investment Approach
Employ fundamental analysis to identify companies with sustainable above-market earnings growth rates.Focus on franchise strength, management team quality, free cash flow, and financing/balance sheet structure.Verify relative valuation appeal versus both local market and region.Apply negative screening for macroeconomic and political factors to temper bottom-up enthusiasm for specific securities.Investing in this fund involves a high degree of risk due to its concentration in the emerging economies of a specific region. Share prices are also subject to market risk, as well as risks associated with unfavorable currency exchange rates and political or economic uncertainty abroad.The fund is "non-diversified," meaning it can own a larger percentage of assets in the securities of a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund. As a result, poor performance of a single issuer could adversely affect fund performance than if the fund were investing in a larger number of issuers.



Portfolio Construction
Typically 30 - 60 stock portfolio.Individual positions typically range from 0.5% to 20.0% — average position size of 2.0% to 3.0%.Sector ranges typically +/- 10.0% absolute deviation to the benchmark.Country ranges typically +/- 10.0% absolute deviation to the benchmark.Target reserves less than 5%.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of a 2.00% redemption fee on shares held for 90 days or less; if it did, the performance would be lower.



The T. Rowe Price Funds - I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund (the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown above) and the actual performance results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed over the periods shown, would have been higher.

Strategy






Investment Objective
		The fund seeks long-term growth of capital through investments primarily in the common stocks of companies located (or with primary operations) in Latin America.



Investment Approach
Employ fundamental analysis to identify companies with sustainable above-market earnings growth rates.Focus on franchise strength, management team quality, free cash flow, and financing/balance sheet structure.Verify relative valuation appeal versus both local market and region.Apply negative screening for macroeconomic and political factors to temper bottom-up enthusiasm for specific securities.Investing in this fund involves a high degree of risk due to its concentration in the emerging economies of a specific region. Share prices are also subject to market risk, as well as risks associated with unfavorable currency exchange rates and political or economic uncertainty abroad.The fund is "non-diversified," meaning it can own a larger percentage of assets in the securities of a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund. As a result, poor performance of a single issuer could adversely affect fund performance than if the fund were investing in a larger number of issuers.



Portfolio Construction
Typically 30 - 60 stock portfolio.Individual positions typically range from 0.5% to 20.0% — average position size of 2.0% to 3.0%.Sector ranges typically +/- 10.0% absolute deviation to the benchmark.Country ranges typically +/- 10.0% absolute deviation to the benchmark.Target reserves less than 5%.

GIPS® Information

      T. Rowe Price ("TRP") claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). TRP has been independently verified for the 10-year period ended June 30, 2016 by KPMG LLP. The verification report is available upon request. Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
    

      TRP is a U.S. investment management firm with various investment advisers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, and other regulatory bodies in various countries and holds itself out as such to potential clients for GIPS purposes. TRP further defines itself under GIPS as a discretionary investment manager providing services primarily to institutional clients with regard to various mandates, which include U.S, international, and global strategies but excluding the services of the Private Asset Management group.
    

      A complete list and description of all of the Firm's composites and/or a presentation that adheres to the GIPS® standards are 
      available upon request. 
      Additional information regarding the firm's policies and procedures for calculating and reporting performance results is
