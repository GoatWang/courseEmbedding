Affiliated Wealth Advisors | 





































































































A unique partnership
for income growth.




AWA is able to offer IPO investors an 8% income return per year, paid 2% quarterly, plus an annual dividend from profits. The IPO leverages a new partnership, with a portfolio of asset management firms – SEC Registered Investment Advisers (RIA).
Here’s how it works:
We acquire equity in a select group of best-of-breed RIA firms, chosen for their long-term success, client loyalty and growth. The proven performance of these partner firms allows AWA to offer investors an 8% income return per year, paid quarterly, plus an annual dividend.
It’s a partnership that benefits everyone.
For investors, it’s robust, stable cash income.
For our RIA partners, it’s liquidity, with independence to run their business as they always have.
For RIA clients, it’s uninterrupted service and continued satisfaction.
That’s a win, win, win.

Circular indicates
that you
are
a newly
formed
limited partnership
with an �intention�
to use the offering
proceeds to acquire
and operate
between
twelve and thirty-one
�targeted�
registered
investment advisory
firms.  Revise
the Offering
Circular to identify
these targeted
entities
and explain the status
of your

with each identified
entity.
To the extent
that you
are unable
to identify
these targeted
entities
in the Offering
Circular,

Act
Rule 251(b)(3)
and withdraw

�
RESPONSE: The Company understands
the concerns of the SEC in ensuring that investors will have adequate information about potential registered investment advisory
firms (�RIA firms�) to be acquired by the Company with the proceeds of the offering. At this time, the Company
has conducted an initial screening and narrowed the list of RIA firm candidates to 204 potential RIA firms. In response to the
SEC�s comment, the Amendment updates disclosures about the identity of the RIA firms, the investment acquisition process
to be utilized in vetting RIA firm candidates for acquisition, and additional risk factors, each of which is described in further
detail below.
�
The Amendment revises disclosures
on pages 4 and 23 of the Amendment to provide the following:
�
�At this time,
we have identified 204 RIA firms that we intend to screen and possibly enter into acquisition discussions, which are set forth
on page 53 of this Offering Circular. At this time we do not have any agreements in place, binding or non-binding, to acquire any
specific RIA firm. A description of our screening process for potential RIA firm acquisitions is set forth in the �Investment
- Acquisition Process Overview� section of this Offering Circular on page�26.�
�
Page 26 of the Amendment
(Investment - Acquisition Process Overview) provides a description of the process that the Company intends to utilize in vetting
and monitoring targeted RIA firms as a part of its acquisition.

�
Page 53 of the Amendment
provides the following description of the targeted RIA firms:

�RIA FIRM ACQUISITION CANDIDATE
LIST
�
The GP has identified
the following candidates as potential RIA firms to target for acquisition based upon its completion of the Initial Sourcing Stage
described on page 26 of this Offering Circular. At this time none of the following RIA firms or their owners have entered into
any commitment, binding or non-binding, to sell a majority interest of such RIA firms to the Partnership. Please see the �Investment
- Acquisition Process Overview� on page 26 of this Offering Circular for information regarding how the Partnership intends
to research and determine which of the following RIA firms may be approached to discuss a sale of its majority interest to the
Partnership.�

�
The name, city and state
of each RIA firm will be provided in a final amendment to the Form 1-A. This will provide potential investors an opportunity to
review all public filings made by each RIA firm with the SEC before deciding whether to participate in the Company�s offering.
�
In addition, the Amendment
provides a more detailed description of the Company�s plans to approach potential RIA firms for acquisition. Page 23 of the
Amendment states:
�
�After commencement
of this Offering, the Partnership intends to enter into discussions with at least 10-12 RIA firms set forth on the RIA Firm Acquisition
Candidate List. The Partnership intends to enter into definitive purchase agreements with such RIA firms (or if such discussions
do not progress, it will speak with other qualified RIA firms and seek to enter into definitive purchase agreements with such
other RIA firms), and once the minimum amount of Class A Common Units ([���] Class A Common Units) are sold in
this Offering, the Partnership intends to consummate the acquisitions of such RIA firms. The Partnership intends to continue to
consummate additional acquisitions of RIA firms with the proceeds of sales from additional Class A Common Units in this Offering.
If the maximum amount of Class A Common Units ([���] Class A Common Units) are sold in this Offering, the Partnership
intends to negotiate and acquire approximately 26-31 RIA firms. The costs of each acquisition will vary, and the time to consummate
such acquisitions may be extended.�

�
In addition to the risk
factor on page 6 of the Form 1-A notifying investors that they will not have an opportunity to evaluate any of the target investments
prior to purchasing our Class A Common Units, page 6 of the Amendment also includes the following new risk factor to discuss the
possibility that the Company may encounter difficulties in acquiring RIA firms:
�
�At this time we have conducted
only an initial screening process to identify 204 potential RIA firms that we may seek to acquire majority control, and there is
no guarantee that we will be able to acquire any RIA firms on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
��
Currently, we have used publicly available
resources to identify 204 RIA firms that we may be interested in purchasing a majority control. These RIA firms will be further
investigated by our Deal Team, and vetted by our Investment Committee, and we plan to engage in discussions with certain of such
RIA firms after the minimum amount of Class A Common Units are sold in this Offering. We do not and will not have prior to selling
the minimum amount of Class A Common Units in this Offering any term sheets, letters of intent or written commitments (binding
or non-binding) of any RIA firm to enter into a sale transaction with us. There is no guarantee that we will be able to acquire
any RIA firms, or that the terms of any such transactions will follow the proposed structure outlined in this Offering Circular.
It may also take the Partnership an extended period of time to conduct its due diligence or to consummate any acquisitions. Any
delay or inability of the Partnership to timely consummate RIA firm acquisitions, and to consummate RIA firm acquisitions on acceptable
terms outlined in this Offering Circular, could have a material adverse effect on the price of the Class A Common Units.

to the risk factor
you include
at the bottom
of page 14. Please
revise the Summary
to highlight
the
risks and uncertainties
regarding
the federal
tax
treatment
of the limited
partnership, particularly
the �especially
high�
risk that
you will not meet
the applicable
exception
in the first
year.
�
RESPONSE: The following
paragraph has been inserted on page 5 (Summary) of the Amendment:
�
�In order
to receive such pass-through tax treatment, 90% or more of our gross income for every taxable year must consist of qualifying
income, as defined in Section 7704 of the Code (the �Qualifying Income Exception�). Qualifying income generally includes
dividends, interest, capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stocks and securities and certain other forms of investment
income. We may not meet these requirements or current law may change so as to cause, in either event, us to be treated as a corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax. The risk that we will not meet the Qualifying
Income Exception is especially high in the first year, during which our gross income may be limited in amount and sources. If
we were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would pay U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income
at the corporate tax rate, and income of the Partnership would not pass through and be taxable to you except for dividends we
declare and pay to you. Such dividends would generally be taxed as corporate dividends, and no income, gains, losses, deductions
or credits would flow through to you. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our dividends to you would be substantially
reduced, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our Class A Common Units.�

risk factor discussion
describing
Mr. Baker�s
conflicts of interest
as the Chairman,
CEO and Director
of the General
Partner,
managing
member of IAMC,
LLC, and owner
of common units.
The risk factor discussion should
discuss common
units and Class M units held by
AWA Management
and the IAMC
trusts and the percentage
of the vote
Mr. Baker will
control if the minimum
and maximum
number of units are
sold.
�
RESPONSE: Page 12 of the
Amendment sets forth the following risk factor:
�
�L. Edward Baker may have
a conflict of interest with respect to the operations of the Partnership based upon his positions as Chairman, Chief Executive
Officer and director of the GP, and his substantial beneficial ownership of units of the Partnership.
�
L. Edward Baker
is the sole owner of IAMC, LLC, which is the sole owner of the GP. Mr. Baker is also the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and
director of the GP. Mr. Baker beneficially owns the power to vote 1,785,001 Class A Common Units, or 58% of the Class A Common
Units (on an as-converted basis) prior to the Offering, based upon his direct ownership of 900,000 Class M Units, and his beneficial
ownership of 1 Class A Common Unit owned by IAMC (which will be canceled for no consideration once the minimum amount of Class
A Common Units are sold in the Offering), 510,000 Class A Common Units owned by IAMC �F� Trust and 375,000 Class A
Common Units owned by IAMC �S� Trust. If the minimum amount of Class A Common Units ([���] Units) are sold in the Offering,
Mr. Baker will hold voting control of approximately [���]% of the Class A Common Units (on an as-converted basis), and approximately
[���]% of the Class A Common Units (on an as-converted basis) if the maximum amount of Class A Common Units ([���] Units) are sold
in the Offering.
�
Given Mr. Baker�s
substantial ownership in the Partnership and his control of the GP, Mr. Baker will have the ability to directly influence the operations
of the Partnership, which may occur for the benefit of the GP and cause an adverse effect on the Partnership.�
�
11.���������We note
your disclosure
on page 24 that
you expect
that each
RIA
acquisition
will range between
$5 million and $10
million. Given the
expected proceeds
available
for investment range
between
$18,300,000 and $45,750,000 and
you expect
to finance
the balance
of these
acquisitions
using earn-out
agreements
and promissory
notes, please include
a risk factor
discussion highlighting
your plan to finance
these agreements
using debt and the
resulting
impact on
your cash flows.
�
RESPONSE: Page 11
of the Amendment sets forth the following risk factor:
�
�We expect to issue promissory
notes and to enter into earn-out agreements with RIA firms as part of our acquisition strategy, which may reduce the cash flow
of the Partnership available for distributions and working capital.
�
We intend to purchase
majority interests in RIA firms with cash, promissory notes and earn-out payments. We intend to keep a capital reserve available
to satisfy such obligations as they accrue over time. Our obligations to honor the terms of these notes and agreements will reduce
our cash flow. As a result, we may be forced to seek working capital from creditors or sell additional equity securities of the
Partnership from time to time, and reduce the amount of our distributions to unitholders.�

tell us, and revise,
as applicable,
to explain how, if at
all, Investment
Company Act Rule
3a-2 concerning
transient
investment
companies impacts
your business
plan. To the extent
that there are
material
risks that you
will become an
investment company
pursuant to this
rule, please
revise your
risk factor
disclosure and highlight
the risk in
the Summary
section
of the Offering
Circular.
�
RESPONSE: Rule 3a-2 provides
a one-year relief period for issuers that would become subject to the Investment Company Act as a consequence of becoming an �investment
company� under such Act. The Company intends to purchase majority control of RIA firms, and does not intend on purchasing
investment securities in excess of 40% of its total assets. However, during the interim period between the sale of Class A Common
Units in the offering and the actual deployment of such capital in connection with the acquisition of RIA firms, the Company may
invest such funds in securities that constitute �investment securities� under the Act. Accordingly, the following has
been added to risk factor discussing potential application of the Investment Company Act on the Company, found on page 9 of the
Amendment:
�
�During the
period of time in between the receipt of proceeds as part of this Offering and the deployment of such proceeds in acquiring RIA
firms, we may invest such proceeds in liquid securities that constitute �investment securities� under the 1940 Act.
Such investments may exceed the foregoing 40% asset test, and as a consequence we would be deemed an investment company under
the 1940 Act unless we may rely upon Rule 3a-2 of the 1940 Act, which applies to �transient investment companies.�

�
Rule 3a-2 permits
a company that fails the 40% test to remain exempt from the 1940 Act for a period of up to one-year commencing upon the earlier
of the date on which a company owns or proposes to own securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the value of the
company�s total assets, on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis, or the date on which the company owns or proposes
to acquire investment securities in an amount that would fail the 40% test. The Company may only rely upon such Rule once in any
three-year period.�

experience
at Mesa
Holdings, including
how many registered
investment
adviser firms Mesa
held during
Mr. Baker�s
tenure and
the status of the Mesa business
at the end of his tenure.
�
RESPONSE: Page
24 of the Amendment contains the following disclosure in response to your request:
�
�The leader
of our investment team, Mr. Baker has relevant experience as the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer
at Mesa Holdings, Inc. (�Mesa�), from 2004 to 2010. Mr. Baker�s primary role at Mesa was to acquire RIA firms
similar to those that the Partnership intends to acquire. Mesa operated as a holding company of RIA firm subsidiaries. When Mesa
ceased operations in 2010, it had seven RIA firm subsidiaries. Mesa financed its RIA firm acquisitions via debt secured by Mesa
as RIA firm acquisitions were consummated. In 2010, one of Mesa�s large investors became involved in legal problems, and
as a result, Mesa could no longer secure additional funding. At the time, Mesa had not reached operating income profitability
to sustain its operations, so Mesa ceased operations and conveyed its assets over to its creditors.
�
The
Partnership intends to primarily utilize capital from equity financings to raise capital for RIA firm acquisitions. Aside
from the issuance of promissory notes in consideration of the purchase price of RIA firms (which we believe will represent no more
than 50% of the total purchase price, and may be converted into Class B Units in lieu of cash, at the option of the holder), we
do not intend to utilize debt leverage to acquire RIA firms. We believe that the Partnership will benefit from Mr. Baker�s
first-hand experience at Mesa. We believe that the proceeds from the Offering will put AWA in a strong capital position to avoid
reliance on creditors to fund the Partnership�s operations in the near future.�

�
RESPONSE: The three
classes of units of the Company (Class A Common, Class B and Class M) continue to be presented as a single table in the
Amendment. The Company believes this is appropriate since all three classes vote as a single class on all matters submitted
to the unitholders for approval. Segregating each class into a separate table may improperly create the impression to
investors Class A Common Unit holders may vote separately from the other classes of units on matters submitted to unitholders
for approval. Also, since 1,050,000 Class M Units are outstanding, the Company believes investors should be aware of how such
outstanding units affect the voting power of the Class A Common Units being sold in the offering.

a view to potential
disclosure,

RESPONSE: Item 6 of Part
I of the Amendment provides that an aggregate of 2,001,378 Class A Units have been issued in consideration for an aggregate of
$100,000. 885,000 Class A Common Units have been issued to the IAMC �F� and �S� trusts, as set forth in
the Amendment. The remaining 1,116,378 Class A Common Units have been issued to founders of the Company.

�
The beneficial ownership
table requires disclosure of each non-affiliated investor of the Company with at least 10% of the outstanding voting power of the
units. No non-affiliated investors own 10% or more of the voting power of the units. The private placement section (on page 35
of the Amendment) is contained in Item 13, which requires disclosure of the issuance of units to the GP and its affiliates, but
not non-affiliated investors. With regard to potential disclosure, the effect of any pre-offering dilutive issuances are discussed
as part of the dilution table set forth on page 20 of the Amendment.

�
RESPONSE: The following
paragraph has been added to the summary of the offering on page 6, and to the Material U.S. Federal Tax Considerations on page
47, of the Amendment:
�
�We intend
to authorize and declare 8% annual distributions on a quarterly basis and pay such dividends on a quarterly basis beginning no
later than the end of the first calendar quarter after the month in which the minimum offering requirement ($20 million) is met.
Our distributions may exceed our earnings, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from
this Offering. As a result, a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital for tax purposes. A return
of capital is a return of your investment, rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities, and
will be made after deduction of the fees and expenses payable in connection with the Offering, including any fees to be reimbursed
to the GP. A unitholder will not be subject to immediate taxation on the amount of any distribution treated as a return of capital
to the extent of the unitholder�s basis in its units; however, the unitholder�s basis in its units will be reduced
(but not below zero) by the amount of the return of capital, which will result in the unitholder recognizing additional gain (or
a lower loss) when the units are sold. To the extent that the amount of the return of capital exceeds the unitholder�s basis
in its units, such excess amount will be treated as gain from the sale of the unitholder�s units. A unitholder may recognize
a gain from the sale of units even if the unitholder sells the units for less than the original purchase price.�
�
The Company has been informed
by its accountants that K-1s will identify whether a dividend payment constitutes a return of capital.

Affiliated Wealth Advisors | 





































































































A unique partnership
for income growth.




AWA is able to offer IPO investors an 8% income return per year, paid 2% quarterly, plus an annual dividend from profits. The IPO leverages a new partnership, with a portfolio of asset management firms – SEC Registered Investment Advisers (RIA).
Here’s how it works:
We acquire equity in a select group of best-of-breed RIA firms, chosen for their long-term success, client loyalty and growth. The proven performance of these partner firms allows AWA to offer investors an 8% income return per year, paid quarterly, plus an annual dividend.
It’s a partnership that benefits everyone.
For investors, it’s robust, stable cash income.
For our RIA partners, it’s liquidity, with independence to run their business as they always have.
For RIA clients, it’s uninterrupted service and continued satisfaction.
That’s a win, win, win.
