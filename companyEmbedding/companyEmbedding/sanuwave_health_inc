SANUWAVE Appoints Alat Medika Indonesia as Distributor for dermaPACE and Liaison to Clinical Trials Participation for Company's Wound Care Product(s) in Indonesia

SUWANEE, GA--(Marketwired - Jul 20, 2017) -  SANUWAVE Health, Inc. (OTCQB: SNWV) is pleased to announce that the Company has appointed Alat Medika Indonesia as distributor for dermaPACE® and liaison for clinical trials participation for Company's wound care product in Indonesia. The expected revenue from this agreement will be north of $1 million over the next three years.
André Mouton, V.P. International Sales and Relations of SANUWAVE, stated, "This decision to engage Alat Medika Indonesia was made to increase our focus and visibility within Indonesia for the wound care market. It is of the utmost importance that we partner with distributors that have influence and a good track record within the Indonesian market. It is well known that diabetes and related concerns need to be addressed within Indonesia and having access to outstanding technology such as SANUWAVE's within the country is a positive step. We will need speedy access to potential clinical trials to ensure we add value with our product offering as well as clinical proven outcome. These factors will lead to faster market entry and closer ties with identified Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs)," concluded André Mouton.
Christian Hainsch, Chief Product Officer of Alat Medika International Group, declared, "Setting the 'PACE®' in wound healing in Indonesia! A technical milestone in professional wound healing is coming to Indonesia. With dermaPACE, SANUWAVE developed an innovative medical device for patients suffering from diabetic wounds, ulcer or burn injuries. One of the major indications for the use of dermaPACE, and most important for Indonesia, is the treatment of diabetic ulcers. With dermaPACE the regeneration process of tissue from chronic wounds is increased and can be an alternative to amputation or medication based treatment. Diabetes and other patients benefit from a simple, painless and side-effect free treatment for faster healing and quicker recovery to improve quality of life," concluded Mr. Hainsch.
SANUWAVE is using this occasion to further educate on our lead wound care product dermaPACE. This Extracorporeal Shockwave Technology (ESWT) device, based upon electrohydraulic principles, is CE Marked and has enjoyed success in certain markets within the European Union treating a wide variety of skin conditions such as pressure ulcers, burns, post-operative wounds, and scar reduction. dermaPACE has been proven, in two US based clinical trials enrolling 336 subjects, to be safe and effective in the treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers. Within a few weeks of initial treatment, wounds treated with dermaPACE reduce in area at superior rates compared to control subjects. dermaPACE exhibits superiority in wound area reduction within 12 weeks of initial treatment and exhibits superiority in wound closure within 20 weeks of initial treatment. The use of dermaPACE allows the clinician to more easily, and more cost-effectively, manage wounds. More importantly, the patient's quality of life improves significantly. 
For more information on SANUWAVE's technology, please read our blog, "Shock This", on our website at www.sanuwave.com.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Medical Devices Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis


Medical devices are durable and disposable in nature.  These devices can be used for a wide variety of conditions for surgical procedures, home health care, clinical settings or in the medical office setting.  A medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implant, in vitro reagent or anything similar which can be used to diagnose, prevent or treat a disease within the body.  It can be as simple as a tongue depressor, medical thermometer or disposable gloves.  It can also be as complex as a computer which can assist in medical testing, an implant like a stent or a prosthesis.  Globally, the medical device market is over $209 billion.  
 Medical devices are classified in one of three regulatory classes, the classification is dependent on the intended use of the device and indications for use.  The US accounts for approximately 38% of the global medical device market.  China, Japan, Russia and Brazil have the most stringent regulatory compliance for medical devices. Research can be found within market research industry reports which will further outline economic industry trends, device regulation globally and challenges facing medical device leaders.
