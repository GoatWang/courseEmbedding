Biography[edit]
Xu Liang went to Japan, and entered to Yokohama Daidou School (横浜大同学校). Then he went to the United States where he graduated from Columbia University and Washington University (But Which "Washington University" he graduated was uncertain). Later Xu Liang returned to China and was appointed a secretary to the Ministry for Justice, Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Interior Ministry. Afterwards he successively held the positions of secretary or advisor to many Local Governments or Legations. In the Nationalist Government era, he became a member of the Legation staff to the United States and an officer in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
When the Wang Jingwei regime was established in March 1940, Xu Liang also participated in it. He was appointed Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs and Chief of the Central Political Committee's Commission for Foreign Affairs, etc. In October 1940 he was appointed Ambassador to Japan, and he was sent to Manchukuo as special envoy. In December he returned to Nanjing, and was promoted to Minister of Foreign Affairs which post he held until next October. Later he was appointed member of the North China Political Council (華北政務委員會) and member of the National Government.
After the Wang Jingwei regime had collapsed, Xu Liang was arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's government. He was convicted of treason and surrender to the enemy (namely Hanjian) and sentenced to death.[2] But Xu wasn't executed, while being imprisoned in Tianjin.[2] In the end of 1948, as the Communist army approached Tianjin, he was released by the Nationalist authorities.[2] But in next January he was rearrested by the Communist authorities in Tianjin.[2]
In July 1951 Xu Liang was sentenced to death by the Tianjin authorities[3] and executed at Ningjin County, Hebei in the same year.[4]

Xu Liang —— A Responsible and Principled Quality Inspector
Xu Liang, a quality inspector of Quality Department in Luoyang Sinorock Engineering Material Co., Ltd.. As for products’ quality, he has his own opinions. He is also a sober, diligent and responsible person. Now, let’s come closer to him and know more about him. 

Shell: When did you join Sinorock®and what are you responsible for?
Xu:I joined Sinorock®in March, 2014. So far, I have learned a lot in our company. My routine work is to test and inspect the quality of our anchor bolt products, ensuring that every process meets with customers’ standards and demands.

Shell: What’s your opinion about quality?
Xu:Quality is produced by workers, not tested by inspectors. Everyone be responsible and attentive, the quality of our products can reach a higher level. Details need to be more noticed, once you form a habit, it becomes natural to you. 
Inspecting products is not the last link of production, but a constituent part of processing chain. Only guaranteed every process qualified, an integrated product can be completely finished.

Shell: Quality is important to products and the property of your job seems quite significant. But what will you do when you encounter a problem?
Xu:When I encounter a problem about products’ quality, first, I compare the actual data with the standard; then, I analyze reasons with operator together; third, I will record and supervise the completion of order on time. 

Shell: What characters do you think are necessary for you?
Xu:Because of the work property of inspector, I think carefulness, earnestness, strictness and responsibility are very important to me. Products’ quality concerns not only with our order, but also with company’s reputation and even its future development. So these characters are specially significant to quality inspectors.

Shell: You are so concentrated during the working time, while in the spare time, what do you often do to relax yourself?
Xu:After one-day work, usually it is too busy, so after work, I usually play ball games with friends or drive myself to see different scenery. I enjoy my life very much and I think it is very meaningful!

Shell: Thank you for your cooperation. Hope your life get better and better!
Xu: Thank you!

Molecular therapy targeting cancer and cancer stem cells, via novel nanovectors and rational drug design.
1) Novel small-molecule cancer therapeutics - Drug discovery and molecular cancer therapy.
My lab has been working on drug discovery for novel small molecule cancer therapeutics targeting cell signaling pathways, especially for cancer cell chemo/radiosensitization by molecular modulation of apoptosis/autophagy/necroptosis. One of the first lead compounds tested in vitro and in vivo in my lab has completed Phase I-IIb clinical trials, as the World’s first pan-Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Mcl-1 inhibitor entered clinic trials. Another XIAP inhibitor is also in clinical trials.
Currently, I am working on molecular cancer drug discovery, using structure-based rational drug design for novel small molecule inhibitors targeting Musashi-1/2 and HuR, the RNA-binding proteins so far believed “undruggable”. Through high-throughput screening and lead optimization, we obtained nanomolar to submicromolar lead compounds, and two provisional patents were filed in 2014. One new R01 was funded in 2014; one R01 scored 20, percentile 3%, started in 2015. Our long-term goal is for further lead optimization to obtain more potent and specific, drug like leads for development as first-in-class Musashi-1/2 or HuR inhibitors as whole new therapy for cancer.
2) Novel nanovector delivery systems targeting cancer and cancer stem cells - Drug/gene delivery.
Funded by multiple NIH and DOD grants, my lab works on the tumor-targeted delivery of molecular cancer therapeutics using novel nanotechnology. A self-assembled, virus-mimicking, non-viral nanovector for non-viral tumor-targeted, systemic p53 gene therapy has shown promise in chemo/radiosensitization of breast, prostate, head and neck cancer, just completed a first-in-human Phase I clinical trial, now in multi-center Phase II Trials. Multiple US and International Patents are issued or pending.
Currently, I am exploring next generation nanovectors for tumor-targeted delivery of siRNA/miRNA/CRISPR-based therapeutics for targeting cancer and cancer stem cells. In 2014, I have 7 papers published on nanoparticles for cancer targeting and molecular imaging. Imaging-based nano-drug delivery for cancer targeted therapy will be my focus.
