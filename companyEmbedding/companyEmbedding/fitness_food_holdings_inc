The co-founder of Austin-based Snap Kitchen said the startup raised another round of investment capital to extend the health-food retailers steady growth.
Fitness Food Holdings Inc. collected $22 million from two investors, according to a Tuesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Martin Berson said the company's founders and Connecticut-based Catterton Partners participated in the funding.

"It's to continue to fund a thoughtful growth plan," he said Wednesday. "The most important thing is that we're smart about the growth."




The funding comes one month after Snap Kitchen completed its Chicago expansion with the opening of four new stores that were the first outside Texas for the growing health-food retailer. It also plans to expand to Philadelphia by December, Berson said.
Fitness Food Holdings, founded in 2010, operates 27 Snap Kitchen stores — 23 in Texas and four in Chicago. It employs 566 workers, including 160 in Austin where it operates seven stores, a company spokeswoman said.
The company sells pre-packaged meals designed for a wide variety of dietary preferences. Products include prepared foods and cold-pressed juices that primarily cater to vegan, gluten-free, paleo and vegetarian diets. Made-to-order salads are available at some locations.
In 2013, Fitness Food Holdings completed a $13 million funding from Catterton Partners to finance Snap Kitchen’s growth plans in Houston and Dallas. A large Snap Kitchen was completed in Dallas just four days ago after six months of construction, Berson said.
A rising interest in fitness and nutrition have fueled demand and enabled the company to grow faster than expected, he said.




 


"I am shocked every morning," Berson said. "We knew the space and there were a lot of strong tailwinds with the way people approach food."
Editor's note: This story has been updated to include comments from Snap Kitchen's CEO received after this story was first published.
