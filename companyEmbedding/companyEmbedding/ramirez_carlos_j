Department ("LAPD'M Officers from La Ley
On May 16, 1991, Yolanda Orozco and I met with
Carlos Ramirez (Detective-Hi), Al Ruvalcaba (sergeant-II),
Bob Contreras (Detective-Iii), and Mike Mejia (Detective-I)
for one and a half hours at the offices of the Independent
Commission.  The above-named officers belong to La Ley, the
LAPD Latino Officers Union.
La Ley provides an open membership to LAPD officers
and reportedly is joined by most Latino police officers, as
well as by a number of non-Latino officers. La Ley is also
open to retired LAPD officers. La Ley estimates that it has
1,000 active officer members and 200 retired officer
members.  Its activities include sponsoring community events
and funding scholarships.
La Ley sees its mission as that of bridging the gap
between the Latino community and the LAPD; the officers
believe that it is important that they be able to
communicate with the people they are called on to serve.
The La Ley officers see good community relations between the
