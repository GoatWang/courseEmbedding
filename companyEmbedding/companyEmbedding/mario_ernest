Ernest Mario, Ph.D., Named Chairman of Chimerix, Inc.

Feb 20, 2013, 07:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Chimerix, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Feb. 20, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Chimerix, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company developing novel, oral antivirals in areas of high unmet medical need, today announced the appointment of Ernest Mario, Ph.D., as Chairman of its Board of Directors.  
"Ernie brings to Chimerix a unique breadth and depth of experiences across large and early stage pharmaceutical firms.  His knowledge will be invaluable as we seek to progress our lead compound, CMX001, through Phase 3 clinical development and commercial launch," said Kenneth I. Moch, President and CEO of Chimerix. 
During the course of his career, Dr. Mario has served as the CEO, Chairman and a director of several pharmaceutical companies.  From 1989 to 1993, he served as Chief Executive of Glaxo Holdings, plc, then the second-largest drug company in the world.  Dr. Mario led drug delivery technology company ALZA from 1993 until its acquisition by Johnson & Johnson in 2001.  He served as Chairman and CEO of Reliant Pharmaceuticals from 2003 until its acquisition by GlaxoSmithKline in 2007.  He also previously served as the Chairman of Pharmaceutical Product Development, Inc, a multinational contract research organization, from 1993 to 2011.  Dr. Mario is currently Chairman and CEO of Capnia, a privately held pharmaceutical company.  
"With Ernie's remarkable record of building and leading successful pharmaceutical companies, he is the right person to help guide Chimerix as we seek to establish prevention of serious viral infections using CMX001 as the standard of care in immunocompromised patients," said James Niedel, M.D., Ph.D., who will relinquish the role of Chairman but will remain a member of Chimerix's Board of Directors. 
"I am thrilled to be joining a Chimerix team that has already made great strides to validate its science and IP by advancing CMX001 into Phase 3 and by licensing CMX157 to Merck," said Dr. Mario. "I look forward to working with Ken, the Board and the entire Chimerix team to build upon the company's success to date and to help bring CMX001 to patients who might benefit from it worldwide." 
Dr. Mario earned a B.S. in pharmacy at Rutgers University and an M.S. and Ph.D. in physical sciences at the University of Rhode Island.  He is Chairman of the American Foundation for Pharmaceutical Education, a Director of the Gladstone Foundation, and past Chairman of the Duke University Health System.
About Chimerix and CMX001 
Chimerix is committed to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel, oral antiviral therapeutics designed to transform patient care in areas of high unmet medical need.  The Company's proprietary lipid technology has given rise to two clinical-stage lipid acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, CMX001 and CMX157, which have demonstrated the potential for enhanced activity and safety in convenient, orally administered dosing regimens.  
Chimerix's lead product candidate, CMX001, is a broad spectrum, oral nucleotide analog lipid-conjugate that blocks replication of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus (AdV), BK virus and herpes simplex virus.  CMX001 has completed Phase 2 clinical development for the prevention of CMV in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.  Chimerix is also conducting a Phase 2 study in HSCT recipients which is evaluating CMX001 as a preemptive therapy for AdV disease, an often-fatal infection which has no approved therapies.  Since 2009, Chimerix has made CMX001 available under expanded access regulations to over 80 transplant centers worldwide for the treatment of over 430 patients with life-threatening dsDNA viral infections.  Chimerix anticipates initiating SUPPRESS, its Phase 3 study of CMX001 for the prevention of CMV infection in adults undergoing HSCT, in 2013.    
Chimerix is also developing CMX001 as a potential medical countermeasure against smallpox under a contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).  
Chimerix's second product candidate, CMX157, an oral nucleotide analog lipid-conjugate in Phase 1 development for the treatment of HIV infection, was licensed to Merck in July 2012.

Early life and education[edit]
Ernest Mario grew up in Northern New Jersey, attending the Clifton Public Schools, elementary school #6, Christopher Columbus Middle School and Clifton High School.[2] He received a bachelor of science in Pharmacy from Rutgers University, and Masters and Ph.D. degrees in physical chemistry from the University of Rhode Island.[1] As a youth, Mario earned the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America in 1954; he was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 2000 for his service to youth.[3]
Career in the pharmaceutical industry[edit]
He was a registered pharmacist in the State of New York and worked as a community pharmacist during his early career. After completing his graduate work, he began a career in the pharmaceutical industry, beginning as a researcher for Strasenburgh Laboratories in Rochester, New York. He subsequently held positions with SmithKline & French in Philadelphia, PA; E.R. Squibb & Sons in New Brunswick, NJ and Princeton, NJ; and Glaxo Inc. in Research Triangle Park, NC. In 1990 he became the Chief Executive Officer of Glaxo Holdings, plc, based out of London, England. He served as Deputy Chairman of the Board and CEO of Glaxo Holdings from 1992 to 1993.[1] He was the Chairman and CEO of Alza Corporation, based in Palo Alto, CA, from 1993 until the company was purchased by Johnson & Johnson, Inc, in 2001. After Alza, Mario became Chairman and CEO of Reliant Pharmaceuticals, based in Liberty Corner, New Jersey. He was also the non-executive Chairman of Pharmaceutical Product Development, Inc, based in Wilmington, North Carolina, from 1993 to 2009.
In April 2010, Mario was appointed to the Board of Directors for Vivus Pharmaceuticals. Vivus is a biotechnology corporation based out of Mountain View, California. The US Food & Drug Administration recently approved the drugs Avanfil & Qsymia in April and June 2012 respectively. Avanfil is used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and Qsymia is indicated for weight loss in obese patients.[4]
Trustee of Duke University[edit]
Mario has served as a trustee of Duke University from 1989 to 2007, and chaired the Duke University Health System board of trustees from its inception until 2007. On July 1, 2007, he became a Trustee Emeritus of Duke University. In 2009 he was awarded The University Medal, Duke's highest recognition of service to the school. Mario's 18 years on the Duke University board made him the second longest serving trustee in the school's history. The longest tenure belongs to Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans (1961–1981), great granddaughter of Washington Duke, for whom the school is named.
Awards and honors[edit]
He has held numerous civic and public health positions, including Chair of the American Lung Association and Chair of the American Foundation for Pharmaceutical Education. Mario advises the schools of pharmacy at the University of Maryland, University of Rhode Island, and Rutgers University.
In December 2001, the Rutgers University College of Pharmacy was renamed the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy at Rutgers University.[5]
In 2007, Mario was recognized for a lifetime of service to the profession of pharmacy when the American Pharmacists Association awarded him the Remington Medal, the highest award in professional pharmacy. He is the 79th Remington Medalist.

Ernest Mario Joins the Board of Delpor, Inc.
Delpor continues to strengthen its expertise in drug delivery with the addition of the former CEO of Glaxo and Alza to its Board of Directors.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, January 19, 2012 – Delpor, Inc. (Delpor), a biotechnology company focused on drug delivery of antipsychotics and biologics, today announced that Dr. Ernest Mario has joined the company’s Board of Directors.
“It is a big honor and a privilege that Ernie has joined our Board,” said Tassos Nicolaou, President and CEO of Delpor. “Ernie brings a wealth of experience in R&D, pharmaceutical product development, drug delivery, and corporate strategy.  He is a perfect fit for our already strong and diverse Board of Directors, and I am certain that his contributions will have a positive and meaningful impact on our company.  All of us at Delpor are looking forward to working with and learning from Ernie.”
Dr. Mario has served as CEO, Chairman, and Director at a variety of large life sciences companies where he has created billions of dollars in shareholder value.  From 1989 to 1993, he served as Chief Executive of Glaxo, then the second-largest drug company in the world.  After leaving Glaxo, he became Chairman and CEO of Alza Corporation, a major drug delivery company sold to Johnson & Johnson for $10.5 Billion in 2001.  Dr. Mario subsequently served as Chairman and CEO of Reliant Pharmaceuticals, which was sold to GlaxoSmithKline in 2007 for $1.65 Billion.  He currently is Chairman and CEO of Capnia, a private pharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutic products to treat migraine and allergic rhinitis using a proprietary gas delivery system.  He is also a Venture Partner with Pappas Ventures and serves on a number of corporate boards.  Dr. Mario is active in numerous educational and healthcare organizations.  He is Chairman of the American Foundation for Pharmaceutical Education, a Director of the Gladstone Foundation, and past Chairman of the Duke University Health System.  He holds honorary doctorates from the University of Rhode Island and Rutgers University, the latter of which in 2001 renamed its pharmacy school the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy.
About Delpor, Inc.

Delpor’s device can deliver small & large molecules within a predefined therapeutic window over several months while maintaining zero-order release pharmacokinetics. Delpor is focusing on the delivery of antipsychotics (in order to improve medication adherence, tolerance, and safety) as well as delivery of biologics in order to improve patient safety and convenience. The company’s lead products include 3-month formulations of Risperidone, Paliperidone, and Interferon-alpha.  Additional information about the company can be found at www.delpor.com.
