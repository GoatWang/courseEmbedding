Faith, Family, Federated President and CEO J. Christopher Donahue Driven by Three Commitments as He Champions Cause of Money Funds 
By Boselovic, Len

Article excerpt

Few in the $2.7 trillion money market industry are as protective
of the product as Federated Investors' J. Christopher Donahue.He's the scion of a family business propagated by his father and
controlled by the large, perpetually expanding Donahue clan, which
owns all of Federated's voting stock. Because the Pittsburgh company
and money funds are joined at the hip, Mr. Donahue, 63, takes the
product very personally, championing the cause with particular
relish in recent years.The 2008 financial crisis prompted federal regulators to impose
new restrictions on money funds in 2010, then seek additional
regulations last year.In June, while the industry's regulatory future was uncertain,
Mr. Donahue accused regulators of demonizing money funds. Those
government efforts were halted in August. In an interview last
month, Mr. Donahue said he expects regulators will try again,
contending they have never stopped trying to put his family's baby
out of business."The first time the [Federal Reserve] wanted to eliminate money
market funds was 1976. It's still the same game," Federated's
president and CEO said."It's like an endless playoff series. You never have a victory.
You just survive until the next round."Some say Mr. Donahue is too defensive, noting tougher regulations
have prompted some money fund operators to sell their business to
Federated, increasing the company's share of the market. They
contend Federated's ability to work its way through the regulatory
thicket and to tailor money funds to customer needs has made it the
third-largest money fund operator, behind only Fidelity Investments
and JPMorgan Chase.Industry observers say the key to that success has been the depth
of Mr. Donahue's knowledge of why bank trust departments, corporate
treasurers, institutional investors and other clients want money
funds -- despite today's paltry returns.Money funds invest in U.S. Treasuries and other short-term
securities. Investors like them because they can park cash safely,
earn interest and get it when they need it. Although not government
guaranteed like bank deposits, money funds in all but a few cases
have given investors their money back dollar for dollar -- plus
interest."He understands this product and how it works and its uses as
well as anybody," said Paul Schott Stevens, president and CEO of the
Investment Company Institute, the lobbyist for the mutual fund
industry.But success with money funds -- which account for nearly half of
Federated's revenue and 74 percent of the $364 billion it manages --
has come at a price.Federated's shares typically trade at a discount to many of its
competitors. Money funds are a low margin business, and Federated's
stock and bond funds are not big enough to compete with many fund
companies.Since going public in May 1998, Federated's publicly traded stock
has generated average annual returns of 7.6 percent including
dividends, lagging such competitors as Eaton Vance, up 14.7 percent
annually over the same period; Waddell & Reed, up 8.6 percent; and
Franklin Resources, up 8.2 percent.The three FsMr. Donahue joined the company in 1972 as a part-time law clerk,
a year after graduating from Princeton University with a history
degree. He went full time in 1974 after earning a law degree at the
University of Pittsburgh. Mr. Donahue was named president and chief
operating officer in 1993 and president and CEO in 1998.He is one of 13 children of John and Rhodora Donahue, who have
made their Catholic faith the center of their family, which includes
84 grandchildren and 69 great-grandchildren. John Donahue, 88, who
co-founded Federated in 1955 with two Central Catholic classmates,
is the company's chairman.Catholicism's influence is evident in the work Donahue family
members do.Chris Donahue's oldest son, the Rev. Jay Donahue, is parish
administrator at Sts. Simon and Jude in Scott. A daughter, Colleen
Gornick, is admissions director at Oakland Catholic High School,
where Katherine Freyvogel, Chris Donahue's sister, has been
president since 1997. …
