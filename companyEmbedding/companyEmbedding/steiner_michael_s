 13 lectures, Stuttgart, October 3–15, 1922 (CW 217)“The younger generation is always faced with the dilemma of being heir to the old while about to become a guide for the new.... This cycle of lectures 'to the younger generation' speaks of a pathway to a Michaelic harvest for ears that have the goodwill to hear.” —Carlo PietznerRudolf Steiner presented these lectures to about a hundred German young people who hoped to bring Waldorf education into the culture of their time and for the future. Steiner stressed upon his listeners the great importance of "self-education" as a prerequisite to all other education. His was an attempt to guide the youth toward understanding themselves within the world situation. Steiner showed how the stream of generations had been interrupted by eighteenth-century intellectualism, emphasizing that they would have to reject the general acceptance of impersonal social routine, dead intellectual thinking, and personal and social egoism. Steiner discussed the need, instead, for a form of education permeated by art and feeling, which brings inner nourishment that can grow throughout one's life. It was his view that, without such an education, society will not reach a future built on moral love and mutual human confidence—a truly human culture. READ BOBBY MATHERNE’S REVIEW OF THIS BOOK.A previous translation of these lectures was published as The Younger Generation: Educational and Spiritual Impulses for LIfe in the Twentieth Century (1967). Original German title: Geistige Wirkenskräfte im Zusammenleben von alter und junger Generation. Pädagogischer Jugendkurs (GA 217). This Collected Works edition includes a new introduction, notes, and an index.

 12 lectures, Dornach, November 21–December 15, 1919 (CW 194)“This will generate a struggle covering the face of the whole earth. The one and only remedy for this nonsense being made of human evolution will be the path that can lead humanity to the spirit—the path of Michael, which finds its continuation in the path of Christ.” —Rudolf SteinerSpeaking in the aftermath of World War I, Rudolf Steiner presents a series of extraordinary lectures on the power and mission of the Archangel Michael. He paints on a broad canvas—in the context of cosmic and human evolution—revealing Michael’s tasks in the past, present, and future. Michael, originally the countenance of Yahweh, has transformed from a “night spirit” into a “day spirit.” As “the Countenance of Christ,” Michael helps us find a balance between luciferic and ahrimanic tendencies. The old dualism such as good versus evil, says Steiner, needs to be replaced by the trinity of Lucifer–Christ–Ahriman. Filling our hearts with the Christ impulse creates equilibrium between the luciferic influence that imbues our head and the ahrimanic influence that works in our limbs.Steiner describes how humanity faces three dangers in the social sphere—spiritual life could flow into the “pit of mendacity” ruled by Ahriman; individual rights might descend into a luciferic “pit of selfishness”; and economics could sink into the cultural sickness and death of the Asuras. To prevent Western culture from perishing, it will need to turn toward the contemporary “threefold” approach to society.Steiner also speaks of the principle of metamorphosis in connection with evolution and devolution, as he showed in the pillar designs of the newly built Goetheanum. Architectural styles express human evolution, as we can see in Greek temples, gothic Cathedrals, the Grail temple, and the building at Dornach. Among many other themes, Rudolf Steiner addresses the problem of natural necessity and freedom and the abolition of the trichotomy of body, soul, and spirit at the 869Council of Constantinople.This volume is a translation from German of Die Sendung Michaels. Die Offenbarung der eigentlichen Geheimnisse des Menschenwesens Seven of these lectures were published in English previously as Ideas for a New Europe
