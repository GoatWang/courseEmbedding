Condolences


LILLIAN AND ARLIN ZIEMANN January 3, 2015
Mike, Kayla, Jill and families, I was just looking for a neighbors obiturary and was shocked to see Janice's obituary.  I am so sorry to hear that!  And on Christmas, my heart breaks for you all.  I enjoyed the times few times we had together and thought she was just a sweetheart and she had such a beautiful smile that showed her warm, loving personality.  My Dad passed away December 19th 2014.  He was 85, that was hard, but not like your loss at all.  Thoughts and prayers going out to you all.  I am sorry we didn't know in time to come for visitation or funeral.


Mike Skoug December 31, 2014
My condolances to you and your family. I have been gone from Eau Claire for so long I wasn't even aware that you two were married to one another. Remember the good times and pass them along to the grandkids so they never forget her. Take care.

Janices Family
My prayers and thoughts are with the Family. Janice you will be missed. I enjoyed working with and sitting by you. You were like a Mother Hen when I broke my ribs and told me to sit down and you would get the things for me and yelled at me if I did not listen to you. I just seen Janice 2 weeks ago at Gordies and it was good to talk to her
Love
Martha


Jayne (Kaiser) Plumer December 31, 2014
My heartfelt condolences to Mike and the rest of Janice's family.  I have lots of great memories of our time at Regis High School and will always remember Janice's radiant smile and fun loving spirit!  Heaven will shine brighter now....so sorry for your loss!


Kimberly Prock-Hayes December 30, 2014
Mike I'm so sorry for your loss.  Janice was such a fun-loving, caring woman.  One of my most favorites people bartending at the Bottle and Barrel.  She could always make you smile!  She will be so dearly missed.


Joe and Carol Ringeisen December 30, 2014
Mike, Jill, and Kayla, we are deeply saddened to hear of your wife and mother, Janice's untimely death. We, like you, will always remember her as the sweet and gentle person she was and her quick smile and wonderful sense of humor. Please know that our thoughts and prayers are with you in this difficult time.


Karen & Chris Preston December 29, 2014
Dear Jill, Mike, Kayla, David and Audrey.....
Janice and I were childhood friends and were each other's constant companion, teacher, guidance counselor, and friend. The countless number of bike hikes, neighborhood games, school day experiences, great summer days in Minong and all those Gonderzik kids will be how I remember her. My heartfelt sadness for her passing and for the void she leaves behind in all of your lives. She was loved!


Paula Kelly (Spallees) December 29, 2014
My deepest condolences to Mike and family on the loss of Janice.  We were 'buddies' during elementary school and my remembrance of her was ones of warmth, joy and love.  I know she will greet me when I reach heaven, and we'll laugh about our precious child-hood days, when life was so wonderful.
God Bless her love ones and family!
Paula


Nancy Martens December 29, 2014
Dear Mike and Family,
I am so saddened by your sudden loss.  Janice always brought a smile to my face.  She was such a nice lady and good to everyone.  She loved talking about her daughters and being the Crazy Grandma.  She was so proud of all of you.  She will always be remembered at the Elks for her friendship and contributions to the lodge.  You definitely have a guardian angel.  God Bless you all,  Nancy


Terry McManus December 29, 2014
I am so saddened to hear of Janice's sudden and unexpected death. Janice was a childhood neighbor and classmate at Immaculate Conception grade school and Regis High School. My prayers and deepest sympathy go out to Janice's family.


Jerry & Pam Dutter December 29, 2014
Our deepest sympathy to all of you in the loss of your wife, mother, grandmother, daughter and friend. Janice was definitely one of a kind there wasn't ever a time when we saw her and she always had a big smile for you. She will be missed by many and her love for all of you will always be there. Love to you and prayers. Jerry and Pam Dutter


Christa Dutter December 29, 2014
I just saw Janice a few months ago and even though I have only seen her a handful of times over the last 30 years, she knew exactly who I was and was always warm, welcome and very kind. She was one of those very few people who you just couldn't help but love. My heart goes out to her husband and her girls. May her memories be cherished and your strength through this difficult time. With Love, Christa Dutter


John Dorsey December 28, 2014
Janice was a wonderful lady and friend. She is dearly missed.


Julie Matson December 28, 2014
My deepest sympathies to the McMahon family.  I worked with Janice at American Girl and enjoyed her happy and kind disposition.  Janice was a very caring person and will be missed by all.  My fondest memory of Janice is when Janice and I went fabric shopping so she could make a baptismal gown for my first baby, who is now 17.  My second daughter also wore it and it is truly a treasure that I will always have.  You have touched many lives and your memories will live forever in our hearts.


Deb Machmeier December 28, 2014
To Janice's Family,
I would like to express my deepest sympathy to all of you.  I worked with Janice at Pleasant Company years ago.  She always made a person laugh.
My thoughts are with you.
Deb (Mayer) Machmeier


JoAnne Ahles December 28, 2014
I'm so sorry to hear Janice passed away. My thoughts and prayers are with you.  I worked with her at Pleasant Company.  She was always so cheerful and made everyone around her smile.
My favorite memory is of the Halloween she came to work dressed as Mimi (from the Drew Carey show.) She pulled it off beautifully.  I hope all the great memories help you through this tough time.


Heather Byington December 28, 2014
I am Karen (Loehnis) Hennig's daughter. We are both so sorry to hear of Janice's passing. Please know your family is in our thoughts and prayers as you go through this difficult time.


Mike & Arlette McCrackin December 28, 2014
We are all going to miss Janice, we are currently out of town. So my condolences go out to your family.


Ann Garvey December 28, 2014
Our thoughts and prayers for Janice's family.


Joe Roach December 26, 2014
I am speechless at your loss.  I've known Janice since 8th grade at Immaculate Conception Grade School, but haven't really kept in touch regularly through the years.  My thoughts and prayers go out to her family.  Janice was a kind and generous person who always managed to find the humor in almost any situation.  May God Bless...


Jason Endres December 26, 2014
McMahon Family,
I want to tell you how sorry I am that you lost such a wonderful and caring person.  I will carry with me so many great memories of the years I worked with Janice at American Girl.  In a lot of ways I thought of her as a mother.  She always was looking out for me.
Janice, I will miss you so much.


Donna Thompson December 26, 2014
Mike, Jill, Kayla and family - memories live on and you all have an angel watching over you.  Janice was a great person, always a smile and great story about her grandkids, whom she adored.  There will be an empty chair at Pokeno, but she will be there with us to keep us on track.  Prayers are with you all.


Deb Perry December 26, 2014
My sympathies to Mike, Jill, Kayla, and families!  Janice will never be forgotten ... I first met her while working at American Girl and we had a great friendship through the years.  Our best times were playing Pokeno ... she was our leader and go to person ... I have no idea what we are going to do without her!!


Donna and Dave Springer December 26, 2014
Dear Mike and Family,
We are so sorry.  We will miss our mailbox talks with Janice in the summer!  You are all in our thoughts and prayers.
Dave and Donna


Dave & Brenda December 26, 2014
With deep felt sympathy for all of the family .  Your friends always  Dave & Brenda


Jan and Mike Oestreich December 26, 2014
Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with you in you time of loss.  Our girls (Jenni and Mandi) both knew Jill and Kayla, and remember the beautiful dresses their Mom always had them wear for special occasions in preschool and at Manz.


Tammy Kirby December 26, 2014
McMahon family, my sympathies to you over the loss of such a fun and loving person. I worked with her at American Girl and had a blast! Prayers.


Julie Serum December 25, 2014
My sincere condolences to Mike, Kayla, Jill and the rest of your family and grandchildren.  You are now a angel of inspiration above us as you were in lives with all your love, energy and inspiration.  I can't imagine the extent of how your family will miss you.  Our little world of Pokeno will not be the same.  You have always been our ring leader and we will continue to look to you to find all those chips we drop during the games.  I will always remember your motivation and love of family and life.  May you rest in peace with God.


Joan Wheeler December 25, 2014
Janice, you left us way too soon. I will always remember our banter about how small in stature you were and your tiny feet. I'm not sure how Pokeeno will go on but you will be there keeping score in spirit. You eyes beamed when you talked about your family and especially grandkids. My sincere sympathies go to your husband Mike, daughters Jill and Kayla and their families. You will be a special angel.

UDC and POEM 
Seven-year relationship nets 400 worldwide patents
 




by Peter Page
The vision that Congress had 20 years ago when it allowed universities to patent technology developed with federal research funds is reality at a nondescript, single-story office industrial complex in Ewing Township, N.J.



In that unremarkable building, Universal Display Corp. (UDC), a company that took root in 1994 in the laboratories of the Center for Photonics and Optoelectronic Materials (POEM), workers are hurriedly erecting Sheetrock� walls to create another 11,000 square feet of work space at the company's Pilot Line and Development facility.

						  Greg Olsen, president of Sensors Unlimited Inc., and Janice Mahon, vice president of technology commercialization at Universal Display Corp., are two beneficiaries of the technology transfer process.





UDC's hand-in-glove working relationship with POEM has unleashed a geyser of innovation, and the company needs more room for development: the fabrication of commercial prototypes for its growing list of manufacturing and customer partners.



"The relationship with Princeton has been pivotal to the growth of this company,'' said Janice K. Mahon, UDC vice president of technology commercialization. "They are our reason for being.''



In the seven years since UDC researchers began working in the labs at POEM, the company has accumulated 400 worldwide patents, pending or issued, related to organic light emitting device (OLED) technology, Ms. Mahon said.



"Significantly more than 50 percent of our patents originate from work done at Princeton,'' she added. "It has been a very fruitful relationship.''



UDC works closely with Professor Steve Forrest and his researchers, a relationship that he says enhances both the company's commercial prospects and the education of students. Together, UDC and POEM are achieving breakthroughs in basic technology for building flat panel displays, lasers, and light generating devices. The goal is to dramatically enhance display performance with products less expensive than current technologies.



"Photonics is rich in problems and poor in solutions, so it's not hard to find material for good thesis work when you are working with companies that can see beyond the tip of their nose,'' Professor Forrest said. "The benefits are enormous for students who are exposed to industrial researchers. They see the problems industry faces, and they get immediate feedback on their ideas.''

The path from great idea to great product on store shelves is long and too arduous for most ideas to survive. Ms. Mahon described a sort of intellectual bucket brigade anchored at one end by Princeton that substitutes for the research and development departments that are too costly for all but the wealthiest corporations.



"Basically, Princeton is the 'r' and we are the 'd'," she said. "Princeton is where basic research is conducted, then we take that research and build a prototype.''



The next stage-development of the prototype into a product-is conducted under a web of licensing agreements that bind Princeton, UDC, and corporations eager for new technology.



UDC, according to its Web site, currently has strategic alliances with PPG Industries Inc. of Pittsburgh, to develop and commercialize UDC's proprietary OLED materials; a license agreement with Motorola Inc., to explore product development stemming from dozens of U.S. and foreign patents; and a development and license agreement with Aixtron AG of Germany to develop and commercialize manufacturing equipment for OLEDs based on technology originating from Princeton called Organic Vapor Phase Deposition.



The complex relationships linking researchers from universities and corporations provide lessons for students in the long haul that it takes to hammer an idea into a product, Professor Forrest said.



"It is a huge gap from the lab to a product. The more experience I get, the bigger that gap appears,'' he said.



Ms. Mahon acknowledges the arduous process of bringing technology to market, but at the same time sees the fecundity of Princeton research as the assurance that UDC will, indeed, have products, whatever the challenges.



"Princeton is the engine that fuels the pipeline of future products,'' she said.
