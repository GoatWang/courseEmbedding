How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?

                            Hank and I parted ways in January 1982. I found him on your site in September 2007. In May 2009 we moved to Montana and bought a ranch. Without your site I might still be alone in Colorado. Thanks for helping me re-find my soul mate!

Public Records Now can help you learn about an individual’s past using the criminal records check feature on the site.  Our goal is to collect information from a variety of sources and put it all together into an intensive report that summarizes what the individual has in their background.  Every report will have specific details regarding any crimes an individual might have committed or been involved in. The report will also include their age, gender, name and any identifiable markings.
When the information is available, the report will include:

The offense that was charged
The location of where the offense occurred
Whether the offense was a misdemeanor or a felony
Whether the individual was actually convicted of the crime or not
What the risk level is for any sex offenders

Overview of a Background Check
Criminal searches can be extremely helpful in a number of different situations.  Some of the common reasons why an individual would need someone to perform a criminal background check are:

To gather information about people who are going to interact with you or the members of your family
To learn more about whether the individual has a criminal conviction
To investigate someone’s past that you are planning to date or currently dating
To look into a new person in your neighborhood
Business related ventures
And much more

Based on what you can see, a number of reasons exist as to why you might want to perform a criminal background check on an individual.  Regardless of what it is that you need to check for, you can rely on the professionals at Public Records Now to provide you with the most accurate and comprehensive information relating to someone’s past.
