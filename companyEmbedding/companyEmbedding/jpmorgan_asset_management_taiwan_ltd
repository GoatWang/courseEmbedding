FOMC Statement & Potential Impact on Fixed Income
Posted on July 27, 2017
Following the Fed’s announcement, please see below for market views from the Global Fixed Income, Currency & Commodities Team (GFICC):
Consistent with our and the market’s expectations, the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC) left the Fed Funds rate unchanged, at 1.0%‐1.25%. The Fed’s only means of communication at this meeting was the typical FOMC Statement.
The FOMC used the July Statement to prepare the market for an official balance sheet announcement at the September meeting. By effectively “marking-to-market” recent economic developments and indicating that a change in the Fed’s reinvestment policy would be coming “relatively soon”, the Committee readied the market for the balance sheet run-off while leaving the prospects for additional rate hikes dependent on inflation data.
We can break the Committee’s statement into four parts:

Economic Assessment – the Committee upgraded its already positive assessment of both the labor market and the overall US economy. They also softened their assessment on inflation, acknowledging the persistent weakness in the data.
Outlook – the Committee kept the outlook unchanged and expects an eventual return of inflation to its 2% objective.
Forward Guidance –the Committee continued to describe future actions as ‘gradual’ and stressed their current policy stance was accommodative.
Balance Sheet – The statement indicated that a change in existing investment policy would be appropriate “relatively soon”.

There were no dissenters at the meeting.
Our view: 

The FOMC was fairly balanced reflecting a mark-to-market on the recent data. They are confident that the positive developments in the labor market and the broader economy will allow them to push ahead with balance sheet reductions later in the year. The Committee is waiting for signs that the recent soft patch in realized inflation is reversing before raising the policy rate for a 3rd time in 2017.
The Committee continues to favor a gradual approach to tightening policy as they juggle incoming information on inflation, growth, and fiscal policy, as well as the market’s reaction to balance sheet normalization. We view the balance sheet reinvestment plan laid out in the June addendum as essentially a “done deal”. Ideally, once the process starts in September, the balance sheet normalization will run on autopilot as a secondary tool while rate hikes will remain the primary tool of removing accommodation. Any additional changes to the Fed’s schedule for balance sheet shrinkage once it begins will likely only be made if economic conditions were to deteriorate materially.
Despite the recent weakness in inflation readings, future rate hikes are still warranted by the economic and labor market data. Fiscal policy initiatives will continue to play an increasingly important role in the FOMC’s decision-making process for the number of rate hikes the US economy can handle in 2018.
We expect the Fed will raise rates 1 more time in 2017. Improving global growth, expectations of fiscal expansion and regulatory reform will create an environment that is supportive of risk assets at the expense of Treasury yields, despite the coming contraction in global central bank liquidity. We expect that the reduction in global central bank liquidity will move into the market’s purview as the year progresses.  Inflation has remained stubbornly weak for the past 4 months but should return to a pace closer to the Fed’s longer-run target. This will allow 10-year yields to move higher through the remainder of 2017, toward our year-end target of 2.5 – 3%.

A “Structural Reform” for the Kids
Posted on July 20, 2017
The Group of 20’s stated goal is “strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.” Amen to that.  The quality-of-life triple threat of low productivity, unfavorable demographics, and stifling income inequality would all be licked if the G20 achieves that goal.  The challenge of course is how to get there. Policy makers, economists, and the group itself all fall back on the tried-and-true prescription of “structural reforms.”  That catch-all phrase is prominent in their publications, but one usually has to dig deep to uncover the specifics of what, really, these folks are recommending. For the US, infrastructure investment, tax reform, and regulatory reform—to the extent they rigorously address inefficiency, productivity, or inequality—would all count.  Today, however, I want revisit in more detail a different proposal that I’ve discussed in the past, and expand on it with three key charts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
In short, a wholesale change in the US approach to childcare could have a profoundly positive impact on growth and quality of life. The idea is unusual, in that it is motivated by two factors which are often in conflict but here are aligned: first, a clinical focus on key macroeconomic outcomes, and second, deferential attention to small-scale outcomes for human individuals which improve the opportunities, incentives, and quality of life for families in the economy.  The result could unlock significant gains in both productivity and hours worked, while at the same time counteract rising inequality—the three keys to sustainable and inclusive growth.
The United States government spends the second-least on preschool and childcare of the 32 individual countries plus the EU, measured as a whole, studied by the OECD:

When parents consider re-entering the workforce, childcare costs are a significant deterrent to doing so. For single parents, as well as the second earner in a two-parent household re-entering the workforce in the United States, the implicit tax rate is the fourth-worst in the OECD.  It totals some 80%+ of gross pay just for taxes, childcare, and benefit reductions:


The result is an inefficient system, where primary caregivers are compelled to provide in-home childcare in lieu of participating in the wider economy. The impediments persist as children grow and their care needs are only partially met by primary school, with summer holidays and significant portions of the traditional workday hours still not covered.  Parents are forced to accept jobs which can accommodate a certain schedule, rather than jobs which allow them to maximize their productivity, earnings, and participation in the economy.
If the United States treated childcare like public education, where every parent who wished could enroll their children in all-day, enriching childcare at little or no out-of-pocket cost, the economic benefits on both a macro and micro scale could be substantial:

Job creation: the many primary caregivers who are talented and passionate about the work could do it professionally (and this is a job that is not easily automated!). The infrastructure needs on an upfront and ongoing basis are also potentially significant, requiring skilled construction work, regardless whether the programs are publicly or privately administered.
Increased labor force participation and hours worked: the implicit “re-entry tax” would be removed as a serious disincentive to join the labor force and barrier to pursuing new skills training.
Increased productivity: individuals, as they see fit, can pursue jobs to maximize their quality of life, earnings, and contribution to the economy, at a level greater than the (purely monetary) cost of caring for 1.9 children per day, which is the average number of children under 18 in each household with children.
Decreased inequality: childcare is a benefit for all families, paid for by the existing progressive tax system.
The first four are dispassionate assessments of the raw 1st order macroeconomic effects, which would be critical to justifying the expense and helping pay for it over the short term, but there is a bigger issue at the heart of the proposal with longer-term implications. Providing all children with equal access to robust early childhood education, reliable care, and a structure through which other basic health and nutrition needs can be met efficiently and consistently will help strengthen the youngest generation of Americans. They are the future US economy.

Clearly any program like this, whether it’s done with physical structures, extensions of the public education system, or through vouchers and refundable tax credits would be costly. However, the realistic potential growth uplift outlined above allows “dynamic scoring” to be used with confidence for at least partial self-funding.  Dynamic scoring uses future growth expectations, realized in the form of higher tax revenues, to fund current expenditures.  The concept is frequently abused because growth forecasts are too optimistic, but in this case the pure economic effects are pretty simple.  Near term funding through progressive taxation can provide a plausible bridge to a period of sustainably higher and more inclusive growth.  Higher sustainable growth with less inequality allows a larger share of the economy to eventually make meaningful tax contributions.  The ability of the economy to sustain less progressivity in the tax code ought to be a “win” for both political parties.
Any structural reform which can plausibly create jobs, increase labor force participation, increase productivity, and reduce inequality would produce meaningful progress toward “strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.” Reforming the childcare system could potentially do all of this, while encouraging participation and engagement in the economy by all parents who wish to do so.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
