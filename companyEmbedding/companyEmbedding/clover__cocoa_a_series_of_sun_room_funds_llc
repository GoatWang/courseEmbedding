Overview of Incorporation Service - Forming Your Business!
Incorporating may be the most important move you make for your business. It can help protect you and your family from the risks of personal liability and may make it easier to attract employees and investment. 

1. LegalForce's Incorporation Wizard, designed by corporate attorneys, makes it super easy for you to incorporate a business.
2. Your documentation will be well prepared and complete.
3. Fast, friendly service and 24/7 customer support. 
4. Take care of the bureaucratic details so you can focus on your business.

Why Incorporate?

1.  Protect your personal assets. By forming a corporation, you separate your personal assets from the company, and are typically not personally responsible for business debts. So creditors can't pursue your home or car to pay business debts.
 2. Tax and other savings. Corporations often gain tax advantages, such as savings on self-employment taxes, and deductions for health insurance premiums and life insurance.
 3. Attract investors. Incorporating is often a pre-requisite to getting outside investment, from sales of stock, or for borrowing money from professional investors or banks. It can also help you reach potential new customers and partners.
 4. Easier transfer and sale. An incorporated business provides more security for purchasers and therefore can also be easier to sell than an unincorporated business.
 5. Retirement planning. It can be easier to create retirement funds and qualified plans, like a 401(k) for yourself and employees. 









In the Standard Package, incorporating a business is easy and painless.
 You will receive: (1) LegalForce automated Incorporation Wizard helps you decide what corporate form is best for your business; (2) Legally compliant filing of Articles of Incorporation; (3) Customer service available at any time.
 Some states require your original signature before filing. For these states, we will send you the documents to sign and return to us. 








InCorporation Plus Package

Our "Incorporation Wizard" will recommend an incorporation package based on what other businesses like yours usually choose. This is all you have to do: 
Step 1. Tell us about your business: 
Answer a couple of simple questions about your business. These are used by our "Incorporation Wizard" to recommend the state and type of incorporation that are most likely to meet your needs. You are free to make changes to these recommendations or to chose a different package.
 Step 2. Choose an Incorporation Package:
 Choose your package and fill out our simple form. We guide you through the information that your state of incorporation requires.
 Step 3. Customize for Your Business:
 Make any changes you want and submit your answers to us. 
LegalForce Does the Rest:

				“Overall my experience with RunSignUp was great. It was easy to learn how to set up a race and use the different features. I was on the system almost everyday, setting up coupons, responding to participant changes, and watching my registration numbers grow. The online help section and videos made it easy as a first-time user to get up and running. When I had a question (or made a mistake), they were very responsive and helped me resolve my issue.  I was also impressed at how receptive they were to feedback and ideas to make it an even better tool for race directors.”

Brokerage products are not insured by the FDIC — are not deposits or other obligations of the bank and are not guaranteed by the bank — are subject to investment risks, including possible loss of the principal invested.
All investing involves risk. The value of your investment may fluctuate over time, and you may gain or lose money.
Online market and limit stock trades are just $6.95 for stocks priced $1 and above. Additional charges may apply for stocks priced under $1, mutual fund and option transactions. Detailed information on our fees can be found in the Explanation of Fees (PDF).

You must have $500 in equity in an Individual, Joint, Trust, IRA, Roth IRA, or SEP IRA account with Scottrade to be eligible for a Scottrade Bank® account. In this instance, equity is defined as Total Brokerage Account Value minus Recent Brokerage Deposits on Hold.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The research, tools and information provided will not include every security available to the public. Although the sources of the research tools provided on this website are believed to be reliable, Scottrade makes no warranty with respect to the contents, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, suitability or reliability of the information.

Scottrade does not provide tax advice. The material provided is for informational purposes only. Please consult your tax or legal advisor for questions concerning your personal tax or financial situation.
Investors should consider the investment objectives, charges, expense, and unique risk profile of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) before investing. A prospectus contains this and other information about the fund and may be obtained online or by contacting Scottrade.  The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Leveraged and inverse ETFs may not be suitable for all investors and may increase exposure to volatility through the use of leverage, short sales of securities, derivatives and other complex investment strategies. These funds’ performance will likely be significantly different than their benchmark over periods of more than one day, and their performance over time may in fact trend opposite of their benchmark. Investors should monitor these holdings, consistent with their strategies, as frequently as daily.
Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a mutual fund before investing. A prospectus contains this and other information about the fund and may be obtained online or by contacting Scottrade.  The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. No-transaction-fee (NTF) funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the NTF funds program. Scottrade is compensated by the funds participating in the NTF program through recordkeeping, shareholder or SEC 12b-1 fees.
Margin trading involves interest charges and risks, including the potential to lose more than deposited or the need to deposit additional collateral in a falling market. The Margin Disclosure Statement and Agreement (PDF) is available for download, or it is available at one of our branch offices. It contains information on our lending policies, interest charges, and the risks associated with margin accounts.

Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Detailed information on our policies and the risks associated with options can be found in the Scottrade® Options Application and Agreement, Brokerage Account Agreement, by downloading the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options and Supplements (PDF) from The Options Clearing Corporation, or by requesting a copy by contacting Scottrade. Supporting documentation for any claims will be supplied upon request. Consult with your tax advisor for information on how taxes may affect the outcome of these strategies. Keep in mind, profit will be reduced or loss worsened, as applicable, by the deduction of commissions and fees.
Market volatility, volume and system availability may impact account access and trade execution.

Keep in mind that while diversification may help spread risk, it does not assure a profit, or protect against loss, in a down market.
