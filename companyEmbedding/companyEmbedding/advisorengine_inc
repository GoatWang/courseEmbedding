 | Source: WisdomTree Investments, Inc.






NEW YORK, April  27, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WisdomTree Investments, Inc. (NASDAQ:WETF), an exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) and exchange-traded product (“ETP”) sponsor and asset manager driven by research and technology, and AdvisorEngine Inc., a digital wealth management platform, jointly announce their commitment to providing advisor growth solutions through AdvisorEngine’s acquisition of Kredible Technologies, Inc. (“Kredible”), a technology-enabled, research-driven practice management firm designed to help advisors acquire new clients. WisdomTree and AdvisorEngine: Collectively Helping Advisors Grow Their BusinessesIn November 2016, WisdomTree, an independent-thinking asset manager with a focus on research and a history of innovation, and AdvisorEngine, a B2B full enterprise wealth management technology platform, established a strategic relationship with a common goal: to help financial advisors grow their businesses and better connect with their clients in a rapidly evolving industry and regulatory environment. “AdvisorEngine has been continuously focused on helping financial advisors scale and grow. Our investment in Kredible’s powerful, research-based marketing tools further demonstrates our commitment to the financial services space,” said AdvisorEngine CEO, Rich Cancro. “So many advisors struggle with building out a solid online presence; Kredible’s platform streamlines the process with the goal of acquiring new clients.” Thomas Skrobe, WisdomTree Head of Client Solutions, said, “WisdomTree and AdvisorEngine are committed to building a global advisor solutions program to help meet evolving client needs. With the wealth management industry changing quickly and significantly, financial advisors need to evolve the way they do business. Kredible’s solutions are a natural addition to our offerings, enabling advisors to differentiate themselves and grow their businesses through digital enhancements and modern techniques.” Beyond WisdomTree’s ETF, ETP and CIT offerings, the Company provides access to an advisor solutions program, which includes portfolio consulting services, model portfolios and practice management, incorporating leadership, organizational development and marketing services. The Incredible Opportunity for KredibleKredible is a technology-enabled practice management firm targeting financial advisors with the goal of helping advisors modernize and enhance their online presence. Kredible research, including eye tracking studies of high net worth clients, shows that approximately 72% of the clients surveyed said online information is “extremely” or “very” influential to who they hire. Direct benefits to the advisor include: Ability to attract more prospects and win more business by optimizing their digital presence, such as their social profiles and organic search rankingsAccess to relevant content and analyticsA behavioral, research-based online property for each advisor that helps fill a void in most financial advisors’ online presence Brad Shepard, Kredible Founder and CEO, said, “Based on our research, more than 50% of new prospects indicate that they have eliminated a financial advisor from consideration based on what they did or didn’t find about them online. The modern advisor must evolve to meet ever-changing expectations including the way their prospects and clients find them to determine if they are credible to manage their financial life and communicate with them on an ongoing basis.” “We’re thrilled to join WisdomTree and AdvisorEngine in this effort,” Shepard adds. Enhancing Connectivity Between Client and AdvisorIn February, AdvisorEngine announced the acquisition of a financial planning technology that both streamlines the onboarding process and includes an easy-to-use digital prospecting tool that helps financial firms create and deliver advice, execute on that advice and monitor client progress.  Going forward, AdvisorEngine will continue to be an open architecture platform with key integrations to other financial planning tools and CRMs, as such tools are often very personal to the advisor. AdvisorEngine’s Cancro adds, “The financial investment and strategic relationship with WisdomTree has allowed us to expand the AdvisorEngine platform to deliver an innovative and sophisticated set of tools that advisors can use to differentiate themselves from the competition. Add Kredible to the platform, and you have a deeper, broader layer of advisor growth solutions to complement our existing solutions.” In November 2016, WisdomTree made a $20 million minority equity investment in AdvisorEngine and announced a strategic agreement whereby WisdomTree’s asset allocation models would be made available through AdvisorEngine’s open architecture platform and WisdomTree would actively introduce the AdvisorEngine platform to its deep distribution network. WisdomTree is also announcing an additional $5 million investment in AdvisorEngine to continue to fuel its growth, leadership and innovation in the advisor solutions space.

Beyond WisdomTree's ETF, ETP and CIT offerings, the Company provides access to an advisor solutions program, which includes portfolio consulting services, model portfolios and practice management, incorporating leadership, organizational development and marketing services.


                                        








The Incredible Opportunity for Kredible        
Kredible is a technology-enabled practice management firm targeting financial advisors with the goal of helping advisors modernize and enhance their online presence. Kredible research, including eye tracking studies of high net worth clients, shows that approximately 72% of the clients surveyed said online information is "extremely" or "very" influential to who they hire.


                                        








Direct benefits to the advisor include:


                                        










Ability to attract more prospects and win more business by optimizing their digital presence, such as their social profiles and organic search rankings

                                    










Access to relevant content and analytics

                                    










A behavioral, research-based online property for each advisor that helps fill a void in most financial advisors' online presence

                                    










Brad Shepard, Kredible Founder and CEO, said, "Based on our research, more than 50% of new prospects indicate that they have eliminated a financial advisor from consideration based on what they did or didn't find about them online. The modern advisor must evolve to meet ever-changing expectations including the way their prospects and clients find them to determine if they are credible to manage their financial life and communicate with them on an ongoing basis."


                                        








"We're thrilled to join WisdomTree and AdvisorEngine in this effort," Shepard adds.


                                        








Enhancing Connectivity Between Client and Advisor        
In February, AdvisorEngine announced the acquisition of a financial planning technology that both streamlines the onboarding process and includes an easy-to-use digital prospecting tool that helps financial firms create and deliver advice, execute on that advice and monitor client progress.  Going forward, AdvisorEngine will continue to be an open architecture platform with key integrations to other financial planning tools and CRMs, as such tools are often very personal to the advisor.


                                        








AdvisorEngine's Cancro adds, "The financial investment and strategic relationship with WisdomTree has allowed us to expand the AdvisorEngine platform to deliver an innovative and sophisticated set of tools that advisors can use to differentiate themselves from the competition. Add Kredible to the platform, and you have a deeper, broader layer of advisor growth solutions to complement our existing solutions."


                                        








In November 2016, WisdomTree made a $20 million minority equity investment in AdvisorEngine and announced a strategic agreement whereby WisdomTree's asset allocation models would be made available through AdvisorEngine's open architecture platform and WisdomTree would actively introduce the AdvisorEngine platform to its deep distribution network. WisdomTree is also announcing an additional $5 million investment in AdvisorEngine to continue to fuel its growth, leadership and innovation in the advisor solutions space.

NEW YORK, April 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WisdomTree Investments, Inc. (NASDAQ:WETF), an exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) and exchange-traded product (“ETP”) sponsor and asset manager driven by research and technology, and AdvisorEngine Inc., a digital wealth management platform, jointly announce their commitment to providing advisor growth solutions through AdvisorEngine’s acquisition of Kredible Technologies, Inc. (“Kredible”), a technology-enabled, research-driven practice management firm designed to help advisors acquire new clients.






WisdomTree and AdvisorEngine: Collectively Helping Advisors Grow Their BusinessesIn November 2016, WisdomTree, an independent-thinking asset manager with a focus on research and a history of innovation, and AdvisorEngine, a B2B full enterprise wealth management technology platform, established a strategic relationship with a common goal: to help financial advisors grow their businesses and better connect with their clients in a rapidly evolving industry and regulatory environment.
“AdvisorEngine has been continuously focused on helping financial advisors scale and grow. Our investment in Kredible’s powerful, research-based marketing tools further demonstrates our commitment to the financial services space,” said AdvisorEngine CEO, Rich Cancro. “So many advisors struggle with building out a solid online presence; Kredible’s platform streamlines the process with the goal of acquiring new clients.”
Thomas Skrobe, WisdomTree Head of Client Solutions, said, “WisdomTree and AdvisorEngine are committed to building a global advisor solutions program to help meet evolving client needs. With the wealth management industry changing quickly and significantly, financial advisors need to evolve the way they do business. Kredible’s solutions are a natural addition to our offerings, enabling advisors to differentiate themselves and grow their businesses through digital enhancements and modern techniques.”
Beyond WisdomTree’s ETF, ETP and CIT offerings, the Company provides access to an advisor solutions program, which includes portfolio consulting services, model portfolios and practice management, incorporating leadership, organizational development and marketing services.
