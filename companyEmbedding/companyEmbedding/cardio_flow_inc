Children who are extremely picky eaters may be missing out on some vital nutrients, and there is some research showing many children may not be meeting their vitamin D needs if they dont go out in the sun often enough. Omega-3 fatty acids may also be deficient. If your child doesnt eat fish and seafood, pumpkin seeds, flaxseeds, soy or walnuts, he or she may benefit from taking fish oil or omega-3 fatty acid supplements.

Care and Treatment








































Am I At Risk for Heart Disease?





Heart disease is the number one cause of death for men and women in the United States; about one in four people die of heart disease every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  
But many types of heart disease are preventable, by reducing risk factors and being aware of the signs and symptoms. For example, you can reduce your risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), the most common type of heart disease, through lifestyle changes and medication therapy.
About the Preventive Cardiology clinic
Our expert cardiologists provide you the tools you need to live a heart healthy life. Our team's integrated approach to patient care includes an evaluation of your heart disease risk factors.
At our clinic, you can expect:

Plans tailored for you, with specific lifestyle recommendations and medication management as needed
Counseling and education to promote a healthy lifestyle
Access to research and active clinical trials

Comprehensive heart disease risk assessment
Our evaluation and treatment therapies are designed to slow or stop the progression of heart disease, for conditions like atherosclerosis, or coronary artery disease.

Lipid abnormalities

Components of the cardiometabolic syndrome: 
Blood pressure
Glucose
Physical activity



Men and women are affected differently by certain risk factors. Our Women's Heart Health clinic focuses solely on how heart disease affects women. 
About the Familial Coronary Risk Clinic
The Stanford Familial Coronary Risk Clinic is a special focus within the Preventive Cardiology clinic, providing comprehensive, compassionate care to individual patients with early-onset coronary disease or strong risk factors for coronary disease, as well as their family members who may also be at increased risk.
Our goal is to comprehensively evaluate a patient's risk and to provide the most effective measures to slow or stop the progression of atherosclerosis for both primary and secondary prevention.
Individualized action plans are developed to determine the optimal approach for each patient, which include lifestyle interventions and when necessary, medications. Electronic medical records provide patients with secure on-line access to health information and communication.
The program involves:

Advanced tests for lipids and emerging risk factors such as CRP, Lp (a), and Apo B
Referrals for and assessment of imaging tests, such as ultrasound and heart CT scans
Interpretation of and referrals for cardiovascular genetic testing

Referrals to cardiac rehabilitation programs
Coordination with Women's Heart Health for specialized coronary artery disease and chest pain evaluation

Care and Treatment









































Conditions Treated









Cholesterol
Excess cholesterol is deposited in the lining of the arteries, including the arteries that feed the heart muscle, which in turn narrows the artery through which blood flows.






Diabetes and high blood pressure
High blood pressure is twice as likely to strike a person with diabetes than a person without diabetes; left untreated, high blood pressure can lead to heart disease and stroke.






Hypertension (chronic hypertension)
Also referred to as high blood pressure, a condition in which the arteries have persistently elevated blood pressure which can lead to damaged organs, as well as several illnesses, such as renal failure (kidney failure), aneurysm, heart failure, stroke, or heart attack.










Sleep and heart disease
Women with chronic sleep disturbance experience an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

Heart Disease in Women Q&A
05.20.2015








                Are women at higher risk for cardiovascular disease than men?
            



Heart disease is more prevalent in men than women, and remains the leading cause of death for both sexes. Cardiovascular disease, on the other hand, which also includes heart failure, hypertension, and stroke, is more prevalent in women.
Likewise, each year, more women than men die of cardiovascular disease. Six times as many women die from heart disease as from breast cancer— about 500,000 each year.
An estimated 8 million American women suffer from heart disease. One out of every four women will die of heart disease, and one out of every two will die of cardiovascular disease. Women have more heart attacks than men that go unrecognized.















                Who is at risk? How can I reduce my risk?
            



Two out of every three women who die suddenly of heart disease have no prior history of cardiovascular disease.
Several risk factors can raise your risk, including:

A family history of cardiovascular disease
High blood pressure
Diabetes
Smoking
Abnormal cholesterol

Even if you have normal cholesterol, after menopause, the amount of low-density lipoproteins, or LDL (“bad cholesterol”), may increase because of the lowered levels of estrogen.
Your risk of developing high blood pressure, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease increases if:

You are overweight or obese
Have an unhealthy diet (including excessive alcohol consumption)
Don’t exercise regularly

You can lower your risk significantly by:

Eating a heart-healthy diet that is low in saturated fat, sugar and salt
Maintaining a healthy weight
Being physically active
Limiting the amount of alcohol you drink
Not smoking

Psychological distress can be a risk factor. Women with depression and anxiety are more likely to die of heart disease. Women are also more prone to depression than men after a heart attack—and that raises the risk of another attack.















                How are the symptoms of heart attack different in women?
            



Chest pain is the classic symptom of a heart attack, but it can also feel like   pressure, tightness, squeezing, or burning. Women can have other symptoms, too:

Shortness of breath
Light-headedness, dizziness
Nausea or vomiting
Sweating
Unusual fatigue
Arm or shoulder pain, usually left-sided, but may be right-sided
Pain in neck, jaw, back, or abdomen
















                What are the most important elements in heart health care for women?
            



Finding a clinician who specializes in women’s heart health raises the odds that you’ll be evaluated by someone who knows what to look for and how to look for it. Clinician’s current standards for diagnosis are primarily based on research performed on men.
Women are more likely to get misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed because the symptoms they experience may not be consistent with these standards. In addition, women are less likely to be referred for appropriate testing.















                What are the latest advances in diagnosis and treatment for heart disease in women?
            



Many women experiencing symptoms may have a normal stress test or angiogram, which are tests often used to evaluate chest pain. Heart disease in women can affect smaller blood vessels instead of the large ones assessed in these standard tests.
Stanford is one of the few heart centers in the U.S. using special testing techniques tailored to find the microvascular disease or endothelial dysfunction that is more prevalent in women.
For many women, a treatment called percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, will be appropriate. The procedure passes a catheter, or narrow tubing, through arteries until the catheter reaches the site of a heart blockage.
Once there, a balloon is inflated within the artery to relieve the blockage and restore blood flow. Traditionally, the catheter was inserted in an artery in the groin. In women, however, that location produces two to three times the rate of bleeding and vascular complications.
Jennifer Tremmel, MD, SM, Clinical Director of Women’s Heart Health at Stanford, uses a transradial approach, inserting the catheter in the radial artery, an artery in the wrist. The transradial PCI cuts the rate of bleeding and complications by half.















                What is the Women’s Heart Health clinic at Stanford doing now?
            



Women’s Heart Health at Stanford has been growing since it started in 2007.
Clinical care continues to become increasingly comprehensive with specialists in:

Preventive cardiology
Psychology
Valvular heart disease
Arrhythmia
Peripheral vascular disease
Coronary artery disease

In addition, ongoing research studies add a greater understanding of how best to care for women patients. Women’s Heart Health at Stanford has many research studies, including:

Chest pain with normal heart arteries
Coronary artery dissection
Peri-partum weight gain
Diet and exercise interventions
Mindfulness for the improvement of heart health

Moreover, Women’s Heart Health is supporting other researchers at Stanford studying how women differ from men.

Education
Preventing Heart Disease Q&A
01.30.2015








                When should I start paying attention to my heart health?
            



It is never too early to start! Whether or not you develop heart disease will depend on modifiable factors (your behaviors and environment), genetic factors, or a combination of both.
The most common form of heart disease, coronary artery disease, typically begins in early adulthood. Some people are born with inherited heart or metabolic problems that raise their risk for the early appearance of heart health issues. Knowing something about your family's health history is a good start.
Get screened regularly to find out if you have high LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol, high blood pressure or high blood sugar—conditions that are relatively symptomless but that raise your risk for coronary artery disease.
You can calculate your risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years by entering your personal risk factor information at tools.cardiosource.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator.















                How can I avoid heart disease?
            



For most of us, reducing our risk of heart disease means adopting behaviors long known to keep a heart healthy:

Eating heart-healthy food
Being physically active
Not smoking
Maintaining an appropriate weight

The DASH and Mediterranean diets have both proven effective as heart-healthy. Learning how to manage stress is also important because long-term stress can contribute to unhealthy behaviors, increase blood pressure and may independently cause heart attacks.
Control of risk factors with lifestyle change, and sometimes with medications like statins, can reduce the risk of heart attacks.
For some people with specific genetic conditions, like familial hypercholesterolemia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the effect of their genes tends to dominate the effect of environment, although environment continues to play a role.
For people without such a strong genetic component, a family history of heart disease may still provide clues. Some drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamines, and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy, can also damage the heart.
Other medical conditions, like diabetes and sleep apnea, can also raise your risk for heart disease, so finding good care for those conditions is also important. As you grow older, it also makes sense to know the symptoms of a heart attack, so you can seek prompt medical attention if they occur.
Heart attack symptoms in women can be very different from those seen in men; knowing those symptoms will allow you to seek prompt treatment.















                Does intensity of exercise matter?
            



The intensity of exercise is less important than just being active. In other words, moving off the couch and becoming a regular walker does more to reduce the risk of heart disease than increasing the intensity of exercise from moderate to high.
The heart is a muscle, and like any muscle, responds well to exercise. Those of us who did not grow up playing sports or doing exercise may be discouraged by the thought of running, bicycling, swimming, skiing and rowing.
It is important to know that activities like gardening, vacuuming, and walking up stairs count as activities that help your heart. Try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day. Wearing a pedometer or using some other device that can be downloaded to a smart phone can help motivate people to reach their physical activity goals.















                What’s new in heart disease prevention?
            



In recent years, research has identified some important genetic influences on heart health—and clinical care has become more effective in preventing the worst consequences. That increased level of knowledge has added genetic analysis as a tool to find new therapeutic drugs and to better understand the disease process.
Research has also confirmed without question that smoking, diet, and exercise are directly related to heart health. In certain people, such as those with a strong family history of heart attacks, screening for coronary artery calcium has become an effective way to detect early deposits of cholesterol in coronary arteries before they cause symptoms. This discovery often leads to better risk factor control that can reduce the chances of having a heart attack.















                Is it ever too late to make changes to reduce my risk for heart disease?
            



It is never too late to make changes to reduce the risk of having a heart attack. Amazingly enough, when people who have smoked for decades quit smoking, within two years their risk of having a heart attack falls within two years to that of someone who has never smoked.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Please note: Roex has recently renamed and relabeled the product formerly called "CardioClear." It is now called "CardioFlow."CardioFlow� keeps your veins and arteries clear of toxic debris!
CardioFlow� is an EDTA-based oral chelation formula 
that promotes healthy circulation and cardiovascular function.  It works
 to remove built up stores of toxins like lead, mercury and other heavy 
metals that can often have negative health effects. 
Each capsule of CardioFlow� contains 250mg of calcium disodium EDTA, 
which has been scientifically proven to remove harmful heavy metals from
 the body and support healthy circulation.  It also contains malic acid,
 garlic, and parsley which are also chelators and work to protect the 
heart and support healthy blood pressure.
CardioFlow: Promotes healthy circulation throughout the body, Supports healthy cardiovascular function, Supports healthy blood pressure, Removes harmful environmental heavy metals.*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.







              Directions: Basic chelation therapeutic dose is 4 capsules daily / 1,000 mgs EDTA (minimum 6-9 months for substantial results). Aggressive chelation dose is 6-12 capsules daily / 1,500-3,000 mgs EDTA (6-9 months).Caution: Keep out of reach of children. Use only as directed. Not for use by pregnant or lactating women. Persons with kidney disorders, or those taking prescription blood thinners like coumadin (warfarin), should not use this product unless directed to do so by their physician.Ingredients: EDTA (calcium disodium) � 500 mg, Malic Acid � 600 mg, Garlic (odor reduced) � 200 mg, Parsely Powder � 50 mg.Other Ingredient: Gelatin capsule, silicon dioxide.A Note On Using CardioFlow:1. Be Sure to Replace Your MineralsSince CardioFlow is so effective at clearing debris from your arteries, it may result in the depletion of certain essential elements as well. That's why it is very important you take a broad-spectrum mineral supplement when using it. We recommend our multivitamin / multimineral supplements Chelation Companion�, Nutra-6� or Nutra-2�. Mineral Basics� is also a good choice for those who are already taking a complete multivitamin formula.2. Select the Right Dosage for Your NeedsCardioFlow is extremely safe, and it is virtually impossible to overdose. However, you don't want to waste the product by taking more than you need. The table below shows the proper dose for the various types of chelation therapy and the time required for substantial results:Types of Chelation.................................Therapy DosageMaintenance Chelation Therapy........4 caps per day (1000 mgs EDTA)Therapeutic Chelation Therapy..........6 caps per day (1500 mgs EDTA)(6-9 months for best results)Aggressive Chelation Therapy...........8-12 caps per day(2000 mgs-3000 mgs EDTA) (6-9 months)Note: For all chelation protocols, always start with 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule in the mid-afternoon � then work up to the preferred dose over 3-7 days.3. Take CardioFlow When Your Stomach is Clear � Take Minerals With MealsFor best results, CardioFlow should be taken between meals on an empty stomach. This allows for maximum absorption of the product into your bloodstream. Minerals (along with most other supplements) should be taken with meals. You should also drink plenty of water throughout the day to hydrate your body and to assist with nutrient absorption. *Information provided by Health Freedom Nutrition / ROEX for CardioFlow.

Care and Treatment








































Am I At Risk for Heart Disease?





Heart disease is the number one cause of death for men and women in the United States; about one in four people die of heart disease every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  
But many types of heart disease are preventable, by reducing risk factors and being aware of the signs and symptoms. For example, you can reduce your risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), the most common type of heart disease, through lifestyle changes and medication therapy.
About the Preventive Cardiology clinic
Our expert cardiologists provide you the tools you need to live a heart healthy life. Our team's integrated approach to patient care includes an evaluation of your heart disease risk factors.
At our clinic, you can expect:

Plans tailored for you, with specific lifestyle recommendations and medication management as needed
Counseling and education to promote a healthy lifestyle
Access to research and active clinical trials

Comprehensive heart disease risk assessment
Our evaluation and treatment therapies are designed to slow or stop the progression of heart disease, for conditions like atherosclerosis, or coronary artery disease.

Lipid abnormalities

Components of the cardiometabolic syndrome: 
Blood pressure
Glucose
Physical activity



Men and women are affected differently by certain risk factors. Our Women's Heart Health clinic focuses solely on how heart disease affects women. 
About the Familial Coronary Risk Clinic
The Stanford Familial Coronary Risk Clinic is a special focus within the Preventive Cardiology clinic, providing comprehensive, compassionate care to individual patients with early-onset coronary disease or strong risk factors for coronary disease, as well as their family members who may also be at increased risk.
Our goal is to comprehensively evaluate a patient's risk and to provide the most effective measures to slow or stop the progression of atherosclerosis for both primary and secondary prevention.
Individualized action plans are developed to determine the optimal approach for each patient, which include lifestyle interventions and when necessary, medications. Electronic medical records provide patients with secure on-line access to health information and communication.
The program involves:

Advanced tests for lipids and emerging risk factors such as CRP, Lp (a), and Apo B
Referrals for and assessment of imaging tests, such as ultrasound and heart CT scans
Interpretation of and referrals for cardiovascular genetic testing

Referrals to cardiac rehabilitation programs
Coordination with Women's Heart Health for specialized coronary artery disease and chest pain evaluation

Heart Disease in Women Q&A
05.20.2015








                Are women at higher risk for cardiovascular disease than men?
            



Heart disease is more prevalent in men than women, and remains the leading cause of death for both sexes. Cardiovascular disease, on the other hand, which also includes heart failure, hypertension, and stroke, is more prevalent in women.
Likewise, each year, more women than men die of cardiovascular disease. Six times as many women die from heart disease as from breast cancer— about 500,000 each year.
An estimated 8 million American women suffer from heart disease. One out of every four women will die of heart disease, and one out of every two will die of cardiovascular disease. Women have more heart attacks than men that go unrecognized.















                Who is at risk? How can I reduce my risk?
            



Two out of every three women who die suddenly of heart disease have no prior history of cardiovascular disease.
Several risk factors can raise your risk, including:

A family history of cardiovascular disease
High blood pressure
Diabetes
Smoking
Abnormal cholesterol

Even if you have normal cholesterol, after menopause, the amount of low-density lipoproteins, or LDL (“bad cholesterol”), may increase because of the lowered levels of estrogen.
Your risk of developing high blood pressure, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease increases if:

You are overweight or obese
Have an unhealthy diet (including excessive alcohol consumption)
Don’t exercise regularly

You can lower your risk significantly by:

Eating a heart-healthy diet that is low in saturated fat, sugar and salt
Maintaining a healthy weight
Being physically active
Limiting the amount of alcohol you drink
Not smoking

Psychological distress can be a risk factor. Women with depression and anxiety are more likely to die of heart disease. Women are also more prone to depression than men after a heart attack—and that raises the risk of another attack.















                How are the symptoms of heart attack different in women?
            



Chest pain is the classic symptom of a heart attack, but it can also feel like   pressure, tightness, squeezing, or burning. Women can have other symptoms, too:

Shortness of breath
Light-headedness, dizziness
Nausea or vomiting
Sweating
Unusual fatigue
Arm or shoulder pain, usually left-sided, but may be right-sided
Pain in neck, jaw, back, or abdomen
















                What are the most important elements in heart health care for women?
            



Finding a clinician who specializes in women’s heart health raises the odds that you’ll be evaluated by someone who knows what to look for and how to look for it. Clinician’s current standards for diagnosis are primarily based on research performed on men.
Women are more likely to get misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed because the symptoms they experience may not be consistent with these standards. In addition, women are less likely to be referred for appropriate testing.















                What are the latest advances in diagnosis and treatment for heart disease in women?
            



Many women experiencing symptoms may have a normal stress test or angiogram, which are tests often used to evaluate chest pain. Heart disease in women can affect smaller blood vessels instead of the large ones assessed in these standard tests.
Stanford is one of the few heart centers in the U.S. using special testing techniques tailored to find the microvascular disease or endothelial dysfunction that is more prevalent in women.
For many women, a treatment called percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, will be appropriate. The procedure passes a catheter, or narrow tubing, through arteries until the catheter reaches the site of a heart blockage.
Once there, a balloon is inflated within the artery to relieve the blockage and restore blood flow. Traditionally, the catheter was inserted in an artery in the groin. In women, however, that location produces two to three times the rate of bleeding and vascular complications.
Jennifer Tremmel, MD, SM, Clinical Director of Women’s Heart Health at Stanford, uses a transradial approach, inserting the catheter in the radial artery, an artery in the wrist. The transradial PCI cuts the rate of bleeding and complications by half.















                What is the Women’s Heart Health clinic at Stanford doing now?
            



Women’s Heart Health at Stanford has been growing since it started in 2007.
Clinical care continues to become increasingly comprehensive with specialists in:

Preventive cardiology
Psychology
Valvular heart disease
Arrhythmia
Peripheral vascular disease
Coronary artery disease

In addition, ongoing research studies add a greater understanding of how best to care for women patients. Women’s Heart Health at Stanford has many research studies, including:

Chest pain with normal heart arteries
Coronary artery dissection
Peri-partum weight gain
Diet and exercise interventions
Mindfulness for the improvement of heart health

Moreover, Women’s Heart Health is supporting other researchers at Stanford studying how women differ from men.

In addition to ground-breaking research, Stanford has an international reputation for cardiac excellence. Dr. Norman Shumway performed the first adult heart transplant in 1968 at Stanford. Since then, we've performed more than 30,000 cardiac procedures, treating some of the most complex patients.

Care and Treatment









































Conditions Treated









Cholesterol
Excess cholesterol is deposited in the lining of the arteries, including the arteries that feed the heart muscle, which in turn narrows the artery through which blood flows.






Diabetes and high blood pressure
High blood pressure is twice as likely to strike a person with diabetes than a person without diabetes; left untreated, high blood pressure can lead to heart disease and stroke.






Hypertension (chronic hypertension)
Also referred to as high blood pressure, a condition in which the arteries have persistently elevated blood pressure which can lead to damaged organs, as well as several illnesses, such as renal failure (kidney failure), aneurysm, heart failure, stroke, or heart attack.










Sleep and heart disease
Women with chronic sleep disturbance experience an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
