Early life and education[edit]
Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum is the son of Shirley and Alan Lorberbaum,[4] Jewish[5] migrants to the South from New York City.[4] In 1957, his parents founded Aladdin Mills, Inc., in Dalton, Georgia. Aladdin initially produced bathmats and rugs for discount retailers and during the 1970s expanded into tufted carpet manufacturing, eventually growing the business into one of the largest carpet manufacturers in the country.[4] He has one sister, Suzanne Helen of Denver, and one brother, Mark Lorberbaum of Miami Beach.[4] He graduated with a B.A. from the University of Denver.[1]
Career[edit]
Jeffrey joined the family business, carpet and rug manufacturer Aladdin Mills, in 1976, after graduating from the University of Denver. Lorberbaum held a number of leadership positions, eventually serving as Vice President of Operations from 1986 to 1994.[6] In 1994, Aladdin merged with Mohawk Industries, which had gone public in 1992, creating one of the largest flooring manufacturers in the United States - and his father became Mohawk’s largest shareholder. Jeffrey and Alan Lorberbaum then joined Mohawk's Board of Directors.[4] In 1995, Lorberbaum became president of Mohawk; and, in 2001, he became CEO. Since then he has grown the company to $5.8 billion in revenues (2012)[1] partly through acquisitions that expanded the scope of the company into hard surface flooring (ceramic tile, laminate, hard wood) and provided access to new geographies.[7][8] In 2002, Lorberbaum orchestrated the $1.8 billion purchase of Dal-Tile of Dallas making Mohawk the world’s largest tile-maker. In 2005, Mohawk purchased Unilin, a Belgium-based maker of laminate flooring and MDF board (a composite used in do-it-yourself furniture) for $2.6 billion.[9]

Jeffrey Lorberbaum is an American billionaire and is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Georgia based Mohawk Industries Inc, which is one of the world’s largest flooring companies. The net worth of Jeffrey Lorberbaum is estimated to be $1.9 as per the Forbes 2015 list of the richest personalities. He is ranked #1054th Billionaire and ranked #373rd billionaire in United States.



 
 His business acumen is quite remarkable and he is obsessed with details. Jeffrey has transformed his parents’ bathmat operations into $5.7 billion housing products empire that includes carpet and the flooring operations, roofing and insulation businesses and a whole range of furniture line.
Early Life
 

Jeffrey Lorberbaum (born 1954) is the son of Shirley and Alan Lorberbaum who were Jewish migrants from the New York City. In 1957, Jeffrey’s parents founded Aladdin Mills, Inc. that manufactured bathmats, rugs from extruded plastics. Later, during 1970, it expanded into tufted carpet manufacturing, and the company eventually grew into one of the largest carpet manufacturers in United States of America. Jeffrey graduated from the University of Denver with B.A.in Finance in 1976.
Career
Jeffrey Lorberbaum grew up in the carpet business and therefore during his growth years he along with his siblings Suzanne and Mark grew up working on the factory floor during the summer vacations. His famous quote that he quoted for author Jason Jennings book “Hit the Ground Running” in 2007 is that “The Company was the family, and the family was the company.”
After earning his finance degree from the University of Denver in 1976, Lorberbaum reentered into the family business as Owner in Training or OIT as declared by his father and performed various jobs throughout the various departments of the company – Aladdin Inc. 
Achievements

During the 1980’s, Jeffrey was instrumental in an effort for Aladdin Inc. to be one of the first companies in its sector/industry to operate its own extruding machine that allowed the company to have a greater control over the cost and supply of its plastics feedstock. In the course of time, Jeffrey Lorberbaum held a number of leadership positions finally serving as the Vice President of Operations for Aladdin Inc.
from 1986 to 1994. During 1994, the Lorberbaum family after opting against the initial public offering sold Aladdin Inc. to Mohawk for $387 million in stock. The deal made the Lorberbaums, Mohawk’s largest stockholder with 42% of shares. Jeffrey Lorberbaum emerged successful in integrating Aladdin and another half a dozen companies into Mohawk with his quick mind, thorough preparation and a demanding focus on execution.
He almost collected $200 million from stock sales and compensation since 1994 according to the filings with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Under the leadership of Jeffrey Lorberbaum, Mohawk Industries successfully made a $1.5 billion acquisition bid for ceramic tile maker Marazzi Group SpA based in Modena – Italy that helped the company to extend its market share in the United States to 23% compared to 21% held by Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s Shaw Industries Group. This purchase also marked the third billion dollar acquisition that Lorberbaum has orchestrated. Jeffrey has turned billionaire by his successful mantra of acquisition remaining central part of the company’s strategy.

Early life and education[edit]
Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum is the son of Shirley and Alan Lorberbaum,[4] Jewish[5] migrants to the South from New York City.[4] In 1957, his parents founded Aladdin Mills, Inc., in Dalton, Georgia. Aladdin initially produced bathmats and rugs for discount retailers and during the 1970s expanded into tufted carpet manufacturing, eventually growing the business into one of the largest carpet manufacturers in the country.[4] He has one sister, Suzanne Helen of Denver, and one brother, Mark Lorberbaum of Miami Beach.[4] He graduated with a B.A. from the University of Denver.[1]
Career[edit]
Jeffrey joined the family business, carpet and rug manufacturer Aladdin Mills, in 1976, after graduating from the University of Denver. Lorberbaum held a number of leadership positions, eventually serving as Vice President of Operations from 1986 to 1994.[6] In 1994, Aladdin merged with Mohawk Industries, which had gone public in 1992, creating one of the largest flooring manufacturers in the United States - and his father became Mohawk’s largest shareholder. Jeffrey and Alan Lorberbaum then joined Mohawk's Board of Directors.[4] In 1995, Lorberbaum became president of Mohawk; and, in 2001, he became CEO. Since then he has grown the company to $5.8 billion in revenues (2012)[1] partly through acquisitions that expanded the scope of the company into hard surface flooring (ceramic tile, laminate, hard wood) and provided access to new geographies.[7][8] In 2002, Lorberbaum orchestrated the $1.8 billion purchase of Dal-Tile of Dallas making Mohawk the world’s largest tile-maker. In 2005, Mohawk purchased Unilin, a Belgium-based maker of laminate flooring and MDF board (a composite used in do-it-yourself furniture) for $2.6 billion.[9]
Personal life[edit]
Lorberbaum is married to Sarah Lorberbaum. They live in Chattanooga, Tennessee. They have two children, a daughter, Lauren, who works as a consultant at PwC Advisory in New York City, and a son, Brian, an associate at Mohawk Industries.
As of August 2016, Lorberbaum holds 9.6 million shares of Mohawk amounting to 14 percent of the company which is valued at $2.14 billion.[9]

Jeffrey Lorberbaum joined America's richest circles as the Chairman and CEO of Mohawk industries, one of the largest flooring companies in the world. He debuted on to the US's 400 richest list as a result of the increasing value of his 15% stake in listed Mohawk Industries.  Lorberbaum made his career beginnings in the mid-1970s, when he joined his father's company Aladdin Mills, a maker of bath mats. Later on, he took over the business completely, serving as the president and CEO until the family sold Aladdin to Mohawk in 1994. Not a full decade later, in 2001, Lorberbaum took the helm of Mohawk. While serving as CEO, he has managed to expand the company's operations into hard surface flooring. In late 2012, Mohawk revealed the purchase of Italian ceramic-tile maker, the Marazzi Group, for some $1.5 billion. Mohawk's stake price has increased drastically in the past 12 months.
