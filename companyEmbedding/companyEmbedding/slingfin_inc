Design Methodology
Our Name
The Crew
MZ's Views



The outdoor industry has changed since the early days... 
			Back then, people worked at and owned the companies they founded. Everyone involved was equally passionate about making the best products possible. Goals were driven by the lust for great gear, solid connections, and like-minded people. We have seen many of the companies we once respected for delivering kick-ass gear devolve into less passionate, more finance-driven corporate entities. 
			The methodology at SlingFin is design and quality driven. The end goal is to bring to market the most well-designed, and highest quality outdoor products ever created, for the most serious users in the world. Utilizing our innovative designs, the best materials available, and extensive research through hands-on product testing, we make sure our gear is tested under the harshest conditions to ensure a quality and trustworthy product. 

	        "There is no such thing as bad weather, only bad gear". – Masta DB. 
        	"The heaviest tent in the world is a lightweight tent that failed". – Phil Scott 


Tents are tensile structures.
			Tensile structures are formed with tension and compression members. The pure form of tensile structures can be seen with tensegrity structures where tension members (wires), and compression members (struts) operate simultaneously for the structure to hold its shape (please see tensegrity.com). If any single strut or tension member fails, the whole structure is weakened, and can even fail completely. Individual parts must work together to maintain strength and stability.

        	The same is true for tents. Any failure in a tension member (fabric) or compression member (tent poles) results in a weakened, or even failed structure. Liken tents to chains where any weak link may render the whole chain unusable. Designing a tent where all components are equally strong is a tremendous challenge, but is the key ingredient to making a tent or structure as strong as possible.
 
	        Many companies attach webbing (with a tensile strength of 500 pounds) to a tent using fabric with a tensile strength of 5 pounds. This is not an efficient use or resources because the tent is either out of balance, being either heavier than it needs to be, or not as strong as it could be. Using ingredients that are proportionately strong will create the strongest tent for the least amount of weight, and when you're out on the trail, the last thing you need is a broken tent. At SlingFin, we put design and efficiency at top of our priorities, because our team of hardworking outdoor enthusiasts and gear junkies know just how important it is to be able to trust your tent for every mile you spend on the trail.



Steff Zurek designed our logo with help from Jonathan Buck and Martin Zemitis.
			Steff came up with dozens of design concepts, and we chose one very similar to our current logo. Something about the way the tips of the fins joined together at the center made it look unfinished. Jonathan suggested that we "just spread the fins apart so they are no longer joined at the center." Steff took the new concept, and delivered our final and official logo. The process took place over 2 weeks.
			Steff Zurek is an artist and graphic designer who works in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Where did the name SlingFin come from? 
The Short Story 
            "Sling" refers to a climbing sling (a loop of nylon or dyneema with multiple applications), and "Fin" refers to the fin from a fish or rock formation. Founder Martin Zemitis wanted a name that represented gear made for use on land and in the water. 

The Long Story (per Martin) 
            I started purchasing domain names in the late 90's. I would register domain names I liked, or thought I would have use for in the future. I registered the domain names TentDesign.com, TentBlog.com, GeodesicDomes.com, Tensegrity.com, ExpeditionBlog.com, MountainBlog.com, and many others over the years. One weekend I spent a few hours looking for climbing related domain names, and while searching Sling.com and ClimbingSling.com, I stumbled across www.SlingFin.com 
			I worked at Mountain Hardwear for nearly 15 years before I decided it was time to head out on my own in 2009. I rented a beautiful loft in Richmond about 200 yards away from Mountain Hardware's original location (4911 Central Avenue) prior to moving to the Ford Point building in Richmond, California. I moved my parts library, industrial sewing machines, fabrics, materials, machinery, and design tools into the loft. The loft had windows on all sides and a gorgeous wood floor. The property owners (European Sleepworks, www.EuropeanSleepworks.com) were very generous and best of all quiet. I was free to design and work on whatever I wanted to. No product managers, bosses, and best of all, no interruptions. Few people knew what I was up to and for 6 months I spent all my time designing tents, sleeping bags, clothing, and packs. I came up with the WebTruss™ design and ExoPak technology during my design time in the loft. I used the name Expedition Technology (www.ExpeditionTechnology.com) for nearly a year, but deep down I knew the name had to be SlingFin.


Meet the SlingFin Crew:

Martin Zemitis — Founder/Designer/Gearhead
            Martin is widely known as one of the best tent designers in the business. As a 30+ year industry veteran and gear guru, he has developed award-winning products for other well-known industry leaders. Martin was originally one of the co-founders of Mountain Hardwear, but now as the founder of SlingFin, has his very own sandbox with two patents, and many more to come.

Timothy Baka — Founder
            Timothy was the "numbers guy" on the team of Mountain Hardwear co-founders. His past lives include investment banking and number crunching, but he has since started a China-based sourcing and production business specializing in organic cotton.

Richard Ying – Operations Manager
            Rich is responsible for the creation of product design outlines and the management of information between the creative side of SlingFin and our manufacturers in Asia. He is our "get it done" guy.

Tim Hunt — Dealer Relations
            Tim Hunt wandered into the SlingFin office after thru-hiking the PCT and the AT and didn't leave. An avid backpacker, paddler, cyclist, climber, skier, runner, surfer, gearhead, guide, and occasional glamper, he's led hiking and biking trips stateside and internationally for years. At SlingFin, he brings his extensive outdoor experience to the design process, sales, and dealer relations. 
Ellese Nguyen - Intern
            Between climbing and studying at UC Berkeley, Ellese helps manage and write for SlingFin's Facebook page and website. She fits in well with the SlingFin team because of her passion for the outdoors and for high quality gear. Her groovy and lively energy make her an all-around cool girl, which is perfect for SlingFin's social media and public outreach.

Kendall De Jong — Marketing, Sales, Public Relations and Social Media
            Kendal joined the SlingFin family in 2015 as a marketing and public relations manager. She has been active in the PR world for 10 years, and luckily for us, fits right in at SlingFin with her love for all things outdoors.

Nolan "NoNo" Fritts — Tent and Gear Guru
            Affectionately known as "NoNo," this guy brings high energy and enthusiasm to SlingFin, making him our go-to-guy for in-person dealer relations.

Devon Brown (Devo) – Gear Design, Social Media Interface, Guide & Internet Sales
            Devo is responsible for supporting the gear design process from raw materials selection to our initial social media outreach efforts. He is an avid outdoor enthusiast user, so he has a wealth of knowledge when it comes to outdoor gear and apparel. He formerly worked with Mountain Hardwear, leading their customer repairs and retail sales, so he really knows what works and what doesn't.

James Zormeir — Apparel Design
            James brings an avant garde and hip approach to clothing design at SlingFin. We consider him our breath of fresh air when it comes to outdoor clothing.

Robert Link — Professional Mountaineer/Design Advisor
            Robert has been kicking ass and putting his name down on many of the world's highest peaks. Having him put our gear to the test in the high mountains provides us with a design feedback loop to help us make the best gear possible.

Lhawang Dhondup — Professional Mountaineer/Design Advisor
            Lhawang has racked up over 30 years of Himalayan expedition experience under his belt. As Robert Link's climbing partner, he also kicks the shit out of our gear to make sure it works.

Devin Swisher — Creative Director
            Devin was the guy that made Mountain Hardwear look good for a decade. He is our artist extraordinaire, ideas man, and master of design and all things internet.

Paul Porter and Danny Nguyen – Photographers
            Thank them for all the awesome photos on our website, Facebook page, and Instagram!

Phil Scott — Legendary Designer/Production Guru
            Phil has been an outdoor industry man since the 1960's. He has also never met a computer CAD system he couldn't beat.

 #1 SlingFin Start (written by MZ) 
I started in this industry in 1975 with my brother Cedrik Zemitis, Bill Sterling, and Bonnie Jerome. We rented an industrial sewing machine, and I started making patterns and sewing products used by backpackers and cross-country skiers. It was easy to come up with new product designs since we were backpacking and cross-country skiing every chance we got. We made, used, and sold the gear. We started from the ground up and got our hands dirty. I learned to cut, sew, and make sample patterns, production patterns, markers, repair sewing machines, and much more. The learning curve was steep but fun and rewarding. I loved finding solutions to design problems which led me to become a designer, and later, an inventor.
In the early days, most of the backpacking companies focused on the equipment side of the business such as packs, sleeping bags, accessories, and tents. Clothing was in the mix, but was seen as equipment in the early days. Down jackets were not fashion items — they were tools just like down sleeping bags. Both were a necessary part of everyone's gear list. Companies grew and realized there was a much larger market for clothing instead of equipment though, and slowly equipment became an ever decreasing percentage of the business total as compared to clothing.
Clothing added a whole new level of complexity to the business, so most companies split responsibilities between equipment and clothing. Company owners were still working at the companies they founded and there was pride taken in the quality of their products. As the industry continued to grow and mature, the dollars got larger and product managers with pure business backgrounds took over with the mission to grow their businesses. As money rolled in, the game changed and became more serious. The economies of scale and capital resources allowed the larger companies to produce products offshore which helped them grow even faster. The industry went through several phases of consolidation with many of the smaller brands being assimilated into larger organizations. Brands such as Holubar, and others, eventually began to disappear altogether.
The important point here is the shift. Product managers with pure business backgrounds were hired to to manage the design process. Most of these managers knew numbers, marketing, product position, and sales, but few know of the details that go into making great gear. Their focus became to increase sales by selling products to a larger market through expanded distribution. Product managers are looking at the Leisure Trend numbers so they know what to tell their design department to create for the next season. For a forward looking designer, this is not a creative way to approach a piece of gear. Companies began using lower quality fabrics, raw materials, and second rate factories to make products that meet price points compelling to retail store buyers. This "cut-rate" approach leaves serious users confused and disappointed, since products are no longer well made, so more time is spent on the phone dealing with warranty departments. The customer is not happy if the product fails three days into a 17 day Patagonia trekking trip. 
To meet these ever-lower price points, companies are using less experienced, lower quality factories and raw materials. For example, high end tent brands would never have considered using a nylon 6 fabric 10 years ago. To meet these price points product managers and retail store buyers want nylon 6, instead of nylon 6,6. Take it one step further and consider that nylon fabrics are more expensive compared to polyester fabrics. Many manufacturers are now making their tents using polyester because these are less expensive than even nylon 6. Using the very lowest quality fabrics will help the product managers meet their price targets but the products will not stand up to the marketing hype put out by the company. 60 days of UV exposure is about the most you can hope for from the average tent these days. We have decided to get off that train and head down a new path which really is the old path that the industry was founded on -- making great gear for backpackers and mountaineers.
Making great gear is easy if you have the balls to do it, and you know how. You cut out the product manager who does not know how to make anything, and solve design problems instead of filling product slots for the retail buyers' positioning strategies. We started SlingFin to make quality gear for professional users. This means we are positioning ourselves at the top of the user pyramid. These are professional users, guides, outfitters, expedition users and gear junkies who crave only the best. We design and build tools which help these users accomplish their objectives. This is a tiny segment of the market and not one that will excite the average retailer. It's not even a market which is economically viable in the long term, but it is the right place to start. 
It is however, an often overlooked and critical part of the market. The users at the top of the pyramid are the ones that can give the feedback needed to produce great gear. They are the ones that help define what the problems are so the designers can work on solving the problems. I have learned something interesting over the years working with professional guides. If they return a piece of gear that is in tatters (what most people would consider a trashed piece of gear which should be recycled or discarded) and they want you to fix it, then you know you have succeeded. If you never hear from them again after giving them a product, then you know they are not interested in it. It's a rather dysfunctional means of communication, but that has been my observation over the last 35 years in the industry. There are guides and outfitters that are willing to work with you if you are willing to listen and learn from them. That is something I have always done since it's the long term users who know what works and what does not.
 I have had the privilege to work with many great mountaineers, Ed Viesturs, Eric Simonson, Robert Link, Babu Chiri Sherpa, David Breashears and many more. I feel a great amount of respect for Sherpas since they are many of the best mountaineers in the world. Babu Chiri Sherpa is an example of one of the best and strongest climbers ever. I learned a lot from Babu and his Sherpa friends. They see and use gear from all over the world and they know better than most what works and what does not work in some of the most inhospitable places and conditions on the planet. The way you make quality outdoor gear is the way you make any quality product. You find like minded people who love gear and have a passion for making it. There are factories and raw goods suppliers who are passionate about making quality products as well.
The trick is to know who they are and to set the ground rules when you start working with them. Generally, US manufacturers love to improve the quality of their products as the product cycle matures. Companies build their brand and improve their reputation which allows them to charge a premium for their products. The price goes up as more features, improvements and models are introduced. Asian factories, in order to win the contract, bid very low which means they have a very thin margin. The factories are betting they can increase their margin by lowering their costs over time. They do this by squeezing their suppliers and employees. In Asia, from the day you get a price quote, the factory (and all the suppliers) are trying to figure out how to lower their costs and increase their margins. This means that from day one the quality of the products steadily decreases as factories try to reduce costs. You have to either own a manufacturing facility or know how to work with contract factories to understand how to make quality gear. Paying for quality fabrics alone will not get the results you are trying to achieve when it comes to making quality gear. We work with factories that do not play by the Asian pricing strategies. 
What else makes a great company? People! To make quality gear you need to bring people together who are passionate about gear. Phil Scott, for example, has been in the industry since the 60's. He has worked for every name brand outdoor company in California. He is one of the few people I know (other than Marty Kaiser and Mark Erickson) that can design clothing, sleeping bags, tents and packs. While Phil is a designer his real specialties are cutting, making production patterns, markers, grading. His sewing is rather crude but he does know how to sew better than most people. He has been designing and making gear for nearly 50 years. He knows what works and is constantly making improvements to his products. He is an old fashioned craftsman who loves gear! Phil has been "banned for life" from participating in any marketing or product naming sessions. His dislike and contempt for marketing is only rivaled by his dislike of poor design, fabrics or craftsmanship. Phil is working in our skunk works on clothing as is Susan Smith, a former design room manager and product engineer for The North Face and other Bay Area outdoor companies over the last 27 years. Tim Baka is a Harvard MBA and was Mountain Hardwear's numbers guy until the company's sale to Columbia in 2003. He put together the business plan for the Hardwear along with Jack Gilbert. While his first jobs were as an investment banker, Tim and his wife Dora have spent the last 6 years in Hong Kong working in organic cotton garment and fabric manufacturing. Tim has visited and worked with more textile mills and sewing factories than anyone I know.
While we are working on clothing, sleeping bags, and packs, our initial products are tents. Equipment has historically been the foundation of any authentic brand in the outdoor industry. Tents often separate the creative brands from the others. The world sees your company logo in some off the craziest places on Earth. Any company in the rag trade can make a garment, but only a handful of companies can make a tent that can withstand 8,000 meter conditions with less than 10 pounds of aluminum and fabric. SlingFin has no formal marketing department, other than a keg of beer and a jockey box full of ice (and some very creative minds). We have 18 industrial sewing machines used for sample making, the support of our vendors that we have been working with for over 30 years, and people who are passionate about making great gear. What we do is build gear like others in our industry used to, but this time with people who have more experience than those who did in the 60's.

SlingFin Lifetime Warranty:
SlingFin guarantees that the materials and workmanship in every product we make
                            will stand up to the use for which it was designed. This warranty does not cover damage
                            caused by improper care, improper cleaning, accidents and natural breakdown of materials over extended time and use. All warranty products should be returned to us for evaluation and will be repaired or replaced at our discretion. Damage due to accident or improper care will be repaired (if possible) at a reasonable rate.
Warranty Disclaimer:
Improper Care or Cleaning
                            Damage from mold, mildew, acid or volcanic gas is not covered under the SlingFin warranty
                            It is important that you store your SlingFin products in as clean and dry a location as possible. Storing wet or damp gear, that is dirty, facilitates the growth of mold and mildew. Mold and mildew damages fabrics that results in decreased performance, ugly stains and horrible smelling gear!
                            Please keep all SlingFin products away from battery acid and environments where volcanic gases may come into contact with your gear.
                            Do not machine wash or dry any SlingFin products without first consulting the owner’s manual.
Product Modification:
SlingFin recognizes that field maintenance, modifications and repairs are often necessary. Repairs and modifications made in the field will not void the SlingFin Lifetime warranty provided the repairs and modifications are reasonable and necessary. SlingFin does reserve the right to determine, at its sole discretion, if the modifications were reasonable and necessary.
Return Instructions for Warranty Items:
All warranty items returned to SlingFin must be clean. California law prohibits our employees from handling returned items that or not clean. We do not have cleaning facilities so we will return all items that are not clean.
Sender must request an RMA
(Return Merchandise Authorization) in order to process any returns.

Summary
The SlingFin CrossBow 2 R/S is the solid bodied, ripstop four-season tent in the CrossBow 2 family. Two backpackers and ALL OF THEIR GEAR can comfortably wait out the storm without being cramped. This tent is ideal for a backpacking duo that does not want to compromise shelter strength in cold weather conditions. Not every new tent builder has more experience than the big dogs…

Pros

Very comfortable for two people
Extremely spacious vestibules
Good strength-to-weight ratio
Excellent quality of materials



Cons

Not dry pitch/dry breakdown
Learning curve
High price point



A quiet afternoon in the forest, all to myself.
Although SlingFin may be a relatively new name to the tent world, the crew on board has more collective experience than most well established companies. It is clear that they have paid very close attention to the needs of users who camp in adverse conditions. This being said, this tent could be overkill for many hikers out there. This tent configuration is designed specifically for cold weather environments, which has been quite lacking this autumn in the Mid-Atlantic east coast region.
Specs:
MSRP $580
Capacity: 2 Person
Number of Doors: 2
Number of Vestibules: 2
Interior Area: 32 sq ft
Vestibule Area: 11sq ft (X2)
Interior Height: 41.5” at center
Fabric- 20D Nylon Ripstop PU Coated Floor
            15D Canopy Fabric
            15D Nylon Ripstop Silicone PU Coated Fly
Poles- 2x DAC NSL 9mm (Main Poles)
           1x DAC NSL 9.6mm (Bow Pole)
Min. Trail Weight: 4lbs 4oz (Without Footprint)

Setup
This shelter takes a good bit of time to learn for proper setup. After a couple of uses, the CrossBow 2 R/S became intuitive to setup. After staking the four corners of the shelter, the two main tent poles slide through the WebTruss and are inserted into grommets, much like most tents. 

The rainfly can then be installed, which was shown to be problematic when breaking camp in the pouring rain. Removing the tent poles from the gusset can be troublesome, especially when every moment counts during a rainstorm.
I broke the tent down during a rainstorm, working as carefully as possible to keep the tent dry. Unfortunately, the tent poles were being extremely finicky coming out of their sleeves. Unfortunately, there wasn’t an opportunity to snap any shots at the time…
The top bow pole is optional, if the user chooses to attach trekking poles as the secondary support system (weight savings= 3.7oz).

The guylines are all included with clam cleats, which have become a standard in the industry over the last several years. 

Rainfly installation is easy, with special reflective tabs that indicate the correct opening in respect to the doorway to the tent.

Stability
All configurations of the SlingFin CrossBow 2 have shown to be among the most stable tents I have ever used. The strongest winds encountered during testing were only in the 30+ mph range, and this tent did not budge. This tent will easily handle far higher winds!
Weather Resistance
The R/S performed extremely well in one downpour during testing. The rainfly keeps the entire tent inner dry, as well as the two GIANT vestibules. The bathtub bottom of this shelter successfully prevented any splash back. 

Ventilation
The R/S has shown to ventilate extremely well in cold weather and rain, over a four-day trip to the Cranberry Wilderness in southern Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia in November. Though wind was light, no condensation was noted whatsoever the entire trip, with both vestibules closed.
The rainfly is designed for maximum cross-ventilation
Two doors aid in superb ventilation
 
Room & Storage
The useable space for the size and weight of this shelter is truly great. Most of my testing was either solo or with my pup, and this tent is palatial! Even with two larger people in this tent, the vestibules will hold packs, boots, trekking poles, water bottles and more!

Packability
For the size of this shelter, packability is a plus. The 15D and 20D material really does an admirable job packing down.
Ease Of Use
Once the system is understood, the CrossBow 2 is relatively easy to use. The WebTruss can easily become tangled and twisted when stored, but is not too much of a hassle to correct. The adjustable guylines allow the rainfly to appropriately adjust when the tent is set up on non-level ground.
Features
There are several features that set this shelter apart from most others. All guylines and sleeve openings have awesome reflective strips, making this tent quick to spot, even from 50+ yards! Cam adjustments allow the flysheet to be easily adjusted, ensuring a happy and dry camper! 

The inner of the flysheet has additional toggles and o-rings so it can be directly attached to the tent poles rather than the tent inner, which greatly increases tent strength. 
The fly attaches directly to the tent poles with a toggle/ring system (shown separated)
 
Each end of the tent inner has two large pockets for storage and organization. Thanks, SlingFin, for listening!
280 weight merino wool sweatshirt and more are swallowed by the pocket.
Construction & Durability
SlingFin did not cut any corners when it comes to quality of craftsmanship they are putting into the hands of their customers.  Every stitch, feature, and clip is top of the range construction. No wear has been noted during the duration of testing. Titanium Dioxide coated fabric prolongs the lifespan of any material that is exposed to UV rays. Eco-friendly DAC tent pegs and tent poles are used. 

Conditions
This shelter configuration has been tested on approximately four overnight trips on the Appalachian Trail between October and November, 2016.

Many thanks to the people out at SlingFin for the opportunity to test this product for the Trailspace Gear Review Corps!

Recent Four-Season Tent Reviews

				Stephenson's Warmlite 2R			


								Great tent. I got my first 2R Stephenson tent around 1974. Did several trips to the Grand Teton, up to the Canadian Rockies and then down to Peru. It was lightweight and stood up great in some wild windy snowy weather at high altitudes.  On the saddle between the Grand and Middle Teton one time, the winds shredded two lady climbers' tent and they had to join us. Our tent held great, while it was cramped for four.  Unfortunately, my tent did not hold up too well after I got married and my son…				Full review


				Marmot Thor 2P			


								Is a strong and solid 4-season freestanding tent, very spacious and good design. This is my first impression of this tent. I have only used this new model once. With the previous model, despite being a very good tent, I had some problems, but the people of Marmot have behaved incredibly well, a little delayed, but finally I have my tent. With respect to the previous model, it is a little shorter 221 (236), higher 112 (109), wider 147 (142), changed the poles, has no knees, and is easier and faster…				Full review


				ALPS Mountaineering Tasmanian 2			


								So far we have only set up the tent in the backyard in nice spring weather. First impressions are that the tent quality is very good for the price. The large vestibule gives a neat front porch feel to it. It is very spacious inside for two, and there are gear pockets all around the interior just above the floor. The fabric color is relaxing. We just received this tent and will be updating this review once we use it a few times. First impressions were that this is a well constructed tent with the…				Full review


				Sierra Designs Superflash			


								Bought new very long ago. Treasured tent, not used for many years. Recently used it again, found coating on flysheet has gone gummy. Inner tent OK, poles like new. Perhaps person above with bad poles would like to sell me theirs or buy mine. Excellent design. Should be updated with polyester flysheet.				Full review


				Cabela's Alaskan Guide			


								Strongest dome tent I have owned! I have both the 8-man tent and the 6-man tent with the added floor protector for both, plus they made a corridor to connect two tents. We use the 8-man tent to sleep in and the 6-man to keep all of our gear. 
These tent are extremely strong and by far the most well made tents I have had.				Full review


				Cabela's Alaskan Guide 8-Man			


								Strongest dome tent I have owned! I have both the 8 man tent and the 6-Man tent with the added floor protector for both, plus they made a corridor to connect two tents.  We use the 8-man tent to sleep in and the 6-man to keep all of our gear.  These tent are extremely strong and by far the most well made tent I have had.				Full review


				Hilleberg Soulo			


								Buy this tent! The best quality tent I have seen in my 61 years. Nothing comes close—NOTHING! It is light, packs small and tight as a drum. No seam tape to get scabby in 5 years. Attention to detail, great hardware and the fabric is unbelievable. Big enough on the inside for my Exped long wide SyncellMat. A rain gutter on the vent cover! I intend to be a bicycle touring tramp in my retirement and I needed a single tent to see me through every kind of climate. I researched tents for years before…				Full review


				Terra Nova Super Quasar			


								Wrote my original review (above) in 2003 and just saw a user write a hard critique. My son now owns my original Super Quasar as I bought a Hilleberg Nammtj 3GT to replace it. However, I was very disappointed with that tent and sold it after one season. I then bought another Super Quasar and remain delighted with it. 
Still love it.				Full review


				Marmot Thor 3P			


								Disappointed. Two months ago I bought Thor 3P and last weekend we finally took it with us outdoors. On the very first night (and because of the incident the only night) wind broke three poles and dramatically contorted the rest. We assembled the tent with the entrance directed toward the wind, stretched it to the some degree, and added 8 guy lines fixed with MSR Blizzard Stakes and ice axes assuming possibility of wind conditions to be changed. At the morning the wind strengthened to 20 meters per…				Full review

Recent Tent/Shelter Reviews

				  Universal Improved Combat Shelter			


								Universal Improved Combat Shelter Military Two-walls, low-profile freestanding tent by Orc Industries For 1-2 person (1.5 person tent) Color: Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP) Dimensions Outer: 250x170x88 mm Dimensions Inner: 240x100x83 mm Weight: 2.9 kg I would love this tent if it was truly one person (instead of 1.5 person) with outer dimensions:  200x140x95 (2.2 kg) instead of 250x170x88 (2.9 kg) Plus painted olive green or one of RealTree patterns (instead of UCP, which is useless in forest)…				Full review


				Sierra Designs Lookout			


								Had my Lookout since 1996. Lots of use for backcountry paddling and backpacking. The Lookout has served me well in the 22 seasons I have owned it. A slightly crooked pole hasn't stopped this tent from performing. I gave it a bath a couple seasons ago and it was DIRTY!! but still holding strong from weather of all kinds. I have actually used this as a 4-season tent. From deep snow and cold to hot and humid. You don't want to stay in too long in the sun as it heats up quite quickly with the fly on.				Full review


				Eureka! Zeus 2EXO			


								Good tent. Needs a rain fly. I used this tent several time in the mountains in CA and CO. It took me about five times to realize that if you sleep head-in vs head-by-the door, it vents your breath through the ceiling vent over your head—no condensation problem.  That worked fine until last time camping in all night constant rain for the first time. I am not sure if it leaked or if the rain sealed the ventilation in the surface, but it was like sleeping in drizzling rain inside the tent. I am…				Full review


				Marmot Limelight 3P			


								I don't normally take the time to write reviews, but I have to for this tent. Perfect tent for avid back country travelers to weekend warriors. Tent is functional, durable, and easy to set up. I've been using/abusing it for 8 years and the tent is going strong like it was its first campout. Highly recommended. This tent is the real deal and has made me a Marmot tent customer for life (much respect to Mountain Hardwear though). I've thought of every possible way to give this tent 4.5 stars, and I…				Full review


				Stephenson's Warmlite 2R			


								Great tent. I got my first 2R Stephenson tent around 1974. Did several trips to the Grand Teton, up to the Canadian Rockies and then down to Peru. It was lightweight and stood up great in some wild windy snowy weather at high altitudes.  On the saddle between the Grand and Middle Teton one time, the winds shredded two lady climbers' tent and they had to join us. Our tent held great, while it was cramped for four.  Unfortunately, my tent did not hold up too well after I got married and my son…				Full review


				Big Agnes Seedhouse SL1			


								This tent is a piece of garbage. I'm confident I could craft a better shelter out of rope and tarp. I can't for the life of me figure why Big Agnes hails this tent as their claim to fame in the tent world. This is by far the worst tent I have ever used, much less owned. Big Agnes makes some decent gear, especially their sleeping bags, but the Seedhouse is a big middle finger to their customers. For a one-man tent the setup process is okay, and relatively quick, but they could have thought it out…				Full review


				Sea to Summit Hammock Bug Net			


								An awesome product. Versatile, easy to put on, and allows for great visibility. Well designed and well executed. Definitely a product worth checking out if you're a hammock user looking for a standalone bugnet. This review is a part of a review of the entire Sea to Summit Hammock System. Please refer to my Sea to Summit Ultralight Hammock review to see the full review of the Ultralight Hammock and its components. Most of the information below is just separated out here again for visibility purposes.				Full review


				Sea to Summit Hammock Tarp			


								A great tarp, though a little on the minimalist side. Looking to go lighter? This may be the tarp for you. This review is a part of a review of the entire Sea to Summit Hammock System. Please refer to my Sea to Summit Ultralight Hammock review to see the full review of the Ultralight Hammock and its components. Most of the information below is just separated out here again for visibility purposes. Hammock Tarp: The Hammock Tarp is made of Ultra-Sil Nano 15D Nylon fabric, which provides a high…				Full review


				Slumberjack Sightline 1			


								Good tent for backpacking trips. Stores relatively small and lightweight. I used this tent for a backpacking trip in the Tetons. The tent worked well and kept me dry the entire time. Even through a large thunderstorm, the tent withstood hail and rain along with heavy winds with no issue at all. The tent had plenty of room for me and my 70L pack. The tent is easy to pitch and easy to pack up. The only downside was the bag ripped after our trip. However the company sent me a new bag within a few days.				Full review

What’s the “best” tent or shelter for you? Consider your personal outdoor needs, preferences, and budget:

Conditions: First, and most important, in what seasons, conditions, and terrain will you use your tent, tarp, or hammock? Choose a shelter that can handle the conditions you expect to encounter (rain, snow, wind, heat, humidity, biting insects, an energetic scout troop), but don’t buy more tent than you truly need, and don’t expect one tent to do it all.
Capacity: Tents are typically classified by sleeping capacity (i.e. one-person, two-person, etc). However, a tent's stated sleeping capacity usually does not include much (or any) space for your gear and there’s no sizing standard between tent manufacturers. Some users size up.
Livability: Will you use the tent as a basecamp or is it an emergency shelter only? To determine if you and your gear will fit, look at the shelter’s dimensions, including floor and vestibule square areas, height and headroom (including at the sides), plus the number and placement of doors, gear lofts, and pockets, to assess personal livability, comfort, and footprint.
Weight and Packed Size: If you’ll be backpacking, climbing, cycling, or otherwise carrying that shelter, consider its weight, packed size (and your pack it needs to fit in), and its space-to-weight ratio before automatically opting for the bigger tent. Paddlers and car campers have more room to work with, but everyone should consider how the tent and its parts pack up for stowage.
Design: Tents come in various designs. Freestanding tents can stand alone without stakes or guy lines and can be easily moved or have dirt and other debris shaken out without being disassembled, though they still need to be staked out. Rounded, geodesic domes are stable and able to withstand heavy snow loads and wind. Tunnel tents are narrow and rectangular, and large family cabin tents are best for warm-weather campground outings.
Other features and specs to consider include single versus double-wall, ease of setup, stability, weather resistance, ventilation, , and any noteworthy features.
Read more in our guide to tents.

“We make the highest quality mountaineering and backpacking tents in the world. Our gear works in conditions that cause other equipment to fail. Case in point: we built the only tent to ever spend a night on Mt. Everest. Our founder, Martin, has been building tents since high school and has worked at the biggest outdoor companies: Sierra Designs, Mountain Hardwear, and The North Face.



Martin Zemitis
Co-Founder, SlingFin




Key Facts

Founders built Mountain Hardwear (acquired by Columbia for $36M).
Designed the only tent ever to spend a night on Everest summit.
Won prestigious Gold Award at 2013 Outdoor Friedrichshafen Show.
Inventor of WebTruss, an entirely new way to pitch a tent.
50% margin, growing to 60% with this investment.

Our Ambition
SlingFin is dedicated to solving difficult design problems. For example our patented WebTruss™ can be pitched in the most extreme weather conditions (think Mt. Everest extreme). We started at the top of the mountain and now we've created durable, lightweight backpacking tents to use on the trail. We've been in the outdoor industry for over 30 years and we've seen quality products disappear. SlingFin is bringing that quality back.

Why I Like SlingFin



You’ve seen the pictures and felt your spirit soar with the images of adventurers in high and wild places. Now we can all join and be part of the outdoor design revolution.Patagonia, North Face, Marmot, Black Diamond – wouldn’t it be great to have been able to invest in one of these iconic companies in their infancy, to be a shareholder?

THE BUZZ ABOUT SLINGFIN




A new American company that makes the strongest tents on Everest has just launched this new line for backpackers. They’re as light as anything else out there, but much stronger, much more livable and, believe it or not, cheaper too.

Companies like SlingFin push the outdoor industry forward with progressive designs and ruthless attention to detail.


Max Neale

Senior Editor, Outdoor Gear Lab




... SlingFin is a manufacturer bent on showing up to market with innovative solutions developed outside the box. It feels that other outdoor companies are too preoccupied with copying each other's designs, focusing on fashion and compromising for profit to properly innovate.


C.C. Weiss

Gizmag




I suspect that 5-10 years from now, SlingFin tents will be some of the most widely-used tents on the highest peaks and most remote places around the world.


GEAR:30






The SlingFin HardShell tent is the equivalent of Air Force One for mountain climbers and polar explorers... It's like a portable luxury suite for the world's most heinous conditions... We suspect that the HardShell is the best 3-4 person four-season dome tent on the planet.


OutdoorGearLab






Real email from Everest: "Just wanted to let you know that [your tent] is hanging tough up at Camp 2 (21,500 ft.) in 50-80 mph winds while other tents are snapping poles. I really think that [your tent] is the best dining tent or dome up there. Climbers from other teams stop by regularly to check out the dome, and I think they are all jealous."

The Most Important Question to Ask When Buying a Tent 
November 19, 2015
How can two tents with identical height and footprint differ in volume by ten cubic feet-the difference between sprawling and spooning? The answer: basic geometry. And it's the reason a growing chorus of tent makers thinks volume should join weight, peak height, and square footage in tent specs.

Slingfin 2Lite Review: Everest Tent Tech For The Backpacker 
July 28, 2015
A new American company that makes the strongest tents on Everest has just launched this new line for backpackers. They're as light as anything else out there, but much stronger, much more livable and, believe it or not, cheaper too. We took one up the highest mountain in the lower 48.

Slingfin 2Lite 
May  1, 2015
This is a case where the stats don't tell all. While the 2Lite's 29 square foot floor area seems small, living in the tent does not. The two 11 square foot vestibules swallow packs and gear and the elbow room feels expansive when hanging out in the tent.

Honey Badger serves as a backpack and a bicycle pannier 
October 10, 2012
Once a relatively lesser known member of the animal kingdom, the honey badger rose to infamy last year, becoming a legend among critters. It's not all that surprising to see the animal referenced in a product name, especially one designed to bring some of the animal's tenacity and ferocity to the outdoors.

High-end Tent Company SlingFin Enters the Market - Backpacker 
September  1, 2010
A master designer attempts to build the last mountain shelter you'll ever need. If anyone else called his creation "The One," it might sound a wee bit pretentious. But when Martin Zemitis, who in the last 33 years has made some of the most popular tents on the market, does it, and says The One is his favorite model in a new line of expedition tents, it sounds momentous.

 First Objective: Make the Best Tents in the World
    We’re an outdoor equipment company run by industry veterans with a passion for making only the highest quality gear. We planted our flag at the top of the mountain (Mt. Everest to be exact!) and are working our way down while gaining a larger market presence. We've already released our first line of backpacking tents and will soon be adding backpacks and an apparel line.

                



















33+ Years of Experience
  Martin has been crafting tents since high school and has worked at the biggest outdoors firms: Sierra Designs, Mountain Hardwear, and The North Face. After 33 years, he's branched off to create SlingFin for the continuous pursuit of better, stronger equipment. His design skill and passion is sewn with every stitch of every SlingFin tent.

 



   
  


 









                   The Secret: Patented Webtruss 

Watch Martin's Award Winning Technology in Action







 The Honeybadger Backpack
     This pack was designed to be a waterproof, durable and lightweight pack/backpack that could adapt its users needs. It's been dragged behind trucks, dropped out of planes, floated through whitewater rapids, and rappelled down waterfalls. Once the Honey Badger Pack comes online, we will expand distribution greatly which means more reps, more stores, and more online representation. Entering the backpack category presents a lower entry price and a much larger audience.
                

    
  
    
 



 Take Our Products on Any Adventure
      Since inception, we’ve focused on the specialty tent market ($60M - $100M / year) to prove our technology and capture the customers that set trends. When they see our gear work in the most extreme conditions, people will know it will work anywhere. At SlingFin we make quality tools to help adventurers reach their goals and we're adapting that technology and design for the larger backpacking market. 

                



  
    






 Help Us Get to the Peak
 May 16th, 2016   Our vision is clear. We are driven to build, create, improve and solve design problems to provide exceptional gear for those of us that love to explore our beautiful earth.

We have the team, experience, suppliers and IP. Take the journey with us by participating as an owner. We are creative, fun and have a knowledge base that is unsurpassed in the industry but we need your help.

With your participation we can  grow without institutional funding and remain independently owned which will allow us the freedom to remain true to our vision and not answer to absentee owners.

If you share our vision then please join us for the journey.

Enjoy the Ride!

                  What is SlingFin?
                  



We make the strongest tents in the world. We’re an outdoor equipment company run by industry veterans that have a passion for making only the highest quality gear based on a lifetime of design, manufacturing, and user experience. We planted our flag at the top of the mountain (Mt. Everest to be exact!) and are working our way down while gaining a larger market presence in the process. We are about to release our first backpack and have plans to enter the apparel and sleeping bag categories as well.



                  Who are your customers?
                  



We serve people that are serious about their adventures and their gear; our customers know what works and what doesn’t.  Backpackers, mountaineers, adventurers, explorers, guides, and outfitters look to SlingFin for gear that works when failure is not an option. These people go to some of the most inhospitable places on earth, use their gear all the time, and know what they can trust.



                  What gives Slingfin a competitive advantage?
                  



Our founder Martin has spent over 30 years designing tents for the top brands in the world. His design skill and passion is sewn with every stitch of every SlingFin tent. We’ve solved design problems, have been awarded multiple utility patents, and provide strength and weight savings that simply aren’t available elsewhere. Reviewers recognize this quality and have consistently pushed our gear to the forefront: in 2013, we were the only U.S. company to win the prestigious Gold Award at the Outdoor Show in Friedrichshafen Germany, Europe's largest outdoor gear show. Our technology is so good that professional guides use SlingFin tents as windbreaks to keep the other tent brands from collapsing in strong winds.

In addition, a lifetime of experimentation and design experience has resulted in SlingFin having some of the best (protectable) intellectual property in the industry. We solve design problems and offer solutions and technology that our competitors cannot. For example, we designed a new way of pitching tents through our invention, the WebTruss™. Now users can pitch the tent poles by first creating a rigid structure. The flysheet and tent body are added after the tent poles are locked in place by the WebTruss™, which allows users to pitch their tents in high winds and severe weather with ease. This is truly the next innovation in tent architecture -- we’re extremely proud of this proprietary game changing step forward.




                  What makes Slingfin such a trustworthy brand?
                  



Like we mentioned earlier, we make the strongest tents in the world in our weight class - period! Our founder Martin Zemitis designed the only tent used on the summit of the world's highest peak, Mount Everest. Babu Chiri Sherpa spent the night at over 29,000 ft above sea level (without supplemental oxygen) using our gear. He is the only person ever to spend a night on the summit of Mount Everest.



                  How are you spreading the word and marketing SlingFin?
                  



From the beginning we’ve let the tents speak for themselves. The logo on our tents is our billboard in the mountains, because people remember what stands up to the elements.  When a storm comes through Camp II on Mount Everest and our competitors’ tents collapse while ours stand, people are quick to understand which brand makes gear that they can count on. Serious outdoors men and women come straight to us for their next tent because you can’t afford to skimp when you’re one degree away from freezing. Nothing advertises better quality than the difference between life and death. Being the last tent standing is our brand - we are the strongest tent in the mountains.

New customers also find us via gear reviews and word-of-mouth, which makes marketing costs are close to zero. We received an incredible gear review for one of our tents on a very popular blog called Indefinitely Wild (a Gizmodo website) and that launched our most popular tent, the 2Lite. Our new tent called the WindSaber will also be in Outside Magazine's “Gear Review” guide which has a very large audience. We are waiting on additional reviews to hit media outlets in time for the 2016 backpacking season. The more people hear about and learn about our gear, the larger our audience grows. The addition of crowdfunding equity will only help grow our army of evangelists.




                  Why did you start your own brand?
                  



Quality and making gear that works is all that matters to us--that’s what it’s all about at SlingFin--but we didn’t have the freedom to operate this way with our previous employers. We wanted to make truly great products and got sick of the race to the bottom in order to fill the price bucket targets retailers are asking for. Quality at so many brands has suffered after their founders retired or the company got bought out; the bottom line takes over and cost cutting cannibalizes brand quality. When quality suffers, the people that helped build the brand move on to where their experience and skills can contribute something to the field. At SlingFin we make quality tools help adventurers reach their goals.

Our users know that when you are on an 8,000 meter mountain in 100 mph+ winds, you are 1 mm away from being outside in the storm. No marketing department can help you if your tent fails. A tent is your house in the mountains and that house cannot fail; by running our own shop we can design and build tents as if lives depend on it - because they do.




                  What makes you so certain that SlingFin will succeed?
                  



Our ethos, experience, and relationships allow us to design gear second to none.  We’re a design company first and not just a marketing operation.  We hand craft and design everything we sell. Our CEO sits at the sewing machine himself and creates our designs and samples.

Second, we’ve spent over 30 years (100+ years collectively) learning the hard lessons, so we understand this space better than anyone else. Martin has been designing tents for top brands for 30 years, all the while being an avid user of his own products. Everything we do is by deliberate design, including creating our own plastic parts rather than buying them off the shelf, because we have the depth of experience to know what can go wrong and what needs to be done right. What some of the other companies don’t understand is that it’s often less expensive to do things right. Tent design is not something that is taught in schools; you have to have lived it, have an understanding of the tradeoffs, and have insight from the right mountaineers who will tell you what the problems are.

Third, we’ve done this before. We know how the game is played and we know everyone in the industry. We have a great track record through helping build several other legendary brands like The North Face, Sierra Designs, and Mountain Hardwear. Our advisory board is a “who’s who” of the industry; we’re one degree of separation away from any resource we need in the industry.




                  Where do you see yourself in the larger tent market?
                  



At the moment, we’re focused on extending our lead in the specialty tent market—which sells $60M - $100M annually— to prove our technology and capture the customers that set trends. When they see our gear work in the most extreme conditions, people will know it will work anywhere. Once we’ve won this market, we can apply our expedition-proven technology to a larger market segment of backpacks and adventurers.



                  How do you view the competition?
                  



Many of the major brands have hollowed out their design capacity in search of lower costs. The outdoor industry as a whole is plagued by this disease: a regression from innovative design in pursuit of wider margins. But increasing marketing budget is no substitute for innovation.

Because the majority of our competitors aren’t doing a lot of new and exciting things, they’ve had a hard time retaining their creative staff. This means that there aren’t a lot of people left in the industry who know how to bring something really innovative to market, which has created an opening for us.  Our competitors have deeper pockets and can offer more favorable terms to dealers, but we still find an overwhelming number of dealers coming to us because they want our unique product.  We’re focused on offering designs and solutions our customers want and our competitors cannot offer.




                  What are your expansion plans?
                  



After five years of research & development and proving market fit, now is the time to accelerate our growth. We will use this investment to boost our factory order sizes, allowing us to take advantage of volume pricing and instantaneously increase our margin from 50% to nearly 60%. This inventory increase will also allow us to expand our dealer network and solve the repeated challenge we’ve faced in running out of inventory, which has put us in the unwelcome position of being unable to fill orders for $2,000 tents.

We’re also looking to grow our marketing beyond the word-of-mouth that has propelled us to this point by expanding our online, social media, grassroots, and trade show presence. Finally, we’re excited about the opportunity to apply our high-end technology to products that more and more people can use, such as expanding our ultralight tents and hardshell backpack, the “Honey Badger” Pack and Pannier.

Once the Honey Badger Pack and Pannier comes online, we will expand distribution greatly which means more reps, more stores, and more online representation. Entering the backpack category presents a lower entry price and a much larger audience. We will still focus on specialty distribution that understands how to represent a quality brand properly. Once we open our target specialty shops in the U.S. then we will look to larger specialty outlets.




                  Why create a hard shell backpack?
                  



The Honey Badger backpack is a patented design unlike anything else in the market due to its versatility and efficiency. It was inspired by our experience in getting tents up to Everest base camp where we discovered that, after the tents were set up, there were a lot of duffel bags, wooden crates, and hard containers leftover from carrying the tents; the waste left at basecamp was overwhelming. We wanted to make an adaptable product that would let you carry gear up to basecamp, then reconfigure the bag and use it for another task. We ended up with a semi-rigid exoskeleton with attachment points everywhere on the pack that allows you to carry nearly twice as much weight and volume as similarly sized packs.  It also includes a separate waterproof inner bag that will protect your sensitive gear from getting wet.  It’s easy to carry, easy to pack, and extremely durable -- as proven by our development tests involving dragging it behind a truck and dropping it from an airplane.We just sent our initial batch of packs to testers and product reviewers and are looking forward to rolling out sales later this year through our existing distribution network.



                  Who does your manufacturing?
                  



We have a 30 year-old relationship with a Taiwanese manufacturing partner who has been producing tents since the 1950s.  They’re the best in the business.  We use their factory in Vietnam because it has the most experienced sewing staff anywhere.  They take great pride in their craftsmanship and have been a true partner in finding innovative ways to make our vision a reality.



                  What are your unit economics?
                  



Our margin is currently 50% when selling to retailers - appreciably ahead of the industry average of 40% for hardgoods. Our margins triple when we sell direct-to-consumer through our website, because we can capture the full MSRP. Currently we sell half direct and half through the other channels. By carefully managing our SKUs and growth, we’ve been able to sustain these margins.

With this funding, we’ll be able to take advantage of 10% minimum order quantity discounts which will expand margins further to ~60%. Given the quality of our gear and the difference it can make between life and death, it’s unlikely we’ll ever have to cheapen our brand with discounts. We are setting the standard which allows us to charge accordingly.




                  What is your distribution model?
                  



We sell through specialty retailers all over the country and from our own website. We leverage our long-running industry relationships to connect with the specialty retailers at regional and national trade shows. Specialty shop owners get it because they see what we’ve delivered in the past at previous brands, understand the products that we’re building now, and see our future vision. Dealers especially appreciate that we are not over distributed and the “street” price on our products is our MSRP. We are vigilant with our MAP policy which further strengthens our relationship with our specialty dealers.



                  What about International Distribution?
                  



Internationally, we have a thriving business in South Korea. Our current plan is to expand to other countries via a licensee model. This business model is advantageous since the funds are bottom line dollars (15% of cost) without risk to SlingFin. Another advantage is that larger orders help with economies of scale and pricing.



                  Do you have plans to partner with larger distributors to sell your consumer grade tents?
                  



Our focus is to partner with the right dealers that understand the SlingFin brand and our products - whether it be brick and mortar stores or online. We will remain true to the brand and our mission and not bend over for the big guys and their price bucket strategies. Rushing to get into big chains like REI sounds good to the general public, but in reality, that’s a shortcut to bankruptcy.



                  What challenges are you facing right now?
                  



We need working capital to help support our growth.  In some cases, we’re unable to fill orders because we don’t have products in stock.  We’re also missing out on volume discounts because we don’t have enough capital to increase our minimum order size.  We’re excited to move past the fundraising process and return full focus to our products. Finding capital that has the same vision as we do is a total time sink. We see crowdfunding for equity as a tremendous opportunity by matching the investors’ vision with the company's vision.



                  What keeps you up at night?
                  



I sleep like a baby because I live my life by doing right by people and the environment.

However, there are those nights when the realities of meeting payroll and growing a business interfere with my REM time. We have the margin, design, IP, manufacturing and distribution challenges handled, but matching cash flow to growth is the real challenge. Our goal is to become financially sustainable so we can grow organically and finance orders on time, while maintaining control of the company. We also need to continually find ways to communicate our superior design and value to consumers.

We are driven to be the best and that is a 24 hours-a-day job! What we are working on now will be seen 1, 2, or perhaps 5 years down the road and getting it right requires constant work. We have technology that will define the next generation of tents but there are just not enough hours in the day to make it happen, especially as the little guy. We have to work that much harder to break our way into the marketplace dominated by the big conglomerates.  But that’s also what drives us, so I see many sleepless nights going forward - not because of unrest, but because I’m eager to make a difference.




                  Why have you given your customers the chance to invest in Slingfin?
                  



To date, our investors have been family, friends, mountaineers, and guides that share our vision. Unfortunately, there were also a lot of the above who do not qualify as an accredited investor, so they were not able to purchase shares, but have been supporting in other ways.

We’re excited about the opportunity to broaden that pool and share our success with the users who are excited about what we’re doing.  “Democratizing investing” is a brilliant idea and will increase collective social good by supporting projects that people believe in.  We love the idea of being able to invest in small companies that have double- and triple-bottom lines that we believe in. Crowdfunding for equity will change the way the most innovative and creative ideas will come to light. The solutions to the world's problems will come from the small innovators with great ideas and solutions and not from the boardrooms of transnational corporations that find change too costly or inconvenient to their long term plans.

If you share our vision then join us for a great ride! Although we’re taking the road less explored, we will always take the high road. Be part of a journey that will change the way people experience the wildest places on earth!




                  Tell us about the team.
                  



Our team is incredible - experienced, design driven, and obsessed with the gear, the outdoors, and the environment. In the same room we have industry veterans and young, fresh talent hungry to prove themselves.

Richard is our Director of Operations and a mechanical engineer from UCLA. His background is failure analysis; so he went from a world of figuring out why things failed, to helping design and produce products that won’t. Rich is a terminator and genius at getting things done and done right.

Robert Link is our best gear user and consultant. He is a professional mountain guide and owner of Mountain-Link. We do not have enough room for his list of achievements. He knows how to throw down design challenges.

I’m Martin Zemitis, the CEO. Jack Gilbert (former VP of TNF and Founder of Mountain hardwear with Paul Kramer) used to call me a truant on a salary since I love to go whitewater rafting and fly fishing. I started my first outdoor company, Sierra Mountaineering, in 1976 while in high-school. My uncle sent me a heavy duty Pfaff 545 large bobbin sewing machine and that was the start of my career. I tell people I’ve never worked a day in my life because I love what I do.

Al Tabor is the founder at Mountain Hardwear and OutinUnderground.com, a website dedicated to telling stories of the history of the outdoor industry. He was Director of Operations and Information Systems at Mountain Hardwear. He has been playing an active role at SlingFin doing a bit of everything from strategic advising to occasional front end web development.
