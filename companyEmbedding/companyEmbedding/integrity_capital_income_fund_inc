FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS


This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.  These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions.  Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "would," "should," "targets," "projects," and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements including,
without limitation:






·     


an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies' abilities to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies;










·     


the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in the sections entitled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2014 filed with the SEC on February 2, 2015 and elsewhere in this report and in our filings with the SEC.






Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate.  In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this prospectus should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved.  You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report.  We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

1.
ORGANIZATION



 
Integrity Capital Income Fund, Inc. (the "Company"), an externally managed investment company was organized as a Colorado corporation on December 10, 2013 (Inception) and was initially funded on January 21, 2014 (commencement of operations). Effective, November 1, 2014, the Company has elected to be regulated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ("RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

 
The Company invests principally in debt, equity securities, including convertible preferred securities and other debt securities convertible into equity securities, of primarily non-public U.S.-based companies.  The investment objective is to maximize income and capital appreciation.  In accordance with the investment objective, the Company intends to provide capital principally to U.S.-based, private companies with an equity value of less than $250 million, which the Company refers to as "micro-cap companies."  The Company's primary emphasis is to identify companies with experienced management and positive
cash flow from operations.
 
The Company is managed by Integrity Wealth Management, a division of Integrity Bank & Trust, a Colorado corporation (the "Adviser"), who also serves as the investment adviser and provides the Company with certain administrative services necessary to operate.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





Basis of Accounting


The accompanying interim financial statements of the Company and related financial information have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Articles 6 or 10 of Regulation S-X.  In the opinion of management, the financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications that are necessary for the fair presentation of financial results as of and for the periods presented.


Use of Estimates


Financial statements prepared on a GAAP basis require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.  Investment valuation represents a significant estimate within these financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents


Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition. The Company deposits its cash in financial institutions and, at times, such balances may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.


Investments


Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. The Company reports current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the statement of operations.


As part of the valuation process, management may take into account the following types of factors, if relevant, in determining the fair value of the Company's investments: the enterprise value of a portfolio company (the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities, changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments would trade in their principal
markets and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, management considers the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate its valuation.


Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in its portfolio, the Company values substantially all of its portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by management, as described in Note 4. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company's investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company's investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the
Company may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded it.


In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned.


Deferred Offering Costs


Offering costs are expenses such as legal fees pertaining to the Company's shares offered for sale.  The Company has accounted for offering costs in the current period as a deferred charge, Deferred Offering Costs on the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets.  The deferred offering costs are being amortized to expense over 12 months on a straight-line basis beginning with the period after the registration was effective (November 1, 2014).

Revenue Recognition


Investments and related investment income:  Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual interest terms of debt investments. For the three months ended January 31, 2015, the Company earned interest income of $204,086. As of January 31, 2015 and October 31, 2014, the Company had interest receivable of $59,239 and $41,730, respectively.


Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and the Company accretes or amortizes such amounts over the life of the loan. For the periods ended January 31, 2015 and October 31, 2014, the Company received loan origination fees of $36,000 and $97,500, respectively. These loan origination fees are capitalized and amortized over the life of the loan. For the three months ended January 31, 2015, total investment income included $11,125 of accretion of loan origination fees.


For investments with contractual payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, the Company will not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not collectible. For the periods ended January 31, 2015 and October 31, 2014, the Company did not hold any investments with contractual PIK interest.


Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Each distribution received from limited liability company ("LLC") and limited partnership ("LP") investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, the Company will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. For the three months ended January 31, 2015, the
Company recorded dividend income of $5,304.


Non-accrual loans:  A loan may be left on accrual status during the period the Company is pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews all loans that become 90 days or more past due on principal and interest, or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected, for possible placement on non-accrual status. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain
current. There were no non-accrual loans held as of January 31, 2015 or October 31, 2014.


Partial loan sales:  The Company follows the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 860 when accounting for loan participations and other partial loan sales. Such guidance requires a participation or other partial loan sale to meet the definition of a "participating interest", as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain on the Company's statement of assets, liabilities and net assets and the proceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing until the definition is met. Secured borrowings are carried at fair value to correspond with the related investments, which are
carried at fair value. For the three months ended January 31, 2015, there were partial loan sales to an unrelated third party of $800,000 of the Company's interest in its $3,257,500 Promissory Note in Camel Parkwood, LLC. There was no gain or loss resulting from this partial loan sale.

Income Taxes


The Company has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act.  The Company also has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code.  So long as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that is distributes at least annually to its stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Company represents obligations of the Company's stockholders
and will not be reflected in the financial statements of the Company.

 
As a RIC, the Company is subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless the Company distributes in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98.2% of ordinary income for each calendar year, (ii) 98% of capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year, and (iii) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year (the "Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement").  The Company will not be subject to excise taxes on amounts on which the Company is required to pay corporate income tax (such as retained net capital
gains). The Company currently intends to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement.

 
The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its financial statements to determine whether the positions are "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained by the applicable tax authority.  Tax positions not deemed to meet the "more-likely-than-not" threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.


The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that they are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative
evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.  If the Company determines that it would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.  As the Company has elected to be treated as a RIC beginning on November 1, 2014, there is no benefit to any deferred tax assets and thus a full valuation allowance was recorded as of October
31, 2014.  As a RIC, the Company was not a taxable entity for the period ended January 31, 2015 and thus no income tax expense (benefit) was recorded.


Income tax expense (benefit) consists of the following for the periods ended January 31, 2014:

The Company classifies estimated interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions, if any, as a component of tax expense.  There were no such interest and penalties estimated at January 31, 2014.


The Company currently has no unrecognized tax benefit.  There was no interest or penalties accrued at January 31, 2014.


The Company files federal and Colorado income tax returns.  All tax years since inception remain open to examination. 



Dividends and distributions


Dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount to be paid out as a dividend or distribution is determined by the Board each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually, although the Company may decide to retain such capital gains for investment.


Recent accounting pronouncements


In May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early application is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its financial statements.

In August 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-13, Consolidation (Topic 810): Measuring the Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity, containing new guidance for fair valuing the financial assets and financial liabilities of a consolidate collateralized financing entity. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its financial statements.

RELATED PARTY AND AGREEMENTS





Investment Advisory and Management Agreement


The Company pays the Adviser a fee for its investment advisory services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and any incentive fees earned by the Adviser is ultimately borne by the common shareholders.


The base management fee (the "Base Fee") is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% of gross assets, which includes the use of leverage, if any. The Base Fee is payable quarterly in arrears, and is calculated based on the value of gross assets at the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter, and appropriately adjusted for any equity capital raises or repurchases during the current fiscal quarter. The Base Fee for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately prorated.


The Incentive Fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing with the calendar year beginning November 1, 2014, and equals 20% of "Net Investment Income" above 7.5% for the year. "Net Investment Income" is defined as all income accrued during the year minus operating expenses, Base Management Fee and expenses paid under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount debt instruments with payable-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities) accrued income not yet received in cash. Net Investment Income does include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses, or unrealized capital depreciation. It does not include unrealized capital appreciation.


For the three months ended January 31, 2015, the Adviser earned $31,252 in base management fees.  There was no Incentive Fee for the three months ended January 31, 2015 and January 31, 2014.


Custody Agreement


As compensation for the Adviser's services related to the Custody Agreement the Company has agreed to pay an annual fee of 0.15% of the Custodial Property defined as all investments and cash equivalents held by the Adviser.  The Adviser invoices the Company on a quarterly basis for the pro-rata portion of the annual amount, calculated as of the last business day of each quarter.  The property originally delivered to the Adviser, and earnings there from, together with any additional property delivered to the Adviser, and earnings there from, shall constitute the "Custodial Property." For the three months ended January 31, 2015, the Adviser earned $3,581 in custody fees.

Administration Agreement


Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser furnishes the Company with equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record-keeping services, as well as certain administrative services, which include being responsible for the financial records which the Company is required to maintain and preparing reports to shareholders and reports filed with the SEC.  In addition, the Adviser assists the Company in monitoring portfolio accounting and bookkeeping, managing portfolio collections and reporting, performing internal audit services, determining and publishing the net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports
to shareholders, providing support for risk management efforts and generally overseeing the payment of expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to the Company by others.  The Company reimburses the Adviser for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred in performing its administrative obligations under the Advisory Agreement. The Adviser prepares and delivers statements documenting its expenses which are subject to reimbursement.


The Adviser has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement ("OELA") with the Company effective January 2, 2014, to limit the total operating expenses of the Company to 2.34%.  Effective September 1, 2014, the OELA was amended to 2.95%, whereby any expenses in excess of the OELA will not be immediately reimbursed to the Adviser.  However, the Adviser will be able to recoup from the Company these expenses in excess of the limit over a period not to exceed three years.  The total amount of organization and operating expenses within the limit and reimbursed by the Adviser for the three
months ended January 31, 2015 was $77,836. Additional expenses in excess of the limit were incurred but not reimbursed, for which the Adviser will collect this amount over a period not to exceed three years, if the Company's expense ratio is less than the 2.95% limit.  The OELA remains in effect until terminated by the Company and Adviser.  The following table presents the amounts reimbursed and the expiration date for recoupment.

The Company calculated a waiver amount of $35,047 as of January 31, 2014 for comparative purposes but this amount does not impact the actual amount and date of the original waiver that occurred on June 30, 2014 as noted above. Through the normal course of business, the Adviser or an affiliate of the Adviser processes payments on behalf of the Company and then is reimbursed for expenses paid on behalf of the Company.  As of January 31, 2015, $12,629 is receivable from the Adviser for such reimbursements, net of the current operating expense waiver of
$77,836.






4.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS





The Company's fair value accounting policies adhere to the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.  Topic ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.  Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.  Unobservable inputs reflect the Company's assumption about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on
the best information available in the circumstances.  The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:
 
 

15




Integrity Capital Income Fund, Inc.
Notes to Financial Statements
Period Ended January 31, 2015
(unaudited)




 
 

 




 


Level 1 -



Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.  Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 securities.  Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
 





 


Level 2 -



Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
 





 


Level 3 -


Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.




 
To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.  Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined.


Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed.  Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for securities categorized in Level 3.  In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.


Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.  Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company's own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.


The Company invests in direct debt and equity securities that are not traded on a public market.  These securities are recorded at fair value as determined by the Company using the framework of Topic ASC 820.  In addition, the Company has adopted written guidelines for determining the fair value of its investments for reporting in the accompanying financial statements.  Under these guidelines, investment valuations are reviewed on a quarterly basis and investments without readily available market values are valued at fair value as determined by the Company.  In the absence of readily ascertainable market values,
the Company uses valuation techniques consistent with the market, income and cost approaches, as prescribed by Topic ASC 820, in order to estimate the fair value of investments.  In all cases, the Company evaluates whether the valuation techniques used and the resultant fair value estimate is representative of what the most likely buyers of the company would also pay upon exit, and therefore, whether the value is deemed to be the price expected in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

Under Topic ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  ASC 820 permits the Company, as a practical expedient, to estimate the fair value of investments in other investment companies based on the net asset value (NAV) per share, or its equivalent, if the NAV of such investments is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of ASC 946, Financial Services — Investment Companies. As such the Company's estimate of fair value for its investments in other investment companies is generally based on the NAV provided to the
Company by each Investee Fund, supported by the independently audited financial statements of the Investee Fund, when available.


The transaction price is typically the Company's best estimate of fair value at inception of the investment.  When evidence supports a change to the carrying value from the transaction price, adjustments are made to reflect expected exit values.  Ongoing reviews by the Company are based on an assessment of significant assumptions related to each underlying investment including incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties, the financial condition and operating results of the portfolio company, achievement of technical milestones, and expected cash flows.  All investments at January 31, 2015 and October 31, 2014 had no readily
available market value and are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.


The following tables present information about the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at January 31, 2015 and October 31, 2014.  The Company assesses the levels for the investments at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer in accordance with the Company's accounting policy regarding the recognitions of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy.  For the periods ended January 31, 2015 and October
31, 2014, there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, 2, and 3.

The Company estimates that it will receive liquidating distributions from its Other Investment Companies over a period consistent with the investee company's estimated life plus available extension periods, which is 3 years from the Effective Date with two additional 12-month extensions available at the discretion of the GP.  For the investment in other investment companies, the Company will pay the management of such investment company a monthly management fee based on the product of $65 and the number of Portfolio Assets then held by the investment company. The investment company specializes in the acquisition of real property rights to ground leases and easements primarily under infrastructure assets. The
Company has fully funded its capital commitment to the investment company. The Company's investment in other investment companies is stated at fair value based on the underlying NAV as a practical expedient. Accordingly, the investment in Other Investment Companies is classified as Level 3 in the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy.

The above tables are not intended to be all-inclusive but rather to provide information on significant unobservable inputs and valuation techniques used by the Company. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company's debt investments is market interest rates. The Company uses market interest rates for loans to determine if the effective yield on a loan is commensurate with the market yields for that type of loan. If a loan's effective yield is significantly less than the market yield for a similar loan with a similar credit profile, then the resulting fair value of the loan may be lower.  The
Company valued its Investment in Other Investment Companies as of October 31, 2014 based on a subsequent market transaction that occurred effective December 31, 2014 and settled in cash on January 30, 2015.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES





The Company in the normal course of business makes investments in financial instruments where the risk of potential loss exists due to changes in the market (market risk), or failure or inability of the counterparty to a transaction to perform (credit and counterparty risk). See below for a detailed description of select principal risks.


Market Risk


Market risk is the company's investments in financial instruments and derivatives that expose it to various risks such as, but not limited to, interest rate, foreign currency, and equity. Interest rate risk is the risk that a fixed income investment's value will change due to a change in the absolute level of interest rates, in the spread between two rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in any other interest rate relationship. Such changes usually affect securities inversely and can be reduced by diversifying (for example, investing in fixed- income securities with different durations) or hedging (for example, through an interest rate swap).


Equity Risk


Equity risk is the risk that the market values of equities, such as common stocks or equity related investments such as futures and options, may decline due to general market conditions, such as political or macroeconomic factors. Additionally, equities may decline in value due to specific factors affecting a related industry or industries. Equity securities and equity related investments generally have greater market price volatility than fixed income securities.


Credit and Counterparty Risk


The Company is exposed to credit risk to counterparties with whom it transacts with and also bears the risk of settlement default. The company may lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty to a derivative instrument contract, repurchase agreement or securities lending is unable or unwilling to make timely principal and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. Securities are subject to varying degrees of credit risk, which are often reflected in credit ratings. The Company minimizes concentrations of credit risk by undertaking transactions with
a diverse population of counterparties with a history of good credit quality. Further, the company manages counterparty risk by entering into appropriate legally enforceable master netting agreements, or similar agreements which include provisions for offsetting positions, collateral, or both in the event of counterparty default or nonperformance.






10.
INDEMNIFICATIONS





The Company has provided general indemnifications to the Adviser, any affiliate of the Adviser and any person acting on behalf of the Adviser or such affiliate when they act, in good faith, in the best interest of the Company. The Company is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but expects the risk of having to make any payments under these general business indemnifications to be remote.

 ITEM 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and notes thereto included in this quarterly report and our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2014.
 
Overview 


We were incorporated on December 10, 2013 under the laws of the State of Colorado.  We are externally managed and have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. We must not acquire any assets other than "qualifying assets" specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in "eligible portfolio companies." Under the relevant SEC rules, the term "eligible portfolio company" includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million. These rules also permit
us to include as qualifying assets certain follow-on investments in companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time of initial investment but no longer meet the definition.


We invest principally in debt securities and equity securities, including convertible preferred securities and other debt securities convertible into equity securities, of primarily non-public U.S.-based companies.  We expect that the debt securities will generally be collateralized by the assets of the company and will carry a market rate of interest.


We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees.  Any such fees will be generated in connection with our investments and recognized as earned.


Results of Operations


Revenues.  We generated revenue of $220,515 during the quarter ended January 31, 2015.  This included $204,086 in interest on investments, $11,125 in revenue recognized from origination fees and $5,304 in dividend income.  In addition the Company generated $36,000 as origination fees related to portfolio investments which are being amortized over the remaining eight month life of the loan.


A comparison of revenues for the quarter ended January 31, 2015 to the same period in 2014 is not meaningful since the Company had only recently commenced operations and had no revenues during the January 31, 2014 fiscal quarter.


Expenses.  During the quarter ended January 31, 2015, the Company had expenses of $140,751, consisting of: (i) amortization of offering costs of $7,898; (ii) legal fees of $34,418; (iii) professional fees of $53,825; (iv) base management fees of $31,252, (v) directors' fees of $1,500; (vi) marketing fees of $4,020; (vii) custody fees of $3,581; (viii) insurance expenses of $3,875; and (ix) miscellaneous expenses of $382.
 
 

23



  
During the quarter ended January 31, 2014, the Company had expenses of $83,027, consisting of offering costs of $83,027.


The Adviser has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement ("OELA") with the Company effective January 2, 2014, to limit the total operating expenses of the Company to 2.34%. Effective September 1, 2014, the OELA was amended to 2.95%, whereby any expenses in excess of the OELA will not be immediately reimbursed to the Adviser.  However, the Adviser will be able to recoup from the Company these expenses in excess of the limit over a period not to exceed three years. The total amount of organization and operating expenses within the limit and reimbursed by the Adviser for the quarter
ended January 31, 2015 was $77,836.  Additional expenses in excess of the limit were incurred but not reimbursed, for which the Adviser will collect this amount over a period not to exceed three years, if the Company's expense ratio is less than the 2.95% limit. The OELA remains in effect until terminated by the Company and Adviser. The Company calculated the total amount of organization expenses to be reimbursed by the Advisor at January 31, 2014 as $35,047. However, we note that this amount was determined for comparison purposes and did not impact the actual amount waived in prior periods as presented in the 10-Q.


Through the normal course of business, the Adviser or an affiliate of the Adviser processes payments on behalf of the Company and then is reimbursed for expenses paid on behalf of the Company. 


Financial condition, liquidity and capital resources. 


We received $3,119,000 from the net proceeds of sales of the Company's common stock during the quarter ended January 31, 2015.  We invested the net proceeds in portfolio companies in accordance with our investment objective and strategies described in this report.
 
Our primary use of funds is investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to holders of our common stock, and the payment of operating expenses, including debt service if we borrow to fund our investments. 


As of January 31, 2015, we were approximately 70% invested, compared to 89% invested at October 31, 2014.  We had cash resources of $3,042,689, which is an increase of 238% over cash resources held on October 31, 2014.  We had no indebtedness as of January 31, 2015.  As of January 31, 2015, the balance of the deferred offering costs was $23,695, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 12 months.  As of January 31, 2015, the balance of organization and operating expenses subject to the OELA was $254,866.  For the period from and including February 1, 2015 through February
8, 2015, the Company received additional net proceeds from the sale of common stock of $430,000 at a price of $10.03 per share. For the period from and including February 9, 2015 through March 2, 2015, the Company received additional net proceeds from the sale of our common stock of $436,000 at a price of $10.15 per share.
 

24


 
As of January 31, 2015, our investments included:  (i) two secured promissory notes bearing interest rates of 14.5%; (ii) subordinated debt bearing an interest rate of 8% with warrants for 5% of the outstanding equity of the Company; (iii) a secured promissory note at 75% loan to value bearing an interest rate of 11%, (iv) a secured promissory note at 65% loan to value bearing an interest rate of 11%, (v) a promissory note secured by tax liens bearing an 11.5% interest rate, (vi) a secured promissory note bearing an 8% interest rate; and (vii) a secured promissory note at 67% loan to value bearing an interest rate of 13%.


The Company also holds membership interest in a limited liability company (or LLC) that invests in real property rights to ground leases and easements under infrastructure assets.  The LLC pays annual dividends at a rate of 7%.  The Company closed two more portfolio investment on February 18, 2015 and March 3, 2015.  The portfolio investments are for $400,000 and $150,000 in Class B membership interest in two LLC's.  Our cash resources are held in depository accounts at First Republic Bank.  We currently have no investments in debt or equity securities of public companies.


As of January 31, 2015, we had net assets of $10,248,749 and, based on 1,026,203 shares of common stock outstanding, a net asset value per common share of $9.99.  This represents an increase of 45% in net assets as compared to October 31, 2014.


 
Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
 
As a significant portion of the proceeds from the sale of common stock has been invested in debt instruments of our target portfolio companies, our only current market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in interest rates and credit risks. Pending investment in target portfolio companies, our cash is invested in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality debt instruments that mature in one year or less.


We have not engaged in any hedging activities since our inception. We do not expect to engage in any hedging activities with respect to the market risk to which we are exposed.


Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.


We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company is made known to the officers who certify the Company's financial reports and the Board of Directors.


Our President, Eric Davis, and our Chief Financial Officer, Randall Rush, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q (the "Evaluation Date").  Based on this evaluation, they believe that as of the Evaluation Date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms; and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management,
including the President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective
portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our
assumptions.  Words such as "anticipates," "expects,"
"intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "would,"
"should," "targets," "projects," and variations of these words and
similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
statements.  These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other
factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to
predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from
those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements
including, without limitation:

 





 



·



an
economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies' abilities
to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all
of our investments in such portfolio companies;




 





 



·



the risks,
uncertainties and other factors we identify in the sections
entitled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended October 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on February 1, 2016
and elsewhere in this report and in our filings with the
SEC.




Although
management believes that the assumptions on which these
forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those
assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the
forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be
inaccurate.  In light of these and other uncertainties, the
inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this
annual report should not be regarded as a representation by
management that its plans and objectives will be achieved.  Do
not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which
apply only as of the date of this report.  Management does not
undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statements.

the Company were illiquid.



 



 



 



 





 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 





(2) The
investment is treated as a non-qualifying asset under Section 55(a)
of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, the Company may not acquire
any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time the acquisition is
made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company's
total assets. Total non-qualifying assets made up 6.0% of net
assets at July 31, 2016.

(4) As
defined in the Investment Company Act, the Company is deemed to be
both an "Affiliated Person" and "Control" to this portfolio company
because it owns more than 25% of the portfolio company's
outstanding voting securities or it has the power to exercise
control over the management or policies of such portfolio company
(including through a management agreement).  Transactions
during the nine months ended July 31, 2016 in which the issuer was
both an Affiliated company and a portfolio company that the Company

ORGANIZATION




 

Integrity
Capital Income Fund, Inc. (the "Company"), an externally managed
investment company was organized as a Colorado corporation on
December 10, 2013 (Inception) and was initially funded on January
21, 2014 (commencement of operations). The Company has elected to
be regulated as a business development company ("BDC") under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). In
addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company has
elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ("RIC")
under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code").

 

The
Company invests principally in debt, equity securities, including
convertible preferred securities, limited liability companies,
partnerships and other debt securities convertible into equity
securities, of primarily non-public U.S.-based companies.  The
investment objective is to maximize income and capital
appreciation.  In accordance with the investment objective,
the Company intends to provide capital principally to U.S.-based,
private companies with an equity value of less than $250 million,
which the Company refers to as "micro-cap companies."  The
Company's primary emphasis is to identify companies with
experienced management and positive cash flow from operations by
(1) accessing established relationship channels of Integrity Trust
Company, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (the "Adviser"),
(2) selecting investments within our core markets, (3) partnering
with experienced private equity, real estate and investment firms,
(4) implementing the disciplined underwriting standards of the
Adviser and (5) drawing upon the combined experience and resources
of the Adviser and its affiliates.

 

The
Company generally invests in securities that have not been rated by
independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment
grade if they were rated.  These securities have predominately
speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity
to pay interest and repay principal.

 

On
December 1, 2015, the adviser role was transferred from Integrity
Bank & Trust, an affiliated entity, to the Adviser. The Company
notes that this was just a change in legal structure and did not
change the Adviser employees or physical address.

SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES




 

Basis of
Accounting

 

The
accompanying financial statements of the Company and related
financial information have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America ("GAAP") and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on
Form 10-Q and Articles 6 or 10 of Regulation S-X. The Company has
determined it meets the definition of an investment company and
follows the accounting and reporting guidance in the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards
Codification ("ASC") Topic 946—Financial
Services—Investment Companies ("ASC Topic 946"). In the
opinion of management, the financial statements reflect all
adjustments and reclassifications that are necessary for the fair
presentation of financial results as of and for the periods
presented.

Use of
Estimates

 

Financial
statements prepared on a GAAP basis require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Such
estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more
information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported
and disclosed herein.  Investment valuation represents a
significant estimate within these financial statements.

 

Reclassification
of Prior Year Presentation

 

Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the
current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect
on the reported results of operations. In the first quarter of
fiscal 2016, the Company concluded it was appropriate to capitalize
loan origination fees charged on promissory notes as a reduction to
the initial cost of the investment and accrete such amounts over
the estimated life of the investment as interest income.
Previously, such fees were deferred and amortized over the
estimated life of the investment. Accordingly, the Company had
revised the classification to report these amounts as interest
income on investments. Corresponding reclassifications have also
been made to the statements of cash flows for the first nine months
of fiscal year 2015. This change in classification does not
materially affect previously reported cash flows from operations or
from financing activities in the statements of Cash Flows, and had
no effect on the previously reported Statements of Operations for
any period.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

The
Company deposits its cash in financial institutions and, at times,
such balances may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation insurance limits; however, management does not believe
it is exposed to any significant credit risk.

 

Fair Value
of Investments

 

The
Company's fair value accounting policies adhere to the provisions
of FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
("Topic ASC 820").  Topic ASC 820 establishes a fair value
hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes
the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable
inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when
available.  Observable inputs are those that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on
market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. 
Unobservable inputs reflect the Company's assumption about the
inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability developed based on the best information available in the
circumstances.  The fair value hierarchy is categorized into
three levels based on the inputs as follows:

  




Leve 1
- 



Valuations
based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to
access.  Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not
applied to Level 1 securities.  Since valuations are based on
quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active
market, valuation of these securities does not entail a significant
degree of judgment.




 




Leve 2
- 



Valuations
based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which
all significant inputs are observable, either directly or
indirectly.




 




Leve 3
- 



Valuations
based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the
overall fair value measurement.

Integrity

Notes to

(unaudited)

 

 

 


 

To the
extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are
less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of
fair value requires more judgment.  Those estimated values do
not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately
realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot
be reasonably determined.

 

Because
of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values
may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have
been used had a ready market for the securities existed. 
Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in
determining fair value is greatest for securities categorized in
Level 3.  In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair
value may fall into different levels of the fair value
hierarchy.  In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level
in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement
falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that
is significant to the fair value measurement.

 

Fair
value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of
a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. 
Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available,
the Company's own assumptions are set to reflect those that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the
measurement date. See further description of fair value methodology
in Note 5.

 

Deferred
Offering Costs

 

Offering
costs are expenses such as legal fees pertaining to the Company's
shares offered for sale. The Company has accounted for offering
costs in the current period as a deferred charge, Deferred Offering
Costs on the Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets. The
deferred offering costs are being amortized to expense over 12
months on a straight-line basis beginning with the period after the
Company's registration under the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934 (the "Exchange Act") was effective (November 1, 2014). As of
October 31, 2015, the deferred offering costs incurred by the
Company had been fully amortized.

 

Revenue
Recognition

 

Investments
and related investment income:  Interest income is accrued
based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual
interest terms of debt investments. For the three and nine months
ended July 31, 2016, the Company earned interest income of $332,337
and $979,327 (including $13,251 and $45,182 interest on investments
from affiliate company), respectively. During the nine months ended
July 31, 2016, the Company wrote-off $6,243, $7,180, and $10,333 in
interest income and interest receivable related to its debt
securities with Aequitas Commercial Finance, LLC, Aequitas
Peer-to-Peer Funding, LLC, and Care Payment Holdings, LLC,
respectively, as the amounts were determined to be uncollectible.
For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2015, the Company
earned interest income of $242,661 and $705,325 (including no
interest on investments from affiliate company). As of July 31,
2016 and October 31, 2015, the Company had interest receivable of
$777,030 and $245,706, respectively.

 

Fee
income such as loan origination, closing, commitment, structuring
and other upfront fees is capitalized, and the Company accretes or
amortizes such amounts over the life of the loan as interest
income. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2016, interest
income included $12,539 and $30,932, respectively, of accretion of
loan origination fees. There was no accretion of loan origination
fees for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2015. For the
three and nine months ended July 31, 2016, the Company received
loan origination fees of $27,354 and $30,171 respectively. For the
three and nine months ended July 31, 2015, the Company received
loan origination fees of $43,250 and $79,250,
respectively.

Investment
transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis. Realized
gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference
between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of
investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously
recognized. The Company reports current period changes in fair
value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component
of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on
investments in the Statements of Operations.

 

For
investments with contractual payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest,
which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the
principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, the
Company will not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company
valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not collectible. As of
July 31, 2016, the Company held three investments, Ajubeo, Inc.,
Northstar Portfolio, LLC and 5500 South Quebec Holdings, LLC with
contractual PIK interest. As of July 31, 2016 the balance of
accrued PIK interest related to these investments was $50,778,
$192,329, and $294,207, respectively. For the year ended October
31, 2015, the Company held three investments, Ajubeo, Inc.
Northstar Portfolio, LLC and 5500 South Quebec Holdings, LLC with
contractual PIK interest. As of October 31, 2015, the balance of
PIK interest related to these investments was $26,583, $23,750, and
$56,667, respectively. All PIK interest amounts are recorded within
the interest receivable balances as of July 31, 2016 and Octover
31, 2015. The Company notes that investments held with PIK interest
do not have cash interest rates.

 

Dividend
income from investments in other investment companies is recorded
as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such
amounts are payable by the investment company and are expected to
be collected. Each distribution received from limited liability
company ("LLC") and limited partnership ("LP") investments is
evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as
dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, the Company will
not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as
dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis
earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution.
Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are
recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. For
the three and nine months ended July 31, 2016, the Company recorded
dividend income of $5,091 and $18,446. For the three and nine
months ended July 31, 2015, the Company recorded dividend income of
$8,888 and $22,383, respectively.

 

Non-accrual
loans:  A loan may be left on accrual status during the period
the Company is pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews
all loans that become 90 days or more past due on principal and
interest, or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or
interest will be collected, for possible placement on non-accrual
status. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, unpaid
interest credited to income is reversed. Additionally, any original
issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to
interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual
status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be
recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon
management's judgment. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual
status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in
management's judgment, are likely to remain current. There were
three non-accrual loans held as of July 31, 2016 (Aequitas
Commercial Finance, LLC, Aequitas Peer-to-Peer Funding, LLC, and
Care Payment Holdings, LLC) with a fair value of $1,339,730 and
cost of $1,626,500. There weren't any non-accrual loans held as of
October 31, 2015. During the three months ended July 31, 2016, the
Company reduced fair value by $286,770 for these non-accrual
loans.

 

Partial
loan sales: The Company follows the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 860
when accounting for loan participations and other partial loan
sales. Such guidance requires a participation or other partial loan
sale to meet the definition of a "participating interest", as
defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed.
Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the
definition of a participating interest remain on the Company's
Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets and the proceeds
are recorded as a secured borrowing until the definition is met.
Secured borrowings are carried at fair value to correspond with the
related investments, which are carried at fair value. For the three
months ended July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015, there were no partial
loan sales. For the nine months ended July 31, 2016, there were
partial loan sales which met the definition of a participating
interest to a related party of $40,000 of the Company's interest in
its Promissory Note in eCOS, LLC. For the nine months ended
July  31, 2015 there were partial loan sales which met the
definition of a participating interest to an unrelated third party
of $800,000 of the Company's interest in its $3,257,500 Promissory
Note in Camel Parkwood, LLC. There was no gain or loss resulting
from this partial loan sale.

Income
Taxes

 

The
Company has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940
Act.  The Company elected to be treated as a RIC under the
Internal Revenue Code beginning with the tax year ended October 31,
2015. Such election was made upon the filing of the Company's first
federal tax return for RIC purposes.  In order to continue to
qualify as a RIC, among other things, the Company must meet certain
source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely
distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of investment company
taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each tax year. The
Company has made, and intends to continue to make, the requisite
distributions to its stockholders, which generally relieves the
Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to all income
distributed to its stockholders. So long as the Company maintains
its status as a RIC, it will generally not pay corporate-level U.S.
federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital
gains that it distributes at least annually to its stockholders as
distributions of income. As a result, any tax liability related to
income earned and distributed by the Company represents obligations
of the Company's stockholders and will not be reflected in the
financial statements of the Company.

 

As a RIC,
the Company is subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on
certain undistributed income unless the Company distributes in a
timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98.0% of
ordinary income for each calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of capital gain
net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that
calendar year, and (iii) any income realized, but not distributed,
in the preceding year.  The Company will not be subject to
excise taxes on amounts on which the Company is required to pay
corporate income tax (such as retained net capital gains). The
Company currently intends to make sufficient distributions each
taxable year to satisfy the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. For
the three and nine months ended July 31, 2016 there was no amount
recorded for U.S. federal excise tax.

 

The
Company accounts for income taxes in conformity with ASC Topic 740
— Income Taxes ("ASC Topic 740"). ASC Topic 740 provides
guidelines for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,
measured, presented and disclosed in financial statements. ASC
Topic 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken in the
course of preparing the Company's tax returns to determine whether
the tax positions are "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained by the
applicable tax authority. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to
meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax
expense in the current year. It is the Company's policy to
recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
benefits in income tax expense. There were no material uncertain
income tax positions through July 31, 2016. All tax years since
inception remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most
state tax authorities.

Distributions

 

Distributions
to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount
to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board each
quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by
management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at
least annually, although the Company may decide to retain such
capital gains for investment. During the nine months ended July 31,
2016, there were total distributions of $1,309,836. During the nine
months ended July 31, 2015, there were total distributions of
$629,849.

 

Recently
adopted accounting pronouncements

 

In April
2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03, Interest —
Imputation of interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt
issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented
in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount
of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This
guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2015. The Company notes that the adoption of
this accounting standard did not have a material impact on its
financial statements.

 

In May
2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-07 "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)
– Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that
Calculate Net Asset Value ("NAV") per Share (or Its Equivalent)."
This new guidance no longer requires investments for which NAV is
determined based on practical expedient reliance to be reported
utilizing the fair value hierarchy. This guidance is effective for
annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015,
however, early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early
adopt ASU 2015-07 as of October 31, 2015. The adoption did not have
a material impact on the Company's financial statements, other than
enhancing the disclosures.

October 21, 2015, the Company entered into a senior secured
revolving credit facility up to $3,200,000.  The line of
credit expires on October 21, 2016, unless extended.

Company. The outstanding balance on the line of credit was
$1,000,000 at July 31, 2016 and $1,701,008 at October 31, 2015.
Borrowings under the line of credit are subject to certain
financial covenants and restrictions on indebtedness, distribution
of income payments, financial guarantees, business combinations,
and other related items. As of July 31, 2016, the Company is in
compliance with all covenants.

 

In
accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, the
Company is only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset
coverage, calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 200%
after such borrowing. As of July 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, the
Company's asset coverage was 2,486% and 1,207%.
