      Virginia 23285-5015; http://www.capitalone.com.
    

      ■ Richard D. Fairbank, along with his former partner Nigel Morris,
      was the cofounder of Capital One Financial Corporation, the firm that
      redesigned the credit model and revolutionized the banking and lending
      industry in the United States during the 1990s. Fairbank and Morris were
      able to use the tools of the emerging information-technology industry to
      target different credit plans toward different customer groups. This
      database marketing approach to vending credit, known as the
      "information-based strategy," made Capital One a major
      player in the banking industry. In the first eight years of its existence
      the company that was spun off from Signet Banking in 1994 opened 48.6
      million accounts worth a total of $53.2 billion. The company claimed that
      it created 10,000 new accounts daily in 2002 and that its credit cards
      were in use in about 12 percent of all American homes.
    

      During his early years at the helm of Capital One, Fairbank became known
      for his loose management style, which was described by Jennifer Kingson
      Bloom in 
      
        American Banker
      
       as "new age" (September 9, 1998). Employees were rewarded
      with stock options in addition to their salaries; senior management as
      well usually received the majority of their compensation in the form of
      stock options. Such a method of compensation gave employees on all levels
      a more vested interest in the success of the company. After federal
      regulators investigated the company's lending practices in 2003,
      the compensation policy was changed, bringing Capital One out of the
      entrepreneurial era and back in line with traditional banking practices.
    

      COMPUTERIZED INNOVATION
    

      The impetus for Fairbank's highly successful career was his
      understanding of information technology and the impact it could have on
      the lending industry. In 1987 he and his partner Nigel Morris came up with
      a radical idea that would permanently change the way credit cards were
      issued. Most creditcard issuers had been charging holders an annual fee
      for the privilege of drawing on the issuer's credit. The pair of
      consultants' idea was to drop the annual fee and instead target
      different credit cards to specific segments of the population. The problem
      they faced was how to compile the demographics and other statistics that
      would help them sort out and identify those segments.
    

      Thus information technology came into the picture. Fair-bank and Morris
      met with representatives of Oracle Corporation and explained their
      requirements: they needed a flexible database into which data from a
      variety of sources—ranging from information compiled by credit-card
      bureaus to purchased lists of consumers—could be entered. That data
      would then be manipulated by database-management software in order to
      produce a variety of reports based on different scenarios. The reports
      would eventually be used to produce lists of potential customers, who were
      carefully selected to correspond to the terms the credit-card issuer
      wished to offer. Such targeted marketing would, the two consultants
      argued, lead to huge profits based on the large numbers of customers
      expected to sign up through the program.
    

      SIGNING ON
    

      Fairbank and Morris tried for a number of months to sell their
      targeted-marketing program to traditional banks but met
       with little success. A year and a half passed before Signet Bank, a
      smaller player with offices in central Virginia, took a chance on their
      system. The young consultants agreed to manage Signet's credit-card
      accounts, investing a portion of the profits they earned in the new
      database model. The basic information-system controls were in place by
      1990, and the following year Signet launched its targeted-marketing
      campaign. Using models compiled over the previous several years as derived
      from the immense database, Signet was able to offer about three hundred
      different types of credit-card agreements to their customers, adjusting
      terms and interest rates to suit their customers' projected
      preferences.
    

      The other major breakthrough that Fairbank and Morris made possible with
      their targeted-marketing database was the addition of the abilities to
      offer customers low introductory interest rates and to transfer balances
      from one card to another with a lower rate of interest. The introductory
      "teaser" rates–sometimes as low as zero
      percent—were meant to attract new customers and were wildly
      successful.
    

      The risks that Fairbank and Morris's innovations posed met with
      resistance from executives trained in traditional banking practices. Top
      executives at Signet as well as at other banking firms doubted that the
      young men's system would prove profitable. In 1991 Signet's
      real-estate loan business went into a severe decline; in order to offset
      losses managers wanted to kill the credit-card program that Fairbank and
      Morris were in the process of refining. At that time, in order to save
      their plan, the pair conceived of the idea of the balance transfer.
      Customers could move debt from high-interest accounts to new Signet
      accounts that offered the very low "teaser" interest rates.
      Since many of the clientele who were attracted to these offers were
      low-risk borrowers—and leaped at the chance to lower their
      debt—the program proved enormously successful. Signet's
      credit-card business doubled in size during 1992, the first year in which
      the corporation used Fairbank and Morris's new financial models.
      Fairbank became the head of the credit-card division in 1993, when his
      former boss David K. Hunt left Signet. Around that time Signet revamped
      its entire management structure in order to improve efficiency.
    

      STRIKING OUT ON THEIR OWN
    

      Capital One Financial Corporation was created in 1994 when Signet spun off
      its credit-card business into a subsidiary company; during the following
      year Capital One outpaced its parent corporation in sales and services. In
      an interview with Bloom in 
      
        American Banker
      
      , Morris explained that Signet had moved from being a bank that owned a
      credit-card issuing company to being "a credit-card business that
      had a regional bank attached to it" (September 9, 1998). Capital
      One broke away from Signet entirely in 1995; when Signet was later taken
      over by First Union Corporation, the credit-card issuer maintained its
      independence. By mid-1995 Capital One had entered the ranks of the top-ten
      credit-card issuers in the United States, with $8.9 billion in receivable
      income—an increase of 25 percent over the company's 1994 net
      earnings. Earnings forecasters predicted further growth of 20 percent
      during 1996, the company's third year of existence.
    

      Capital One's main strength lay in the fact that it was not merely
      a credit-card issuing company but was in fact an information-gathering
      company that issued credit cards. The database of customer information,
      painstakingly compiled through years of work at Signet, allowed Capital
      One to identify the ideal credit-card customers—those that paid
      parts of their outstanding balances but kept some revolving credit. Such
      customers were charged interest rates ranging from 13 to 17 percent
      throughout the industry; Capital One sought these customers out and
      offered better deals in the hopes of drawing them away from their current
      card companies.
    

      Capital One's success in identifying prize customers and coaxing
      them to transfer their accounts was imitated by several other major
      card-issuing bank houses, including Advanta Corporation, First USA, and
      MBNA Corporation. Those businesses quickly began to make the same types of
      customer offers that Capital One had pioneered: reduced introductory
      interest rates, account-balance transfers, and other special deals. The
      new competitors spent huge amounts on mass-mailing solicitations; but none
      had the one advantage that made Capital One such a high-growth performer:
      the complex customer database and the algorithms that turned the
      information therein into real market-based strategies.
    

      INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
    

      As an information-technology–centered corporation one of Capital
      One's first challenges was to deal with the mixed IT legacy that it
      had inherited from Signet. In 1990, in an effort to control IT costs,
      Signet shipped most of its information-technology functions out to EDS.
      Fairbank and Morris had felt that Capital One could manage its own IT
      functions more efficiently than EDS, so the two had set out to incorporate
      those functions into the new company's structure. They brought in
      an IT specialist, the CIO Jim Donehey, to meet Capital One's needs.
    

      Donehey recognized the strengths of Fairbank and Morris's
      databases, which were built on the framework designed by Oracle
      Corporation. However, the material portions of the new company's IT
      was in a shambles. An earlier occupant had sandwiched the mainframe system
      between the building's kitchen and its restrooms, leaving the data
      vulnerable to both fire and flood. If Capital One intended to bring major
      business functions, such as general-ledger accounting, purchasing,
      payroll, and personnel, safely back to the company from EDS, it needed new
      equipment, new training for IT staff, and new security
       measures to protect the information. Fairbank, Morris, and Donehey also
      created new management structures in order to integrate IT more thoroughly
      into the company's business processes. IT representatives
      participated in the daily management of Capital One, unlike at other
      corporations, where information technology was treated as a support
      function for marketing and other traditionally organized business
      departments.
    

      BRANCHING OUT
    

      Fairbank and Morris further utilized their customer databases by
      diversifying from the credit-card business into other areas. One of their
      first such ventures was into the field of cellular-telephone services; the
      subsidiary America One Communications was launched in 1995. Rather than
      investing large sums in basic infrastructure, America One bought dead
      airtime from existing companies, repackaged it in the form of special
      deals, and then used its enormous databases to communicate those special
      deals to those most likely to be interested. America One thrived for five
      years before Capital One sold its assets off to other telecommunications
      companies, with the majority of the accounts—representing about
      72,000 customers—going to Sprint PCS on September 30, 2000.
    

      The success of America One Communications proved that Fairbank and
      Morris's information-based strategy could be applied to businesses
      outside the credit-card field. Fairbank went as far as to claim that the
      advent of modern electronic databases prefigured a marketing revolution
      that would rival the technology revolution that had been made possible by
      the modern microcomputer. He claimed that Capital One had the capacity to
      customize its products to satisfy the requirements of individual customers
      even when the company was adding 10,000 new customers each day and
      offering about 12,000 different variations on its credit products. All
      this, Fairbank implied, was the result of the targeted marketing he and
      Morris had pioneered.
    

      RADICAL PAY STRUCTURES
    

      Another area in which Fairbank was a pioneer was executive compensation.
      Unlike other chief executives who received salaries and rewards whether
      their companies performed well or not, Fairbank and Morris chose to
      receive most of their compensation in the form of stock options. In 1998
      Fairbank received no pay at all—nor any retirement plan
      contributions or bonuses—despite the fact that Capital One's
      earnings had doubled in the previous two years. Analysts noted that
      Fair-bank and Morris essentially bet their executive salaries on the
      performance of Capital One's stock. As long as the stock continued
      to rise, they made money; if it faltered, on the other hand, they lost
      their incomes. This system as instituted by the two young executives
      proved enormously popular with investors jaded by the huge salaries taken
      by many other corporation heads.
    

      OUT OF A PRECARIOUS POSITION
    

      Although the systems that Fairbank and Morris created worked well for
      Capital One, by 2002 their gung-ho tactics and looser-than-ususal
      management style had attracted the attention of federal and state banking
      regulators. The regulators questioned the managers' methods of
      assessing and managing risk—that is, the algorithms at the very
      base of Capital One's success. Those algorithms helped Capital One
      identify customers who were good credit risks, and the company used its
      huge portfolio of credit options to woo those customers away from their
      original banks. Despite the fact that Capital One had achieved an average
      30 percent annual return on investments through the use of those
      algorithms, the threat of federal investigation drove investors away. In
      addition Capital One's CFO David M. Willey was notified by the
      Securities and Exchange Commission that he was being investigated for
      insider trading, and he resigned soon afterwards. Although the federal
      investigators ultimately found nothing wrong with Capital One's
      model of risk assessment, company stock prices plummeted during the early
      months of 2003 to about half their value of the previous year.
    

      Stock prices rebounded following the successful conclusion of the federal
      investigation. However, Fairbank and Morris saw this investigation as a
      sign that Capital One had finally matured and should leave the ranks of
      brash start-up companies and institute practices closer to those of older
      banks. They adjusted by revamping Capital One's decision-making
      structure; in February 2004 the pair announced that the company would be
      run by a team of executive decision makers led by Fairbank rather than
      according to policies brainstormed by Fairbank and Morris on long car
      trips. Morris himself announced that he would leave the company on April
      30, 2004, bringing to a close a partnership that had stretched back almost
      two decades.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Capital One Financial (COF) shareholders are relieved that defaults among its customers have stopped climbing. But recent missteps mean it will take time for the shares to fully rebound from the loss of confidence among investors. For much of last year, Capital One chief executive and industry veteran Richard Fairbank insisted that the gradual rise in defaults on the company's credit cards was the simple result of "growth math."

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Capital One Financial (COF) shareholders are relieved that defaults among its customers have stopped climbing. But recent missteps mean it will take time for the shares to fully rebound from the loss of confidence among investors. For much of last year, Capital One chief executive and industry veteran Richard Fairbank insisted that the gradual rise in defaults on the company's credit cards was the simple result of "growth math."

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
