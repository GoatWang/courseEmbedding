                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

$56 million piece of a $140 million mortgage, written by Bank of America, against the Grove City Premium Outlets, a 531,200-square-foot outlet retail center in Grove City, Pa., that is owned by Simon Property Group. The property is 97.9 percent occupied and generated $16.7 million of net cash flow last year. The loan requires only interest payments for its 10-year term and pays a coupon of 4.3085 percent. Simon used proceeds of the loan to retire a $106.7 million mortgage that was securitized through WBCMT 2006-C23 and WBCMT 2006-C25.
$50 million piece of a $70 million mortgage, written by BofA, against 300 Four Falls, a 298,482-sf office building in the West Conshohocken, Pa., suburb of Philadelphia that was acquired by Maguire Hayden Real Estate Co. for $95.9 million. The property previously was encumbered by a $64.8 million loan that was securitized through WBCMT 2005-C22. The building is 98.4 percent occupied and generated $7.1 million of net cash flow last year. But it was underwritten with the assumption that it would operate at a 95 percent occupancy level and generate $6.7 million of cash flow. The loan requires only interest payments for its entire 10-year term and pays a coupon of 4.84 percent.
$46.6 million piece of a $310 million mortgage, written by Morgan Stanley, against the 1.1 million-square-fooft Penn Square Mall in Oklahoma City, which is owned by Simon Property Group. The property last year was 98.8 percent occupied and had generated $29.9 million of net cash flow during the 12 months through the end of last November. But it was underwritten to generate $33 million of cash flow, based on its performance between January 2015 and last August. The properyt is anchored by a Dillard's, Macy's and JCPenney. It includes an Apple store, which had generated $8,074/sf in sales during the 12 months through last August. Inline stores, excluding the Apple store, generated $618/sf in sales during that period. The mortgage has a 10-year term and requires only interest payments during that entire time. It pays a coupon of 3.842 percent. A companion $90 million loan was securitized through MSBAM 2016-C28.

Press Releases
Date of Release: May 4, 2017
DBRS Confirms Ratings on Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust 2016-C29 


May 4, 2017







DBRS Limited (DBRS) has today confirmed the ratings on the following classes of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-C29 (the Certificates) issued by Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust 2016-C29:

-- Class A-1 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-2 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-3 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-4 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-S at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-SB at AAA (sf) 
-- Class X-A at AAA (sf) 
-- Class X-B at AAA (sf) 
-- Class B at AA (high) (sf) 
-- Class C at A (high) (sf) 
-- Class X-D at BBB (high) (sf) 
-- Class D at BBB (sf) 
-- Class X-E at BBB (low) (sf) 
-- Class E at BB (high) (sf) 
-- Class X-F at BB (sf) 
-- Class F at BB (low) (sf) 
-- Class X-G at B (sf)
-- Class G at B (low) (sf) 

All trends are Stable.

The rating confirmations reflect the overall performance of the transaction, which has remained in line with DBRS�s expectations since issuance. As of the April 2017 remittance, all 69 loans remain in the pool with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately $805.3 million, which represents a collateral reduction of 0.5% since issuance as a result of scheduled loan amortization. Eight loans (representing 23.8% of the pool), including the largest three loans, are structured with full interest-only (IO) terms while an additional 25 loans (representing 33.0% of the pool) have partial IO periods remaining, ranging from six to 48 months. According to the DBRS issuance figures, the transaction had a weighted-average (WA) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and WA debt yield of 1.64 times (x) and 9.0%, respectively, or 1.51x and 9.0%, respectively, excluding shadow-rated loans. To date, 47 loans (representing 67.7% of the pool) have reported YE2016 net cash flow figures. The largest 15 loans in the pool collectively represent 51.4% of the transaction balance and nine of those loans are reporting partial-year 2016 financials, showing a WA annualized DSCR and debt yield of 1.93x and 11.0%, respectively, compared with the DBRS Issuance WA DSCR and WA debt yield figures of 1.70x and 11.0%, respectively.

As of the April 2017 remittance, there are no loans in special servicing and four loans (representing 2.3% of the pool) are on the servicer�s watchlist. The largest loan on the watchlist, Midway Industrial Park (Prospectus ID#46; 0.8% of the pool) is secured by a 84,748 square foot industrial building in San Diego, California. The loan was placed on the watchlist after the loss of the second-largest tenant, The Church of Scientology, which represented 17.9% of the net rentable area before leaving at lease expiration in December 2016. The loan is reporting a Q3 2016 DSCR of 2.82x. The second-largest loan on the watchlist, Winslow Plaza (Prospectus ID#58; 0.6% of the pool) was flagged for upcoming rollover; however, the tenants in question have all extended their leases for five-year terms through 2022. The remaining two watchlisted loans were flagged for low DSCRs caused by increased expenses. 

At issuance, DBRS assigned an investment-grade shadow rating to one loan, Penn Square Mall (Prospectus ID#3; 5.8% of the pool) and has today confirmed that the characteristics of this loan continue to support the shadow rating. 

The rating assigned to Class F materially deviates from the higher rating implied by the quantitative results. The deviation is warranted because sustainability of loan trends has not yet been demonstrated. 

DBRS has provided updated loan-level commentary and analysis for larger and/or pivotal watchlisted loans as well as for the largest 15 loans in the pool in the DBRS CMBS IReports platform. To view these and future loan-level updates provided as part of DBRS�s ongoing surveillance for this transaction, please register or log into at www.ireports.dbrs.com.

OUR MISSION STATEMENT


Experience, intellectual capital and dedicated personal service to help you meet your life goals





Our Story and Services


Story
As the financial world becomes more complex and investment choices multiply, careful planning becomes ever more important to helping you achieve your financial goals. As Financial Advisors, our role is to work with you to help you develop a plan that lays out a clear path to your goals; a plan that we develop in collaboration with you, and one that you can follow with confidence in the face of the market’s ups and downs.Together, we will explore a broad range of topics that are likely to influence your financial future; from your family situation to your career aspirations, from likely education expenses to the retirement you ultimately envision. What we learn will become the foundation for a financial and investment strategy based on who you are and where you want to go. Only then will we talk with you about the details of investing: how much risk makes sense, your asset allocation, and which investments are right for your portfolio. But that’s just the beginning. Over time, we will revise your plan to reflect new aspirations and priorities, helping your plan keep pace as the markets change and your life unfolds.
