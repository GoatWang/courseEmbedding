                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Discover Bank (“ Discover Bank ”), as depositor
(in such capacity, the “ Depositor ”) of the
Issuer, propose, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein,
to cause to be issued and sold from time to time notes of the
series, classes and tranches designated in the applicable Terms
Agreement (as hereinafter defined) (the “ Notes
”). The Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated
as of July 26, 2007, as amended by the First Amendment to
Indenture, dated as of June 4, 2010, as supplemented by the
Amended and Restated Indenture Supplement, dated as of June 4,
2010, and a Terms Document having the date stated in the applicable
Terms Agreement (as so supplemented and as otherwise modified or
amended from time to time, the “ Indenture ”),
between the Issuer and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee
(in such capacity, the “ Indenture Trustee ”).
The Issuer is organized pursuant to a Trust Agreement, dated as of
July 2, 2007, as amended by the First Amendment to Trust
Agreement, dated as of June 4, 2010 (as modified or amended
from time to time, the “ Trust Agreement ”),
between Discover Bank, as Beneficiary, and Wilmington Trust
Company, as owner trustee (the “ Owner Trustee
”). The Notes will be secured by certain assets of the
Issuer, including the Collateral Certificate referred to below
(collectively, the “ Collateral ”) transferred
to the Issuer pursuant to the Collateral 

 


 


Certificate
Transfer Agreement, dated as of July 26, 2007, by and between
the Issuer and Discover Bank.

Discover
Bank has conveyed receivables (the “ Receivables
”) generated from time to time in certain designated credit
card accounts (the “ Accounts ”) owned by
Discover Bank, collections thereon and certain related property to
the Discover Credit Card Master Trust I (the “ Master
Trust ”) pursuant to a Second Amended and Restated
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of June 4, 2010 (as
modified or amended from time to time, the “ Pooling and
Servicing Agreement ”), as supplemented by the Series
2007-CC Supplement, dated as of July 26, 2007, as amended by
the Amendment to Specified Series Supplements, dated as of
June 4, 2010 (as modified or amended from time to time, the

Trustee ”). References herein to the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, unless otherwise specified, shall mean the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement as supplemented by the Series
Supplement. Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the
Collateral Certificate Transfer Agreement, Discover Bank has
transferred to the Issuer an undivided interest in certain assets
of the Master Trust as represented by a collateral certificate (the
“ Collateral Certificate ”) and has caused the
Master Trust to issue the Collateral Certificate to the Issuer. The
Collateral Certificate is an investor certificate under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement.

To the
extent not defined herein, the capitalized terms used herein have
the meanings assigned in the Indenture or the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, as applicable. Unless otherwise stated herein or in the
applicable Terms Agreement, as the context otherwise requires or if
such term is otherwise defined in the Indenture or the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, each capitalized term used or defined herein
or in the applicable Terms Agreement shall relate only to the Notes
designated in the applicable Terms Agreement and shall not relate
to any other series, classes or tranches of notes issued by the
Issuer.

offering of each tranche of Notes to which this Agreement applies
made pursuant to the Registration Statement (as defined herein)
will be made through you or through you and other underwriters for
whom you are acting as a representative or through an underwriting
syndicate managed

by you.
Any action taken by you as a representative will be binding on all
the Underwriters (as defined herein). Whenever Discover Bank and
the Issuer determine to make such an offering of Notes to which
this Agreement shall apply, Discover Bank, the Issuer and one or
more Underwriters will enter into an agreement (the “
Terms Agreement ”) providing for the sale of the Notes
to, and the purchase and offering thereof by, (i) you,
(ii) you and such other underwriters who execute the Terms
Agreement and agree thereby to become obligated to purchase the
Notes from the Issuer subject to the satisfaction of the condition
precedents contained herein, or (iii) you and such other
underwriters, if any, selected by you as have authorized you to
enter into such Terms Agreement on their behalf (in each case, the
“ Underwriters ”). The representatives of the
Underwriters may be referred to herein individually as a “
Representative ” and collectively as the “
Representatives ”. Such Terms Agreement shall specify
the initial principal amount of the Notes to be issued and their
terms not otherwise specified in this Agreement, the price at which
such Notes are to be purchased by the Underwriters from the Issuer,
the aggregate amount of Notes to be purchased by you and any other
Underwriter that is a party to such Terms Agreement and the initial
public offering price or the method by which the price at which
such Notes are to be sold will be determined. The Terms Agreement
shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A . Each such offering of the Notes for which a Terms Agreement
is entered into will be governed by this Agreement, as supplemented
by the applicable Terms Agreement, and this Agreement and such
Terms Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon
the Underwriters participating in the offering of such Notes. At or

Agreement).

knowledge of such counsel, any statute or any order, rule or
regulation applicable to Discover Bank of any court or any Federal,
State or other regulatory authority or other governmental body
having jurisdiction over Discover Bank other than the Act, the

(v) The
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Collateral Certificate
Transfer Agreement and the Trust Agreement have been duly
authorized, executed and delivered on the part of Discover Bank and
as to Discover Bank are valid and binding instruments enforceable
in accordance with their terms except as the foregoing may be
limited by insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium or
other laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors’ rights or by general equity principles; the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the Trust Agreement are not
required to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; the Master

equity principles.

(vi) The
Registration Statement, as of its most recent effective date prior
to the Time of Sale, and the Prospectus, as of its date, in each
case after giving effect to Rule 412 under the Act, each appeared
on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material
respects to the applicable form requirements for registration
statements on Form S-3 under the Act and the rules and regulations
of the Commission thereunder; it being understood, however, that
except as set forth in paragraph (vii) of the opinion, such
counsel need express no view with respect to Regulation S-T or the
financial statements, schedules, or other financial data, included
in, incorporated by reference in, or omitted from, the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus. For purposes of this paragraph, such
counsel may assume that the statements made in the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus are correct and complete. With respect
to the opinion expressed in subclause (vi) above, Counsel to
Discover Bank notes that the Registration Statement does not
include the ratings of the Notes as required by Items 1103(a)(9)
and 1120 of Regulation AB, 17 C.F.R. 229.1103(a)(9) and 17 C.F.R.

(vii)
Assuming (a) the Web site address included in the Registration
Statement is accurate and provides unrestricted access free of
charge to static pool information posted thereon, (b) static
pool information posted on such Web site is available for the time
periods specified in Rule 312 of Regulation S-T, and is updated
only in compliance with such rule, and (c) Discover Bank
complies with the requirements of Rule 312 of Regulation S-T
regarding retaining all versions of such information for not less
than five years and furnishing it to the Commission or its staff
upon request, the use of a Web site to satisfy the requirements for
the Prospectus contained in Item 1105 of Regulation AB
regarding static pool information is permitted pursuant to Rule 312
of Regulation S-T.

In
rendering such opinion, counsel may rely to the extent they deem
appropriate upon certificates of officers or other executives of
Discover Bank and their affiliates and of public officials as to
factual matters and upon opinions of other counsel. Such counsel
shall also state that nothing has come to their attention which has
caused them to believe that the Registration Statement as of its
effective date or the Time of Sale Information as of the Time of
Sale or the Prospectus as of the date thereof and as of the
applicable Time of Delivery (other than financial, statistical and
accounting data therein, as to which such counsel need express no
belief) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

result in any breach which would constitute a

material
default under, or, except to the extent contemplated in the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement or the Indenture, result in the creation or
imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the
property or assets of the Issuer, material to the Issuer considered
as a whole, pursuant to the terms of, any indenture, loan agreement
or other agreement or instrument for borrowed money known to such
counsel to which the Issuer is a party or by which the Issuer may
be bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Issuer,
material to the Issuer considered as a whole, is subject, nor will
such action result in any material violation of the provisions of
the Trust Agreement, or to the best knowledge of such counsel, any
statute or any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Issuer
of any court or any Federal, State or other regulatory authority or
other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Issuer other
than the Act, the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the

any court or any such regulatory authority or other governmental
body is required for the issue and sale of the Notes except as may
be required under the Act, the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture
Act and the Investment Company Act and securities laws of the
various states or other jurisdictions which are applicable to the
issue and sale of the Notes and except for the filing of any
financing or continuation statement required to perfect or continue
the Issuer’s interest in the Collateral.

(iv) The
Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered on the
part of the Issuer and as to the Issuer is a valid and binding
instrument enforceable in accordance with its terms except as the
foregoing may be limited by insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting the enforcement
of creditors’ rights or by general equity principles; the
Indenture is qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; the Issuer is
not required to be registered under the Investment Company Act; and
the Notes have been duly authorized and (assuming their due
authentication by the Indenture Trustee) have been duly executed,
issued and delivered and constitute

binding obligations of the Issuer in accordance with their terms,
enforceable in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, except
as the foregoing may be limited by insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other laws relating to or affecting the

in form and substance satisfactory to you and your counsel, to the
effect that:

the matters described therein in all material respects.

(iii)
Although no transaction closely comparable to that contemplated in
the Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement has been the subject of
any Treasury Regulation, revenue ruling or judicial decision,
(A) the Notes will be characterized as debt for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and (B) each of the Issuer and the Master
Trust will not be classified as an association or publicly traded
partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

(iv) The
statements in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus under
the heading “Investment by Benefit Plans,” have been
prepared and reviewed by us and, insofar as they purport to
summarize the provisions of the specific statutes and regulations
referred to therein, are accurate summaries in all material
respects.

fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this
Agreement, or if any of the opinions or certificates mentioned
above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material
respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to you and
your counsel, this Agreement and the Terms Agreement and all the
Underwriters’ obligations hereunder and thereunder may be
canceled at, or at any time before, the Time of Delivery by you.
Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Issuer and
Discover Bank in writing or by telephone or telecopy confirmed in
writing prior to the Time of Delivery.

8.
(a) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Discover
Bank and the Issuer will pay all expenses incidental to the
performance of their obligations under this Agreement and will
reimburse each Underwriter for any expenses reasonably incurred by
it in connection with qualification of the Notes and determination
of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such
jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably designate
(including reasonable fees and disbursements of their counsel) and
the printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any fees charged by
investment rating agencies for the rating of the Notes, for the
cost incurred with the preparation and filing of the Registration
Statement, the Time of Sale Information and any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus. Except as specifically provided in this Section and in
Section 9 of this Agreement, each Underwriter will pay all of
its own costs and expenses (including the fees and disbursements of
counsel), transfer taxes on resales of Notes by it and any
advertising expenses connected with any offers it may
make.

(b) If the
sale of the Notes provided for herein is not consummated because of
(i) any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set
forth in Section 7 of this Agreement is not satisfied,
(ii) any refusal, inability or failure on the part of Discover
Bank or the Issuer to perform any agreement herein or to comply
with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any
Underwriter or (iii) any breach of a representation or
warranty herein on the part of Discover Bank or the Issuer other
than solely by reason of a default by any Underwriter, Discover
Bank will reimburse the Underwriters upon demand for all
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel) that shall have been incurred by the Underwriters in
connection with the proposed purchase, sale and offering of the
Notes.

(c) The
provisions of this Section 8 shall survive termination of this
Agreement and the Terms Agreement.

9. (a) Discover
Bank will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, and each
person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of
the Act or the Exchange Act and the respective officers, directors
and employees of each such Underwriter or controlling person,
against any losses,

 

27


 


 


claims,
damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter
or such other person may become subject, under the Act, the
Exchange Act, or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages
or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are
based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the
Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the
Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, or any amendment or
supplement thereto furnished by Discover Bank or the Issuer, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and will
reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim;
provided , however , that Discover Bank shall not be
liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim,
damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or
any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity
with any Underwriter Information; and provided, further, that
Discover Bank shall not be liable to any Underwriter or any person
controlling such Underwriter under the indemnity agreement in this
subdivision (a) with respect to the Preliminary Prospectus, or
any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, to the
extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such
Underwriter or controlling person results solely from the fact that
such Underwriter sold Notes to a person to whom there was not sent
or given, at or prior to the Time of Sale, the Time of Sale
Information (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Time of
Sale Information that corrected or superseded any information
previously provided to the Underwriters) if Discover Bank had
previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter prior to
the Time of Sale.

(b) Each
Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold
harmless Discover Bank against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities to which Discover Bank may become subject, under the
Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or

 

28


 


 


liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon
the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or (in the case of the Registration
Statement, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto) necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading or necessary to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that
such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer
Free Writing Prospectus, the Registration Statement, or the
Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon
and in conformity with any Underwriter Information; and will
reimburse Discover Bank for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by Discover Bank in connection with investigating or
defending any such action or claim.

(c) Within
a reasonable period after receipt by an indemnified party under
subdivision (a) or (b) above of notice of the
commencement of any action with respect to which indemnification is
sought under such subdivision or contribution may be sought under
subdivision (d) below, such indemnified party shall notify the
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but no
failure to or delay in providing such notice shall relieve the
indemnifying party of any liability under such subdivisions except
to the extent that such indemnifying party is materially prejudiced
thereby. In case any such action shall be brought against any
indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate therein, and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified
party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof,
the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified
party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation. If the named parties in any
action (including any impleaded

 

29


 


 


parties)
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and
the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there
may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified
parties that are different from or additional to those available to
the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have
the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses
and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on
behalf of such indemnified party or parties at the expense of the
indemnifying party, such counsel selection to be subject to the
approval of the indemnifying party (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld); provided , however , that the
indemnifying party shall not be responsible for the expenses of
more than one separate counsel for all indemnified parties
(including one local counsel, if necessary, in the applicable
jurisdiction). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior
written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of
any pending or threatened action in respect of which any
indemnified party is a party and indemnity has been sought
hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement
(i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified
party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter
of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to or
admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on
behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person. The indemnifying
party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, but if settled with such consent or if there
be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party
agrees to indemnify any indemnified party from and against any loss
or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

(d) If
the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is
unavailable to an indemnified party under subdivision (a) or
(b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein,
then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
(i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by Discover Bank on the one hand and the
Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Notes or
(ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is
not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as
is

 

30


 


 


appropriate
to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause
(i) above but also the relative fault of Discover Bank on the
one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits
received by Discover Bank on the one hand and such Underwriters on
the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total
net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received
by the Issuer or Discover Bank bear to the total underwriting
discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each
case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus Supplement.
The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by Discover Bank on
the one hand and the Underwriters on the other and the
parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information
and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission of
Discover Bank on the one hand and the Underwriters, directly or
through you, on the other hand. With respect to any Underwriter,
such relative fault shall also be determined by reference to the
extent (if any) to which such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) result from the fact
that such Underwriter sold the Notes to a person to whom there was
not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such
sale, copies of the Time of Sale Information if Discover Bank had
previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter. Discover
Bank and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this subdivision
(d) were determined by per capita allocation among the
indemnifying parties (even if the Underwriters were treated as one
entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which
does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to
above in this subdivision (d). The amount paid or payable by an
indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in
this subdivision (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with investigating or defending any such action or
claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision (d), no
Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess
of the amount by

 

31


 


 


which the
total underwriting discounts and commissions received by it in
connection with such Notes underwritten by it and distributed to
the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of
any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to
pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission, provided , however ,
that if the total underwriting discounts and commissions do not
exceed the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has
otherwise been required to pay, such Underwriter shall not be
required to make any contribution. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the
Underwriters in this subdivision (d) to contribute are several
in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not
joint.
