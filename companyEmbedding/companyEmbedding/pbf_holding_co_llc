PBF Energy (“PBF”) is one of the largest independent petroleum refiners and suppliers of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oil, petrochemical feedstocks, lubricants and other petroleum products in the United States. PBF currently owns and operates five domestic oil refineries and related assets with a combined processing capacity, known as throughput, of approximately 900,000 bpd, and a weighted average Nelson Complexity Index of 12.2.
PBF Energy’s refineries are located in California, Delaware, Louisiana, New Jersey and Ohio. Our newest refinery is located in Torrance, California processes a blend of primarily heavy and medium crudes to produce a high-value product slate.  The Torrance refinery has a nameplate crude capacity of 155,000 barrels per day and is PBF’s most complex refinery with a Nelson Complexity index of 14.9.  The Chalmette refinery was acquired by PBF Energy in 2015 and is located just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana. Chalmette is a 189,000 barrel per day, dual-train coking refinery with a Nelson Complexity of 12.7 and is capable of processing both light and heavy crude oil. The facility is strategically positioned on the Gulf Coast with strong logistics connectivity that offers flexible raw material sourcing and product distribution opportunities, including the potential to export products.  Our East Coast refineries, at Delaware City and Paulsboro, have a combined refining capacity of 370,000 bpd and Nelson Complexity Indices of 11.3 and 13.2, respectively. These high-conversion refineries process primarily medium and heavy, sour crudes and have historically received the bulk of their feedstock via ships and barges on the Delaware River but have the capability to receive crude shipments via rail into crude rail unloading facilities at our Delaware City refinery.  Our Midcontinent refinery, at Toledo, processes light, sweet crude, has a throughput capacity of 170,000 bpd and a Nelson Complexity Index of 9.2. The majority of Toledo’s WTI-based crude is delivered via pipelines that originate in both Canada and the United States. Since our acquisition of Toledo in 2011, we have added additional truck and rail crude unloading capabilities that provide feedstock sourcing flexibility for the refinery and enables Toledo to run a more cost-advantaged crude slate.
PBF Energy also owns 49.5% of PBF Logistics LP (NYSE: PBFX). PBF Logistics LP, headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey, is a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by PBF Energy to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products, terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets.

The notes and the guarantees rank senior in right of payment to the issuers’ and the guarantors’ existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment thereto. The notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to any of the issuers’ and the guarantors’ existing or future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes and the guarantees are structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness and other obligations of the issuers’ non-guarantor subsidiaries. The notes pay interest semi-annually in cash in arrears on June 15 and December 15 each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2025. The indenture contains customary terms, events of default and covenants for an issuer of non-investment grade debt securities. These covenants include limitations on the Issuers’ and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock; make equity distributions, pay dividends on or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments; enter into transactions with affiliates; create liens; engage in mergers and consolidations or otherwise sell all or substantially all of the issuers’ assets; designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; make certain investments; and limit the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to PBF Holding. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. Many of these covenants will cease to apply or will be modified if the Notes are rated investment grade. At any time prior to June 15, 2020, the Issuers may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes in an amount not greater than the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 107.250% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. On or after June 15, 2020, the Issuers may redeem all or part of the Notes, in each case at the redemption prices described in the Indenture, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In addition, prior to June 15, 2020, the Issuers may redeem all or part of the Notes at a “make-whole” redemption price described in the Indenture, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Upon a change of control that results in a ratings decline, the Issuers will be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount of the Notes on the date of purchase plus accrued interest. Prior to a covenant termination event, certain asset dispositions will be triggering events that may require the Issuers to use the proceeds therefrom to offer to repurchase Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable repurchase date.

PBF Energy inks deal for California refinery, logistics assets








HOUSTON, Oct. 1


10/01/2015


By
Robert Brelsford

OGJ Downstream Technology Editor






































PBF Holding Co. LLC, a subsidiary of PBF Energy Inc., Parsippany, NJ, has entered an agreement to buy ExxonMobil Corp.’s 155,000-b/d refinery in Torrance, Calif., which has been shuttered since early this year following an explosion and ensuing fire that struck the plant in February (OGJ Online, Feb. 19, 2015).
The deal—which includes the refinery as well as ExxonMobil’s related California product terminals, crude and product pipelines, and other logistics assets—amounts to $537.5 million, plus working capital that will be valued at closing, PBF Energy said.
To be financed with a combination of cash, debt, and equity, PBF Energy’s purchase of the California operations comes as part of the company’s continued growth strategy to expand both its refining and logistics holdings across the US, said PBF Chief Executive Officer Tom Nimbley.
The company, which currently operates a 190,000-b/d refinery in Delaware City, Del.; a 180,000-b/d refinery in Paulsboro, NJ; and a 170,000-b/d refinery in Toledo, Ohio, also recently announced its entry into a $322-million deal with ExxonMobil and Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) for the purchase of Chalmette Refining LLC, an ExxonMobil-PDVSA joint venture that operates a 189,000-b/d refinery in Louisiana, as well as related logistic assets along the US Gulf Coast (OGJ Online, June 18, 2015).
The related Torrance assets will be held by PBF Energy Western Region LLC, a newly created and wholly owned subsidiary established to support the company’s expansion into the US West Coast, PBF Energy said.
Pending regulatory approvals and restoration of the refinery to full-working order following damages from the February fire, the Torrance transaction is scheduled to close during second-quarter 2016, according to PBF.
ExxonMobil said it expects to hand over control of the refinery and related logistics assets to PBF Energy by mid-2016.
Once completed, the Torrance acquisition will boost PBF Energy’s total refining capacity by more than 60% to about 900,000 b/d.
Logistics assets
In addition to the high-conversion refinery, which can process heavy, high-TAN, and high-sulfur crudes, PBF Energy will acquire the following as part of the Torrance transaction.
Crude gathering, logistics:
• M-1, M-55, and M-70 pipelines. These pipelines provide the refinery direct connection to heavy San Joaquin Valley crude oil, the primary feedstock processed at Torrance. PBF’s acquisition of the lines includes six associated pump stations.
• M-131, M-134, M-137, and M-146 pipelines. These pipelines link the refinery to additional domestic sources of crude oils, including production from Aera Energy Inc.’s Ventura County, Calif., operations, as well as to imported waterborne varieties.
Bulk gasoline-lubricants storage, distribution:
• Refined product terminals in Vernon, Calif., and Atwood, Calif.
• Lubricants distribution center in Vernon.
Refined product logistics:
• M-141, M-145, M-3, L-42, M-119, and L-43 pipelines. These pipelines connect the refinery to production distribution outlets that include Long Beach Harbor, the Port of Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles international airport, as well as to terminals at Vernon, Atwood, and the Port of Los Angeles’ Southwest Terminal Area No. 1.
The transaction also includes shell capacity of 8.6 million bbl in on site crude, intermediate, and finished product storage at the refinery.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

PBF Announces Product Off-Take, Crude Supply and Banking Arrangements | Business Wire
























































PBF Announces Product Off-Take, Crude Supply 
      and Banking Arrangements






October 04, 2010 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PBF Holding Company LLC (PBF) has entered into an arrangement with 
      Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (MSCG) for product off-take at its 
      Delaware City refinery and for the Paulsboro, New Jersey refinery upon 
      the closing of that planned acquisition. PBF also entered into an 
      arrangement with Statoil Marketing & Trading (US) Inc. for crude oil and 
      feedstock supply for Delaware City and Paulsboro. Also, in conjunction 
      with its planned acquisition of the Paulsboro refinery from Valero, PBF 
      entered into commitments arranged by UBS Securities LLC (and its 
      affiliates, UBS), Morgan Stanley Funding, Inc. (MS), and Deutsche Bank 
      Trust Company Americas (DB) for a $75 million term loan and a $100 
      million asset based loan (ABL). These arrangements are subject to 
      execution of definitive agreements and certain other conditions 
      customary for transactions of this type and, with respect to Paulsboro, 
      to the closing of the refinery acquisition.
    


      In regard to these arrangements, Thomas J. Nimbley, PBF’s CEO, stated 
      “We are delighted to be entering into these arrangements with such 
      strong counterparties as MSCG and Statoil, and such a strong banking 
      group. These arrangements will allow PBF to conserve capital for 
      continued growth and provide a strong supply and distribution chain for 
      added value for our investors.”
    

      Under the product off-take arrangement, MSCG will purchase from PBF’s 
      affiliates all of the transportation fuels produced at the two 
      refineries along with intermediates and certain specialty products.
    

      Goran Trapp, Head of Global Oil for MSCG stated “PBF is re-shaping the 
      landscape in the independent refining sector. We are pleased to partner 
      with them in this innovative supply chain solution. The arrangement will 
      generate tremendous synergies for both companies by linking these 
      high-conversion refineries to MSCG’s global trading and marketing 
      network.”
    

      Under the crude oil and feedstock supply arrangement, Statoil will 
      procure crude oil for the refineries, and PBF’s subsidiaries will 
      purchase the crude as it leaves the refinery tanks.
    

      “This agreement with PBF fits well with our strategy and we are looking 
      forward to working with PBF supplying their two refineries,” says Martin 
      Jones, President, Statoil Marketing and Trading Inc.
    

      In connection with the planned acquisition of the Paulsboro refinery, 
      UBS, MS and DB have severally committed to providing a $75 million term 
      loan and an ABL of up to $100 million, subject to the terms and 
      conditions contained in the executed commitment letter. The loans will 
      be secured by working capital at Paulsboro and the assets at Delaware 
      City, along with other collateral. The proceeds of the loans will be 
      used for general corporate purposes.
    

      PBF’s principal owners are Petroplus Holdings A. G., Europe’s largest 
      independent refiner, The Blackstone Group, and First Reserve 
      Corporation. Petroplus has also announced that it plans to sell its 
      investment in PBF to Blackstone and First Reserve.
