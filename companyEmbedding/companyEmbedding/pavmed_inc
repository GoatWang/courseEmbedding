Market Opportunity
Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common cumulative trauma disorder and accounts for half of all occupational injuries in the United States and more than $20 billion in annual workers’ compensation costs. The carpal tunnel is an anatomic compartment in the base of the hand through which tendons and the median nerve pass. Cumulative trauma leads to inflammation which manifests itself clinically through its compressive effect on the median nerve, resulting in motor and sensory dysfunction in the hand.  Each year, about 600,000 surgical procedures are performed to treat carpal tunnel syndrome in the U.S., resulting in a market opportunity of at least $1 billion for a device which successfully supplants open surgery. 










Current Limitations
The treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome patients who have failed to improve with conservative therapy involves cutting the transverse carpal ligament to relieve the compression of the median nerve. Traditional open surgery is effective but invasive. Endoscopic approaches are less invasive but more technically challenging, more expensive and associated with higher complication rates. They also still require a surgical incision and some surgical dissection before the endoscope is passed into the carpal tunnel. 










pavmed solution
CarpX is a completely percutaneous device to treat carpal tunnel syndrome, allowing the physician to relieve the compression of the median nerve without a surgical incision. CarpX incorporates a balloon catheter with bipolar radio-frequency cutting electrodes. The device is advanced over a wire and positioned in the carpal tunnel under ultrasonic guidance. When activated, it creates space within the tunnel, confirming that the nerve is protected from the cutting electrode and decompressing the median nerve by dividing the transverse carpal ligament. We believe CarpX will have the potential to decrease costs by shifting the procedure from the operating room to a less expensive setting, reduce postoperative pain, accelerate the patient’s return to full activity, and lower the threshold for intervention for patients “suffering in silence” who chose to delay surgery until symptoms become debilitating.

PAVmed Inc. Closes $5 Million Financing






July 05, 2017 07:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PAVmed Inc. (Nasdaq:PAVM, PAVMW), a highly differentiated, 
      multi-product medical device company, today announced the closing of a 
      $5 million financing provided by Scopia Holdings LLC. The private 
      placement offering consisted of $5 million in senior secured notes as 
      well as Series S warrants. The net proceeds of the transaction will be 
      used for the company’s working capital needs and advancement of its lead 
      products.
    


      “This financing is a very important milestone for our company and will 
      provide us with the necessary resources to advance our growth strategy 
      and multi-product pipeline towards commercialization,” said Lishan Aklog 
      M.D., Chairman and CEO of PAVmed. “We see this investment by seasoned 
      investors as a strong vote of confidence in our mission to enhance 
      shareholder value by advancing innovative medical device products from 
      concept to commercialization using our unique business model focused on 
      speed to market and capital efficiency,” Dr. Aklog added.
    

      Coincident with the financing, Scopia Holdings LLC was granted the right 
      to nominate one member of PAVmed’s board of directors and has submitted 
      David S. Battleman, M.D., M.B.A. to be its designee. Dr. Battleman is a 
      seasoned healthcare executive whose experience spans management 
      consulting, the life sciences industry and academic medicine. He is 
      Principal and Founder of TrueNorth Lifesciences, a New York City-based 
      firm providing consulting and advisory services focusing on the 
      commercialization of products in the life sciences industry. Prior to 
      founding TrueNorth, Dr. Battleman served as senior principal at IMS 
      Health, now Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc., (NYSE:Q), management 
      consultant in the healthcare practice of Bain & Company, executive 
      director at Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and assistant professor of public health 
      and medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College. Dr. Battleman holds an 
      M.D. from Weill Cornell Medical College, an M.B.A. from the University 
      of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business and an M.Sc. from the 
      Harvard School of Public Health.
    

      “I look forward to joining the PAVmed team as a member of its Board of 
      Directors,” said Dr. Battleman. “I have spent my career evaluating and 
      working with life sciences companies and could not be more impressed 
      with the business model and product portfolio this world-class 
      management team has built. I am particularly excited about the company’s 
      lead products, the PortIO™ Intraosseous Infusion System and the CarpX™ 
      device for the percutaneous treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, both of 
      which have the potential to be game-changers in their respective 
      clinical fields.”
    

      In the financing, the Company offered and sold two-year secured 
      promissory notes (“Notes”) in an aggregate principal amount of 
      $5,000,000 and 2,660,000 Series S warrants (“Warrants”) to purchase 
      shares of common stock of the Corporation (“Common Stock”) for $0.01 per 
      share. The Notes carry a coupon rate of 15% per annum, half of which is 
      payable semi-annually and the balance at maturity, and are secured by 
      the assets of the company. The company has agreed to file a registration 
      statement covering the resale of shares of Common Stock underlying the 
      Warrants.

Forbes11/7/16 5:13 pm ESTShares of small-capitalization companies have been busy beavers, besting larger-cap stocks since February after a long period of under-performance, with the Russell 2000 outscoring the S&P 500-stock index.

PAVmed Inc. Announces Closing of Financing




Company Considering Exchange Offers to Enhance Value of Outstanding 
      Securities






February 02, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PAVmed Inc. (Nasdaq:PAVM, PAVMW), a highly differentiated, 
      multi-product medical device company, today announced the closing of a 
      $1.5 million financing. The private placement consists of shares of 
      Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) and Series 
      A Warrants (the “Series A Warrants”).
    


      Dr. Lishan Aklog, Chairman and CEO of PAVmed, stated, “The strong 
      investor interest in our company has been extremely gratifying. 
      Furthermore, we continue to be delighted with investors’ growing 
      receptivity and endorsement of our business model.”
    

      PAVmed employs a unique business model designed to advance products from 
      concept to commercialization much more rapidly and with significantly 
      less capital than traditional medical device companies.
    

      The company is targeting FDA clearance of its first product, the PortIO™ 
      Intraosseous Infusion System, by the end of Q2 2017. In addition, PAVmed 
      expects to file a 510(k) premarket notification submission with the U.S. 
      Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for its second product, CarpX™, for 
      the percutaneous treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in Q2 2017. The 
      company currently estimates that the aggregate capital required to 
      obtain FDA clearance and initiate commercialization for both products to 
      be approximately $1 million.
    

      “We are excited about the near-term milestones for PortIO™ and CarpX™,” 
      said Dr. Aklog. “The combined addressable market opportunities for these 
      products are in excess of $1 billion. We believe that the 
      commercialization of these products has the potential to generate 
      significant value for our shareholders.”
    

      Dr. Aklog added, “Our time and capital efficient business model enables 
      our multi-product pipeline strategy. We look forward to making further 
      announcements about the forward momentum of other products in our 
      pipeline.”
    

      The Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of PAVmed common stock 
      (the “Common Stock”) at a conversion price of $6.00 per share. 
      Cumulative dividends are payable on the Preferred Stock at a rate of 8% 
      per annum, initially payable in-kind in additional shares of Preferred 
      Stock. Each Series A Warrant is exercisable for one share of Common 
      Stock at $8.00 per share. The conversion price and exercise price of 
      each of the Preferred Stock and Series A Warrants, respectively, are 
      subject to weighted average anti-dilution protection. The Series A 
      Warrants are also exchangeable, subject to certain conditions, into a 
      new series of warrants for which the company intends to seek a listing 
      to facilitate trading of such warrants. PAVmed has agreed to file one or 
      more registration statements covering the resale of securities 
      underlying or issuable pursuant to the terms of the Preferred Stock and 
      Series A Warrants.
    

      In addition, the company continues to evaluate potential exchange offers 
      involving its outstanding securities. The intention of any such 
      transaction would be to enhance the value of such securities.
    

      “The alternatives currently being evaluated are intended to reward 
      holders of our outstanding securities, provide additional incentives for 
      long-term ownership of such securities and attract additional investors 
      to our company,” said Dr. Aklog.
    

      The determination whether or not to proceed with any such transaction 
      shall be in the company’s sole discretion and shall be based upon market 
      conditions at such time, among other considerations. There can be no 
      assurance that any such transaction will occur at all, or if it does, 
      that it will ultimately result in any increase in value for the 
      company’s securities.

Safe Harbor Statement


      This press release includes forward-looking statements that involve 
      risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are statements that 
      are not historical facts. Such forward-looking statements, based upon 
      the current beliefs and expectations of the Company’s management, are 
      subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to 
      differ from the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that 
      may cause such differences include, among other things, the 
      uncertainties inherent in research and development, including the cost 
      and time required advance our products to regulatory submission; whether 
      regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results 
      from our pre‐clinical studies; whether and when our products are cleared 
      by regulatory authorities; market acceptance of our products once 
      cleared and commercialized; our ability to raise additional funding and 
      other competitive developments. PAVmed has not yet received clearance 
      from the FDA or other regulatory body to market any of its products. New 
      risks and uncertainties may arise from time to time and are difficult to 
      predict. All of these factors are difficult or impossible to predict 
      accurately and many of them are beyond our control. For a further list 
      and description of these and other important risks and uncertainties 
      that may affect our future operations, see Part I, Item IA, “Risk 
      Factors,” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission, as the same may be updated in Part 
      II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in any Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed 
      by us after our most recent Annual Report. We disclaim any intention or 
      obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to 
      reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions, or 
      circumstances on which those expectations may be based, or that may 
      affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those 
      contained in the forward-looking statements.

HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets. Trading foreign exchange and or other financial instruments on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.                
                
                NetDania expressly disclaims any liability for any lost principal or profits which without limitation may arise directly or indirectly from the use of or reliance on information on our website or the use of our software with broker integration.
