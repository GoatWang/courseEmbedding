The changes noted above have resulted in changes in the numerical values in some of the representative calculations and tables included in the prospectus, dated May 1, The tables, calculations and the sentences in which these numerical changes occur are set out below. Please refer to the May 1, 2009 prospectus for a discussion of all other provisions of your policy that are not discussed in this supplement. This supplement is for informational purposes and requires no action on your part. Please also note that certain terms used in this supplement are defined within the sentences where they appear, in the relevant provisions of the prospectus or in the prospectus Glossary. The prospectus dated May 1, 2009 is being amended as follows (in order of how these respective sections appear in the prospectus): Changes to Risks of Your Policy (under POLICY SUMMARY, sub-section Risks of Your Policy ): The following replaces the language under Policy values in the General Account paragraph: Policy Values in the General Account. Premium payments and Accumulation Values allocated to the Fixed Account are held in the Company's General Account. Unlike assets held in the Company's Separate Account, of which the Sub-Accounts form a part, the assets of the General Account are subject to the general liabilities of the Company and, therefore, to the Company's general creditors. The general liabilities of the Company include obligations we assume under other types of insurance policies and financial products we sell and it is important to remember that you are relying on the financial strength of the Company for the fulfillment of the contractual promises and guarantees we make to you in the policy, including those relating to the payment of death benefits. For more information, please see "Lincoln Life, The Separate Account and The General Account" section of this prospectus. 23 Changes to Charges and Fees (under POLICY SUMMARY, sub-section Charges and Fees ): The following replaces when the surrender charge is deducted and the Charge for a Representative Insured under the Surrender Charge section of Table I: Transaction Fees: Surrender Charge *2 Charge for a Representative Insured For up to 15 years from the Policy Date and up to 15 years from the effective date of each increase in specified amount, a Surrender Charge will be deducted at the time you effect a Full Surrender of your policy.

For a male, age 45, standard non-tobacco, in year one the maximum Surrender Charge is $31.10 per $1,000 of specified amount. * These charges and costs vary based on individual characteristics. The charges and costs shown in the table may not be representative of the charges and costs that a particular policy owner will pay. You may obtain more information about the particular charges that would apply to you by requesting a personalized policy illustration from you financial advisor. 2 You may request one or more Partial Surrenders totaling 90% of your policy s Surrender Value without the imposition of a Surrender Charge. If you wish to surrender more than 90% of your policy s Surrender Value, you must request a Full Surrender of you policy, which is subject to the Surrender Charge reflected in the table above.

Although deducted annually, interest accrues daily. As described in the section headed Policy Loans, when you request a policy loan, amounts equal to the amount of the loan you request are withdrawn from the Sub-Accounts and the Fixed Account in proportion to their respective values. Such amount is transferred to the Loan Account, which is part of the Company s general account. Amounts in the Loan Account are credited interest at an effective annual rate guaranteed not to be less than 3.0%. The following replaces the charge with respect to the Accelerated Benefit Up to Surrender Value under the Interest on Accelerated Benefit Lien section of Table II: Periodic Charges Other Than Fund Operating Expenses: Interest on Accelerated Benefit Annually Lien Accelerated Benefit Up to Surrender Value 4.0% annually of amount of Accelerated Benefit up to Surrender Value. 3 3 Under the Accelerated Benefits Riders, payments of benefits are considered as liens, which as described more fully in the section headed Policy Loans, are charged interest on amounts not exceeding the Surrender Value of the policy at an effective annual interest rate of 4.0% in years 1-10 and 3.0% in years 11 and later. To the extent the Accelerated Benefit paid exceeds the Surrender Value of the policy, the interest rate charged will vary as described in the table above and in the section headed Policy Loans. Although deducted annually, interest accrues daily. As described in the section headed Policy Loans, when the request as Accelerated Benefit, amounts equal to the amount of the Accelerated Benefit you request are withdrawn from the Sub-Accounts and the Fixed Account in proportion to their respective values. Such amount is transferred to the Loan Account, which is part of the Company s general account. Amounts in the Loan Account are credited interest at an effective annual rate guaranteed not to be less than 3.0%. 45 Under the Waiver of Monthly Deduction Rider section of Table II: Periodic Charges Other Than Fund Operating Expenses the reference to a female Representative Insured has been removed. Changes to POLICY CHARGES AND FEES section of the prospectus: The Fixed Account Asset Charge section has been removed. The following replaces the third paragraph of the Cost of Insurance Charge section: The Cost of Insurance Charge is determined monthly by dividing the death benefit at the beginning of the policy month by 1 plus (the monthly equivalent of an effective annual rate of 3.0%), subtracting the value at the beginning of the policy month, and multiplying the result (the Net Amount at Risk ) by the applicable cost of insurance rate as determined by the Company. The following replaces the last two sentences of the Policy Loan Interest section: The annual effective interest rate is 4.0% in years 1-10, 3.0% in years 11 and beyond. We will credit 3.0% interest on the Loan Account value in all years. The following sentence is removed from the Premium Reserve Rider section under subsection Rider Charges : The rider accumulation value allocated to the premium reserve rider fixed account is subject to the fixed account asset charge not to exceed 0.50% for all policy years. Changes to the Riders section under YOUR INSURANCE POLICY : The following replaces the sample policy example under sub-section headed Enhanced Surrender Value Rider : Sample Policy Insured: Male Standard Non-tobacco, age 45 Specified amount: $1,000,000 Benefit Selection Option: Not Elected Planned annual premium payment: $35,000 No Indebtedness End of Year Accumulation Value Without ESV Rider 5 Accumulation Value With ESV Rider Enhanced Surrender Value Surrender Value 1 $31,630 2 $65,182 $36,432 $64,560 $64,560 $1,690 $31,630 $31,630 3 $100,793 $73,273 $99,507 $99,507 4 $138,675 $112,415 $136,679 $136,679 5 $179,023 $154,053 $176,268 $176,2686 The following replaces the sample policy example illustrating the duration of lapse protection under sub-section headed No-Lapse Enhancement Rider : Sample Policy Insured: Male Standard Non-tobacco, age 45 Specified amount: $1,000,000 Benefit Selection Option: Not elected Planned annual premium payment: $8,000 Duration of lapse protection: 1) if premiums are received on the planned payment date each year: 471 months; or 2) if premiums are received 30 days after the planned payment date each year: 464 months. The following replaces the example under sub-section headed Benefit Selection Option : The following replaces the example shown with respect to a Male, 45 Years Old, Standard Non-tobacco: Benefit Selection Option Election: None Election: 100% Monthly Administrative Expense Fee $1.51 per thousand of (higher) $.48 per thousand of (lower) Male, 45 Year Old, Standard Non-tobacco No-Lapse Monthly Administrative Expense Reference Fee $3.98 per thousand of (lower) $4.19 per thousand of (higher) Result This option offers the best no-lapse protection available. The price of the protection is reflected in the higher Monthly Administrative Expense Fee. This option offers the least amount of no-lapse protection. The Monthly Administrative Expense Fee is reduced in exchange. Therefore, this option allows more money to be invested in the Sub-Accounts or allocated to the Fixed Account. However, the premiums which you must pay in order to satisfy the nolapse requirements of the rider will increase. Changes to Policy Values under PREMIUMS: The following replaces the last two sentences of the seventh paragraph: Interest is credited daily on the Fixed Account value at the greater of a rate of % (equivalent to a compounded annual rate of 3.0%) or a higher rate determined by the Company. The following replaces the last sentence of the eighth paragraph: 67 Interest is credited on the Loan Account at an effective annual rate of 3.0% in all years. Changes to POLICY LOANS section of the prospectus: The following replaces the last sentence of the second paragraph: Interest on policy loans (from both the Premium Reserve Rider and the policy) accrues at an effective annual rate of 4.0% in years 1-10 and 3.0% thereafter, and is payable once a year in arrears on each policy anniversary, or earlier upon full surrender or other payment of proceeds of your policy. The following replaces the last sentence of the third paragraph: Lincoln Life credits interest to the loan account value (of both the Premium Reserve Rider and the Policy) at a rate of 3.0% in all years, so the net cost of your policy loan is 1.0% in years 1-10 and 0.0% thereafter. 7

The information in this supplement updates and amends certain information       
contained in the last Product Prospectus you received. Keep this supplement with
your Prospectus for reference.                                                  

The following paragraph should be added to the section titled LINCOLN LIFE, THE 
SEPARATE ACCOUNT AND THE GENERAL ACCOUNT:                                       

On October 9, 2005, Lincoln National Corporation, the parent company of Lincoln 
Life, entered into a merger agreement with a wholly owned acquisition subsidiary
("LNC acquisition subsidiary") and Jefferson-Pilot Corporation                  
("Jefferson-Pilot"), each a North Carolina corporation. The merger agreement    
provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the    
merger agreement, Jefferson-Pilot will merge with and into the LNC acquisition  
subsidiary, with the LNC acquisition subsidiary continuing as the surviving     
corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of LNC. More information about 
the merger agreement as well as a copy of the merger agreement can be found in  
the Form 8-K filed by LNC with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October
11, 2005. Lincoln Life's obligations as set forth in your policy, prospectus and
Statement of Additional Information will not change upon completion of this     
merger.                                                                         

The following replaces the section titled Distribution of the Policies and      
Compensation:                                                                   

Distribution of the Policies and Compensation                                   

The policy is distributed by broker-dealer firms through their registered       
representatives who are appointed as life insurance agents for the Company.     
Broker-dealer firms distributing the policy enter into selling agreements with  
the Company. One of the broker-dealer firms with a selling agreement is Lincoln 
Financial Advisors Corporation ("LFA"), also an affiliate. Broker-dealer firms  
may receive commission and service fees up to 60% of first year premium, plus up
to 5% of all other premiums paid. In lieu of premium-based commission, we may   
pay equivalent amounts over time, based on accumulation value. Broker-dealer    
firms may elect to share this compensation with their registered                
representatives. Additionally, we may pay the broker-dealer additional          
compensation on first year premiums and all additional premiums and/or provide  
reimbursements for portions of policy sales expenses. In some situations, the   
broker-dealer may elect to share its commission or expense reimbursement        
allowance with its registered representatives. Registered representatives of    
broker-dealer firms may also be eligible for cash bonuses and "non cash         
compensation." The latter, as defined in NASD conduct Rule 2820, includes such  
things as office space, computers, club credit, prizes, awards, and training and
education meetings.                                                             

We may pay broker-dealers or their affiliates additional amounts for: (1)       
"preferred product" treatment of the policies in their marketing programs, which
may include marketing services and increased access to sales representatives;   
(2) sales promotions relating to the policies; (3) costs associated with sales  
conferences and educational seminars for their sales representatives; (4) other 
sales expenses incurred by them; and (5) inclusion in the financial products the
broker-dealer offers. We may provide loans to broker-dealers or their affiliates
to help finance marketing and distribution of the policies, and those loans may 
be forgiven if aggregate sales goals are met. In addition, we may provide       
staffing or other administrative support and services to broker-dealers who     
distribute the policies.                                                        

These additional types of compensation are not offered to all broker-dealers.   
The terms of any particular agreement governing compensation may vary among     
broker-dealers and the amounts may be significant. The prospect of receiving, or
the receipt of, additional compensation may provide broker-dealers and/or their 
registered representatives with an incentive to favor sales of the policies over
other variable life insurance policies (or other investments) with respect to   
which a broker-dealer does not receive additional compensation, or receives     
lower levels of additional compensation. You may wish to take such payments into
account when considering and evaluating any recommendation relating to the      
policies.                                                                       

Depending on the particular selling arrangements, there may be others whom we   
compensate for distribution activities. For example, we may compensate certain  
"wholesalers," who control access to certain selling offices, for access to     
those offices or for referrals, and that compensation may be separate from the  
compensation paid for sales of the policies. One of the wholesalers is Lincoln  
Financial Distributors, Inc. ("LFD"), a registered broker-dealer, also an       
affiliate of Lincoln Life. We may compensate marketing organizations,           
associations, brokers or consultants which provide marketing assistance and     
other services to broker-dealers who distribute the policies, and which may be  
affiliated with those broker-dealers. Commissions and other incentives or       
payments described above are not charged directly to policy owners or the       
Separate Account. All compensation is paid from our resources, which include    
fees and charges imposed on your policy.                                        

We do not anticipate that the surrender charge, together with the portion of the
premium load attributable to sales expense, will cover all sales and            
administrative expenses which we will incur in connection with your policy. Any 
such shortfall would be available for recovery from the Company's General       
Account, which supports insurance and annuity obligations.                      

                                                                      SUPP-05.22

Market Timing
Under the SEC rules, we are required to: (1) enter

that obligates us to provide to the underlying fund promptly upon request
certain information about the trading activity of individual policy owners, and
(2) execute instructions from the underlying fund to restrict or prohibit
further purchases or transfers by specific policy owners who violate excessive
trading policies established by the underlying fund.
Some of the underlying funds have reserved the right
to temporarily or permanently refuse payments or transfer requests from us if,
in the judgment of the underlying fund�s investment adviser, the underlying
fund would be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its investment
objective or policies, or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected. To
the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to defer or reject
a transfer request at any time that we are unable to purchase or redeem shares of
any of the funds in which the Separate Account invests, including any refusal
or restriction on purchases or redemptions of the Sub-Account units as a result
of the funds� own policies and procedures on market timing activities. If a
fund refuses to accept a transfer request we have already processed, we will
reverse the transaction within 1-2 business days of the day on which we receive
notice of the refusal. We will notify you in writing if we have reversed,
restricted or refused any of your transfer requests. Some


underlying funds also may impose redemption fees on
short-term trading (i.e., redemptions of underlying fund shares within a
certain number of business days after purchase). We reserve the right to
administer and collect any such redemption fees on behalf of the underlying
funds. You should read the prospectuses of the funds for more details on their
redemption fees and their ability to refuse or restrict purchases or
redemptions of their shares.

    What is Flexible Premium Adjustable Life Insurance?




























Flexible premium adjustable life insurance allows the most flexibility of the types of whole life insurance in regards to both investment and monthly premiums.






Whole life insurance is different from term as beneficiaries receive payment no matter what age the policy holder passes away.






The amount that a flexible premium adjustable life insurance policyholder pays in ultimately affects how much income she or he will earn from the life insurance policy.

Flexible premium adjustable life insurance is a type of whole life insurance policy that offers individuals the greatest amount of flexibility in terms of their investment choice and monthly premiums. It provides both a death benefit and an investment vehicle. Many individuals opt for such a policy because it provides a form of forced savings for retirement, while also protecting dependents in the event of premature death. 
The first key to understanding this type of insurance is understanding whole life insurance policies. Whole life policies are distinct from term life because the death benefit on a whole life policy is paid no matter when the insured dies. With term policies, the death benefit is paid only during a set period; for example, for his beneficiaries to collect the death benefit on a 30-year term, the insured would have to die within the 30-year period that the policy was active. 
With a whole life policy, premium payments continue for life and the death benefit is paid no matter when the insured dies. Premiums for this type of policy are generally more expensive than those for a term policy. They are also more expensive because the insured pays another fee, over and above the cost of insurance, which is invested in various types of investment vehicles.  

Ad


The payments are invested in one of two ways: the investor may have control over the investments and receive a variable rate of return, or he may have no control over the investment and receive a fixed rate of return. In other words, an investor with a variable policy pays extra premiums that are invested, and then gets to direct the course of that investment, ideally growing his policy, and the amount he is eventually paid. An investor with a fixed rate policy, on the other hand, pays extra premiums in and earns a fixed rate of return, while the insurance company invests those premiums. 
A flexible premium adjustable life insurance policy is an alternative fixed rate policy that gives investors greater freedom. Instead of paying the same premiums every month, the insured can choose to pay within a range. The amount he pays in ultimately affects how much income he will earn from the life insurance policy. 
He also has discretion to direct the investment of his money within the terms of the policy. The money eventually paid out to him in the form of withdrawals or dividends fluctuates based both on how much he paid on a monthly basis and based on how well his investments perform. Some policies may contain a guaranteed minimum rate of return when a policy is purchased, as long as a minimum amount of premiums are paid.

Make sure the financial strength rating is high according to A.M. Best. They rate the best insurance companies. Only 3 percent out of the 3,000 insurances companies in the U.S. have an A+ superior rating. So find one of those, because legally, life insurance companies can wait six months to pay out a death benefit and the average one waits 4.7 months. Also make sure that you are getting what you want out of the program. Lump sum or monthly installments? Income replacement or final expenses? All good things to consider. I would recommend a straight whole life policy that gets locked in at a young age to take care of final expenses and some term with a high face amount to cover your liabilities.

I had an ordinary whole life level premium plan for $750K. My agent passed away and in the fourth year his 'replacement' called to say they had a new and better deal for me. It was called flexible premium adjustable life insurance. The only description he provided was that it provided a surplus or reserve premium to be invested in a variety of capital gain and income producing vehicles.
I told him to leave my original policy untouched, but he could write an additional policy to reach total $1 million. 
Instead, he rewrote entire policy for the "better" policy and collected a $10K commission. I did not know these details until 20 years later, because the new policy was mailed
                            


                                 to the trustee of the family trust who was named the beneficiary. 
The trustee received the policy and simply placed it in our trust file. It was uncovered only 20 years later when we were told premiums had reached a level twice what we had been paying ($21K/year).
In the course of our subsequent communication with the insurer, they admitted a significant error in calculation of the premiums from 20 years ago.
They are now recalculating and, you can imagine, things are a bit tense around here. I guess I should have had the decency to die younger, but at 87 I am now in something of a bind. I can't pay current $44K out of social security.

When shopping for life insurance, it's basically the same thing as shopping around for any product or service - you compare rates and coverage from different life insurance companies.When we had our first child, I started getting life insurance quotes online to see what was available. One site was a good resource. It gave me rates, companies, and coverage options, and by getting a few quotes from three or four companies, I began to learn generally what a good price for certain coverage was. They also have tons of articles, but let's face it: you can't get specific prices without picking what specific coverage you want.Good luck, Alchemy. Hope this helps a bit in your search.

How do I tell if I am paying a good price for life insurance?  If buying life insurance is anything like buying automobile insurance, then prices can vary widely.  I am getting married soon, and I want to buy a motorcycle.  The only way my fiancée will let me have a motorcycle is if I buy some type of life insurance.  Riding bikes can be dangerous in Arizona, and we have a two-year-old daughter so I can agree with her point of view.  My only problem is I don’t know where to start shopping.  Does anyone have any good advice for a relatively young person shopping for life insurance?

Are premiums for a charitable gift of life insurance tax deducible, payable in a lump-sum only, and taxable to the charity after the gift is made?
