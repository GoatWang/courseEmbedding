1 Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed their active mutual fund peers by 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157) and 79.9% (1330/1515) over the 1, 3 and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Review the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds for more information.2 BlackRock, as of 6/30/17. Based on 826 ETFs and $1.53 trillion in assets under management globally.






 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.






Investment comparisons are for illustrative purposes only. To better understand the similarities and differences between investments, including investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses, it is important to read the products' prospectuses.

	iShares Gold Trust(ETF) (IAU): A Quick Guide to IAU
The IAU ETF is an effective, inexpensive way to get gold exposure

When it comes to gold exchange-traded funds, the gold standard — no pun intended — is the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD). At the very least, GLD is the largest and most heavily traded gold ETF as well as being the preferred gold ETF for many professional traders. It also set the stage for rival iShares Gold Trust(ETF) (NYSEARCA:IAU), debuting in late 2004, and IAU quickly found its own success.

With more than $8 billion in assets under management, IAU is big, though still not close to GLD’s $35 billion. Still, iShares’ product is one of the largest gold ETFs on the market — and for that matter, also one of the largest commodity funds of any variety.
To be technical, IAU is not actually an ETF, as iShares points out. It is structured as a trust that holds physical gold, though it more or less acts just like an ETF does.
“The Trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act,” says iShares. “Shares of the Trust are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds.”
IAU Offers Gold Exposure at a Discount
GLD charges 0.4% per year, or $40 on a $10,000 stake. That is not bad among commodity funds, but it’s high enough to make IAU’s annual fee of 0.25% notable. For investors looking for long-term gold exposure, saving $15 per year can and will add up over time.
The 10 Best ETFs on the Planet
The iShares Gold Trust is designed to give investors exposure to day-to-day price movements in gold, one of the most heavily traded commodities in the world. In addition to its low fee, IAU has also been a hit with retail investors due to its low share price. Because GLD represents a tenth of an ounce of gold, whereas IAU shares represent a hundredth, the former tends to trade at triple digits while the latter trades at double digits.
In either case, investors should be aware that selling a product such as GLD or IAU does not result in ownership of gold bars. No one from iShares will come to your door delivering gold after you sell the investment.
Gold also does not offer investors yield or interest, so this is not the investment for the income-seeking crowd. However, a small allocation to a product like IAU can help a portfolio endure rising inflation and profit from a weaker U.S. dollar.
Gold, like all commodities, is denominated in dollars. The weaker the dollar, the better gold (and IAU) usually perform.
As of this writing, Todd Shriber was long IAU.

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.






Performance shown may reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the investment advisor to the fund for some or all of the periods shown. Performance would have been lower without such waivers. Certain funds may have contractual or voluntary fee waivers that result in a Net Expense Ratio. Click on the fund names above for more information.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


Preferred stocks are not necessarily correlated with securities markets generally. Rising interest rates may cause the value of the Fund’s investments to decline significantly. Removal of stocks from the index due to maturity, redemption, call features or conversion may cause a decrease in the yield of the index and the Fund.


Funds that concentrate investments in specific industries, sectors, markets or asset classes may underperform or be more volatile than other industries, sectors, markets or asset classes and than the general securities market.


Diversification and asset allocation may not protect against market risk or loss of principal.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." Copies of this document may be obtained from your broker, from any exchange on which options are traded or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). The document contains information on options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation. The document discusses exchange traded options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation and is intended for educational purposes. No statement in the document should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a security or to provide investment advice. If you need further information, please feel free to call the Options Industry Council Helpline. They will be able to provide you with balanced options education and tools to assist you with your iShares options questions and trading. The Options Industry Council Helpline phone number is 1-888-Options (1-888-678-4667) and its website is www.888options.com.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

When it comes to gold exchange-traded funds, the gold standard — no pun intended — is the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD). At the very least, GLD is the largest and most heavily traded gold ETF as well as being the preferred gold ETF for many professional traders. It also set the stage for rival iShares Gold Trust(ETF) (NYSEARCA:IAU), debuting in late 2004, and IAU quickly found its own success.

With more than $8 billion in assets under management, IAU is big, though still not close to GLD’s $35 billion. Still, iShares’ product is one of the largest gold ETFs on the market — and for that matter, also one of the largest commodity funds of any variety.
To be technical, IAU is not actually an ETF, as iShares points out. It is structured as a trust that holds physical gold, though it more or less acts just like an ETF does.
“The Trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act,” says iShares. “Shares of the Trust are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds.”
IAU Offers Gold Exposure at a Discount
GLD charges 0.4% per year, or $40 on a $10,000 stake. That is not bad among commodity funds, but it’s high enough to make IAU’s annual fee of 0.25% notable. For investors looking for long-term gold exposure, saving $15 per year can and will add up over time.
The 10 Best ETFs on the Planet
The iShares Gold Trust is designed to give investors exposure to day-to-day price movements in gold, one of the most heavily traded commodities in the world. In addition to its low fee, IAU has also been a hit with retail investors due to its low share price. Because GLD represents a tenth of an ounce of gold, whereas IAU shares represent a hundredth, the former tends to trade at triple digits while the latter trades at double digits.
In either case, investors should be aware that selling a product such as GLD or IAU does not result in ownership of gold bars. No one from iShares will come to your door delivering gold after you sell the investment.
Gold also does not offer investors yield or interest, so this is not the investment for the income-seeking crowd. However, a small allocation to a product like IAU can help a portfolio endure rising inflation and profit from a weaker U.S. dollar.
Gold, like all commodities, is denominated in dollars. The weaker the dollar, the better gold (and IAU) usually perform.
As of this writing, Todd Shriber was long IAU.
