ESTERO, Fla., Nov. 12, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Hertz Global Holdings (NYSE:   HTZ) has announced that its Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation (HERC) business has recently added two new members to its senior leadership team as the business continues with plans to become an independent company by mid-2016.
Barbara Brasier has joined HERC as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective November 9, 2015.  Brasier will oversee HERC's global Finance function, including accounting, analysis, audit services, budgeting, control, planning, tax, treasury and reporting.  In addition, Brasier will play a lead role in positioning HERC in the capital markets and developing relationships with banks, ratings agencies, institutional investors and financial analysts.
Brasier joins HERC with 35 years of experience in finance and a career that has spanned diverse roles across public accounting, paper-goods, machinery and industrial-equipment and food-manufacturing industries.  Most recently, Brasier was Senior Vice President, Tax and Treasury, for Mondelez International, Inc., a $30+ billion food company comprising the global snacking and food brands that were spun off from the former Kraft Foods Inc.  
Maryann Waryjas has joined HERC as Senior Vice President and General Counsel, effective November 11, 2015.   Waryjas will lead all aspects of HERC's global Legal function, including contractual- and transaction-related legal activities and regulatory and litigation matters.  In addition, Waryjas will oversee HERC's corporate governance and statutory reporting requirements leading up to and after HERC becoming a standalone public company.
