Robert Conrad Khayat (born April 18, 1938) was the 15th Chancellor of the University of Mississippi. He was appointed in 1995. Khayat, a former student of the University of Mississippi, is the only Chancellor of the university to be a member of the Student Hall of Fame there. He has B.A. and J.D. degrees from the University of Mississippi and a LL.M. degree from Yale University. Khayat played American football in the National Football League as a kicker for the Washington Redskins.
In one of his first acts as chancellor, Dr. Khayat arranged for a $5.4 million gift from Jim and Sally Barksdale to establish an honors college at the university. In 1996, with enrollment declining, Chancellor Khayat retained the public relations firm, Burson-Marsteller, to conduct a survey of public perception — including university symbols. When The New York Times reported on the review, which included the Confederate Flag and other Old South symbols, a media frenzy ensued.
He was born in Moss Point, Mississippi.
On January 6, 2009, Dr. Khayat announced his retirement effective June 30, 2009.[1] He was succeeded by Dr. Daniel "Dan" Jones on June 15, 2009.
Chancellor Khayat's memoir, The Education of a Lifetime, was published on September 10, 2013.
