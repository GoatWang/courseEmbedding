Investment Strategy
Symmetric Capital invests in growing, profitable companies throughout the U.S. and Canada. Typically owned by their founders, a family, or a small partnership, these businesses have already achieved notable market and financial success, yet their owners and managers choose to bring in a new partner â with capital, relevant experience, deep networks, and a strong track record of collaborative relationships â to build even stronger companies and greater equity value.

In addition to providing long-term capital for owners and their growing businesses, we work closely with management throughout the duration of our investment, typically four to seven years, to help achieve their financial, strategic, and operational goals.  Our level of involvement and contributions will vary over time with the evolving needs and priorities of each business, but we are consistently active, informed, and thoughtful partners, with practical skills in such areas as:

Providing fact-based insights and a different perspective on critical strategic, operational, and financial issues.
Sharing real-world experiences and effective strategies gleaned from the more than 40 growth companies with which we have collaborated over the past two decades.
Utilizing our networks for recruiting, capital raising, revenue opportunities, and liquidity events.
Implementing best practices to strengthen financial systems and controls, and to improve operating metrics and incentives.
Identifying, negotiating, and financing add-on acquisitions.
Acting as a "sounding board" and trusted advisor for senior management to discuss strategy, risks, opportunities, acquisitions, personnel issues, and potential liquidity events.

Investment Strategy
Symmetric Capital invests in growing, profitable companies throughout the U.S. and Canada. Typically owned by their founders, a family, or a small partnership, these businesses have already achieved notable market and financial success, yet their owners and managers choose to bring in a new partner – with capital, relevant experience, deep networks, and a strong track record of collaborative relationships – to build even stronger companies and greater equity value.

Uses of Capital
While a CEO or owner of a profitable business may not have a critical need for capital, the addition of a value-added equity partner may become attractive at some point in the company's life-cycle. Symmetric tailors each investment to meet the immediate and longer-term objectives of a company's owners and managers. Whether we aquire a minority or majority ownership position, our equity investment may be used to:

Provide cash liquidity to owners – founders, family members, early investors, management, employees, or a corporate parent – allowing each to realize a portion of the equity value they have built, without having to sell the entire business (or even a majority in many cases) or incur restrictive debt.
Improve the company's balance sheet by reducing debt or adding working capital in support of continued growth.
Finance an acquisition that may be too large, too risky, or too time-consuming to undertake independently.

By enabling owners to diversify their personal financial position, strengthening a company's balance sheet, and bringing new expertise and resources to bear, a partnership with Symmetric lowers risk while better positioning a company for continued, profitable growth.

SYMMETRIC CAPITAL is a private equity firm that invests in profitable growth companies in the U.S. and Canada. 






Symmetric partners with exceptional management teams 
        seeking a value-added investor to help significantly increase the equity 
        value of their businesses. We structure our investments creatively to 
        meet the immediate and longer-term objectives of owners and managers – 
        all without changing a company's entrepreneurial culture, introducing 
        excessive debt that restricts growth, or requiring a change of control.
Symmetric currently manages funds with over $200 million in committed capital and seeks to invest $5-25 million of equity per company to provide liquidity to selling shareholders, working capital, or financing for acquisitions.
					 
 We are equally comfortable in minority 
        or majority ownership positions, as we partner with proven teams who retain 
        operational control and significant equity upside. 
        Since 1990, our principals have successfully invested in more than 40 growth companies across a range of industries, helping entrepreneurs raise over $1.2 billion in capital.
