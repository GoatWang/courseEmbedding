    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

                    For Once It Paid To Gas Up on the Turnpike                
But wait, there was even more good news for drivers last week. Motorists have long grumbled about paying higher gasoline prices on the state's toll roads. Last week, however, the New Jersey Turnpike had a surprise. Despite the spike in gas prices, a trip to the pump on the turnpike cost significantly less than at other stations because of a quirk in the contract with Sonoco, which runs the stations on the toll road.

                    SONOCO TO CLOSE NEW YORK PLANT WITH 130 WORKERS                
The Sonoco Products Company, which makes boxes, plastic bags and food cans, will close a plant in Fulton, N.Y., that has 130 employees as part of a plan to reduce costs amid falling sales and prices. The plant will close by the end of next March, said Allan Cecil, a spokesman for Sonoco. The company, based in Hartsville, S.C., said this week that it would eliminate more than 300 jobs and close at least 20 plants as it seeks to cut costs. ''We don't know yet how many more plants will close, and they range in size from 30 people to 300 people,'' Mr. Cecil said. Sonoco expects to save about $6.5 million a year by closing the Fulton plant.

http://protraderdaily.com/optin/?symbol=CCK 
Earnings Reviewed
 
Sonoco's net sales for Q2 2017 were $1.24 billion, up 2.9% compared to sales of $1.21 billion in Q2 2016. The improvement in sales was attributable to higher selling prices and sales added from acquisitions, net of divestitures. The Company's sales numbers exceeded analysts' estimates of $1.22 billion
During Q2 2017, Sonoco's gross profits were $235.9 million, down $6.1 million, compared with $242.0 million in Q2 2016. The Company's gross profit as a percent of sales declined to 19.0%, compared with 20.1% in the prior year's same quarter, driven primarily by lower volume/mix and the impact of rising raw material prices.
For Q2 2017, GAAP net income attributable to Sonoco was $43.1 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared with $56.3 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in Q2 2016. The Company's base earnings in the reported quarter were $71.8 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, compared with $74.7 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, in the prior year's corresponding quarter. The Company's earnings were in-line with its earlier announced base earnings guidance of $0.67 to $0.73 per diluted share and ahead of Wall Street's expectation of $0.70 per share.
Segment Review 
Sonoco reported its financial results in four operating segments: Consumer Packaging, Display and Packaging, Paper and Industrial Converted Products, and Protective Solutions.
Consumer Packaging - During Q2 2017, Sonoco's Consumer Packaging segment's sales were $521 million, up 2% compared with sales of $511 million in Q2 2016, driven by acquisitions, net of divestitures, and higher selling prices. This segment's operating profit was $59.1 million in the reported quarter compared with $59.5 million in the prior year's same quarter, reflecting modest gains from total productivity and positive price/cost but offset by lower volume, primarily in composite cans in Europe and metal ends in North America, and wage inflation. .
Display and Packaging -Sonoco's Display and Packaging segment recorded sales of $116 million in Q2 2017, down 12% compared with sales of $131 million in Q2 2016, primarily attributable to the loss of Company's contract packaging business in Mexico and Brazil; lower volume in domestic displays and retail packaging; and the negative impact of foreign exchange. This segment's operating profit was $1.4 million in the reported quarter, down on a y-o-y basis due to negative volume/mix in domestic displays and negative manufacturing productivity in retail packaging, versus $5.0 million in the prior year's comparable quarter.
Paper and Industrial Converted Products -During Q2 2017, Sonoco's Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment's sales totaled $469 million, reflecting a gain of 8.3% from sales of $433 million in Q2 2016, driven by higher selling prices implemented to recover higher raw material costs. This segment's operating profit improved 16.1% to $43.5 million in the reported quarter to the highest level in nearly three years compared with $37.5 million in the prior year's same quarter. This improvement in operating profit came on the back of manufacturing productivity enhancements and a positive price/cost relationship, including the Company's corrugating medium operations.
Protective Solutions -The Protective Solutions segment's sales totaled $135 million, up 3.2% compared with sales of $130 million in Q2 2016. The increase in this segment's sales came from acquisitions and higher selling prices offset by negative volume/mix. The segment's operating profit was $11.0 million compared with $14.2 million in the year earlier corresponding quarter, down 23.0% due to unfavorable manufacturing productivity and a negative price/cost relationship.
Cash Matters 
For H1 2017, Sonoco's cash generated from operations was $104.3 million compared with $186.0 million in the year ago same period. The Company's free cash flow for H1 2017 was negative $68.2 million compared with positive $9.8 million in H1 2016.
At July 02, 2017, Sonoco's total debt was approximately $1.31 billion compared with $1.05 billion as of December 31, 2016. At the end of Q2 2017, the Company had a total-debt-to-total-capital ratio of 43.7% compared with 40.4% at December 31, 2016. Sonoco's cash and cash equivalents were $207.6 million as of July 2, 2017, compared with $257.2 million at December 31, 2016.
On July 19, 2017, Sonoco's Board of Directors declared a $0.39 per share quarterly common stock dividend. The dividend will be paid on September 08, 2017, to shareholders of record as of August 11, 2017.
Outlook 
For Q3 2017, Sonoco is forecasting base earnings to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.77 per diluted share. The Company's FY17 base earnings guidance is expected to be a band of $2.73 to $2.80 compared to the Company's previous guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83.
Sonoco's operating cash flow in 2017 is expected to be approximately $445 million, and free cash flow is expected to be approximately $100 million due to higher than expected increases in working capital primarily due to superior selling prices and elevated material costs.
Stock Performance
  
On Wednesday, July 26, 2017, Sonoco Products' stock closed the trading session at $49.23, marginally down 0.63% from its previous closing price of $49.54. A total volume of 883.61 thousand shares was exchanged during the session, which was above the 3-month average volume of 496.17 thousand shares. Shares of the Company have a PE ratio of 18.65 and have a dividend yield of 3.17%. The stock currently has a market cap of $5.12 billion.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
