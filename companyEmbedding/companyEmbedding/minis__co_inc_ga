Came here to test drive and make sure I actually liked the feel of the vehicle.  Ended up leaving with a vehicle!!  They listened to my needs and price point and got me what I wanted. Left happy with a mini cooper countryman  2013 with only 35,000 miles on it for less than 20,000.  the financial  part was easy as they do their own in house financing  and I felt comfortable  knowing I wouldn't get a ton of inquiries from random things.  Great place to buy a car. You either love or hate the minis. we love ours and it is now gun to drive anywhere!

Minis & Company - Investment Advisors


 








  Client Services 
To achieve the highest level of service to our clients, we manage discretionary accounts. By doing so, we are able to promptly execute investment changes, without consulting the client. However, the client is kept fully informed at all times. Clients receive monthly or quarterly account appraisal and performance reports from the custodian and from Minis & Company. We prefer to meet with new clients to review their portfolio on a quarterly basis during the first year. Frequency of subsequent meetings is determined by the client’s needs.
As part of our service, we prepare year-end statements of realized capital gains and losses for each client. Since all Minis & Company clients utilize a separate custodian, either a bank trust department or a brokerage firm, to hold funds and securities, we verify the custodian’s reports to ensure that all income due to the client has been received.

Minis & Company - Investment Advisors


 








  Our Philosophy 
Our investment philosophy balances the higher return potential available in stocks with the relative safety available in cash and fixed income investments. We select stocks based on their average growth prospect and selling price. Investments of fixed income are executed by ensuring safety of principal while pursuing the best available yield.
Stocks
Stocks selected have the potential for above average total return over a one to five year time horizon.  Our analysis of equities measures each company’s financial strength, growth and stability of profits, and management competence.  We strive to buy shares of very good companies at a price that is at a discount to the intrinsic value of the enterprise.  Sustainable, growing cash flows and high returns on equity without excess leverage are important characteristics.  Once a stock achieves its potential return or target price, at least a portion is sold.
Cash & Fixed Income
We use money market funds and U.S. Treasury Bills for cash and equivalents. U.S. Treasury Notes and Bonds and investment-grade municipals, if appropriate, are acquired when investing in the fixed income market. Additionally, we will purchase Federal Agency or high quality corporate bonds and FDIC insured Certificates of Deposit. Our approach is to ladder out maturities as far as ten years, thereby reducing interest rate risk.

Leaving a Legacy


You've worked hard over the years to accumulate wealth, and you probably find it comforting to know that after your death the assets you leave behind will continue to be a source of support for your family, friends, and the causes that are important to you. But to ensure that your legacy reaches your heirs as you intend, you must make the proper arrangements now.There are four basic ways to leave a legacy: (1) by will, (2) by trust, (3) by beneficiary designation, and (4) by joint ownership arrangements.WillsA will is the cornerstone of any estate plan. You should have a will no matter how much your estate is worth, and even if you've implemented other estate planning strategies.You can leave property by will in two ways: making specific bequests and making general bequests. A specific bequest directs a particular piece of property to a particular person ("I leave Aunt Martha's diamond broach to my niece, Jen"). A general bequest is typically a percentage of property or property that is left over after all specific bequests have been made.Typically, principal heirs receive general bequests ("I leave all the rest of my property to my wife, Jane"). With a will, you can generally leave any type of property to whomever you wish, with some exceptions, including: Property will pass according to a beneficiary designation even if you name a different beneficiary for the same property in your will Property owned jointly with rights of survivorship passes directly to the joint owner Property in a trust passes according to the terms of the trust Your surviving spouse has a right to a statutory share (e.g., 50%) of your property, regardless of what you leave him or her in your will Children may have inheritance rights in certain statesLeaving property outright to minor children is problematic. You should name a custodian or property guardian, or use a trust.TrustsYou can also leave property to your heirs using a trust.Trust property passes directly to the trust beneficiaries according to the trust terms. There are two basic types of trusts: (1) living or revocable, and (2) irrevocable.Living trusts are very flexible because you can change the terms of the trust (e.g., rename beneficiaries) and the property in the trust at any time. You can even change your mind by taking your property back and ending the trust.An irrevocable trust, on the other hand, can't be changed or ended except by its terms, but can be useful if you want to minimize estate taxes or protect your property from potential creditors.You create a trust by executing a document called a trust agreement (you should have an attorney draft any type of trust to be sure it accomplishes what you want).A trust can't distribute property it does not own, so you must also transfer ownership of your property to the name of the trust. Property without ownership documentation (e.g., jewelry, tools, furniture) are transferred to a trust by listing the items on a trust schedule. Property with ownership documents must be re-titled or re-registered. You must also name a trustee to administer the trust and manage the trust property. With a living trust, you can name yourself trustee, but you'll need to name a successor trustee who'll transfer the property to your heirs after your death.Tip: A living trust is also a good way to protect your property in case you become incapacitated.Beneficiary designationsProperty that is contractual in nature, such as life insurance, annuities, and retirement accounts, passes to heirs by beneficiary designation.Typically, all you have to do is fill out a form and sign it. Beneficiaries can be persons or entities, such as a charity or a trust, and you can name multiple beneficiaries to share the proceeds. You should name primary and contingent beneficiaries.You shouldn't name minor children as beneficiaries. You can, however, name a guardian to receive the proceeds for the benefit of the minor child.You should consider the income and estate tax ramifications for your heirs and your estate when naming a beneficiary. For example, proceeds your beneficiaries receive from life insurance are generally not subject to income tax, while your beneficiaries will have to pay income tax on proceeds received from tax-deferred retirement plans (e.g., traditional IRAs).Check with your financial planning professional to determine whether your beneficiary designations will have the desired results.Be sure to re-evaluate your beneficiary designations when your circumstances change (e.g., marriage,divorce, death of beneficiary). You can't change the beneficiary with your will or a trust. You must fill out and sign a new beneficiary designation form.Some beneficiaries can't be changed. For example, a divorce decree may stipulate that an ex-spouse will receive the proceeds.Tip: Certain bank accounts and investments also allow you to name someone to receive the asset at your death.Joint ownership arrangementsTwo (or more) persons can own property equally, and at the death of one, the other becomes the sole owner.This type of ownership is called joint tenancy with rights of survivorship (JTWRS). A JTWRS arrangement between spouses is known as tenancy by the entirety in certain states, and a handful of states have a form of joint ownership known as community property.There is another type of joint ownership called tenancy in common where there is no right of survivorship. Property held as tenancy in common will not pass to a joint owner automatically, although you can leave your interest in the property to your heirs in your will.You may find joint ownership arrangements are useful and convenient with some types of property, but may not be desirable with all of your property. For example, having a joint checking account ensures that, upon your death, an heir will have immediate access to needed cash. And owning an out-of state residence jointly (e.g., a vacation home) can avoid an ancillary probate process in that state. But it may not be practical to own property jointly where frequent transactions are involved (e.g., your investment portfolio or business assets) because you may need the joint owner's approval and signature for each transaction.There are some other disadvantages to joint ownership arrangements, including: (1) your co-owner has immediate access to your property, (2) naming someone who is not your spouse as co-owner may trigger gift tax consequences, and (3) if the co-owner has debt problems, creditors may go after the co-owner's share.Unlike with most other types of property, a co-owner of your checking or savings account can withdraw the entire balance without your knowledge or consent.IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES This information has been prepared by Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Came here to test drive and make sure I actually liked the feel of the vehicle.  Ended up leaving with a vehicle!!  They listened to my needs and price point and got me what I wanted. Left happy with a mini cooper countryman  2013 with only 35,000 miles on it for less than 20,000.  the financial  part was easy as they do their own in house financing  and I felt comfortable  knowing I wouldn't get a ton of inquiries from random things.  Great place to buy a car. You either love or hate the minis. we love ours and it is now gun to drive anywhere!

I corresponded via email and phone to start and the general manager was helpful.
On line inventory was up to date and easy to use.
The day we went into the dealership, we worked with Zac and he is very knowledgeable and personable.
