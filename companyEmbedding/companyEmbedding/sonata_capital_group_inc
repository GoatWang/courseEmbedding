The markets finished mixed Tuesday.  Financials weighed on the Dow with shares of Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and JPMorgan falling 2.6%, 0.50% and 0.35%.  The technology sector lifted the S&P and the Nasdaq to gains as shares of Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook rose 1.43%, 1.26% and 1.96%.  The Dow closed down 55 points or 0.25%, at 21,575.  The S&P and the Nasdaq gained 0.06% and 0.47%.  The 10-year Treasury note fell almost six basis points to close yielding 2.26%.  Crude prices rose 0.5% to close at $46.25 per barrel.

Overview
As an independent firm, we operate on a fee-only basis to insure that our interests are aligned with those of our clients. This compensation structure eliminates commissions, markups and hidden fees. We are therefore free to recommend the best investment opportunities for our clients, regardless of origin with no conflict of interest. Our only commitment is to our client and their goals, interests and outcomes. Our clients know that this principle of acting in their best interests is a key tenet of our operating philosophy. Our relationships are based on being there for our clients under all circumstances and providing unbiased financial advice to help them accomplish their goals.
Approach
Our approach to investing begins with an understanding of our client’s specific needs, goals, and investment preferences. With this foundation, we focus on the four controllable factors that drive long-term investment results:

Strategic Asset Allocation – We allocate our clients assets across the core asset classes based upon your specific objectives, risk tolerance and time horizon. We also make tactical adjustments for specific market conditions and shifts in valuations.
Broad Diversification – In our view, diversification is the conscious decision to forego making a killing, in return for never getting killed. We follow a diversified investment strategy designed to provide you with the exposure to long-term market growth while dampening the effects of market volatility.
Researched Assets and Manager Selection – We thoroughly research the investment options for each portfolio, making our selections with a long-term perspective and a preference for tax and cost efficiency. As an independent investment advisor we are able to choose the investment options in each client portfolio without conflict.
Disciplined Rebalancing – We monitor portfolio allocations and performance on an ongoing basis and rebalance it as needed to maintain the long-term strategy.

Portfolio Structure
In most cases, portfolios consist of broadly diversified market investments in U.S. and International Equities, Fixed Income, and Cash equivalents. Depending on a client’s goals, objectives and preferences, we may select investments that include:

Individual stocks
Actively managed mutual funds
Index and Exchange Traded Funds
Individual bonds and fixed income securities
Alternative investments that are generally uncorrelated to the performance of the core portfolio

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Important Privacy Information*





Privacy StatementIntroductionAs a valued customer, we want to ensure your private information is kept private and only shared with those companies who are authorized either by yourself or as allowed or required by law.  This document explains our privacy policy, gives you reasons why we ask for the type of information we do, and if we do reserve a right to share information with non-affiliated third parties, lets you "opt-out" of our reservation to do so.  Please take a moment to read this entire policy.Collection of InformationThe purchase of a motor vehicle requires considerable accumulation of nonpublic personal information.  For example, if we sell or lease you a vehicle - extending you credit at your request - we will receive information from you in order to determine your creditworthiness.  We may also obtain information from a credit-reporting agency.  We may also obtain information from third parties such as employers, references and insurance companies.Some of the information we obtain from you may be required by state of federal agencies, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles or the Internal Revenue Service. This information may be required even if you were to pay cash for your vehicle. Examples would be a driver's license or social security number.Protecting Your InformationWe safeguard nonpublic personal information according to established industry standards and procedures.  We maintain physical and electronic safeguards that comply with state and federal law.  We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees and outside contractors who need to know the information to provide product or service to you.  We prohibit our employees and agents from giving information about you to anyone in a manner that would violate any applicable law or our privacy policy.Information SharingUnless we have indicated our desire to share your nonpublic personal information with non-affiliated third parties (by checking the box in the section below), we share information:A) For everyday business purposes, such as to process transactions, maintain account(s), respond to court orders and legal investigations, or report to credit bureaus.B) For purposes of processing a sale or lease transaction as your request or authorize, such as submitting information to third party financial institutions that may be requested to take an assignment of the contract or verifying insurance coverage information.C) When using outside service providers to help us provide you with products and services.  Before providing information to our service providers we enter into contractual agreements prohibiting them from disclosing or using the information other than for the purpose it was disclosed.D) With "Affiliated" companies.  Companies that are affiliated with us include any company that controls us, any company we control, or any company under common control with us. 



(enter your initials)I am interested in purchasing or leasing a vehicle and request that my Consumer Credit Report be obtained, at no cost to me, in order to help determine the types and extent of financing which may be available to me. 

 







If the item to the left is checked, this dealership reserves the right to disclose nonpublic personal information to third parties, such as market research firms, direct marketing companies, finance service providers and others who may from time to time seek to provide you information on valuable products or services.  


If the item to the left is checked, I direct you not to share nonpublic personal information about me to non-affiliated third parties, except as provided in this Privacy Policy.  


I Authorize*
