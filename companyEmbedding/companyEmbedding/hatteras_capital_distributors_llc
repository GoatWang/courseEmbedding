RALEIGH, N.C., Jan. 4, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Hatteras Funds, a boutique alternative investment specialist providing unique alternative investment solutions for financial advisors and their clients, announced today that the Hatteras Multi-Strategy Fund has been renamed the Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund. The Fund's strategies, objectives and management will not change.
Renaming the fund further distinguishes and better articulates the Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund from other multi-strategy funds of funds. Managed in partnership with Morgan Creek Capital Management, the core alternative investment solution allocates to both hedged strategies and private investments in a single investment vehicle, making it unique in the industry.
"As the alternative investing landscape evolves, renaming the Hatteras Multi-Strategy Fund the Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund provides greater clarity for investment advisors and their clients about the Fund's investment strategies, allocations and the role the Fund plays in a portfolio," said David B. Perkins, Hatteras Funds Founder and Chairman. "Thousands of funds currently fall under the multi-strategy umbrella, but the Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund is the only all alternatives, multi-strategy fund of funds combining hedged strategies with a mature, seasoned private investments portfolio. With 75 percent of our Fund's assets allocated to hedged strategies and 25 percent allocated to private investments, ours is truly a core alternative investment solution for qualified clients in both name and investment strategy."
The Fund was launched in 2004 to serve as a complement to a traditional portfolio of bonds, stocks and cash and was designed after the university endowment's alternative investment portfolio. The Fund allocates to 4 hedged strategies including Opportunistic Equity, Enhanced Fixed Income, Absolute Return and Tactical Trading. Additionally, the Fund allocates to private investment strategies diversified across 7 vintage years. By providing institutional-quality portfolios in a registered fund, investors gain access to strategies and managers that would normally be inaccessible due to high investment minimums and/or capacity constraints.
"The renaming to Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund does not alter our unwavering commitment to advisors whose clients are looking for sophisticated alternative investment solutions," said Mr. Perkins. "This is simply a better representation of the role this Fund could play in an Advisor's portfolio allocation."

Important Disclosures and Risk Factors: This is not an offering to subscribe for units in any fund and is intended for informational purposes only. An offering can only be made by delivery of the Prospectus to "qualified clients" within the meaning of U.S. securities laws. Please carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the Funds before investing. Please read the Prospectus carefully before investing as it contains important information on the investment objectives, composition, fees, charges and expenses, risks, suitability, and tax obligations of investing in the Funds. Copies of the Prospectus and performance data current to the most recent month-end may be obtained online at hatterasfunds.com or by contacting Hatteras Funds at 866.388.6292. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 
The Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund, L.P.; the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P; the Hatteras Core Alternatives Institutional Fund, L.P.; and the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P. (collectively referred to herein as the "Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund" or the "Fund") are Delaware limited partnerships that are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended, as non-diversified, closed-end management investment companies whose units are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund is a fund of alternative investments. As such, the Fund invests in private hedge funds and private equity investments. Hedge funds are speculative investments and are not suitable for all investors, nor do they represent a complete investment program. A hedge fund can be described generally as a private and unregistered investment pool that accepts investors' money and employs hedging and arbitrage techniques using long and short positions, leverage and derivatives, and investments in many markets. 
Key Risk Factors: The Fund, through an investment in the Master Fund, will invest substantially all of its assets in underlying funds that are generally not registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act and, therefore, the Fund will not have the benefit of various protections provided under the 1940 Act with respect to an investment in those underlying funds. The Fund can be highly volatile, carry substantial fees, and involve complex tax structures. Investments in the Fund involve a high degree of risk, including loss of entire capital. The underlying funds may engage in speculative investment strategies and practices, such as the use of leverage, short sales, and derivatives transactions, which can increase the risk of investment loss. The Fund provides limited liquidity, and units in the Fund are not transferable. Liquidity will be provided only through repurchase offers made by the Fund from time to time, generally on a quarterly basis upon prior written notice. 
The success of the Fund is highly dependent on the financial and managerial expertise of its principals and key personnel of the Fund's investment managers. Although the investment managers for the Fund expect to receive detailed information from each underlying fund on a regular basis regarding its valuation, investment performance, and strategy, in most cases the investment managers have little or no means of independently verifying this information. The underlying funds are not required to provide transparency with respect to their respective investments. By investing in the underlying funds indirectly through the Fund, investors will be subject to a dual layer of fees, both at the Fund and underlying fund levels. Certain underlying funds will not provide final Schedule K-1s for any fiscal year before April 15th of the following year. Those funds, however, will endeavor to provide estimates of taxable income or losses with respect to their investments. 
Please see the Prospectus for a detailed discussion of the specific risks disclosed here and other important risks and considerations. 
Securities offered through Hatteras Capital Distributors, LLC, member FINRA/SIPC. Hatteras Capital Distributors, LLC is affiliated with Hatteras Investment Partners, LLC by virtue of common control/ownership.

Hatteras Funds Announces New Sales and Marketing Directors






May 04, 2010 11:35 AM Eastern Daylight Time



RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hatteras Funds, a leading provider of unique alternative investment 
      solutions specifically designed for financial professionals, is pleased 
      to announce today four new appointments to its sales and marketing teams.
    


      Caron R. Brown has joined Hatteras as Director of National Accounts. She 
      assumes the role from Robert B. Brown, who has been promoted to the 
      position of Director of Marketing. Ms. Brown and Mr. Brown are not 
      related. Joseph T. McMenamin has also joined the Hatteras team as 
      Regional Director for the Northeast territory, and John W. Vaughan has 
      joined the team as Regional Director for the recently created New 
      England territory.
    

      “Caron, Rob, John and Joe are experienced professionals with deep 
      insights to the advisor community, and we expect that they will 
      significantly expand Hatteras’ presence. They will play an important 
      part in bringing the Hatteras Funds offering and value-added services to 
      substantially more advisors and their clients,” said Chief Executive 
      Officer Brian Jacobs. “They have each been through different market 
      cycles that have created demands for new investment solutions. They each 
      understand the importance of alternatives in post-recession portfolios 
      and how they are integrated with traditional investments.”
    

      “These professionals bring significant experience to Hatteras, further 
      reinforcing our ongoing commitment to our client, the financial 
      professional,” said Founder and Chairman David B. Perkins.
    

      Ms. Brown has over 15 years of financial services experience. She joins 
      Hatteras from J.P. Morgan Asset Management, where she was Vice President 
      and Senior Relationship manager responsible for increasing distribution 
      to the independent broker/dealer and bank channels. Before joining J.P. 
      Morgan in 2006, Ms. Brown spent three years as Vice President, 
      Relationship Management, at Merrill Lynch Investment Managers.
    

      Mr. Brown joined Hatteras in 2004 and has more than a decade of 
      alternative investment industry experience. Before joining the firm, he 
      was Vice President of Alternative Strategies at Highland Associates, 
      where he held a range of responsibilities that included alternative 
      investment strategy research, manager search and due diligence 
      functions, as well as client education. Mr. Brown will continue his 
      responsibility as liaison for the RIA space as well as a strong focus on 
      enhancing education and marketing materials for financial professionals.
    

      With over 16 years of financial services experience, Mr. McMenamin joins 
      Hatteras Funds from Allianz Global Investors, where he was Senior Vice 
      President and Divisional Sales Manager for the East Coast Region from 
      2007-2010, and Vice President from 2001-2007. Among his responsibilities 
      at Allianz Global Investors were the development of business 
      relationships and top-down support for advisors within banks, 
      independent, regional and wirehouse firms. Previously, he spent eight 
      successful years with Eaton Vance Distributors, most recently as 
      Regional Vice President.
    

      Joining Hatteras as Regional Director for New England, John W. Vaughan 
      brings over 25 years of financial services experience to the firm. 
      Before joining Hatteras, Mr. Vaughan was Vice President and Regional 
      Director in the Wealth Management Solutions Group at Eaton Vance, a 
      position he had held since 2007. In this capacity, he was responsible 
      for the sale and service of Eaton Vance’s high-net-worth offerings. In 
      2007, he was appointed a Director of Eaton Vance’s Wealth Management 
      Solutions Group. From 2001 to 2007, he was Managing Director of 
      Alternative Investments, responsible for the development and sales of 
      the firm’s private placements and charitable gift trust products. He 
      joined Eaton Vance in 1999. Earlier Mr. Vaughan served as an enforcement 
      attorney with the Massachusetts Securities Division and as a state 
      prosecutor. From 1985 to 1991, he was a financial consultant and 
      brokerage manager at Fidelity Investments. He holds the J.D. from the 
      New England School of Law, and the Chartered Private Wealth Advisor (CPWASM) 
      designation.

Disclosures
When considering alternative investments, you should consider various risks, including the fact that some products use leverage and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss, can be illiquid, are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, often charge high fees, and, in many cases, the underlying investments are not transparent and are known only to the investment manager. With respect to alternative investments in general, you should be aware that returns from some alternative investments can be volatile and you may lose all or a portion of your investment.
Past performance of any investment is not necessarily indicative of future results. You should only commit risk capital to a fund investment.

You should obtain investment and tax advice from your advisors before deciding to invest.
