Products & Systems


Our commitment to the customer leads us to great efforts in research and development. The result is the quality products and constructive systems: 


Stylink® - Polymer modified asphalt: More than 15 years of experience and 30,000 km of paved roads in Mexico.
Styler® - Polymer modified asphalt emulsion.
MacroSello® System - Introduced in Mexico in 2001, this system is supported by the construction of surfaces using an irrigation system. Before applying the system, the particular existing conditions on the highways are considered to achieve maximum performance. Styler® technology is used along with one pass chip sealing equipment that allows the asphalt material to adhere to the rock. As a result, materials have been saved—the dispensing is controlled—and a uniform, secure surface layer, with quick return to traffic and high durability is achieved.
DuraMix® System - High performance cold-mix technology. This system’s application has been promoted since 2001. The objective is to develop high quality surfaces that have characteristics similar to hot mix with a savings of up to 25%. The result has been the production of better quality rural roads and greater conservation of federal highways. In addition, the DuraMix system reduces environmental pollution during the paving process.
Fillmix - This is a next generation product developed by our engineering division for permanent repair of potholes and shoving, involving design, processing and application of the asphalt mix, with complete technical support.  
Recycling Plus System - This system consists of full depth reclamation/ base stabilization. It increases the pavement’s structural capacity and supports flexibility. Following a specialized engineering design, the existing pavement and/or granular base is uniformly pulverized to a depth of 15 to 20 centimeters, treated with a special emulsion and then compacted.
RodaMat System - This new technology was introduced in Mexico in 2002 by SemMaterials Mexico. It consists of the application of an ultra-thin layer of hot mix over a highly adherent membrane and Stylink® technology in the polymer modification; the simultaneous mixing is done by equipment especially designed for that purpose. The result is a surface layer with a high level of noise absorption and above all makes for a very comfortable ride. 
EverPAV™ System - This system combines superior performance asphalt products and regional aggregates. We use the most advanced technology for the application process and the result is a long-lasting paved surface, resistant to present and future loads and requires minimal maintenance. Our High Modulus Asphalt and Fatigue Resistant mixes are used to build roads with a world class “Perpetual Pavement” technology.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

SemGroup Announces Natural Gas Pipeline Project to Serve Active STACK Play


5/3/2017

Download this Press Release (PDF 212 KB)


TULSA, Okla., May  03, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SemGroup® Corporation (NYSE:SEMG) today announced plans to build a natural gas pipeline to connect its processing complex in northern Oklahoma to the active STACK play in the central portion of the state.
The Canton Pipeline is backed by firm commitments from an investment-grade counterparty and has an initial capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day. With additional compression, the pipeline could be expanded up to 400 million cubic feet per day to serve other producers in the area. The 24-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline will extend approximately 50 miles from SemGroup’s Rose Valley processing facility in Woods County to north central Blaine County. The pipeline is expected to be in service by year-end 2017.        “This project falls directly in line with our long-term strategic goals to achieve basin and customer diversification while optimizing our existing assets,” said Wayne Ziegler, vice president of SemGroup’s gas operations. “It significantly expands our Oklahoma asset footprint and allows us to better serve the growing gathering and processing needs within this active play.” Also in the STACK play, SemGroup’s jointly owned Glass Mountain Pipeline, LLC is constructing a 44-mile pipeline extension to deliver STACK crude to the Cushing storage complex with access to Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast refineries. The Glass Mountain Pipeline extension is expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2017.
