 SUMMARY

The Trust:                                                                      

      The Trust is a no-load open-end, diversified management investment company
that  was  organized  under  the  laws  of the  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts,
presently  consisting  of four separate  funds,  the INVESCO  Treasurer's  Money
Market  Reserve Fund (the "Money Fund") and the INVESCO  Treasurer's  Tax-Exempt
Reserve Fund (the "Tax-Exempt Fund") (collectively,  the "Funds"), each of which
represents a separate  portfolio of investments.  This Prospectus  describes the
operations  of the Money  Fund and the  Tax-Exempt  Fund.  Each of the Funds has
separate   investment   policies.   The  Funds  are  designed   especially   for
consideration by treasurers and financial  officers of  corporations,  financial
institutions,  and fiduciary accounts. The securities offered by this Prospectus
consist of shares of  beneficial  interests of both Funds.  Certain of the terms
used in this Prospectus are defined in Appendix A.                              

Investment Objectives:                                                          

      The  investment  objective  of each of the Funds is to  achieve  as high a
level of current income as is consistent with the  preservation of capital,  the
maintenance of liquidity,  and investing in high quality instruments.  A summary
of how each Fund intends to accomplish its objective follows:                   

      INVESCO Treasurer's Money Market Reserve Fund -- This Fund will attempt to
achieve its  objective  by  investing in  short-term  money market  instruments,
consisting of those issued or guaranteed by the U.S.  Government or its agencies
or  instrumentalities,  obligations  of  financial  institutions  (such  as  the
following  instruments  determined to be readily  marketable  by the  Investment
Adviser:  certificates  of deposit,  time deposits and bankers'  acceptances  of
domestic and foreign banks, and funding  agreements issued by domestic insurance
companies) which may include demand features,  commercial paper,  corporate debt
obligations  other  than  commercial  paper and loan  participation  agreements.
Corporate debt  securities  acquired by the Money Fund must be rated by at least
two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ("NRSROs"), generally
Standard & Poor's  Ratings Group ("S&P") and Moody's  Investors  Services,  Inc.
("Moody's"),  in one of the two highest rating  categories  (AAA or AA by S&P or
Aaa or Aa by Moody's),  or where the obligation is rated only by S&P or Moody's,
and not by any other NRSRO,  such obligation is rated AAA or AA by S&P or Aaa or
Aa by Moody's.  The Money Fund will limit  purchases  of  instruments  issued by
banks to those instruments issued by a bank that meets the criteria discussed in
the section of this Prospectus  entitled  "Investment  Objectives and Policies."
The Money Fund limits  investment  in foreign bank  obligations  to U.S.  dollar
denominated  obligations  of  foreign  banks  that  have  assets of at least $10
billion and have branches or agencies in the U.S.                               

      Commercial  paper acquired by the Money Fund must be rated by at least two
NRSROs, generally S&P and Moody's, in the highest rating category (A-1 by S&P or
P-1 by Moody's),  or, where the obligation is rated only by S&P or Moody's,  and
not by any  other  NRSRO,  such  obligation  is rated A-1 or P-1.  Money  market
instruments purchased by the Money Fund that are not rated must be determined by
the Adviser to be of equivalent  credit quality to the rated securities in which
the Money Fund may invest.  In the Adviser's  opinion,  obligations that are not
rated are not  necessarily of lower quality than those that are rated but may be
less marketable and typically may provide higher yields. The Fund will invest in
such  securities  only when such  investment  is in  accordance  with the Fund's
investment  objective of achieving a high level of current  income and when such
investment  will not impair  the Fund's  ability  to comply  with  requests  for
redemptions.                                                                    

P-->4974th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�4th
      INVESCO  Treasurer's  Tax-Exempt Reserve Fund -- This Fund will attempt to
achieve its  objective  by investing in the  following  instruments:  short-term
municipal obligations consisting of tax anticipation notes, revenue anticipation
notes  and bond  anticipation  notes;  short-term  municipal  bonds;  tax-exempt
commercial   paper;  and  variable  rate  demand  notes.   Under  normal  market
conditions,  this Fund will  invest at least 80% of its net assets in  municipal
obligations that pay interest free from federal income tax.                     

      Municipal  obligations other than municipal notes or commercial paper will
be purchased by the Tax-Exempt  Fund only if backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States,  or if they meet the rating  requirements set forth below.
Municipal bonds must be rated by at least two NRSROs - generally S&P and Moody's
- in one of the two highest rating  categories (AAA or AA by S&P or Aaa or Aa by
Moody's),  or where  the  bond is rated  only by one  NRSRO -  generally  S&P or
Moody's - in the single NRSRO's two highest rating categories (AAA or AA by S&P,
or Aaa or Aa by Moody's).  Municipal notes or municipal commercial paper must be
rated in the highest rating category by at least two NRSROs,  or where the notes
or paper is rated only by one NRSRO,  in the  highest  rating  category  by that
NRSRO.  If a security  is unrated,  the Fund may invest in such  security if the
Adviser  determines,  in an analysis similar to that performed by Moody's or S&P
in rating  similar  securities  and issuers,  that the security is comparable to
that eligible for investment by the Fund.                                       

      In order to enhance  the  liquidity,  stability  or quality of a municipal
obligation,  the  Tax-Exempt  Fund may acquire a right to sell an  obligation to
another party at a guaranteed price approximating par value, either on demand or
at specified intervals.  The right to sell may form part of the obligation or be
acquired  separately by the Tax-Exempt  Fund. These rights may be referred to as
demand features, standby commitments or puts, depending on their characteristics
(collectively referred to as "Standby Commitments"),  and may involve letters of
credit or other  credit  support  arrangements  supplied  by domestic or foreign
banks  supporting the other party's  ability to purchase the obligation from the
Tax-Exempt Fund.                                                                

      In  fulfillment  of  their  investment  objectives,  and as part of  their
investment strategy,  both Funds may enter into repurchase agreements and invest
in bank  participation  interests and "when issued"  securities.  Both Funds may
also enter  into  reverse  repurchase  agreements,  but only for the  purpose of
obtaining funds for meeting redemption requests of shareholders.  Both Funds may
also hold cash for temporary defensive purposes. (See "Investment Objectives and
Policies.")                                                                     

      Certain  of the  investments  by the  Funds  may be  considered  "illiquid
securities."  Each of the Funds has adopted an investment  policy that prohibits
it from having more than 10% of its total assets invested in illiquid securities
(including  restricted  securities,  repurchase agreements maturing in more than
seven days,  time deposits  without  demand  features  having a stated  maturity
greater than seven days,  and funding  agreements  and  participation  interests
without demand features or for which there is not a readily available market).  

Investment Adviser:                                                             

      INVESCO Capital Management,  Inc., a Delaware  corporation and the Trust's
investment  adviser  (the  "Adviser"),  acts  as  investment  adviser  to  other
investment companies and furnishes investment counseling services to private and
institutional  clients.  As to each Fund, the Trust pays the Adviser an advisory
fee equal to, on an annual basis,  0.25% of the average daily net asset value of
the Fund's net assets.

Principal Underwriter and Distributor:                                          

INVESCO Services, Inc. (the "Distributor") serves as the principal  
underwriter and distributor of shares of the Trust.  The Distributor also       
furnishes distribution and investment advisory services to one other            
investment company consisting of six portfolios.                                

Purchases:                                                                      

      Each Fund's shares are offered at net asset value, which is expected to be
maintained at a constant $1.00 per share. There is no assurance, however, that a
Fund will be able to maintain a net asset value of $1.00 per share.  The minimum
initial  purchase of shares required by the Trust is $1,000,000.  In determining
the minimum  required,  subscribers  will be given credit for amounts which they
have invested in either of the Funds. Shares must be purchased by good funds (as
defined under "How to Buy Fund Shares").  The Trust reserves the right to reduce
or to waive the  minimum  purchase  requirements  in certain  cases.  Subsequent
investments  in any of the Funds may be made in amounts of  $100,000  or more at
any time. Shares may be purchased  through the Distributor,  acting as agent for
the  Trust.  Purchase  orders  may also be placed  through  member  firms of the
National  Association of Securities  Dealers,  Inc.  ("NASD"),  who may charge a
reasonable handling fee. Such handling fees can be avoided by investing directly
with the Trust.  There are no charges imposed by the Trust or the Distributor on
purchases of Trust shares.                                                      

Redemptions:                                                                    

      The amount paid upon redemption will be the net asset value per share next
determined  after the  redemption  request  is  received  in proper  form.  If a
redemption  request is  received  by 11:30 a.m.  (New York time)  proceeds  will
normally be wired that day, if  requested  by the  shareholder,  but no dividend
will be  earned on the  redeemed  shares on that  day.  Proceeds  on  redemption
requests  received  after  11:30  a.m.  (New  York  time)  will be sent the next
business day when net asset value is determined and will earn any dividends paid
on the redeemed  shares up to but not including the day on which such shares are
redeemed.  There is no charge  imposed  in  connection  with the  redemption  of
shares. The Trust has the right to redeem shareholder accounts that fall below a
minimum  level  ($500,000 or less) as a result of  redemptions  of shares.  (See
"Redemption of Shares.")                                                        

Dividends and Distributions:                                                    

 The Trust intends to declare dividends daily.  All distributions made
to a shareholder will be reinvested automatically in additional Fund shares     
pursuant to the Trust's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless the         
shareholder specifically elects to receive declared dividends and other         
distributions in cash.  (See "Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan.")

THE TRUST 

      The  Trust  is a  no-load,  open-end,  diversified  management  investment
company. The Trust's address is 7800 East Union Avenue, Denver,  Colorado 80237.
The Trust was organized on January 27, 1988,  under the laws of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts  as a Massachusetts  business trust. The Trust has one class of
shares that may be divided into different series,  each representing an interest
in a separate portfolio of investments.  Presently,  the Trust has four separate
portfolios of  investments.  This Prospectus  describes the INVESCO  Treasurer's
Money Market Reserve Fund ("Money Fund") and the INVESCO Treasurer's  Tax-Exempt
Reserve Fund ("Tax-Exempt Fund") (collectively, the "Funds").                   

      From  time to time  the  Funds  advertise  their  respective  "yield"  and
"effective  yield." The "yields" shown are based on historical  earnings and are
not intended to indicate future performance. Annualized net yields for the seven
days ended  December  31, 1994 for the Money Fund and the  Tax-Exempt  Fund were
5.91% and  5.22%,  respectively.  The yield of a Fund  refers to the net  income
generated by the  investment  in the Fund over a seven-day  period (which period
will be stated in the advertisement).  This income is then annualized.  That is,
the amount of income generated by the investment  during that week is assumed to
be generated each week over a 52-week period and is shown as a percentage of the
investment.  The "effective yield" is calculated similarly but, when annualized,
the income earned by an investment in the Fund is assumed to be reinvested.  The
"effective  yield"  will be  slightly  higher  than the  "yield"  because of the
compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment.                                

      Average  portfolio  maturities for the Money Fund and Tax-Exempt Fund were
12 days and 10 days, respectively, at December 31, 1994.                        

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 

      The  investment  objective  of each of the Funds is to  achieve  as high a
level of current income as is consistent  with the  preservation  of capital and
the  maintenance  of  liquidity.  Each Fund's  assets are invested in securities
having  maturities of 397 days or less, and the dollar weighted average maturity
of the  portfolio  will  not  exceed  90 days.  The  Funds  buy only  securities
determined  by the Board of  Directors  or the Adviser  with the approval of the
Board of Directors  to be of high quality with minimal  credit risk and that are
eligible  for  investment  by the Funds under  applicable  U.S.  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission  ("SEC")  rules.  See  Appendix A for  descriptions  of the
investment  instruments referred to below, as well as discussions of the degrees
of risk involved in purchasing these instruments.                               

      INVESCO  Treasurer's  Money Market Reserve Fund -- The Money Fund attempts
to achieve its  objective by investing in money market  instruments,  consisting
of:  short-term  money  market  instruments  issued  or  guaranteed  by the U.S.
Government  or its  agencies  or  instrumentalities,  obligations  of  financial
institutions  (such  as  the  following  instruments  determined  to be  readily
marketable by the Investment Adviser: certificates of deposit, time deposits and
bankers'  acceptances  of domestic  and foreign  banks,  and funding  agreements
issued by  domestic  insurance  companies)  which may include  demand  features,
corporate debt securities,  other than commercial  paper and loan  participation
agreements.  Corporate debt securities  acquired by the Money Fund must be rated
by at least two NRSROs - generally Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P") and

Moody's Investors  Services,  Inc.  ("Moody's") - in one of the two highest     
rating  categories  (AAA or AA by S&P or Aaa or Aa by  Moody's),  or  where  the
obligation  is rated only by S&P or Moody's,  and not by any other  NRSRO,  such
obligation  is rated AAA or AA by S&P, or Aaa or Aa by  Moody's.  The Money Fund
limits purchases of instruments  issued by banks to those  instruments which are
rated  in  one  of  the  two  highest  categories  by  a  nationally  recognized
statistical rating organization,  and which are issued by banks which have total
assets in excess of $4 billion and meet other criteria  established by the board
of trustees.  The Money Fund limits  investments in foreign bank  obligations to
U.S.  dollar  denominated  obligations  of foreign banks which have assets of at
least $10  billion,  have  branches  or  agencies  in the U.S.,  and meet  other
criteria established by the board of trustees. From time to time, on a temporary
basis for defensive purposes, the Money Fund may hold cash.                     

      Commercial  paper  acquired  by this  Fund  must be rated by at least  two
NRSROs, generally S&P and Moody's, in the highest rating category (A-1 by S&P or
P-1 by Moody's),  or, where the  obligation  is rated by only S&P or Moody's and
not by any  other  NRSRO,  such  obligation  is rated A-1 or P-1.  Money  market
instruments purchased by the Money Fund which are not rated by any NRSRO must be
determined  by the  Adviser  to be of  equivalent  credit  quality  to the rated
securities  in which  the  Money  Fund may  invest.  In the  Adviser's  opinion,
obligations  that are not rated are not  necessarily of lower quality than those
which are rated;  however, they may be less marketable and typically may provide
higher  yields.  The Fund  invests  in  unrated  securities  only  when  such an
investment is in accordance with the Fund's investment objectives of achieving a
high level of current income and when such investment will not impair the Fund's
ability to comply with requests for redemptions.                                

      INVESCO  Treasurer's  Tax-Exempt  Reserve Fund -- The Tax-Exempt Fund will
attempt to achieve its objective by investing in short-term  instruments  exempt
from federal taxation,  consisting of: short-term municipal obligations, such as
tax anticipation notes,  revenue anticipation notes and bond anticipation notes;
tax-exempt commercial paper; and variable rate demand notes. It is the intention
of this  Fund to  qualify  to pay  exempt-interest  dividends  for  federal  tax
purposes. There can be no assurance that this Fund will qualify each year to pay
exempt-interest dividends.                                                      

      It  is a  fundamental  policy  of  the  Fund  that,  under  normal  market
conditions,  it will have at least 80% of its net assets  invested in  municipal
obligations  that,  based on the opinion of counsel to the issuer,  pay interest
free from federal income tax. It is the Tax-Exempt Fund's present intention (but
not a fundamental policy) to invest its assets so that 100% of its annual income
will be tax-exempt. This Fund may invest in municipal obligations whose interest
income is  specially  treated as a tax  preference  item  under the  alternative
minimum tax. All tax-exempt  income  results in an indirect tax preference  item
for  corporations,  which  may  subject  an  investor  to  liability  under  the
alternative  minimum  tax  depending  on its  particular  situation.  This Fund,
however,  will not  invest  more than 20% of its net assets in  obligations  the
interest  from which  gives  rise to a  preference  item for the  purpose of the
alternative  minimum tax and in other investments subject to Federal income tax.
Distributions from this Fund may be subject to state and local taxes.           

P-->49712th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�12th
      Municipal  obligations,  other than municipal  notes or commercial  paper,
will be  purchased by the  Tax-Exempt  Fund only if backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States,  or if they meet the rating  requirements set forth
below.  Municipal bonds must be rated by at least two NRSROs - generally S&P and
Moody's - in one of the two highest rating  categories  (AAA or AA by S&P or Aaa
or Aa by Moody's),  or where the bond is rated only by one NRSRO - generally S&P
or Moody's - in the single NRSRO's two highest rating  categories  (AAA or AA by
S&P, or Aaa or Aa by Moody's).  Municipal  notes or municipal  commercial  paper
must be rated in the highest  rating  category by at least two NRSROs,  or where
the note or paper is rated only by one NRSRO,  in the highest rating category by
that NRSRO.  If a security is unrated,  the Fund may invest in such  security if
the Adviser  determines,  in an analysis similar to that performed by Moody's or
S&P in rating similar securities and issuers, that the security is comparable to
that eligible for investment by the Fund.                                       

      In order to enhance  the  liquidity,  stability  or quality of a municipal
obligation,  the  Tax-Exempt  Fund may acquire a right to sell an  obligation to
another party at a guaranteed price approximating par value, either on demand or
at specified intervals.  The right to sell may form part of the obligation or be
acquired  separately by the Tax-Exempt  Fund. These rights may be referred to as
demand features, standby commitments or puts, depending on their characteristics
(collectively referred to as "Standby Commitments"),  and may involve letters of
credit or other  credit  support  arrangements  supplied  by domestic or foreign
banks  supporting the other party's  ability to purchase the obligation from the
Tax-Exempt  Fund.  The  Tax-Exempt  Fund will  acquire  these  rights  solely to
facilitate  portfolio  liquidity and does not intend to exercise such rights for
trading  purposes.  In  considering  whether an obligation  meets the Tax-Exempt
Fund's quality standards, the Fund may look to the creditworthiness of the party
providing  the right to sell or to the  quality of the  obligation  itself.  The
acquisition  of a  Standby  Commitment  will not  affect  the  valuation  of the
underlying  obligation  which will continue to be valued in accordance  with the
amortized cost method of valuation (see  "Computation of Net Asset Value").  For
additional  information  concerning  these  rights,  see Statement of Additional
Information under "Investment Objectives and Policies."                         

      From time to time,  on a  temporary  basis  for  defensive  purposes,  the
Tax-Exempt  Fund may also hold 100  percent  of its  assets in cash or invest in
taxable  short  term   investments   ("taxable   investments")   consisting  of:
obligations  of  the  U.S.  Government,   its  agencies  or   instrumentalities;
commercial paper limited to obligations which are rated by at least two NRSROs -
generally S&P and Moody's - in the highest  rating  category (A-1 by S&P and P-1
by Moody's),  or where the obligation is rated only by one NRSRO - generally S&P
or Moody's - in the single NRSRO's  highest rating  category (A-1 by S&P, or P-1
by Moody's);  certificates of deposit of U.S. domestic banks,  including foreign
branches of domestic  banks meeting the criteria  described in the discussion of
the Money Fund; time deposits;  and repurchase agreements with respect to any of
the foregoing with registered  broker-dealers,  registered government securities
dealers or banks meeting the criteria  described in the  discussion of the Money
Fund.                                                                           

OTHER POLICIES RELEVANT TO THE FUNDS 

    The   Trust,   on  behalf  of  each  of  the   Funds,   may  enter  into

P-->49713th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�13th
repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements. (See Appendix A to this
Prospectus for a discussion of these agreements and the risks involved with such
transactions.)  The Funds will  enter into  repurchase  agreements  and  reverse
repurchase  agreements  only  with  banks  which  meet the  criteria  for  banks
discussed  above and with  registered  broker-dealers  or registered  government
securities  dealers which have outstanding either commercial paper or other debt
obligations  rated in the highest  rating  category by at least two NRSROs or by
one NRSRO if such  obligations  are rated by only one NRSRO.  The  Adviser  will
monitor the  creditworthiness  of such  entities in accordance  with  procedures
adopted and  monitored by the  Trustees of the Trust.  The Funds will enter into
repurchase agreements whenever, in the opinion of the Adviser, such transactions
would be advantageous to the Funds.  Repurchase agreements afford an opportunity
for the Funds to earn a return on  temporarily  available  cash.  The Funds will
enter into reverse repurchase agreements only for the purpose of obtaining funds
necessary for meeting  redemption  requests of shareholders.  Interest earned by
the Funds on  repurchase  agreements  would not be  tax-exempt,  and thus  would
constitute taxable income.                                                      

      The Money Reserve Fund may purchase loan participation interests in all or
part of specific holdings of corporate debt obligations. The issuer of such debt
obligations  is also the issuer of the loan  participation  interests into which
the obligations have been apportioned. The Money Reserve Fund will purchase only
loan  participation  interests  issued by companies  whose  commercial  paper is
currently rated, as determined by the investment  adviser, in the highest rating
category by at least two NRSROs, generally S&P and Moody's (A-1 by S&P or P-1 by
Moody's),  or where such  instrument  is rated only by S&P or Moody's and not by
any other NRSRO,  such  instrument is rated A-1 or P-1. Such loan  participation
interests  will only be  purchased  from banks which meet the criteria for banks
discussed  above  and  registered   broker-dealers   or  registered   government
securities  dealers  which have  outstanding  either  commercial  paper or other
short-term debt obligations rated in the highest rating category by at least two
NRSROs or by one NRSRO if such obligation is rated by only one NRSRO. Such banks
and security dealers are not guarantors of the debt  obligations  represented by
the  loan  participation  interests,  and  therefore  are  not  responsible  for
satisfying  such debt  obligations in the event of default.  Additionally,  such
banks  and  securities  dealers  act  merely  as  facilitators,  with  regard to
repayment by the issuer,  with no authority to direct or control repayment.  The
Money  Reserve  Fund will  attempt to ensure  that there is a readily  available
market for all of the loan  participation  interests.  The Money Reserve  Fund's
investments  in loan  participation  interests  for which there is not a readily
available market are considered to be investments in illiquid securities.       

      Each Fund has  adopted an  investment  policy that  prohibits  each of the
Funds  from  having  more  than 10% of its total  assets  invested  in  illiquid
securities (including restricted  securities,  repurchase agreements maturing in
more than seven days,  time deposits  without  demand  features  having a stated
maturity  greater  than seven  days,  and  participation  interests  and funding
agreements  without demand features,  for which there is not a readily available
market).                                                                        

      The Money Fund, but not the Tax-Exempt Fund, may maintain time deposits in
and invest in U.S. dollar denominated  certificates of deposit issued by foreign
banks and foreign branches of U.S. banks.                                       

P-->49714th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�14th
The  Fund  limits  investments  in  foreign  bank  obligations  to  U.S.  dollar
denominated  obligations  of foreign  banks  which have more than $10 billion in
assets,  have  branches  or  agencies  in the  U.S.,  and  meet  other  criteria
established by the board of trustees.  Investments in foreign securities involve
special  considerations.  There is generally less publicly available information
about  foreign  issuers  since  many  foreign  countries  do not  have  the same
disclosure  and  reporting  requirements  as are imposed by the U.S.  securities
laws.  Moreover,  foreign issuers are generally not bound by uniform  accounting
and auditing and  financial  reporting  requirements  and  standards of practice
comparable to those  applicable to domestic  issuers.  Such investments may also
entail the risks of possible imposition of dividend  withholding or confiscatory
taxes,  possible  currency  blockage  or transfer  restrictions,  expropriation,
nationalization  or other adverse  political or economic  developments,  and the
difficulty of enforcing obligations in other countries.                         

      The Money Fund may also invest in bankers' acceptances,  time deposits and
certificates of deposit of U.S.  branches of foreign banks and foreign  branches
of U.S. banks. Investments in instruments of U.S. branches of foreign banks will
be made only with  branches  that are  subject to the same  regulations  as U.S.
banks. Investments in instruments issued by a foreign branch of a U.S. bank will
be made only if the investment  risk associated with such investment is the same
as that involving an investment in instruments  issued by the U.S. parent,  with
the U.S.  parent  unconditionally  liable in the event that the  foreign  branch
failed to pay on the investment for any reason.                                 

      Each Fund may purchase  securities on a "when-issued"  basis, with payment
and delivery to be made at a later date,  generally  within one month, but in no
event later than 45 days.  The price and yield are normally fixed on the date of
the purchase  commitment,  and the value of the security is thereafter reflected
in the applicable Fund's net asset value computations. During the period between
purchase and settlement,  no payment is made by the Fund and no interest accrues
to the Fund. At the time of settlement,  the market value of the security may be
more or less than the purchase price.  Each Fund will maintain,  at all times, a
segregated  account holding cash or liquid debt securities in an amount equal to
the aggregate amount due on settlement date for all "when-issued"  transactions.
Any  securities in such  segregated  account will be marked to market on a daily
basis. Such segregated  securities either will mature or, if necessary,  be sold
on or before the  settlement  date.  The Funds will not invest  more than 10% of
their respective assets in "when issued" securities.                            

      The Money Fund may also  invest in funding  agreements  issued by domestic
insurance  companies.  Such  funding  agreements  will  only be  purchased  from
insurance companies which have outstanding an issue of long-term debt securities
rated AAA or AA by S&P,  or Aaa or Aa by  Moody's.  In all cases,  the Fund will
attempt to obtain  the right to demand  payment,  on not more than  seven  days'
notice, for all or any part of the amount subject to the funding agreement, plus
accrued  interest.  The Fund intends to execute its right to demand payment only
as needed to  provide  liquidity  to meet  redemptions,  or to  maintain  a high
quality investment portfolio.  The Fund's investments in funding agreements that
do not have this demand feature,  or for which there is not a readily  available
market, are considered to be investments in illiquid securities.                

P-->49715th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�15th
      Diversification. Since the Trust is a diversified investment company under
the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,  it must have at least 75% of the value of
the total  assets of each Fund  represented  by a  combination  of cash and cash
items, government securities, securities of other investment companies and other
securities  which represent,  in the case of any one issuer,  no more than 5% of
the value of each Fund's  total  assets.  Moreover,  since the Trust  values its
portfolio   securities  under  the  amortized  cost  valuation   method,   these
diversification  requirements  are applied to 100% of the Money  Reserve  Fund's
total assets for all securities  purchased after June 1, 1991. The Trust may not
change from a diversified to a  non-diversified  investment  company without the
approval of a majority of each affected Fund's  outstanding  voting  securities,
with "majority" defined as described under "Investment Restrictions."

Portfolio Securities Loans. The Trust, on behalf of each of the Funds, may
lend  limited  amounts  of its  portfolio  securities  (not to  exceed  20% of a
particular  Fund's  total  assets)  to  broker-dealers  or  other  institutional
investors.  While there may be delays in recovery of loaned securities or even a
loss of rights in collateral should the borrower fail financially, loans will be
made only to firms deemed by the Adviser to be of good  standing and will not be
made unless, in the judgment of the Adviser, the consideration to be earned from
such  loans  would   justify   the  risk.   The  Adviser   will   evaluate   the
creditworthiness  of such borrowers in accordance  with  procedures  adopted and
monitored by the Trustees of the Trust. It is expected that the Trust, on behalf
of the applicable  Fund, will use the cash portions of loan collateral to invest
in short-term  income  producing  securities for the Fund's account and that the
Trust may share some of the income from these investments with the borrower. See
"Portfolio Securities Loans" at Appendix A to this Prospectus.                  

     For  an  additional  discussion  of  each  Fund's  fundamental   investment
policies, see "Investment Restrictions."                                        

      General. No assurance is or can be given that any Fund will accomplish its
investment  objective,   as  there  is  some  degree  of  uncertainty  in  every
investment.  An increase in interest  rates will  generally  reduce the value of
portfolio  investments  in the  Funds,  and a decline  in  interest  rates  will
generally increase the value of each Fund's portfolio investments.              

INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS 

      The  Trust,  on behalf of each of the Funds,  has  adopted  the  following
investment  restrictions,  all of which are fundamental  policies and may not be
changed  without  the  approval  of the  holders  of a majority  of the  Trust's
outstanding voting securities, or if the policy relates only to a specific Fund,
that Fund's outstanding voting securities (which in this Prospectus means, as to
the Trust or each  Fund (as  applicable),  the vote of the  lesser of (i) 67% or
more of the voting securities present at a meeting,  if the holders of more than
50% of the outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy, or
(ii) more than 50% of the outstanding voting  securities).  The Trust, on behalf
of each of the Funds, may not:                                                  

(1)   Invest in the securities of issuers  (excluding (i) municipal  obligations
      for the Tax-Exempt Fund only, (ii) bankers' acceptances, time deposits and
certificates of deposit of                                          

P-->49716th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�16th
      domestic  branches  of U.S.  banks and,  as to the Money  Fund only,  U.S.
      branches of foreign  banks and foreign  branches of U.S.  banks,  provided
      that the U.S. branches are subject to sufficient  regulation by government
      bodies that they can be considered U.S. banks,  and the obligations of the
      foreign branches qualify as unconditional  obligations of the U.S. parent,
      and (iii) U.S. Government obligations) conducting their principal business
      activity in the same industry,  if immediately  after such  investment the
      value of a Fund's investments in such industry would represent 25% or more
      of the value of such  Fund's  total  assets.  It should be noted that from
      time to time, the Tax-Exempt Fund may invest more than 25% of the value of
      its total assets in industrial development bonds which, although issued by
      industrial development  authorities,  may be backed only by the assets and
      revenues of the  non-governmental  users.  The Tax-Exempt  Fund may invest
      more than 25% of the value of its total  assets in  municipal  obligations
      which are  related in such a way that an economic  business  or  political
      development  or change  affecting  one such security also would affect the
      other securities; for example,  securities the interest upon which is paid
      from  revenues of similar types of projects,  or securities  whose issuers
are located in the same state.                                      

(2)   As to 75% of the assets of the Tax-Exempt  Fund, and 100% of the assets of
      the Money Reserve Fund, invest in the securities of any one issuer,  other
      than U.S.  Government  obligations,  if immediately  after such investment
      more than 5% of the value of a Fund's total assets, taken at market value,
would be invested in such issuer.                                   

(3)   Underwrite  securities  of  other  issuers,   except  insofar  as  it  may
      technically be deemed an  "underwriter"  under the Securities Act of 1933,
      as amended,  in  connection  with the  disposition  of a Fund's  portfolio
securities.                                                         

(4)   Invest  in  companies   for  the  purpose  of   exercising   control  or  
management.                                                         

(5)   Issue  any  class  of  senior   securities  or  borrow   money,   except  
    borrowings   from  banks  for   temporary  or  emergency   purposes  not
    in  excess  of  10%  of  the  value  of  a  Fund's   net   assets   (not
    including   the   amount   borrowed)   at  the   time   the   money   is
    borrowed.   The  Funds  are   permitted   to  borrow   money   only  for
    the    purpose   of   meeting    redemption    requests    which   might
    otherwise    require   the   untimely    disposition    of   securities.
    Borrowing  is  allowed  as  long  as  the  cost  of  borrowing  is  less
    than  the  income  which  would  be  lost  should   securities  be  sold
    to  meet  the  redemption   requests.   While  in  a  borrowed  position
    (including   reverse   repurchase   agreements),   the   Funds  may  not
    make   purchases   of    securities.    The   Funds   may   enter   into
    reverse    repurchase    agreements    only   for   the    purpose    of
obtaining funds necessary for meeting redemption requests.          

(6)   Mortgage,  pledge,  hypothecate or in any manner  transfer as security for
      indebtedness  any securities owned or held except to secure funds borrowed
      and then  only to an  extent  not  greater  than  10% of the  value of the
applicable Fund's total assets.                                     

(7)   Make short sales of securities or maintain a short position.              

P-->49717th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�17th
(8)   Purchase  securities  on  margin,  except  that a  Fund  may  obtain  such
      short-term  credit as may be necessary  for the clearance of purchases and
sales of portfolio securities.                                      

(9)   Purchase or sell real estate or interests in real estate.                 

(10)  Purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts.                      

(11)  Make  loans to other  persons,  provided  that a Fund  may  purchase  debt
      obligations  consistent with its investment  objectives and policies,  may
      lend  limited  amounts  (not to  exceed  20% of its total  assets)  of its
      portfolio  securities to broker-dealers or other institutional  investors,
and may enter into repurchase agreements.                           

(12)  Purchase   securities   of  other   investment   companies   except  (i)  
    in   connection   with   a   merger,   consolidation,   acquisition   or
    reorganization,   or  (ii)  by   purchase   in  the   open   market   of
    securities   of   open-end    investment    companies   involving   only
    customary    brokers'    commissions    and    only    if    immediately
    thereafter  (i)  no  more  than  3% of  the  voting  securities  of  any
    one  investment  company  are  owned  by  a  Fund,  (ii)  no  more  than
    5%  of  the   value   of  the   total   assets   of  a  Fund   would  be
    invested  in  any  one  investment  company,  and  (iii)  no  more  than
    10%  of  the   value  of  the   total   assets   of  a  Fund   would  be
    invested   in   the   securities   of   such    investment    companies.
    Subject  to  these   conditions,   the  Funds   intend  to  invest  only
    in  no-load   money   market   funds  not  advised  by  the  Adviser  or
    any   company    affiliated    with   the   adviser   which   meet   the
    requirements    of   Rule    2a-7   and   which   do   not   incur   any
    distribution   expenses.    Investors   in   the   Funds   should   note
    that  such  no-load   money  market  funds  will  pay  an  advisory  fee
and incur other operational expenses.                               

(13)  Enter   into   repurchase   agreements   if   more   than   10%  of  the  
    applicable   Fund's  net  assets   will  be   invested   in   repurchase
    agreements    and   in    participation    interests    without   demand
    features,   time  deposits  having  a  stated   maturity   greater  than
    seven    days,     securities     having     legal    or     contractual
    restrictions   on   resale,   securities   for   which   there   is   no
    readily   available   market,   or   in   other   illiquid   securities.
    The   term   "illiquid   securities"   includes   any   security   which
    cannot  be  disposed  of  promptly  and  in  the   ordinary   course  of
    business    without    taking   a   reduced   price.   A   security   is
    considered   illiquid   if  a  Fund   cannot   receive   the  amount  at
which it values the instrument within seven days.                   

      Additional  investment  restrictions adopted by the Trust on behalf of the
Funds and which may be changed by the Trustees at their discretion  provide that
the Trust, on behalf of each of the Funds, may not:                             

(1)   Write,   purchase   or  sell   puts,   calls,   straddles,   spreads  or  
    combinations    thereof.    However,    in   order   to   enhance    the
    liquidity  of  a  municipal   obligation,   the   Tax-Exempt   Fund  may
    acquire   Standby   Commitments.    See   "Investment   Objectives   and
Policies."                                                          

(2)   Purchase  or sell  interests  in  oil,  gas or  other  mineral  leases  or
      exploration or development programs. A Fund, however, may purchase or sell
securities issued by entities which invest in such interests.

(3)   Invest more than 5% of a Fund's  total assets in  securities  of companies
      having a record,  together with predecessors,  of less than three years of
continuous operation.                                               

(4)   Purchase or sell warrants.                                                

(5)   Purchase or retain the securities of any issuer if any individual officers
      and  trustees/directors  of the  Trust,  the  Adviser,  or any  subsidiary
      thereof owns  individually more than 0.5% of the securities of that issuer
      and if all such officers and trustees/directors  together own more than 5%
of the securities of that issuer.                                   

(6)   Engage in arbitrage transactions.                                         

THE INVESTMENT ADVISER 

      The investment adviser to the Trust is INVESCO Capital Management, Inc., a
Delaware  corporation  (sometimes  referred  to as the  "Adviser"),  having  its
principal office at 1315 Peachtree  Street,  N.E.,  Atlanta,  Georgia 30309. The
Adviser is an indirect  subsidiary  of INVESCO  PLC, an English  public  limited
company which is a global investment  manager.  The Adviser also has an advisory
office in Coral Gables, Florida and a marketing and client service office in San
Francisco.                                                                      

      The Adviser is the sponsor and will provide general  investment advice and
portfolio  management to the Trust and the Funds. The Adviser  currently manages
in excess of $28.0 billion of assets for its  customers,  and it believes it has
one of the nation's  largest  discretionary  portfolios of  tax-exempt  accounts
(such as pension and  profit-sharing  funds for corporations and state and local
governments).  In  addition,  the  Adviser  furnishes  investment  advice to the
following other  investment  companies:  INVESCO Value Trust,  INVESCO  Variable
Investment Funds, Inc.-Total Return Portfolio,  The Target Portfolio Trust-Large
Capitalization  Value  Portfolio,  The  Chaconia  Growth and Income Fund and EBI
Funds, Inc. The Adviser furnishes investment advice to a total of six investment
companies,  consisting  of 17  different  portfolios.  Certain  customers of the
Adviser may have similar  investment  objectives to those of  particular  mutual
funds.  Portfolios  are  supervised  by  investment  managers  who  utilize  the
Adviser's  facilities  for investment  research and analysis,  review of current
economic  conditions  and trends,  and  consideration  of long-range  investment
policy matters.                                                                 

      Under its Investment  Advisory Agreement (the "Agreement") with the Trust,
the Adviser,  subject to the  supervision  of the Trustees of the Trust,  and in
conformance  with each  Fund's  stated  policies,  is to manage  the  investment
operations  and  portfolios  of the  Funds.  In  this  regard,  it  will  be the
responsibility  of the Adviser  not only to make  investment  decisions  for the
Funds,  but  also to  place  the  purchase  and sale  orders  for the  portfolio
transactions  of the Funds.  (See  Statement  of  Additional  Information  under
"Brokerage and Portfolio  Transactions.")  The Adviser is also  responsible  for
furnishing  to the Trust,  at the  Adviser's  expense,  the  services of persons
believed to be  competent  to perform  all  executive  and other  administrative
functions required by the Trust to conduct its business effectively,  as well as
the offices,  equipment and other facilities necessary for its operations.  Such
functions  include the maintenance of the Trust's accounts and records,  and the
preparation of all requisite corporate documents such as tax returns and reports
to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and shareholders.             

P-->49719th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�19th
      Under the Agreement,  the Adviser is responsible for the payment of all of
the Funds' expenses,  other than payment of advisory fees, taxes,  interests and
brokerage commissions. Such expenses include, without limitation, organizational
expenses,  compensation of officers,  trustees and employees, legal and auditing
expenses, the fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian and transfer agent, and
the expenses of printing and mailing reports and notices to Trust  shareholders.
For the  services to be rendered  and the  expenses to be assumed by the Adviser
under the  Agreement,  the Trust will pay to the Adviser an  advisory  fee which
will be computed daily and paid as of the last day of each month on the basis of
each Fund's daily net asset  value,  using for each daily  calculation  the most
recently determined net asset value of the Funds. (See "Computation of Net Asset
Value.")  On an annual  basis,  the  advisory  fee paid by each Fund is equal to
0.25% of the average daily net asset value of the applicable  Fund's net assets.
For additional information concerning the Agreement, see Statement of Additional
Information under "The Advisory Agreement."                                     

      The following  individual serves as portfolio manager for the Funds and is
primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolios:   

Money Market Reserve Fund and                                                   
Tax-Exempt Reserve Fund                                                         

George S. Robinson              Portfolio    manager   of   the   Money   Market
                                Reserve    Fund    and    Tax-Exempt     Reserve
                                Fund    since    1988;    formerly    (1986   to
                                1987)     Vice     President     of     Citicorp
                                Investment      Bank;      began      investment
career in 1965. 

THE DISTRIBUTOR 

      INVESCO Services,  Inc., the Trust's  distributor (the  "Distributor"),  a
Georgia corporation,  is the principal underwriter and distributor of the shares
of the Funds under a Distribution  Agreement  dated as of December 30, 1988. All
of the  Distributor's  outstanding  shares  of  voting  stock  are  owned by the
Adviser.  The Distributor is also the sponsor of, investment  adviser to and the
principal  underwriter for one investment  company consisting of six portfolios.
The  Distributor  acts as agent upon the receipt of orders from  investors.  The
Distributor's  principal  office is  located  at 1315  Peachtree  Street,  N.E.,
Atlanta, Georgia 30309.                                                         

COMPUTATION OF NET ASSET VALUE 

      The net asset value per share of each of the Funds is determined  daily as
of 11:30 a.m.  (New York time) on each day that the New York Stock  Exchange  is
open for trading  and at such other times  and/or on such other days as there is
sufficient  trading in the  portfolio  securities  of the Fund such that its net
asset  value  might  be  affected  materially.  Net  asset  value  per  share is
determined by adding the value of all assets of each Fund,  deducting its actual
and accrued liabilities, and dividing by the number of shares outstanding.      

      Each Fund seeks to maintain a constant  net asset value of $1.00 per share
by utilizing the amortized cost method of valuing portfolio  securities.        

P-->49720th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
There can be no  assurance  that the Funds  will be able to  maintain a net     
asset value of $1.00 per share.  Under the  amortized  cost method of valuation,
securities are valued at cost on the date of purchase.  Thereafter, the value of
the  security  is  increased  or  decreased  incrementally  each  day so that at
maturity any purchase  discount or premium is fully  amortized  and the value of
the  security  is equal to its  principal.  As a result  of minor  shifts in the
market value of a Fund's  portfolio  securities,  the amortized  cost method may
result in periods during which the amortized cost value of the securities may be
higher or lower than their  market  value.  This would  result in the yield on a
shareholder's  investment  being  higher  or  lower  than  that  which  would be
recognized if the net asset value of a Fund's portfolio was not constant and was
permitted to fluctuate with the market value of its portfolio securities.  It is
believed that any such differences will normally be minimal.                    

CAPITALIZATION 

      There are no conversion or preemptive rights in connection with any shares
of the Funds, nor are there cumulative  voting rights with respect to the shares
of any such Fund. Each issued and outstanding  share of each Fund is entitled to
participate  equally in dividends and  distributions  declared by such Fund, and
upon liquidation or dissolution,  in the net assets of such Fund remaining after
satisfaction  of  outstanding  liabilities.  The  Trust's  Declaration  of Trust
provides  that  the  obligations  and  liabilities  of  a  particular  Fund  are
restricted  to the  assets of that Fund and do not  extend to the  assets of the
Trust generally.                                                                

      All  issued  and  outstanding  shares of each Fund will be fully  paid and
nonassessable  and  redeemable  at net asset  value per share.  The  issuance of
certificates  representing  shares  of the  Trust  is at the  discretion  of the
Trustees.                                                                       

DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAX INFORMATION 

Distributions                                                                   

      The  net  income  of each of the  Funds  is  declared  daily.  The  Funds'
dividends and net realized capital gains, if any, will be reinvested  monthly in
additional  shares (or fractions  thereof) of each  applicable  Fund pursuant to
each Fund's Automatic  Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan. Such reinvestment will take
place on the last  business  day of each month.  Each  shareholder  may elect to
terminate his  participation  in such plan and to receive his  distributions  in
cash.  Shareholders  who redeem all of their shares at any time during the month
will be paid all dividends accrued through the date of redemption.  Shareholders
who  redeem  less  than all of their  shares  will be paid the  proceeds  of the
redemption in cash,  and dividends  with respect to the redeemed  shares will be
reinvested  in  additional  shares  (unless the  shareholder  has elected not to
participate  in this plan or has elected to terminate his  participation  in the
plan). (See "Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan.")                            

Federal Taxes                                                                   

      Each Fund  intends to continue  to qualify  for the special tax  treatment
afforded  regulated  investment  companies  under  Subchapter  M of the Internal
Revenue  Code,  as amended  (the  "Code").  If a Fund  qualifies  as a regulated
investment company, it will not be subject to federal  income taxes to the      

P-->49721st�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�21st
extent that it distributes  its ordinary  income and net realized capital gains.

      With respect to a shareholder  that is exempt from federal income taxation
under Section  401(a) or 501(a) of the Code,  the  distributions  made by a Fund
will not constitute  unrelated  business  taxable  income (i.e.,  taxable income
derived by a tax-exempt  entity from any unrelated  trade or business  regularly
carried on by it) and thus will not be taxable.  Under Section  512(b)(1) of the
Code, dividends and capital gains are expressly excluded from unrelated business
taxable  income.  Consequently,  a  tax-exempt  shareholder  will not  incur any
federal income tax liability as a result of its participation in a Fund.        

      With  respect to a  shareholder  that is not exempt  from  federal  income
taxation,   all   distributions   from  a  Fund,  except  for  distributions  of
exempt-interest  dividends or return of capital distributions,  whether received
in cash or in additional  shares of a Fund, will be taxable and must be reported
by the  shareholder on its federal income tax return.  Shareholders of the Trust
are advised to consult their own tax advisers with respect to these matters.    

      It  is   intended   that  the   Tax-Exempt   Fund  will   qualify  to  pay
exempt-interest  dividends  pursuant  to  Section  852(b)(5)  of the  Code,  and
shareholders  will be notified in writing of any dividend,  or portion  thereof,
which  represents an  exempt-interest  dividend.  Exempt-interest  dividends are
excludable  from the gross  income  of a  shareholder  for  federal  income  tax
purposes, but may be subject to state and local taxes.                          

      Distributions  of  exempt-interest  dividends  derived  from  interest  on
certain private activity bonds are specifically treated as a tax preference item
and may subject  corporate  shareholders  to, or increase their liability under,
the corporate  alternative  minimum tax and may subject individual  shareholders
to,  or  increase  their  liability  under,  the  alternative  minimum  tax  for
individuals. In addition, because 75% of the difference between adjusted current
earnings and alternative minimum taxable income, all distributions  derived from
interest  which is exempt  from  regular  federal  income  tax are  included  in
adjusted  pre-tax  book income and may  subject  corporate  shareholders  to, or
increase their liability under, the corporate alternative minimum tax.          

      Information  concerning the status of a Fund's  distributions  for federal
income tax purposes will be mailed to shareholders annually. Such distributions,
including capital gains distributions, may be subject to state and local taxes. 

      The  foregoing  is a general  and  abbreviated  summary of the  applicable
provisions  of the Code and Treasury  Regulations  presently  in effect,  and is
qualified in its entirety by reference  thereto.  The Code and these Regulations
are  subject to change by  legislative  or  administrative  action.  For further
discussion of the tax  consequences of becoming a shareholder of the Trust,  see
Statement of Additional Information under "Tax Information." Shareholders should
consult with their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of an investment
in the Funds.                                                                   

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan                                            

  For the convenience of the shareholders and to permit shareholders  to

P-->49722nd�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
increase their shareholdings in the Funds in which they have invested,  the     
Fund's transfer agent, INVESCO Funds Group, Inc., ("INVESCO"),  is automatically
appointed  by  the   investors  to  receive  all  dividends  and  capital  gains
distributions  of the  respective  Funds and to reinvest  them on their  payment
dates in shares (or  fractions  thereof)  of the Fund at the net asset value per
share next determined after reinvestment.                                       

      Shareholders may, however,  elect not to participate or to terminate their
participation at any time without penalty in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment
Plan by  notifying  INVESCO  in  writing  at the  time of  investment  (for  new
investments),  or at least 15 days prior to the desired date of termination (for
existing participants). Shareholders may rejoin the plan by notifying the Fund's
transfer  agent in writing at least 15 days prior to the  payment  date on which
such shareholder wishes to rejoin the plan.                                     

      Upon  termination  of  a  shareholder's  participation  in  the  Automatic
Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan,  a check for the  market  value of any  fractional
interest will, at the request of the  shareholder,  be sent to the  shareholder.
All  costs of the  Automatic  Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan,  including  those of
registration  under  applicable  securities  laws,  if any, will be borne by the
Adviser.                                                                        

HOW TO BUY FUND SHARES 

      Shares  of the  Funds  are sold at the net  asset  value  per  share  next
determined  after the receipt of the  investor's  purchase  order and payment in
"good funds," as described  below.  No sales charge is imposed upon the purchase
of shares.                                                                      

      The  minimum  initial   purchase  of  shares  required  by  the  Trust  is
$1,000,000. Subscribers will be given credit for amounts that they have invested
in any of the Funds.  Subsequent purchases may be made in amounts of $100,000 or
more. The Trustees, acting through the Distributor,  reserve the right to reduce
or to waive  the  minimum  purchase  requirements  in  certain  cases -- such as
investments  involving  investors which are affiliated with one another (such as
separate  employee  benefit  plans  sponsored  by the same  employer or separate
companies  under  common   control,   for  example  a  parent  company  and  its
subsidiaries  or two or more  subsidiaries  of the same parent company) or where
additional  investments  are  expected to be made on a regular  basis in amounts
sufficient to meet the minimum  requirement  within a reasonable  period of time
after the initial investment. The Trustees, acting through the Distributor, also
reserve the right to reject any  subscription in whole or in part for any reason
at the time that the subscription is first received. The Trust offers its shares
on a continuous basis;  however, the Trust may terminate the continuous offering
of its shares at any time in the discretion of the Trustees.                    

      Following receipt by the transfer agent, INVESCO (sometimes referred to as
the "Transfer  Agent"),  of a proper purchase order and good funds ("good funds"
means cashier's, certified, personal or federal funds check or wire transfer, as
described  below),  the  investor  will be credited  with the number of full and
fractional  shares of the stated Fund  purchased with the  subscription  amount.
Checks  must be made  payable  to INVESCO  Treasurer's  Series  Trust,  and must
include the name of the desired Fund.  Purchase orders,  for shares of the Funds
should be forwarded to INVESCO Treasurer's Series Trust, P.O. Box 173710,       

P-->49723rd�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
Denver,  Colorado 80217-3710.  Orders sent by overnight courier,  including     
Express  Mail,  should be sent to the street  address,  not Post  Office Box, of
INVESCO Funds Group,  Inc.,  7800 E. Union Avenue,  Denver,  Colorado 80237.  A
confirmation of the investment will be mailed to the investor.                  

      Additional  purchase  applications  are  available  from the  Distributor.
Investors may call INVESCO  Services,  Inc.,  for  assistance in completing  the
required  application and any other authorization forms. The toll free telephone
number (except for Georgia) is 1-800-241-5477. In Georgia, call 404-892-0896.   

      Investors may also arrange to acquire shares through  broker-dealers other
than the Distributor. Such broker-dealers,  who must be members of the NASD, may
charge investors a reasonable  handling fee. The services to be provided and the
applicable fees are established by each broker-dealer  acting independently from
the Trust. Such broker-dealers have the responsibility of promptly  transferring
investors'  purchase  orders  and funds to the  Transfer  Agent  and  custodian,
respectively.  Shares acquired through such  broker-dealers will be purchased at
the  applicable  Fund's  net asset  value per share  next  determined  after the
receipt by the Fund's  transfer agent of a proper purchase order and good funds.
Neither the  Distributor  nor the Trust  receives any part of such handling fees
when charged and such  handling  fees can be avoided by investing  directly with
the Trust through the Distributor.                                              

Purchase by Wire                                                                

      Investors may purchase shares of the Funds by  transmitting  Federal funds
by bank  wire to  United  Missouri  Bank  of  Kansas  City,  N.A.,  ABA  Routing
#1010-0069-5,  Wire text:  credit to account  9870287056,  FBO INVESCO Funds for
further credit to (Fund name, account # and $ amount),  Treasurer's Money Market
Reserve  Fund  UMB  #740115001,  or  Treasurer's  Tax-Exempt  Reserve  Fund  UMB
#740116009.  Instructions  for new accounts should specify  INVESCO  Treasurer's
Series Trust, the name of the desired Fund and should include the name,  address
and IRS identification  number, if applicable,  of each person in whose name the
shares are to be registered.  Existing shareholders need only to specify INVESCO
Treasurer's  Series Trust,  the name of the desired Fund and applicable  account
number.  The  required  purchase   application  or  additional  shares  purchase
application  should be forwarded to the Distributor  (INVESCO  Services,  Inc.).
Federal  funds  transmitted  by bank wire to the United  Missouri Bank of Kansas
City,  N.A., and received prior to 11:30 a.m. (New York time),  become available
to the Trust and are invested that day.  Federal funds  transmitted by bank wire
and  received  after 11:30 a.m.  (New York time) will be available to and deemed
received  and invested by the Trust on the next  business  day. The Trust is not
responsible for delays in any wire transmission.                                

Exchange Privilege                                                              

      Shareholders  in  either  of  the  Funds  may  exchange  shares  of  their
respective  Fund for  shares of the  other  Fund.  There is no  charge  for such
exchanges. Investors should consider the difference in the investment objectives
and portfolio  compositions of such Funds, and should be aware that the exchange
privilege  may only be available in those states where  exchanges may legally be
made,  which will require that the shares being acquired are registered for sale
in the shareholder's state of residence.                                        

P-->49724th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
      An  exchange  request  may be  given in  writing  or by  telephone  to the
Transfer Agent,  and must comply with the  requirements  for a redemption.  (See
"Redemption  of  Shares.")  If the  exchange  request  is in proper  order,  the
exchange will be based on the respective net asset values of the shares involved
which is next determined  after the request is received.  The exchange of shares
of one of the Funds for shares of another Fund is treated for federal income tax
purposes as a sale of the shares given in exchange and an investor (other than a
tax-exempt investor) may, therefore,  realize a taxable gain or loss. By signing
the  Application  to Purchase  Shares in the Funds,  the  investor has agreed to
release the Funds,  INVESCO, and their affiliates from any and all liability for
acts or omissions done in good faith under the  authorizations  contained in the
application,    including   their   possibly   effecting   fraudulent   exchange
transactions.  The SEC staff  currently  has under review the  propriety of such
releases from  liability for effecting  fraudulent  exchange  transactions.  The
Trust  reserves the right to modify or terminate  the exchange  privilege at any
time.                                                                           

Purchase by Telephone Orders                                                    

      The purchase of shares of the Funds can be expedited by placing  telephone
orders,  subject to the minimum share purchase requirements currently in effect.
Shares purchased  through telephone orders will be issued at the next determined
net asset value after receipt of an investor's telephone instructions. Since the
Funds currently  determine their net asset values at 11:30 a.m. (New York time),
investors  placing  telephone  orders for Fund shares that are received prior to
that time will have shares purchased for their account as of that day. Investors
placing telephone orders that are received after that time will have Fund shares
purchased  for their  accounts as of the next  business  day.  All  payments for
telephone orders must be received by the Funds'  custodian,  the United Missouri
Bank of Kansas City,  N.A., in "federal funds" (defined as a federal funds check
or wire  transfer in proper  form) by the close of business on the  business day
that  shares  are  purchased  for the  investor's  account  or the order will be
cancelled.  In the  event  of  such  cancellation,  the  purchaser  will be held
responsible for any decline in the value of the shares.  INVESCO Services,  Inc.
has  agreed  to  indemnify  the  Funds  for  any  losses   resulting  from  such
cancellations.                                                                  

REDEMPTION OF SHARES 

      A shareholder wishing to redeem all or any portion of his shares may do so
by giving notice of redemption directly to or through any registered  securities
dealer to the  Distributor  or to the  Transfer  Agent,  in the manner set forth
below.  The  redemption  price is the net asset value per share next  determined
after the  initial  receipt  by either the  registered  securities  dealer,  the
Distributor or the Transfer  Agent of proper notice of redemption.  (See "How to
Buy Fund  Shares.")  Each Fund seeks to  maintain a constant  net asset value of
$1.00 per share (see "Computation of Net Asset Value").  Securities dealers have
the  responsibility  of promptly  transmitting  such  redemption  notices to the
Distributor  or the Transfer  Agent.  Such  securities  dealers will only assist
investors in redeeming their shares from the Funds,  since no securities  dealer
is authorized to repurchase such shares on behalf of the Funds.                 

    If a shareholder holds certificates for the shares to be,redeemed, these
must simultaneously be surrendered, properly endorsed  with  signature(s)       

P-->49725th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
guaranteed by a member firm of a domestic stock exchange, a U.S. commercial     
bank, a foreign correspondent of a U.S. commercial bank, or a trust company, and
the certificates must be forwarded to INVESCO Treasurer's Series Trust, P.O. Box
173710,  Denver,  Colorado 80217-3710.  Redemption  requests  sent by overnight
courier,  including Express Mail, should be sent to the street address, not Post
Office Box, of INVESCO Funds Group, Inc., 7800 E. Union Avenue, Denver, Colorado
80237.  The signature on any request for redemption of shares not represented by
certificates,  or on  any  stock  power  in  lieu  thereof,  must  be  similarly
guaranteed.  In each case,  the signature or signatures  must  correspond to the
name or names in which the account is registered.  The signature guarantee is to
prevent fraud and is for the protection of the investor as a shareholder.       

      Shareholders  should be advised that if notice of  redemption  is received
without  information  thereon sufficient to determine the applicable Fund or the
value or number of shares  involved,  no redemption  will be effected until such
information becomes available.                                                  

      If a  redemption  request  is  received  by 11:30  a.m.  (New York  time),
proceeds will normally be wired that day, if requested by the  shareholder,  but
no  dividend  will be earned on the  redeemed  shares on that day.  Proceeds  of
redemption  requests  received after 11:30 a.m. (New York time) will be based on
the net asset  value next  determined  (which is 11:30 a.m. of the next day that
net asset value per share is determined),  will normally be sent on the day such
net asset value per share is  determined,  but in any event  within 7 days,  and
will not earn a dividend for that day . Although  each Fund attempts to maintain
a constant net asset value per share of $1.00,  the value of shares of a Fund on
redemption may be more or less than the shareholder's  cost,  depending upon the
value of the Fund's assets at the time.                                         

Redemption by Check                                                             

      Shareholders in the Funds may redeem shares by check in an amount not less
than $100,000.  At the shareholder's  request, the Fund's custodian will provide
the shareholder with checks drawn on the account  maintained for that purpose on
behalf of the Funds by the  custodian.  These  checks can be made payable to the
order of any person and the payee of the check may cash or deposit  the check in
the same manner as any check drawn on a bank. When such a check is presented for
payment,  the  applicable  Fund  will  redeem a  sufficient  number  of full and
fractional shares in the shareholder's account to cover the amount of the check.
Shareholders  earn  dividends on the amounts being  redeemed by check until such
time as such check  clears the bank.  If the amount of the check is greater than
the value of the shares  held in the  shareholder's  account,  the check will be
returned,  and the  shareholder  may be  subject  to  extra  charges  (presently
estimated  to be  approximately  $15.00 per returned  check).  The Funds and the
custodian  each  reserves  the  right  at any  time  to  suspend  the  procedure
permitting redemption by check.                                                 

Redemption by Telephone                                                         

      Shareholders  of the  Fund  may  elect  to  redeem  shares  of the Fund by
telephone.   Such  redemptions  are  effected  by  calling  the  Distributor  at
404-892-0896 in Georgia or 800-241-5477, outside of Georgia. The proceeds from a
redemption by telephone will promptly be forwarded according to the             

P-->49726th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
shareholder's  instructions.  In electing to use the telephone  redemption, the 
investor  authorizes the Distributor to act on telephone  instructions  from any
person  representing  himself to be the investor,  and whom the  Distributor    
reasonably  believes to be  genuine.  The  Distributor's  and  Transfer  Agent's
records  of  such   instructions  are  binding.   By  signing  the  new  account
Application,  a Telephone Transaction Authorization Form, or otherwise utilizing
telephone exchange privileges,  the investor has agreed that the Funds, INVESCO,
and their affiliates will not be liable for following instructions  communicated
by  telephone  that they  reasonably  believe to be  genuine.  The Funds  employ
procedures,  which  they  believe  are  reasonable,  designed  to  confirm  that
telephone  instructions  are  genuine.  These may  include  recording  telephone
instructions  and providing  written  confirmation of transactions  initiated by
telephone.  As a result of this  policy,  the  investor may bear the risk of any
loss due to unauthorized or fraudulent instructions;  provided, however, that if
a Fund fails to follow  these or other  reasonable  procedures,  the Fund may be
liable.  The proceeds of shares  redeemed by telephone  must be in an amount not
less than $100,000. Investors should be aware that a telephone redemption may be
difficult to implement  during  periods of drastic  economic or market  changes.
Should  redeeming  shareholders  be unable to  implement a telephone  redemption
during such periods,  or at any other time, they may give appropriate  notice of
redemption to the distributor by mail. The Trust reserves the right to modify or
terminate the telephone redemption privilege at any time.                       

General                                                                         

      Shareholders subject to federal income taxation should note that if a loss
has been  realized on the sale of shares of a Fund,  the loss may be  disallowed
for tax purposes if shares of the same Fund are purchased  within 30 days before
or after the sale.                                                              

      Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the date of payment for redeemed
shares may be postponed,  or the Trust's  obligation to redeem its shares may be
suspended (1) for any period during which trading on the New York Stock Exchange
is restricted  (as  determined  by the SEC),  (2) for any period during which an
emergency exists (as determined by the SEC) which makes it impracticable for the
Trust to dispose of its  securities  or to  determine  the value of a Fund's net
assets,  or (3) for such other periods as the SEC may, by order,  permit for the
protection of shareholders.                                                     

      If the  Trustees  determine  that it is in the best  interest of a Fund, a
Fund has the right to redeem upon prior written notice,  at the then current net
asset value per share,  all  shareholder  accounts  which have  dropped  below a
minimum level ($500,000 or less) as a result of redemption of such Fund's shares
(but not as a result  of any  reduction  in  market  value of such  shares).  An
investor  will have 60 days to increase the shares in his account to the minimum
level in order to avoid any such involuntary redemption.                        

SHAREHOLDER REPORTS 

      The Trust  will issue to each of the Fund's  shareholders  semiannual  and
annual reports containing each Fund's financial  statements,  including selected
per share data and ratios and a schedule of each Fund's portfolio securities.   

P-->49727th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
      The federal  income tax status of shareholder  distributions  will also be
reported to shareholders after the end of each year.                            

      Shareholders having any questions concerning the Trust or any of the Funds
may call the Distributor.  Outside of Georgia, the toll-free telephone number is
1-800-241-5477. In Georgia, the telephone number is 404-892-0896.               

MISCELLANEOUS 

      As a  Massachusetts  business  trust,  the Trust is not  required  to hold
annual  shareholder  meetings.  However,  special  meetings of shareholders  for
action by  shareholder  vote may be called  for  purposes  such as  electing  or
removing trustees, changing fundamental policies, approving an advisory contract
or as may  be  requested  in  writing  by the  holders  of at  least  10% of the
outstanding  shares of the Fund or as may be required by  applicable  law or the
Fund's  Articles  of   Incorporation.   Additionally,   the  Trust  will  assist
shareholders  in  communicating  with  other  shareholders  as  required  by the
Investment  Company Act of 1940.  Each Trust  shareholder  receives one vote for
each share owned.                                                               

      United  Missouri  Bank  of  Kansas  City,  N.A.  is the  custodian  of the
portfolio  securities and cash of the Funds.  The custodian may use the services
of foreign  sub-custodians.  Such  foreign  sub-custodians  will be  selected in
accordance with the provisions of Rule 17f-5 (or any successor rule) promulgated
under the 1940 Act.                                                             

      The Transfer Agent will maintain each  shareholder's  account,  as to each
Fund,  and furnish the  shareholder  with  written  information  concerning  all
transactions in the account,  including  information needed for tax records. The
Trust has the right to appoint a successor  Transfer Agent.  INVESCO also serves
as the Dividend  Disbursement and Reinvestment Agent and Redemption Agent of the
Funds.  INVESCO does not perform any  investment  management  functions  for the
Trust, but performs certain administrative services on its behalf pursuant to an
Administrative  Service Agreement (see information  below). The Adviser pays the
Transfer Agent an annual fee of $50.00 per shareholder account, per Fund, with a
minimum  annual fee of $5,000 per Fund.  For the fiscal years ended December 31,
1994, 1993, and 1992, the Trust's Funds paid no transfer agency fees to INVESCO,
as those  expenses  were  absorbed  and  paid by the  Adviser,  pursuant  to its
Advisory Agreement with the Trust. The principal address of INVESCO is 7800 East
Union Avenue, Denver, Colorado 80237.                                           

      The Declaration of Trust pursuant to which the Trust is organized contains
an express  disclaimer of  shareholder  liability for acts or obligations of the
Trust and requires that notice of such  disclaimer  be given in each  instrument
entered into or executed by the Trust.  The  Declaration  of Trust also provides
for  indemnification  out of the  Trust's  property  for  any  shareholder  held
personally  liable for any Trust  obligation.  Thus,  the risk of a  shareholder
being personally  liable as a partner for obligations of the Trust is limited to
the unlikely  circumstance in which the Trust itself would be unable to meet its
obligations.                                                                    

      The Trust has  entered  into an  Administrative  Services  Agreement  (the
"Administrative  Agreement"),  dated as of January 23, 1991, with INVESCO, which
was approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees,  including all of the independent
trustees, on January 22, 1991.  Pursuant to the  Administrative  Agreement,     

P-->49728th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
INVESCO  will  perform  certain   administrative  and  internal  accounting     
services, including, without limitation,  maintaining general ledger and capital
stock  accounts,  preparing a daily trial balance,  calculating  net asset value
daily,  and providing  selected general ledger reports.  For such services,  the
Adviser pays  INVESCO a fee  consisting  of a base fee of $10,000 per year,  per
Fund, plus an additional  incremental fee per Fund computed at an annual rate of
0.015% per annum of the net asset value of the  applicable  Fund. For the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1994, the Funds paid no administrative  services fees to
INVESCO,  as those  expenses were absorbed and paid by the Adviser,  pursuant to
its Advisory Agreement with the Trust.                                          

      This Prospectus  omits certain  information  contained in the registration
statement which the Trust has filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission
under the  Securities  Act of 1933 and the  Investment  Company Act of 1940, and
reference is made to that registration statement and to the exhibits thereto for
further  information  with respect to the Trust and the shares  offered  hereby.
Copies of such registration statement,  including exhibits, may be obtained from
the Commission's  principal office at Washington,  D.C., upon payment of the fee
prescribed by the Commission.                                                   

LEGAL OPINIONS 

      The legality of the securities  offered by this  Prospectus will be passed
upon for the Trust by Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, 1800 M Street NW, Washington, D.C.
20036.

APPENDIX A 

      Some of the terms  used in the  Prospectus  and  Statement  of  Additional
Information are described below.                                                

      Bank  obligations  include  certificates  of deposit which are  negotiable
certificates  evidencing the  indebtedness  of a commercial  bank to repay funds
deposited  with it for a definite  period of time  (usually  from 14 days to one
year) at a stated interest rate.                                                

      Bankers' acceptances are credit instruments evidencing the obligation of a
bank to pay a draft which has been drawn on it by a customer.  These instruments
reflect the obligation both of the bank and of the drawer to pay the face amount
of the instrument upon maturity.                                                

      Bond  Anticipation  Notes normally are issued to provide interim financing
until long-term financing can be arranged.  The long-term bonds then provide the
money for the repayment of the Notes.                                           

      Bonds:  Municipal  Bonds may be issued to raise money for  various  public
purposes  -- like  constructing  public  facilities  and making  loans to public
institutions.  Certain types of municipal bonds,  such as certain project notes,
are backed by the full faith and credit of the United  States.  Certain types of
municipal bonds are issued to obtain funding for privately operated  facilities.
The two principal  classifications  of municipal bonds are "general  obligation"
and "revenue" bonds.  General obligation bonds are backed by the taxing power of
the issuing  municipality  and are considered the safest type of municipal bond.
Issuers of general obligation bonds include states, counties,  cities, towns and
regional  districts.  The proceeds of these  obligations are used to fund a wide
range of public projects  including the  construction or improvement of schools,
highways  and  roads,  water and sewer  systems  and a variety  of other  public
purposes.  The basic security of general obligation bonds is the issuer's pledge
of its  faith,  credit,  and  taxing  power for the  payment  of  principal  and
interest. Revenue bonds are backed by the net revenues derived from a particular
facility or group of facilities of a  municipality  or, in some cases,  from the
proceeds of a special  excise or other  specific  revenue  source.  Although the
principal  security  behind these bonds varies widely,  many provide  additional
security in the form of a debt  service  reserve  fund whose  monies may also be
used to make  principal  and  interest  payments  on the  issuer's  obligations.
Industrial  development revenue bonds are a specific type of revenue bond backed
by the credit and security of a private user and therefore  investments in these
bonds  have  more  potential  risk.   Although  nominally  issued  by  municipal
authorities,  industrial  development revenue bonds are generally not secured by
the taxing  power of the  municipality  but are  secured by the  revenues of the
authority derived from payments by the industrial user.                         

      Commercial  paper  consists  of  short-term  (usually  one  to  180  days)
unsecured  promissory  notes issued by  corporations  in order to finance  their
current operations.                                                             

      Corporate debt  obligations are bonds and notes issued by corporations and
other business  organizations,  including  business trusts,  in order to finance
their long-term credit needs.                                                   

Money Market refers to the marketplace composed of the financial    
institutions which handle the purchase and sale of liquid, short-term, high-    

P-->49730th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
grade  debt  instruments.  The  money  market is not a single  entity,  but     
consists of numerous separate  markets,  each of which deals in a different type
of  short-term  debt  instrument.  These  include  U.S.  Government  securities,
commercial paper,  certificates of deposit and bankers'  acceptances,  which are
generally referred to as money market instruments.                              

Portfolio Securities Loans: The Trust, on behalf of each of the Funds, may
lend  limited  amounts  of its  portfolio  securities  (not to  exceed  20% of a
particular  Fund's  total  assets)  to  broker-dealers  or  other  institutional
investors.  Management of the Trust  understands  that it is the current view of
the staff of the SEC that the Funds are permitted to engage in loan transactions
only if the following  conditions are met: (1) the applicable  Fund must receive
100% collateral in the form of cash or cash  equivalents,  e.g.,  U.S.  Treasury
bills or notes, from the borrower; (2) the borrower must increase the collateral
whenever the market value of the securities  (determined on a daily basis) rises
above the level of the  collateral;  (3) the Trust must be able to terminate the
loan after notice; (4) the applicable Fund must receive  reasonable  interest on
the loan or a flat fee from the borrower,  as well as amounts  equivalent to any
dividends,  interest or other  distributions  on the  securities  loaned and any
increase  in  market  value;  (5) the  applicable  Fund may pay only  reasonable
custodian fees in connection  with the loan; (6) voting rights on the securities
loaned may pass to the  borrower;  however,  if a material  event  affecting the
investment occurs, the Trust must be able to terminate the loan and vote proxies
or enter into an alternative  arrangement  with the borrower to enable the Trust
to vote proxies.  Excluding  items (1) and (2),  these  practices may be amended
from time to time as regulatory provisions permit.                              

      Repurchase Agreements:  A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which a
Fund purchases a security and simultaneously commits to sell the security to the
seller at an agreed upon price and date (usually not more than seven days) after
the date of  purchase.  The resale price  reflects  the  purchase  price plus an
agreed upon market rate of  interest  which is  unrelated  to the coupon rate or
maturity of the purchased  security.  A Fund's risk is limited to the ability of
the seller to pay the agreed upon amount on the delivery date. In the opinion of
management  this risk is not material;  if the seller  defaults,  the underlying
security  constitutes  collateral  for the  seller's  obligations  to pay.  This
collateral will be held by the custodian for the Trust's assets. However, in the
absence of compelling  legal  precedents in this area, there can be no assurance
that the Trust  will be able to  maintain  its  rights to such  collateral  upon
default  of the  issuer of the  repurchase  agreement.  To the  extent  that the
proceeds from a sale upon a default in the  obligation  to  repurchase  are less
than the repurchase price, the particular Fund would suffer a loss.             

      Revenue  Anticipation  Notes are issued in expectation of receipt of other
kinds of revenue,  such as federal revenues  available under the Federal Revenue
Sharing Program.                                                                

      Reverse  Repurchase  Agreements:  Transactions  where  a Fund  temporarily
transfers possession of a portfolio security to another party, such as a bank or
broker-dealer,  in return  for cash,  and agrees to buy the  security  back at a
future  date and price.  The use of reverse  repurchase  agreements  will create
leverage,  which is speculative.  Reverse  repurchase  agreements are borrowings
subject to the Funds' investment restrictions applicable to that activity.      

P-->49731st�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
The Trust will enter into reverse  repurchase  agreements solely for the purpose
of obtaining  funds  necessary  for meeting  redemption  requests.  The proceeds
received  from a  reverse  repurchase  agreement  will  not be used to  purchase
securities for investment purposes.                                             

      Short-Term  Discount Notes  (tax-exempt  commercial  paper) are promissory
notes issued by  municipalities  to supplement  their cash flow. The ratings A-1
and P-1 are the highest  commercial  paper ratings  assigned by S&P and Moody's,
respectively.                                                                   

      Tax   Anticipation   Notes  are  to  finance   working  capital  needs  of
municipalities  and are issued in anticipation of various seasonal tax revenues,

      Time  deposits  are  non-negotiable   deposits  maintained  in  a  banking
institution  for a  specified  period of time at a stated  interest  rate.  Time
deposits which may be held by the Funds will not benefit from insurance from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.                                          

      U.S.  Government  securities are debt securities  (including bills, notes,
and bonds) issued by the U.S. Treasury or issued by an agency or instrumentality
of the U.S.  Government  which is  established  under the authority of an Act of
Congress.  Such agencies or  instrumentalities  include, but are not limited to,
the  Federal  National  Mortgage   Association,   Government  National  Mortgage
Association,  the Federal  Farm  Credit  Bank,  and the Federal  Home Loan Bank.
Although all obligations of agencies,  authorities and instrumentalities are not
direct obligations of the U.S.  Treasury,  payment of the interest and principal
on these  obligations  is generally  backed  directly or  indirectly by the U.S.
Government. This support can range from the backing of the full faith and credit
of the United States to U.S.  Treasury  guarantees,  or to the backing solely of
the issuing  instrumentality itself. In the case of securities not backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States,  the investor must look  principally
to the agency issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment, and
may not be able to assert a claim  against the United States itself in the event
the agency or instrumentality does not meet its commitments.                    

Ratings of Municipal and Corporate Debt Obligations                             

      The four highest  ratings of Moody's and  Standard & Poor's for  municipal
and corporate  debt  obligations  are Aaa, Aa, A and Baa and AAA, AA, A and BBB,
respectively.                                                                   

Moody's.  The characteristics of these debt obligations rated       
by Moody's are generally as follows:                                            

      Aaa -- Bonds  which are rated  Aaa are  judged to be of the best  quality.
      They  carry the  smallest  degree  of  investment  risk and are  generally
      referred to as "gilt edge." Interest  payments are protected by a large or
      by an  exceptionally  stable  margin and  principal  is secure.  While the
      various protective  elements are likely to change,  such changes as can be
      visualized are most unlikely to impair the  fundamentally  strong position
of such issues.                                                     

     Aa -- Bonds  which are rated Aa are  judged  to be of high  quality  by all
 standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally
known as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds   

P-->49732nd�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
     because  margins of protection  may not be as large as in Aaa securities or
   fluctuation of protective  elements may be of greater  amplitude or there
may be other elements  present which make the long-term  risks appear 
  somewhat  larger than in Aaa securities.  Moody's  applies the numerical
  modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to the Aa rating  classification.  The  modifier  1
  indicates  a  ranking  for the security in the higher end of this rating
     category;  the modifier 2 indicates a mid- range  ranking; and the modifier
3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of this rating category.       

      A -- Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment  attributes
      and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors giving
      security to principal  and interest are  considered  adequate but elements
      may be present which suggest a  susceptibility  to impairment  sometime in
the future.                                                         

      Baa  --  Bonds  which  are  rated  Baa  are  considered  as  medium  grade
      obligations,  i.e., they are neither highly  protected nor poorly secured.
      Interest  payments and principal  security appear adequate for the present
      but   certain   protective   elements   may   be   lacking   or   may   be
      characteristically  unreliable  over any great length of time.  Such bonds
      lack outstanding  investment  characteristics and in fact have speculative
characteristics as well.                                            

      Moody's ratings for state and municipal notes and other  short-term  loans
are  designated  Moody's  Investment  Grade  ("MIG").  This  distinction  is  in
recognition of the difference  between short-term credit and long-term credit. A
short-term rating may also be assigned on an issue having a demand feature. Such
ratings  are  designated  as VMIG.  Short-term  ratings  on issues  with  demand
features  are  differentiated  by the use of the VMIG  symbol  to  reflect  such
characteristics  as payment  upon demand  rather than fixed  maturity  dates and
payment relying on external liquidity.                                          

      MIG 1/VMIG 1 -- Notes and loans bearing this  designation  are of the best
      quality,  enjoying strong  protection from established cash flows of funds
      for their  servicing or from  established  and  broad-based  access to the
market for refinancing, or both.                                    

      MIG  2/VMIG 2 -- Notes  and loans  bearing  this  designation  are of high
      quality,  with margins of protection ample although not so large as in the
preceding group.                                                    

      Standard & Poor's. The  characteristics of these debt obligations rated by
Standard & Poor's Ratings Group are generally as follows:                       

      AAA -- This is the highest rating  assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt
      obligation and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay principal and
interest.                                                           

      AA -- Bonds  rated  AA also  qualify  as high  quality  debt  obligations.
      Capacity to pay principal and interest is very strong, and in the majority
of instances they differ from AAA issues only in small degree.      

      A --  Debt  rated  A has a  strong  capacity  to pay  interest  and  repay
     principal although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects

P-->49733rd�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
      of changes in  circumstances  and economic  conditions than debt in higher
rated categories.                                                   

      BBB -- Debt rated BBB is regarded  as having an  adequate  capacity to pay
      interest  and repay  principal.  Whereas  it  normally  exhibits  adequate
      protection   parameters,   adverse   economic   conditions   or   changing
      circumstances  are  more  likely  to lead to a  weakened  capacity  to pay
      interest  and repay  principal  for debt in this  category  than in higher
rated categories.                                                   

Standard & Poor's ratings for short-term notes are as follows:      

SP-1 -- Very strong capacity to pay principal and interest.         

SP-2 -- Satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest.        

SP-3 -- Speculative capacity to pay principal and interest.         

      A  debt  rating  is not a  recommendation  to  purchase,  sell  or  hold a
security,  inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or suitability for
a particular investor.                                                          

Ratings of Commercial Paper                                                     

      Description  of  Moody's  commercial  paper  ratings.  Among  the  factors
considered by Moody's  Investors  Services,  Inc. in assigning  commercial paper
ratings are the following:  (1) evaluation of the management of the issuer;  (2)
economic  evaluation of the issuer's  industry or industries and an appraisal of
the risks which may be inherent in certain areas; (3) evaluation of the issuer's
products in relation to competition and customer acceptance;  (4) liquidity; (5)
amount and quality of long-term debt; (6) trend of earnings over a period of ten
years; (7) financial  strength of a parent company and the  relationships  which
exist with the issuer;  and (8)  recognition  by the  management of  obligations
which may be present or may arise as a result of public  interest  questions and
preparations  to meet such  obligations.  Relative  differences  in strength and
weakness in respect to these criteria  would  establish a rating of one of three
classifications;  P-1  (Highest  Quality),  P-2  (Higher  Quality)  or P-3 (High
Quality).                                                                       

      Description of Standard & Poor's  commercial  paper ratings.  A Standard &
Poor's  commercial  paper rating is a current  assessment  of the  likelihood of
timely  payment of debt  having an  original  maturity of no more than 365 days.
Ratings  are  graded  into four  categories,  ranging  from "A" for the  highest
quality obligations to "D" for the lowest. The "A" categories are as follows:   

      A -- Issues  assigned  this  highest  rating  are  regarded  as having the
      greatest  capacity  for  timely  payment.  Issues  in  this  category  are
      delineated with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 to indicate the relative degree of
safety.                                                             

            A-1  --  This  designation  indicates  that  the  degree  of  safety
       regarding timely payment is either overwhelming or very strong.

            A-2 -- Capacity for timely  payment on issues with this  designation
            is strong.  However, the relative degree of safety is not as high as
for issues designated A-1.                              

P-->49734th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
            A-3 -- Issues carrying this designation have a satisfactory capacity
            for timely payment.  They are, however,  somewhat more vulnerable to
            the adverse  effects of changes in  circumstances  than  obligations
carrying the higher designations.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 

      Reference  is  made  to  "Investment   Objectives  and  Policies"  in  the
Prospectus  for a discussion of the  investment  objectives  and policies of the
Funds. In addition,  set forth below is certain further information  relating to
the Tax-Exempt Fund.                                                            

Tax-Exempt Fund                                                                 

      In order to enhance  the  liquidity,  stability  or quality of a municipal
obligation,  the  Tax-Exempt  Fund may acquire a right to sell the obligation to
another party at a guaranteed price approximating par value, either on demand or
at specified intervals.  The right to sell may form part of the obligation or be
acquired  separately by the Tax-Exempt  Fund. These rights may be referred to as
demand features, standby commitments or puts, depending on their characteristics
(collectively referred to as "Standby Commitments"),  and may involve letters of
credit or other  credit  support  arrangements  supplied  by domestic or foreign
banks  supporting the other party's  ability to purchase the obligation from the
Tax-Exempt  Fund.  In  considering  whether an obligation  meets the  Tax-Exempt
Fund's quality standards, the Fund may look to the creditworthiness of the party
providing the right to sell or to the quality of the obligation itself.         

      These  transactions   improve  portfolio  liquidity  by  making  available
same-day settlements on sales of portfolio  securities.  The Tax-Exempt Fund may
engage in such  transactions  subject to any limitations  contained in the rules
under  the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940.  A Standby  Commitment  is a right
acquired by the Fund,  when it purchases a municipal  obligation  from a broker,
dealer  or  other  financial  institution  ("seller"),  to sell  up to the  same
principal amount of such securities back to the seller, at the Fund's option, at
a specified price.  The exercise by the Tax-Exempt Fund of a Standby  Commitment
is  subject  to the  ability  of the  other  party to  fulfill  its  contractual
commitment.                                                                     

      Standby  Commitments  acquired  by  the  Tax-Exempt  Fund  will  have  the
following  features:  (1) they will be in writing and will be physically held by
the  Fund's  custodian;   (2)  the  Fund's  rights  to  exercise  them  will  be
unconditional  and unqualified;  (3) they will be entered into only with sellers
which in the Adviser's  opinion present a minimal risk of default;  (4) although
Standby Commitments will not be transferable,  municipal  obligations  purchased
subject  to such  commitments  may be sold to a third  party at any  time,  even
though the commitment is  outstanding;  and (5) their exercise price will be (i)
the  Fund's  acquisition  cost  (excluding  the  cost,  if any,  of the  Standby
Commitment)  of the municipal  obligations  which are subject to the  commitment
(excluding any accrued interest which the Fund paid on their acquisition),  less
any  amortized  market  premium or plus any amortized  market or original  issue
discount during the period the Fund owned the securities, plus (ii) all interest
accrued on the securities since the last interest payment date.                 

      The  Trust,  on  behalf  of the  Tax-Exempt  Fund,  expects  that  Standby
Commitments  generally  will be  available  without the payment of any direct or
indirect consideration.  However, if necessary or advisable, the Tax-Exempt Fund
will pay for  Standby  Commitments,  either  separately  in cash or by  paying a
higher  price  for  portfolio  securities  which  are  acquired  subject  to the
commitments.                                                                    

P-->49740th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
      It is difficult to evaluate the likelihood of use or the potential benefit
of a Standby  Commitment.  Therefore,  it is expected  that the  Trustees of the
Trust will determine that Standby Commitments  ordinarily have a "fair value" of
zero, regardless of whether any direct or indirect  consideration was paid. When
the  Tax-Exempt  Fund has  paid  for a  Standby  Commitment,  its  cost  will be
reflected as unrealized  depreciation for the period during which the commitment
is held.                                                                        

      Management of the Trust understands that the Internal Revenue Service (the
"Service")  has issued a  favorable  revenue  ruling to the effect  that,  under
specified  circumstances,  a registered  investment company will be the owner of
tax-exempt  municipal  obligations acquired subject to a put option. The Service
has also issued private letter rulings to certain  taxpayers (which do not serve
as  precedent  for other  taxpayers)  to the  effect  that  tax-exempt  interest
received by a regulated investment company with respect to such obligations will
be  tax-exempt  in  the  hands  of  such  company  and  may  be  distributed  to
shareholders  as  exempt-interest   dividends.   The  Service  has  subsequently
announced  that it will not  ordinarily  issue advance  ruling letters as to the
identity of the true owner of property in cases involving the sale of securities
or participation  interests  therein if the purchaser has the right to cause the
security,  or the participation  interest therein, to be purchased by either the
seller or a third party.  The Tax-Exempt  Fund intends to take the position that
it is the  owner of any  municipal  obligations  acquired  subject  to a Standby
Commitment and that  tax-exempt  interest  earned with respect to such municipal
obligations will be tax-exempt in its hands.  There is no assurance that Standby
Commitments  will be  available  to the Fund nor has the Fund  assumed that such
commitments would continue to be available under all market conditions.

      3These  figures  represent  the  Trust's  share  of the  estimated  annual
benefits  payable by the INVESCO  Complex  (excluding The Global Health Sciences
Fund,  which does not  participate  in any  retirement  plan) upon the trustee's
retirement,  calculated using the current method of allocating  director/trustee
compensation  among the funds in the INVESCO Complex.  These estimated  benefits
assume  retirement  at  age  72,  or  the  extended   retirement  date  referred
hereinafter,  and that the  basic  retainer  payable  to the  directors  will be
adjusted periodically for inflation, for increases in the number of funds in the
INVESCO  Complex,  and for other reasons  during the period in which  retirement
benefits  are  accrued  on behalf  of the  respective  directors/trustees.  This
results in lower  estimated  benefits for  directors/trustees  who are closer to
retirement and higher estimated benefits for  directors/trustees who are further
from   retirement.   Each  of  these   directors/trustees   has   served   as  a
director/trustee  of one or more of the  funds in the  INVESCO  Complex  for the
minimum  five-year  period required to be eligible to participate in the Defined
Benefit Deferred Compensation Plan.

     Messrs.  Bishop and Brady, as "interested  persons" of the Trust and of the
other  funds  in the  INVESCO  Complex,  receive  compensation  as  officers  or
employees  of  INVESCO  or its  affiliated  companies,  and do not  receive  any
trustee's  fees or other  compensation  from the Trust or the other funds in the
INVESCO Complex for their service as directors.                                 

      The boards of  directors/trustees  of the mutual funds  managed by INVESCO
Funds Group,  Inc., The EBI Funds,  Inc. and the Trust adopted a Defined Benefit
Deferred Compensation Plan for the non- interested directors and trustees of the
funds. Under this plan, each director or trustee who is not an interested person
of the funds (as  defined  in the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940) and who has
served for at least five years (a "qualified  director") is entitled to receive,
upon  retiring  from the boards at the  mandatory  retirement  age of 72 (or the
retirement age of 73 or 74, if the retirement  date is extended by the board for
one or two years but less than three  years),  continuation  of payments for one
year (the "first year retirement  benefit") of the annual basic retainer payable
by the  funds  to the  qualified  director  at the  time  of his  retirement  or
disability (the "basic  retainer").  Commencing with any such director's  second
year of  retirement,  and  commencing  with the first  year of  retirement  of a
director  whose  retirement  has been  extended by the board for three years,  a
qualified  director shall receive quarterly  payments at an annual rate equal to
25% of the basic retainer. These payments will continue for the remainder of the
qualified  director's  life or ten  years,  whichever  is longer  (the  "reduced
retainer payments").  If a qualified director dies or becomes disabled after age
72 and  before  age 74 while  still a  director  of the  funds,  the first  year
retirement  benefit and the reduced retainer  payments will be made to him or to
his  beneficiary or estate.  If a qualified  director  becomes  disabled or dies
either  prior to age 72 or during  his 74th year while  still a director  of the
funds,  the director  will not be entitled to receive the first year  retirement
benefit;  however, the reduced retainer payments will be made to his beneficiary
or estate.  The plan is  administered  by a committee of three directors who are
also  participants  in the plan and one director who is not a plan  participant.
The cost of the plan will be allocated  among the INVESCO,  EBI and  Treasurer's
Series funds in a manner  determined to be fair and equitable by the  committee.
Although the Trust is not making any payments to directors  under the plan as of
the date of this Statement of Additional Information, it has begun to accrue, as
a current expense, a proportionate  amount of the estimated future cost of these
benefits.  The Trust has no stock options or other  pension or retirement  plans
for management or other  personnel and pays no salary or  compensation to any of
its officers.

Inc., of Boston, Massachusetts,  was acquired by INAH in 1983, and manages funds
of some $2.8 billion, predominantly in pension and endowment accounts as of June
30, 1994.                                                                       

      In May  1986,  INVESCO  PLC  acquired  INVESCO  Asset  Management  Limited
("Management  Limited"),  an investment management company located in the United
Kingdom.  The  principal  business of  Management  Limited is the  management of
pension funds, investment trusts, unit trusts, and various investment portfolios

institutions.                                                                   

      In  December  1988,   INVESCO  PLC,   through  one  of  its  wholly  owned
subsidiaries,  purchased INVESCO Capital Management,  Inc.'s general partnership
interest in INVESCO Capital Management, L.P. The limited partnership interest in
INVESCO  Capital  Management  L.P. had been  acquired by INVESCO PLC in December
1986.  The business of INVESCO  Capital  Management,  Inc. is the  management of
institutional  investment  portfolios,  consisting  primarily  of  discretionary
employee  benefit plans for corporations  and state and local  governments,  and
endowment  funds.  INVESCO Capital  Management,  Inc. is the sole shareholder of
INVESCO Services, Inc., a registered broker/dealer whose primary business is the
distribution of shares of two registered investment companies.                  

      In December 1990,  INVESCO PLC purchased the business and assets of PRIMCO
Capital Management,  Inc. ("PRIMCO").  PRIMCO, which was established in 1985 and
is  based  in  Louisville,  Kentucky,  specializes  in  managing  stable  return
investments principally on behalf of Section 401(k) retirement plans. As of June
30, 1994, PRIMCO managed assets of over $16.4 billion on behalf of approximately
50 clients.                                                                     

      Based  in  Dallas,   Texas,   INVESCO  Realty  Advisors  Inc.  ("IRA")  is

INVESCO PLC's clients worldwide.  Established in 1983 as a registered investment
advisor and qualified  professional  asset manager,  funds under management have
grown as of June 30, 1994 to $971  million.  As of June 30, 1994,  its portfolio
contained 73 properties  totalling  over 18.4 million  square feet of commercial
real estate and 3,329 apartment units.  Clients include corporate plans,  public
pension funds, and endowment and foundation accounts.                           

      The  corporate  headquarters  of INVESCO PLC are located at 11  Devonshire
Square,  London,  EC2M 4YR,  England.  The dollar figures set forth in the above
paragraphs were obtained by converting British pounds sterling into U.S. dollars
as of June 30, 1994, at $1.54. All of the information contained in the above six
paragraphs was furnished by INVESCO PLC.                                        

      Under its Investment Advisory Agreement dated as of December 30, 1988 (the
"Agreement") with the Trust, the Adviser will, subject to the supervision of the
Trustees  and in  conformance  with the stated  policies of the Trust and of the
Funds,  manage the investment  operations  and portfolios of the Funds.  In this
regard, it will be the responsibility of the Adviser not only to make investment
decisions for the Funds,  but also to place the purchase and sale orders for the
portfolio   transactions   of  the  Funds.   (See   "Brokerage   and   Portfolio
Transactions.")  The Adviser is also responsible for furnishing to the Trust, at
the  Adviser's  expense,  the  services of persons  believed to be  competent to
perform all executive and other  administrative  functions required by the Trust
to conduct its business effectively, as well as the offices, equipment and other
facilities necessary for its operations.  Such functions include the maintenance
of the Trust's  accounts  and records,  and the  preparations  of all  requisite
corporate documents such as tax returns and reports to the SEC and shareholders.

      Under the Agreement,  the Adviser is responsible for the payment of all of
the Funds' expenses,  other than payment of advisory fees,  taxes,  interest and
brokerage commissions, if any.                                                  

P-->49747th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�47th
The  expenses  to  be  borne  by  the  Adviser  include,   without   limitation,
organizational expenses, compensation of its officers and employees and expenses
of its  trustees,  legal and  auditing  expenses,  the fees and  expenses of the
Funds'  custodian and transfer  agent,  and the expenses of printing and mailing
reports and notices to  shareholders.  For the  services to be rendered  and the
expenses to be assumed by the Adviser under the Agreement, the Trust will pay to
the Adviser an advisory fee which will be computed daily and paid as of the last
day of each month on the basis of each Fund's daily net asset  value,  using for
each daily  calculation  the most  recently  determined  net asset  value of the
Funds.  (See "Computation of Net Asset Value.") On an annual basis, the advisory
fee paid by each Fund is equal to 0.25% of the  average  net asset value of each
Fund's net assets.                                                              

      The Agreement was approved by the shareholders of each Fund on October 11,
1989.  The  Agreement  will  continue in effect from year to year  provided such
continuance  is  specifically  approved at least  annually  (i) by the vote of a
majority of each Fund's  outstanding  voting securities (as defined in the first
paragraph under "Investment  Restrictions" in the Prospectus) or by the Trustees
of the Trust and (ii) by the vote of a majority of the Trustees of the Trust who
are not  "interested  persons"  (as such term is defined by the 1940 Act) of the
Trust or the Adviser.  The Agreement is terminable on 60 days' written notice by
either party thereto and will terminate automatically if assigned.              

      The  investment  advisory  services  of the  Adviser  to the Trust are not
exclusive  and the  Adviser is free to render  investment  advisory  services to
others, including other investment companies.                                   

      For the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994, the Trust paid the Adviser an
advisory fee of $338,683, of which $280,355 was allocated to the Money Fund, and
$58,328 was allocated to the Tax- Exempt Fund,  representing .25% of each of the
Funds' net assets.  For the fiscal year ended  December 31, 1993, the Trust paid
the Adviser an advisory fee of $353,049,  of which $242,422 was allocated to the
Money Fund, and $110,627 was allocated to the Tax-Exempt Fund, representing .25%
of each of the Funds' net assets.  For the fiscal year ended  December 31, 1992,
the Trust paid the Adviser an advisory  fee of $491,311,  of which  $342,866 was
allocated to the Money Fund, and $148,445 was allocated to the Tax- Exempt Fund,
representing .25% of each of the Funds' net assets.                             

THE DISTRIBUTOR 

      INVESCO Services,  Inc., the Distributor,  is the principal underwriter of
the Trust under a Distribution  Agreement  dated as of December 30, 1988. All of
the Distributor's  outstanding  shares of voting stock are owned by the Adviser.
The Distributor's  principal office is located at 1315 Peachtree  Street,  N.E.,
Atlanta, Georgia 30309.                                                         

TAX INFORMATION 

Federal Taxes                                                                   

     Each Fund  intends to continue  to qualify  for the  special tax  treatment
afforded  regulated  investment  companies  under  Subchapter  M of the Internal
Revenue  Code,  as amended (the  "Code").  If the Fund  qualifies as a regulated
investment company, it will not be subject to federal income taxes to the extent
that it distributes  annually its net investment income and net realized capital
gain.                                                                           

P-->49748th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�48th
      With respect to a shareholder  that is exempt from federal income taxation
under Section  401(a) or 501(a) of the Code,  the  distributions  made by a Fund
will not constitute  unrelated  business  taxable  income (i.e.,  taxable income
derived by a tax-exempt  entity from any unrelated  trade or business  regularly
carried on by it) and thus will not be taxable.  Under Section  512(b)(1) of the
Code, dividends and capital gains are expressly excluded from unrelated business
taxable  income.  Consequently,  a  tax-exempt  shareholder  will not  incur any
federal income tax liability as a result of its participation in a Fund.        

      With  respect to a  shareholder  that is not exempt  from  federal  income
taxation,   all  distributions,   except  those  qualifying  as  exempt-interest
dividends  or return of capital  distributions,  whether  received in cash or in
additional  shares  of a Fund,  will be  taxable  and  must be  reported  by the
shareholder on its federal income tax return. Except for dividends designated as
exempt-interest  dividends,  each  Fund's  distributions  of its net  investment
income and net  short-term  capital gain will  constitute  dividends  taxable as
ordinary income. Each Fund's distribution of its net long-term capital gain will
be taxable as long-term capital gain regardless of the length of time the Fund's
shares have been held by the shareholder.  Such  distributions  will not qualify
for the dividends received deduction.                                           

      The Tax-Exempt Fund intends to continue to qualify to pay  exempt-interest
dividends  under  Section  852(b)(5)  of the Code.  In order to  qualify  to pay
exempt-interest  dividends in any taxable  year, at the close of each quarter of
such  taxable  year,  at least 50% of the value of the total  assets of the Fund
must be invested in state, municipal and other obligations the interest on which
is exempt under  Section  103(a) of the Code. No assurance can be given that the
Tax-Exempt  Fund will qualify to pay  exempt-interest  dividends  each year. For
each year that this Fund is qualified to pay exempt-interest  dividends, it will
designate  any  dividends,  or portion  thereof,  being paid as  exempt-interest
dividends  in a  written  notice to its  shareholders.  The  proportion  of each
dividend  which will be  designated as an  exempt-interest  dividend will be the
same as the proportion of the income from tax-exempt obligations (net of certain
disallowed  deductions,  as  provided in Section  852(b)(5)  of the Code) in the
taxable year bears to the dividends paid in the taxable year. Accordingly,  with
respect to any particular dividend, the portion designated as an exempt-interest
dividend  may be  substantially  different  than the  portion of the  Tax-Exempt
Fund's  income  which is income  from  tax-exempt  obligations  (net of  certain
disallowed  deductions,  as provided in Section  852(b)(5)  of the Code) for the
period covered by such dividend.  The notice will be mailed approximately thirty
(30) days, but no later than sixty (60) days,  after the close of the Tax-Exempt
Fund's  tax  year.  Dividends   designated  as  exempt-interest   dividends  are
excludable from the gross income of the shareholder  under Section 103(a) of the
Code.                                                                           

      Distributions  of  exempt-interest  dividends  derived  from  interest  on
certain  private  activity  bonds  are  specifically  treated  as  items  of tax
preference  and  may  subject  corporate  shareholders  to,  or  increase  their
liability  under,  the  corporate   alternative  minimum  tax  and  may  subject
individual  shareholders  to, or increase their liability under, the alternative
minimum tax for individuals.  In addition, because 75% of the difference between
adjusted current earnings and alternative minimum taxable income, all           

P-->49749th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�49th
distributions  derived from interest  which is exempt from regular  federal     
income  tax are  included  in  adjusted  pre-tax  book  income  and may  subject
corporate  shareholders  to, or increase their  liability  under,  the corporate
alternative minimum tax.                                                        

      Since the Trust  expects,  but cannot  guarantee,  to  maintain a constant
$1.00  net  asset  value,  upon the  redemption  of  shares  of a Fund held by a
non-tax-exempt  investor, such investor may realize a capital gain or loss equal
to the difference  between the redemption price received by the investor and the
adjusted  basis of the shares  redeemed.  Such capital gain or loss,  generally,
will constitute short-term capital gain or loss if the redeemed Fund shares were
held for 12 months or less,  and long-term  capital gain or loss if the redeemed
Fund shares  were held for more than 12 months.  If,  however,  Fund shares were
redeemed  within six months of their  purchase by an investor,  and if a capital
gain  dividend was paid with respect to such Fund's  shares while they were held
by the  investor,  then any loss  realized  by the  investor  will be treated as
long-term  capital  loss  to  the  extent  of the  capital  gain  dividend.  Any
short-term capital loss realized upon the redemption of shares of the Tax-Exempt
Fund within six months from the date of their purchase will be disallowed to the
extent of any  exempt-interest  dividends received during such six month period,
although the period may be reduced under Treasury Regulations to be issued.     

      Section 4982 of the Code  provides for a  non-deductible  4% excise tax on
the excess,  if any, of the "required  distribution"  for the calendar year over
the "distributed amount" for such calendar year. The "required  distribution" is
an amount  equal to at least 98% of a Fund's  ordinary  income for the  calendar
year and at least 98% of the excess of its  capital  gains over  capital  losses
("capital gain net income")  realized  during the one-year period ending October
31 during  such year.  The Fund may make an  election,  however,  to measure the
required capital gain distribution using its actual taxable year ending December
31. For  purposes of the required  distribution,  capital gain net income may be
reduced by the Fund's net ordinary loss for the calendar year. Each Fund intends
to avoid the  imposition of this 4% excise tax, but no  assurances  can be given
that this will be done every year.                                              

      Information  concerning the status of a Fund's  distributions  for federal
income tax purposes will be mailed to shareholders annually. Such distributions,
including  capital gains  distributions,  may also be subject to state and local
taxes.                                                                          

      The  foregoing  is a general  and  abbreviated  summary of the  applicable
provisions of the Code and the Treasury Regulations  presently in effect, and it
is  qualified  in  its  entirety  by  reference  thereto.  The  Code  and  these
Regulations are subject to change by legislative or administrative action.      

BROKERAGE AND PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS 

      The Adviser will arrange for the  placement of orders and the execution of
portfolio  transactions  for each of the  Funds.  Portfolio  securities  will be
purchased or sold to parties  acting as either  principal or agent.  Most of the
securities  acquired by the Funds  normally will be purchased  directly from the
issuer or from an  underwriter  acting as  principal.  Other  purchases  will be
placed with those dealers, acting as agents, whom the Adviser believes will     

P-->49750th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�50th
provide the best  execution of the  transaction at prices most favorable to the 
Funds. Usually no brokerage  commissions (as such) are paid by the Funds for    
such  agency   transactions,   although  the  price  paid  usually  includes  an
undisclosed  compensation to the dealer acting as agent.  The prices paid to the
underwriters of newly-issued  securities  normally  include a concession paid by
the issuer to the underwriter. Purchases of after-market securities from dealers
normally are executed at a price between bid and asked prices.                  

      Subject to the  primary  consideration  of best  execution  at prices most
favorable to the Funds,  the Adviser may in the  allocation  of such  investment
transaction  business  consider the general research and investment  information
and other services  provided by dealers,  although it has adopted no formula for
such  allocation.  These  research  and  investment  information  services  make
available  to the Adviser  for its  analysis  and  consideration  as  investment
adviser  to the Funds  and its other  accounts,  the  views and  information  of
individuals  and  research  staffs  of  many  securities  firms.  Although  such
information  may  be  a  useful  supplement  to  the  Adviser's  own  investment
information,  the value of such  research and services is not expected to reduce
materially the expenses of the Adviser in the  performance of its services under
the Investment  Advisory  Agreement and will not reduce the advisory fee payable
to the Adviser by the Funds.                                                    

      The  Adviser  may  follow a policy of  considering  sales of shares of the
Trust as a factor in the selection of dealers to execute portfolio transactions,
subject to the primary objective of best execution discussed above.             

      On occasions  when the Adviser deems the purchase or sale of a security to
be in the best interest of the Funds as well as other customers, the Adviser, to
the extent  permitted by  applicable  laws and  regulations,  may  aggregate the
securities  to be so  purchased or sold for such parties in order to obtain best
execution  and lower  brokerage  commissions.  In such event,  allocation of the
securities  so  purchased  or  sold,  as well as the  expenses  incurred  in the
transaction,  will be made by the Adviser in the manner it  considers to be most
equitable and consistent  with its fiduciary  obligations to all such customers,
including the Funds.  In some cases the  aggregation of securities to be sold or
purchased could have a detrimental  effect on the price of the security  insofar
as each Fund is  concerned.  However,  in other cases,  the ability of a Fund to
participate in volume transactions will be beneficial to such Fund.             

      No brokerage  commissions on purchases and sales of the Funds'  securities
were incurred for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 or 1992.       

      At December 31, 1994,  the Trust's  Funds held  securities  of its regular
brokers or dealers, or their parents, as follows:

CALCULATION OF YIELD  

      From time to time a Fund may advertise its "yield" and "effective  yield."
Both yield  figures are based on  historical  earnings  and are not  intended to
indicate  future  performance.  The  "yield"  of the Fund  refers to the  income
generated by an  investment  in the Fund over a seven-day  period  (which period
will be stated in the advertisement). This income is then "annualized." That is,
the amount of income generated by the investment  during that week is assumed to
be generated each week over a 52-week period and is shown as a percentage of the
investment.  The "effective yield" is calculated similarly but, when annualized,
the income earned by an investment in the Fund is assumed to be reinvested.  The
"effective  yield"  will be  slightly  higher  than the  "yield"  because of the
compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment.                                

      Each Fund normally  computes its yield by determining for a seven-day base
period  the  net  change,  exclusive  of  capital  changes,  for a  hypothetical
pre-existing  account having a balance of one share at the beginning of the base
period, subtracting a hypothetical charge reflecting deductions from shareholder
accounts  and  dividing  the  difference  by the  value  of the  account  at the
beginning of the base period to obtain the base period return,  multiplying  the
result by  (365/7),  with the  resulting  yield  figure  carried to at least the
nearest  hundredth  of one percent.  Each Fund may also  compute a  standardized
effective yield.  This is computed by compounding the base period return,  which
is done by adding  one to the base  period  return,  raising  the sum to a power
equal to 365 divided by seven and  subtracting  one from the  result.  The yield
paid by the Funds  will  result  in  payment  of  taxable  interest  to the Fund
shareholders.

      As of April 4, 1995,  officers  and  trustees  of the  Trust,  as a group,
beneficially  owned less than 43% of the Funds' outstanding shares and less than
26% of any portfolio's outstanding shares.                                      

Net Asset Value                                                                 

      The net asset value per share of each of the Funds is determined  daily as
of 11:30 a.m. (New York time),  after  declaration of the dividend,  on each day
that the New York Stock  Exchange  is open for  trading  and at such other times
and/or  on such  other  days as there is  sufficient  trading  in the  portfolio
securities  of the Fund that might  materially  affect its net asset value.  Net
asset  value per share is  determined  by adding  the value of all assets of the
Fund, deducting its actual and accrued  liabilities,  and dividing by the number
of shares outstanding.                                                          

P-->49753rd�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�53rd
    Each  Fund   seeks  to   maintain  a   constant   net  asset   value  of
$1.00 per  share.  There  can be no  assurance  that the  Funds  will be able to
maintain a net asset value of $1.00 per share. In order to accomplish this goal,
each Fund  intends to utilize the  amortized  cost  method of valuing  portfolio
securities.  By using this  method,  each Fund seeks to maintain a constant  net
asset value of $1.00 per share  despite  minor shifts in the market value of its
portfolio securities.  Under the amortized cost method of valuation,  securities
are  valued  at cost on the  date of  purchase.  Thereafter,  the  value  of the
security is increased or  decreased  incrementally  each day so that at maturity
any  purchase  discount  or  premium  is fully  amortized  and the  value of the
security  is equal to its  principal.  The  amortized  cost method may result in
periods during which the amortized cost value of the securities may be higher or
lower than their market value,  and the yield on a shareholder's  investment may
be higher or lower than that which would be recognized if the net asset value of
a Fund's  portfolio  was not  constant and was  permitted to fluctuate  with the
market  value  of  the  portfolio  securities.  It is  believed  that  any  such
differences  will  normally be minimal.  During  periods of  declining  interest
rates, the quoted yield on shares of each Fund may tend to be higher than a like
computation  made by a fund with  identical  investments  utilizing  a method of
valuation based upon market prices and estimates of market prices for all of its
portfolio instruments.  Thus, if the use of amortized cost by a Fund resulted in
a lower aggregate net asset value on a particular day, a prospective investor in
the Fund would be able to obtain a somewhat  higher yield if he or she purchased
shares of the Fund on that day,  than would  result  from  investment  in a fund
utilizing  solely market values.  The converse would apply in a period of rising
interest rates.                                                                 

      The  Trustees  of  the  Trust  have  undertaken  to  establish  procedures
reasonably  designed,  taking into account  current  market  conditions and each
Fund's investment objectives,  to stabilize, to the extent possible, each Fund's
price per share,  as  computed  for the  purposes of sales and  redemptions,  at
$1.00. Such procedures  include review of each Fund's portfolio  holdings by the
Adviser or its agent,  at such intervals as it deems  appropriate,  to determine
whether  the  Fund's  net  asset  value  calculated  by using  available  market
quotations  or  market  equivalents  deviates  from  $1.00  per  share  based on
amortized  cost. If any deviation  between the Fund's net asset value based upon
available market quotations or market  equivalents and that based upon amortized
cost exceeds 0.5%, the Trustees will promptly  consider what action,  if any, is
appropriate.  The action may  include,  as  appropriate,  the sale of  portfolio
instruments  prior to maturity to realize  capital gains or losses or to shorten
the  applicable  Fund's  average  portfolio  maturity;   withholding  dividends;
reducing  the number of shares  outstanding;  or utilizing a net asset value per
share determined by using available market quotations.                          

      The net asset value per share of the Funds will normally not be calculated
on days that the New York Stock  Exchange  is closed.  These  days  include  New
Year's Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday,  Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor
Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.                                        

Redemption of Shares                                                            

      It is possible that in the future,  conditions  may exist which would,  in
the opinion of the Trustees of the Trust,  make it undesirable for a Fund to pay
for redeemed shares in cash. In such

cases, the Trustees may authorize payment to be made in portfolio  securities or
other property of the applicable Fund.  However,  the Trust has obligated itself
under  the  1940 Act to  redeem  for cash all  shares  of a Fund  presented  for
redemption by any one shareholder up to $250,000 (or 1% of the applicable Fund's
net  assets  if that is less) in any  90-day  period.  Securities  delivered  in
payment of  redemptions  are valued at fair market value as  determined  in good
faith by the Trustees.  Shareholders  receiving  such  securities  are likely to
incur brokerage costs on their subsequent sales of such securities.             

The Custodian                                                                   

      United Missouri Bank of Kansas City, N.A., 928 Grand Avenue,  Kansas City,
Missouri 64106,  is the custodian of the portfolio  securities  and cash of the
Funds and  maintains  certain  records  on  behalf  of the Trust and the  Funds.
Subject to the Trust's  prior  approval,  the  custodian may use the services of
subcustodians for the assets of one or more of the Funds.                       

Independent Accountants                                                         

      Price Waterhouse LLP, 950 Seventeenth Street, Denver, Colorado,  serves as
the Trust's independent accountants,  providing services which include the audit
of the Trust's annual financial  statements,  and the preparation of tax returns
filed on behalf of the Trust.                                                   

      The financial statements, including schedules of investments and financial
highlights,  as of December 31, 1994, have been audited by Price Waterhouse LLP,
Denver,  Colorado, as stated in their report appearing elsewhere herein, and are
included  herein  in  reliance  upon the  report  of said  firm  given  upon its
authority as experts in accounting and auditing.                                

Declaration of Trust Provisions                                                 

      The Declaration of Trust  establishing the Trust dated January 27, 1988, a
copy of which,  together with all amendments thereto (the "Declaration"),  is on
file in the  office  of the  Secretary  of the  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts,
provides that the name "INVESCO Treasurer's Series Trust" refers to the Trustees
under the  Declaration  collectively  as  Trustees,  but not as  individuals  or
personally; and no Trustee, shareholder, officer, employee or agent of the Trust
shall  be held to any  personal  liability;  nor  shall  resort  be had to their
private  property for the  satisfaction of any obligation or claim of the Trust,
but the "Trust Property" only shall be liable.                                  

      As a  Massachusetts  business  trust,  the Trust is not  required  to hold
annual  shareholder  meetings.  However,  special  meetings  may be  called  for
purposes such as electing or removing trustees, changing fundamental policies or
approving an advisory contract.  Pursuant to the Declaration,  the holders of at
least 10% of the  outstanding  shares of a Fund may  require the Trust to hold a
special  meeting  of  shareholders  for any  purpose.  The  Declaration  further
provides that any Trustee of the Trust may be removed, with or without cause, at
any  meeting of the  shareholders  of the Trust by a vote of  two-thirds  of the
outstanding shares of the Trust.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS 

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of                                    
INVESCO Treasurer's Series Trust                                                

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,  including
the statement of investment securities, and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects,  the financial  position of INVESCO  Treasurer's Money Market
Reserve Fund and INVESCO Treasurer's  Tax-Exempt Reserve Fund, two portfolios of
the  INVESCO   Treasurer's   Series   Trust   (hereafter   referred  to  as  the
"Portfolios"), at December 31, 1994, the results of each of their operations for
the year then ended, the changes in each of their net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five
years in the period then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  These financial statements and the financial highlights  (hereafter
referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Portfolios'
management;  our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements  based on our  audits.  We  conducted  our audits of these  financial
statements  in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing  standards  which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about
whether the financial  statements  are free of material  misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits,  which included
confirmation  of  securities  at December  31, 1994 by  correspondence  with the
custodian, provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

INVESCO Treasurer's Series Trust                                                
Notes to Financial Statements                                                   

NOTE 1 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. INVESCO Treasurer's Series Trust (the
"Trust") is registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as
a diversified,  open-end management  investment company.  The Trust is organized
under  the  laws of the  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  and  consists  of four
separate funds:  INVESCO  Treasurer's  Money Market Reserve Fund ("Money Fund"),
INVESCO Treasurer's  Tax-Exempt Reserve Fund ("Tax-Exempt Fund")  (collectively,
the "Funds"),  INVESCO  Treasurer's  Prime Reserve Fund ("Prime  Reserve"),  and
INVESCO  Treasurer's  Special  Reserve Fund ("Special  Reserve"),  each of which
represents  a separate  portfolio  of  investments.  Prime  Reserve  and Special
Reserve are not presented herein.                                               
   The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  consistently
followed  by the  Trust  in the  preparation  of its  financial  statements.    

     A. SECURITY VALUATION -- Short-term securities are stated at amortized cost
(which  approximates  market value) if maturity is 60 days or less, or at market
value if maturity is greater  than 60 days.  If  management  believes  that such
valuation  does not reflect the  securities'  fair value,  these  securities are
valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Funds' trustees.        
     B.  SECURITY   TRANSACTIONS  AND  RELATED  INVESTMENT  INCOME  --  Security
transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Interest income is recorded on
the accrual basis.  The Fund amortizes  discounts and premiums paid on purchases
of  securities  to the  earliest  put or call date as  adjustments  to  interest
income. Cost is determined on the specific identification basis.                

     C. FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES -- The Trust has complied with the provisions of
the Internal  Revenue Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies  and,
accordingly,  has  made or  intends  to  make  sufficient  distributions  of net
investment income and net realized capital gains, if any, to relieve it from all
federal and state income taxes and federal  excise taxes.  Of the  distributions
paid by the Tax-Exempt  Fund for the year ended  December 31, 1994,  95.20% were
exempt from federal income taxes.                                               

     D. DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS -- All the Fund's net investment income is
distributed  to  shareholders  by  dividends  declared  daily and paid  monthly.
Reinvestment of income dividends is effected at the month-end net asset value.  

     NOTE  2 --  INVESTMENT  ADVISORY  AND  OTHER  AGREEMENTS.  INVESCO  Capital
Management,   Inc.  ("ICM")  serves  as  the  Trust's  investment   adviser.  As
compensation for its services to the Trust, ICM receives an investment  advisory
fee which is accrued daily and paid monthly. The fee is based on the annual rate
of  0.25%  of each  Fund's  average  net  assets.  ICM is also  responsible  for
providing certain  administrative and clerical services and facilities necessary
for the  operation of the Trust.  In  accordance  with the  Investment  Advisory
Agreement, ICM bears all other expenses of the Funds, except taxes, interest and
brokerage commissions.                                                          

     NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  Certain of the Trust's  officers
and/or trustees are also officers and/or directors of ICM. At December 31, 1994,
14.92%  and 41.00% of  outstanding  shares of Money  Fund and  Tax-Exempt  Fund,
respectively, were held by ICM or affiliated parties.                           

   The Trust has adopted an unfunded  noncontributory  defined  benefit  pension
plan covering all  independent  trustees of the Trust who will have served as an
independent trustee for at least five years at the time of retirement.  Benefits
under this plan

are  based on an annual  rate  equal to 25% of the  retainer  fee at the time of
retirement.  Pension  expenses for the year ended  December  31,  1994,  prepaid
pension costs and accrued pension  liability were paid by ICM in accordance with
the Investment Advisory Agreement and were as follows.                          

                                                   Prepaid           Accrued

   Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"). NRR indicates a security that is not
re-rated subsequent to funding of an escrow fund (consisting of U.S.  
    Government obligations held by a bank custodian); this funding is pursuant
to an advance refunding of this security.                             

(b)  Principal and interest payments are fully enhanced by a letter of credit   
from the bank listed or a predecessor bank, branch or subsidiary.     

(c)  Demand security payable upon demand by the Fund at specified time intervals

periodically. Rate shown is the rate in effect on November 30, 2007.  

(d)  The security is credit guaranteed, enhanced or has credit risk by a foreign
entity. The foreign credit exposure to countries other than the United
     States of America (as a percentage of net assets) is summarized as follows:
France: 6.4%; other countries less than 5%: 7.4%.                     

(e)  Security subject to the alternative minimum tax.                           

(f)  Principal and/or interest payments are secured by the bond insurance

    buyers. The Fund has no rights to demand registration of these securities.

  otherwise indicated, these securities are not considered to be illiquid.

(h)  Synethetic municipal instruments; involves the deposit inot a trust of one 
   or more long-term tax-exempt bonds or notes ("Underlying Bonds."), a sale
    of certificates evidencing interests in the trust to investors such as the

Underlying Bonds, and pays certificate holders variable rate interest 
payments based upon a short-term reset periodically.                  

(i)  Advance refunded; secured by an escrow fund of U.S. Government obligations.

  quality to the rated securities in which the Fund may invest pursuant to
    guidelines of quality adopted by the Board of Trustees and followed by the
investment advisor.

NOTE 1 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                       

    The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies followed
by the Funds in the preparation of their financial statements.                  

A.   SECURITY VALUATIONS - The Funds securities are recorded on the basis of    
     amortized cost which approximates value as permitted by Rule 2a-7 under the
     1940 Act. This method values a security at its cost on the date of purchase
and, thereafter, assumes a constant amortization to maturity of any   
premiums or accretion of any discounts.                               

B.   SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME - Securities transactions are
    accounted for on a trade date basis. Realized gains or losses on sales are
  computed on the basis of specific identification of the securities sold.
 Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
    discounts on investments, is recorded on the accrual basis from settlement
    date. Paydown gains and losses on mortgage and asset-backed securities are
recorded as adjustments to interest income.                           

          The Funds may periodically participate in litigation related to Fund's
investments. As such, the Funds may receive proceeds from litigation  
settlements. Any proceeds as received are included in the Statement of
Operations as realized gain/loss for investments no longer held and as
unrealized gain/loss for investments still held.                      

       Brokerage commissions and mark ups are considered transaction costs
   and are recorded as an increase to the cost basis of securities purchased
  and/or a reduction of proceeds on a sale of securities. Such transaction
costs are included in the determination of realized gain (loss) from  
investment securities reported in the Statement of Operations and the 
   Statement of Changes in Net Assets and the realized net gains (losses) on
 securities per share in the Financial Highlights. Transaction costs are
included in the calculation of each Fund's net asset value and,       
     accordingly, they reduce each Fund's total returns. These transaction costs
are not considered operating expenses and are not reflected in net    
    investment income reported in the Statement of Operations and Statement of
     Changes in Net Assets, or the net investment income per share and ratios of
  expenses and net investment income reported in the Financial Highlights,
 nor are they limited by any expense limitation arrangements between the
Funds and the advisor.                                                

         The Funds allocate realized capital gains and losses to a class based
  on the relative net assets of each class. The Funds allocate income to a
class based on the relative value of the settled shares of each class.

C.   COUNTRY DETERMINATION - For the purposes of making investment selection    
decisions and presentation in the Schedule of Investments, AIM may    
determine the country in which an issuer is located and/or credit risk
  exposure based on various factors. These factors include the laws of the
   country under which the issuer is organized, where the issuer maintains a
  principal office, the country in which the issuer derives 50% or more of
its total revenues and the country that has the primary market for the
  issuer's securities, as well as other criteria. Among the other criteria
that may be evaluated for making this determination are the country in
     which the issuer maintains 50% or more of its assets, the type of security,
     financial guarantees and enhancements, the nature of the collateral and the
 sponsor organization. Country of issuer and/or credit risk exposure has
    been determined to be the United States of America unless otherwise noted.

D.   RISKS INVOLVED IN INVESTING IN THE FUNDS - Municipal securities may be     
  affected by constitutional amendments, legislative enactments, executive
  orders, administrative regulations and voter initiatives as well, as the
  economics of the regions where the issuers in which the Fund invests are
located.                                                              

E.   RISKS INVOLVED IN INVESTING IN U.S. GOVERNMENT FUNDS- The Funds may invest 
in obligations issued by agencies and instrumentalities of the U.S.   
government that may vary in the level of support they receive from the
   government. The government may choose not to provide financial support to
 government sponsored agencies or instrumentalities if it is not legally
   obligated to do so. In this case, if the issuer defaulted, the underlying
 fund holding securities of such issuer might not be able to recover its
    investment from the U.S. Government. Many securities purchased by the Fund
are not guaranteed by the U.S. Government.                            

                                                                              14

F.   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS - The Funds may enter into repurchase agreements.    
Collateral on repurchase agreements, including each Fund's pro-rata   
   interest in joint repurchase agreements, is taken into possession by such
   Fund upon entering into the repurchase agreement. Eligible securities for
    collateral are securities consistent with the Fund's investment objectives
and may consist of U.S. Government Securities, U.S. Government Agency 
    Securities and/or, Investment Grade Debt Securities. Collateral consisting
of U.S. Government Securities and U.S. Government Agency Securities is
   marked to market daily to ensure its market value is at least 102% of the
sales price of the repurchase agreement. Collateral consisting of     
  Investment Grade Debt Securities is marked to market daily to ensure its
market value is at least 105% of the sales price of the repurchase    
agreement. The investments in some repurchase agreements, pursuant to 
 procedures approved by the Board of Trustees, are through participation
with other mutual funds, private accounts and certain non-registered  
  investment companies managed by the investment advisor or its affiliates
 ("Joint repurchase agreements"). The principal amount of the repurchase
agreement is equal to the value at period-end. If the seller of a     
  repurchase agreement fails to repurchase the security in accordance with
    the terms of the agreement, the fund might incur expenses in enforcing its
  rights, and could experience losses, including a decline in the value of
the collateral and loss of income.                                    

                                                                              15

Item 2. Controls and Procedures.                                                

(a)  As of December 17, 2007, an evaluation was performed under the   
 supervision and with the participation of the officers of the
     Registrant, including the Principal Executive Officer ("PEO") and
       Principal Financial Officer ("PFO"), to assess the effectiveness of
        the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is
     defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940
   ("Act"), as amended. Based on that evaluation, the Registrant's
       officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that, as of December
17, 2007, the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures were
         reasonably designed so as to ensure: (1) that information required to
      be disclosed by the Registrant on Form N-Q is recorded, processed,
          summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules
     and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (2) that
        material information relating to the Registrant is made known to the
  PEO and PFO as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.                                        

   (b)  There have been no changes in the Registrant's internal control over
        financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that
  occurred during the Registrant's last fiscal quarter that have
       materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting. 

Item 3. Exhibits.                                                               

        Certifications of PEO and PFO as required by Rule 30a-2(a) under the
Investment Company Act of 1940.
