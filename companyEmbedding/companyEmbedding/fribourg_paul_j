COMPANY NEWS
COMPANY NEWS;Executive-Suite Shifts at Continental Grain


By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN


Published: July 1, 1994









                    Marking the accession of a new generation of leadership, Michel Fribourg, the longtime chairman of the Continental Grain Company, has stepped aside to make room in the executive suite for his second-oldest son, Paul J. Fribourg.        

                    The elder Mr. Fribourg, who is 80, will become chairman emeritus of the giant agricultural company, which is based in New York. He will be succeeded as chairman by Donald L. Staheli, who has been president and chief executive officer of Continental Grain since 1988. The younger Mr. Fribourg, in turn, will become president and chief operating officer reporting to Mr. Staheli, who will  retain his position as chief executive.        

                    With his ascent, the younger Mr. Fribourg, who is 40, becomes the sixth generation of his family to enter the top management of Continental Grain, which was founded in Belgium in 1813.        

                    Secretive Company        

                    The company, one of the world's largest dealers in agricultural commodities, with more than $15 billion in annual sales, is owned entirely by the Fribourg family and is extremely secretive.        

                    Under the elder Mr. Fribourg, who took control of the company at age 31 after his father died in 1944, Continental Grain expanded its operations to more than  50 countries and became a leading producer of beef, pork and poultry products. It is also active in feed and flour milling and financial services.        

                    Given the scope of its operations and its large volume of sales, the company  has broad contacts in Washington and dozens of other world capitals. Continental Grain was the first company to export American grain to the Soviet Union in the  1960's and to China in the 1970's.        

                    None of the three men were available to comment about the changes, which were announced earlier this week. A spokesman for the company said yesterday that the younger Mr. Fribourg would take on expanded management responsibilities, but those changes had not been announced. Over all, he added, "There won't be any change in the direction of the company."        

                    Indeed, though the elder Mr. Fribourg was giving up his formal responsibilities as chairman of the board, the spokesman said, he would remain an active presence at the company's headquarters on Park Avenue.        

                    "He's still in the office working when I leave most nights so I don't think that will change," the spokesman said.        

                    Mr. Staheli, 62, joined Allied Mills Inc., a unit of Continental Grain in Chicago, in 1969. After rising through the ranks, he was named president of Continental Grain in 1984 and chief executive four years later.        

                    No Mandatory Retirement Age        

                    The spokesman said the company had no mandatory retirement age and there was no timetable for Mr. Staheli to retire.        

                    Like his father, the younger Mr. Fribourg has spent his entire professional career working for Continental Grain. Following his graduation from Amherst College in 1976, he joined the company's office in Memphis as a grain merchandiser.        

                    Since then, he has held various positions in Switzerland and France before returning to New York in 1985 to head the company's world grain group. He was named a director and executive vice president in charge of the company's commodity marketing group in 1990.        

                    Paul Fribourg's younger brother, Charles A. Fribourg, 37, is also an executive at Continental Grain, managing the company's European operations from  offices in Paris. Three other siblings are not active in the company.
