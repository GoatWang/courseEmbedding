                  graded only on tests and quizzes. tests are online, in class. they are all from the book plus some activities from class. adds about 10ts/test boosting exam a letter grade or higher. Big social media group project, easy grader on it. attendance not mandatory but he references his videos and activities from class on exams so don't miss much.

                  He doesn't teach any of the material from either of the books that you are assigned to read during the semester. His lectures are very obscure and often random. There are 3 or 4 tests on the textbook material, then 4 quizzes from the Carnegie book with completely random questions. You probably won't learn anything, but he is a really nice prof.

LECTURE HEAVY
GET READY TO READ


                  I learned absolutely nothing in this class. There are 3/4 tests that are on nothing that he teaches in class. We had one group  social media group project that is set up horribly. He is basically a motivational speaker. Also gives tiny quizzes on a book you must buy and the questions not what the learning objectives are, but random, obscure details

TOUGH GRADER
HILARIOUS


                  Dr. Mac is a good guy. I actually took a lot away from his material. The only thing that sucked was we were only graded on 3 tests and a group project. He ended up giving everyone a 100% on the project no matter how much work they put in and the tests are based mostly on the reading (which I never did), but still ended up doing good becuz he cruved

                  Dr. Mac is an awesome professor! Only hard part is that the tests are based and the textbook readings and it's a lot to remember. He does curve test scores though. Overall a pretty easy class. Just keep up with the readings and you will be fine.

                  Dr. Mac graded us on 3 tests that we took throughout the semester. On these tests were questions that asked about videos we did not watch, and information that we did not go over in the class and he knew that. He did end up curving our test grades but I ended up with a low B because of the irrelevant questions. Good guy, but a confusing teacher.

                  This is a senior level class and he teaches like he is talking to uneducated children. Everything he talks about in this course is irrelevant to the course description. If you actually want to learn about marketing management, take this course with a different professor. Biggest waste of my time.

                  Dr. Mac as he calls himself is very enthousiastic about what he teaches. I learned a lot in this class and would recommend taking it. He applies real world situations to in class assignments. the topics are always interesting and he is always willing to answer questions. THUMBS UP!

                  Dr. Mac is a nice guy but doesn't teach much.  90% of your grade is based on 4 exams in which 70% of the info comes from the textbook, which he doesn't talk about in class at all, that's all outside of class work. Not a terribly hard class.  He's always nice but kind of moody at times.  Never took notes and hardly studied and got an A in the class.

                  I took Dr. Mac my freshman year for fundamentals of marketing and i have based every marketing class off of what i learned in that single semester.  He has allot of useful information and by far is my favorite professor at UW-Stout.  Studying is a must and his lectures get long but he knows what hes talking about and is always willing to help.

                  This guy is super nice and all, but when it comes to instructing, he's pretty bad.  If you like to read textbooks from cover to cover and ONLY get graded on exams (no assignments or anything else)and not learn anything, then I would suggest it. He's nice and all, but I didn't learn anything.

                  I was interested in his lectures because they were full of interesting content presented in a interesting way. BUT he lost one of my tests. He was unwilling to change my grade because the burden of proof was on me. He does not hand back any tests so it was impossible to prove that I showed up every day of class and took every test.watch out.

                  Dr. Mac is favourite professor so far in UW-Stout. He is awesome. His class is so interesting and is all about the unchanging principles of mkg as well as life. I learned so much from this class, which I can utilize my entire life and I thoroughly enjoyed being a part of his crew. Highly recommended!

                  Dr. Mac is the bomb! Lectures are fun, he is funny, makes the class enjoyable. Probably one of the best here at Stout. Marketing is fun, and Mac makes it that much better. 4 Tests, 4 quizzes on a Carganie Book thats easy to read. Neither the tests or quizzes are hard. Make sure you study though. Dont think you can sit at home. Go to class. Take him

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Description
Author Bio
Reviews


 In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, more than a thousand pirates poured from the Atlantic into the Indian Ocean. There, according to Kevin P. McDonald, they helped launch an informal trade network that spanned the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds, connecting the North American colonies with the rich markets of the East Indies. Rather than conducting their commerce through chartered companies based in London or Lisbon, colonial merchants in New York entered into an alliance with Euro-American pirates based in Madagascar. Pirates, Merchants, Settlers, and Slaves explores the resulting global trade network located on the peripheries of world empires and shows the illicit ways American colonists met the consumer demand for slaves and East India goods. The book reveals that pirates played a significant yet misunderstood role in this period and that seafaring slaves were both commodities and essential components in the Indo-Atlantic maritime networks. Enlivened by stories of Indo-Atlantic sailors and cargoes that included textiles, spices, jewels and precious metals, chinaware, alcohol, and drugs, this book links previously isolated themes of piracy, colonialism, slavery, transoceanic networks, and cross-cultural interactions and extends the boundaries of traditional Atlantic, national, world, and colonial histories.


Kevin P. McDonald is Assistant Professor of History at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.



"Extremely well researched."—American Historical Review"McDonald succeeds in sketching a new geography of the British Atlantic in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries."—Humanities and Social Science"McDonald uses his case study to great effect, demonstrating the ways that pirates connected colonial America to a much wider world.... [he] introduces a new category of analysis: the Indo-Atlantic world... [and] identifies a key facet of the history of piracy that has received too little attention from previous scholars... perhaps the most important contribution is [it shines] light on the neglected but critical last decades of the seventeenth century."—The William and Mary Quarterly"[It will] change how scholars of seventeenth-century colonial America make sense of the relationship between law, commerce, and culture in the Atlantic world and beyond . . . breaks new ground by establishing that piratical activity was diverse, widespread, and seasonal . . . McDonald has done a remarkable job marshaling primary sources from archives in the United Kingdom and the United States in support of his ambitious argument . . . McDonald has written an important and powerful book that will make a substantial impact on the historiography of early American commerce."—Journal of American History"McDonald’s book is the most global-minded of the three [books reviewed], and his explicit intellectual engagement with world history as a way of understanding free and unfree migration patterns as well as maritime and trade circuits is refreshing. . . an excellent teaching resource. . . the whole book is ideal for classroom use."—Reviews in American History"McDonald’s carefully researched and crisply-written book makes a number of important interventions in its field: enhancing our appreciation of the vital connections between the colonial Atlantic and the emerging company state in India; by demonstrating the scope of colonial autonomy, and the corresponding limits of the British imperial state; and by revealing the extent to which imperial rivalry shaped and disrupted a set of global frontiers and zones of interaction. Pirates did not merely act as plunderers and despoilers, but were as vital in shaping a series of economic and cultural peripheries, and integrating them into an emerging global order."—International Journal of Maritime History"The book is well written and tells a captivating story."—Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History"McDonald succeeds in sketching a new geography of the British Atlantic in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, one that extends—through Madagascar—to the Indian Ocean. He demonstrates that contemporary Englishmen’s horizons were broader than those of most historians of the British Atlantic. This is an eye-opening and enlightening contribution, which requires other scholars to reframe their histories and periodizations (including such concepts as “First” and “Second” British Empires)."—H-War"A thought-provoking book that will register with both scholars and students of early-modern Atlantic and Indian Ocean studies. . . McDonald’s analysis of . . . the 'pirate-slave trade nexus' contributes to the growing body of literature that argues piracy contributed to the emergence of seventeenth-century merchant capitalism rather than undermined it. . . a fascinating work of history that uncovers how diverse pursuits. . . served to interlock distant and relatively small maritime communities across the globe at the end of the seventeenth century. . . a wonderful addition and. . . a sophisticated analysis."—International Review of Social History"A highly readable and important contribution to our understanding of pirates’ role in colonial projects in both the Americas and Madagascar. . . sheds much needed light on the Madagascar slave trade and the subsequent Malagasy diaspora. . . deserves high praise for providing a fresh perspective on Indian Ocean pirates, their settlement of St. Mary’s on Madagascar, and their participation in the Malagasy slave trade."—Journal of World History

 "In this fascinating book, Kevin McDonald tells the story of how pirates helped turn one imperial periphery, colonial New York, into a hub of the 'Indo-Atlantic trade world.' With a network that stretched from Manhattan to Madagascar, New York–backed sea rovers helped open the Indian Ocean to the colony’s merchants, carried slaves to North America and the Caribbean, and made spectacular fortunes. Carefully researched, beautifully written, and smartly argued, Pirates, Merchants, Settlers, and Slaves is maritime history at its best." —Eliga Gould, author of Among the Powers of the Earth: The American Revolution and the Making of a New World Empire "Beautifully written and well researched, Pirates, Merchants, Settlers, and Slaves promises to make a significant contribution to the burgeoning field of pirate studies. Linking the Atlantic World and the Indian Ocean, McDonald shows how pirates expanded their reach to Madagascar and beyond after they were driven from the Atlantic settlements. This work captures pirates and piracy in their various contexts, complicating the story we all thought we knew so well."—Carla Gardina Pestana, Professor and Joyce Appleby Endowed Chair of America in the World, Department of History, University of California, Los Angeles

                            "In this fascinating book, Kevin McDonald tells the story of how pirates helped turn one imperial periphery, colonial New York, into a hub of the 'Indo-Atlantic trade world.' With a network that stretched from Manhattan to Madagascar, New York-backed sea rovers helped open the Indian Ocean to the colony's merchants, carried slaves to North America and the Caribbean, and made spectacular fortunes. Carefully researched, beautifully written, and smartly argued, Pirates, Merchants, Settlers, and Slaves is maritime history at its best." --Eliga Gould, author of Among the Powers of the Earth: The American Revolution and the Making of a New World Empire  "Beautifully written and well researched, Pirates, Merchants, Settlers, and Slaves promises to make a significant contribution to the burgeoning field of pirate studies. Linking the Atlantic World and the Indian Ocean, McDonald shows how pirates expanded their reach to Madagascar and beyond after they were driven from the Atlantic settlements. This work captures pirates and piracy in their various contexts, complicating the story we all thought we knew so well."--Carla Gardina Pestana, Professor and Joyce Appleby Endowed Chair of America in the World, 
 Department of History, University of California, Los Angelesshow more



Review quote

                            "Extremely well researched." American Historical Review "McDonald succeeds in sketching a new geography of the British Atlantic in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries." Humanities and Social Science "McDonald uses his case study to great effect, demonstrating the ways that pirates connected colonial America to a much wider world... [he] introduces a new category of analysis: the Indo-Atlantic world... [and] identifies a key facet of the history of piracy that has received too little attention from previous scholars... perhaps the most important contribution is [it shines] light on the neglected but critical last decades of the seventeenth century." The William and Mary Quarterly "[It will] change how scholars of seventeenth-century colonial America make sense of the relationship between law, commerce, and culture in the Atlantic world and beyond ... breaks new ground by establishing that piratical activity was diverse, widespread, and seasonal ... McDonald has done a remarkable job marshaling primary sources from archives in the United Kingdom and the United States in support of his ambitious argument ... McDonald has written an important and powerful book that will make a substantial impact on the historiography of early American commerce." Journal of American History "McDonald's book is the most global-minded of the three [books reviewed], and his explicit intellectual engagement with world history as a way of understanding free and unfree migration patterns as well as maritime and trade circuits is refreshing... an excellent teaching resource... the whole book is ideal for classroom use." Reviews in American History "McDonald's carefully researched and crisply-written book makes a number of important interventions in its field: enhancing our appreciation of the vital connections between the colonial Atlantic and the emerging company state in India; by demonstrating the scope of colonial autonomy, and the corresponding limits of the British imperial state; and by revealing the extent to which imperial rivalry shaped and disrupted a set of global frontiers and zones of interaction. Pirates did not merely act as plunderers and despoilers, but were as vital in shaping a series of economic and cultural peripheries, and integrating them into an emerging global order." International Journal of Maritime History "The book is well written and tells a captivating story." Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History "McDonald succeeds in sketching a new geography of the British Atlantic in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, one that extends-through Madagascar-to the Indian Ocean. He demonstrates that contemporary Englishmen's horizons were broader than those of most historians of the British Atlantic. This is an eye-opening and enlightening contribution, which requires other scholars to reframe their histories and periodizations (including such concepts as "First" and "Second" British Empires)." H-War "A thought-provoking book that will register with both scholars and students of early-modern Atlantic and Indian Ocean studies... McDonald's analysis of ... the 'pirate-slave trade nexus' contributes to the growing body of literature that argues piracy contributed to the emergence of seventeenth-century merchant capitalism rather than undermined it... a fascinating work of history that uncovers how diverse pursuits... served to interlock distant and relatively small maritime communities across the globe at the end of the seventeenth century... a wonderful addition and... a sophisticated analysis." International Review of Social History "A highly readable and important contribution to our understanding of pirates' role in colonial projects in both the Americas and Madagascar... sheds much needed light on the Madagascar slave trade and the subsequent Malagasy diaspora... deserves high praise for providing a fresh perspective on Indian Ocean pirates, their settlement of St. Mary's on Madagascar, and their participation in the Malagasy slave trade."

There, according to Kevin P. McDonald, they helped launch an informal trade network that spanned the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds, connecting the North American colonies with the rich markets of the East Indies. Rather than conducting their commerce through chartered companies based in London or Lisbon, colonial merchants in New York entered into an alliance with Euro-American pirates based in Madagascar. Pirates, Merchants, Settlers, and Slaves explores the resulting global trade network located on the peripheries of world empires and shows the illicit ways American colonists met the consumer demand for slaves and East India goods. The book reveals that pirates played a significant yet misunderstood role in this period and that seafaring slaves were both commodities and essential components in the Indo-Atlantic maritime networks. Enlivened by stories of Indo-Atlantic sailors and cargoes that included textiles, spices, jewels and precious metals, chinaware, alcohol, and drugs, this book links previously isolated themes of piracy, colonialism, slavery, transoceanic networks, and cross-cultural interactions and extends the boundaries of traditional Atlantic, national, world, and colonial histories.

Throughout this period, European ships spent months at sea in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, but until now scholars have not fully examined how crews were fed during these long voyages. Without sustenance from Madagascar, European traders would have struggled to transport silver to Asia and spices back to Europe. Colonies in Mozambique, Mauritius, and at the Cape relied upon frequent imports from Madagascar to feed settlers and slaves. In Feeding Globalization, Jane Hooper draws on challenging and previously untapped sources to analyze Madagascar’s role in provisioning European trading networks within and ultimately beyond the Indian Ocean. The sale of food from the island not only shaped trade routes and colonial efforts but also encouraged political centralization and the slave trade in Madagascar. Malagasy people played an essential role in supporting European global commerce, with far-reaching effects on their communities. Feeding Globalization reshapes our understanding of Indian Ocean and global history by insisting historians should pay attention to the role that food played in supporting other exchanges.             2  $34.99 $19.24                 More from author                 Pre-ordered           Cheers!: 1,024 Toasts & Sentiments for Every Occasion    Kevin P.
