Mesa West Capital has closed its fourth real estate debt fund at a hard cap of $900 million, beating its original $750 million target. Mesa West Real Estate Income Fund IV’s investors include public and corporate pension funds, sovereigns, insurance companies and foundations and endowments.
PRESS RELEASE
LOS ANGELES (December 4, 2016)—Mesa West Capital has successfully closed its largest closed-end real estate debt fund, reaching its hard cap of $900 million in equity commitments for its Mesa West Real Estate Income Fund IV L.P, announced Principal Ryan Krauch.
With an original target of $750 million, Mesa West Capital has exceeded its fund raising goal for its last three closed-end debt vehicles. Through its family of funds and separate accounts, Mesa West originates fixed and floating rate loans for Core, Core Plus, and Value-Add properties across the United States. Mesa West Capital, one of the first managers to focus exclusively on commercial real estate debt when it debuted its $208 million fund in 2005, has since deployed more than $11 billion of loans.
“We are humbled that both new and existing investors put their trust in our team and investment strategy,” said Krauch.
Investors in Mesa West Real Estate Income Fund IV, L.P. include public and corporate pension funds, sovereigns, insurance companies, and foundations and endowments. Approximately 80 percent of the investors in Fund IV have invested in one or more of Mesa West’s previous funds.
Institutional capital is increasingly looking at commercial real estate with a more cautious eye given where the market is in the cycle. With commercial property values at record highs, U.S. Federal Reserve edging towards higher interest rates, and global markets uncertain, institutional investors continue to seek the low volatility and high current income provided by our debt funds, explained Krauch.
“Our investors understand that they can often achieve better going-in yield and average cash-on-cash returns by lending on high quality assets than they can by buying them, while at the same time being in the most senior position of the capital stack, which is especially important in today’s low cap rate environment,” said Krauch.
About Mesa West Capital, LLC
Mesa West Capital (www.mesawestcapital.com) is a privately held debt fund manager and portfolio lender with more than $5.5 billion in equity under management. With offices in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City, Mesa West has been one of the most active private providers of commercial real estate debt since its founding in 2004. Mesa West provides non-recourse first mortgage loans for core/core-plus, value-added and transitional properties throughout the United States. Mesa West’s lending portfolio includes all major property types with loan sizes ranging from $20 million up to $300 million. Since inception, the firm has sourced and closed more than 250 transactions totaling in excess of $11.5 billion.

Los Angeles—Mesa West Capital has closed its largest closed-end real estate debt fund, reaching a hard cap of $900 million in equity commitments for its Mesa West Real Estate Income Fund IV LP.
Ryan Krauch, Mesa West Capital
This is its fourth fund overall and surpassed its original $750 million target.
“For this particular fund, we will continue to provide short-term non-recourse first mortgage debt ranging from $20 million to $300 million for the acquisition, refinancing and recapitalization of institutional quality real estate assets in transition,” Ryan Krauch, Mesa West Capital’s principal, told Commercial Property Executive. “Fund IV allows us to continue the successful lending product that we have been providing to the market for the last 13 years—and given the size we will be able to accommodate even more clients and better serve the market.”
Mesa West Real Estate Income Fund IV’s investors include public and corporate pension funds, sovereigns, insurance companies and foundations and endowments. Approximately 80 percent of the investors have invested in one or more of Mesa West’s previous funds.
Mesa West originates fixed and floating rate loans for core, core plus and value-add properties across the United States. It was one of the first managers to focus exclusively on commercial real estate debt when it debuted its $208 million fund in 2005, and has since deployed more than $11 billion of loans.
According to Krauch, from its offices in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, the company lends on all major property types in primary markets throughout the United States.
“The company philosophy has always been to provide responsive service to our borrowing clients by keeping the loans on our balance sheet (rather than securitizing), provide certainty and speed of execution so that our borrowers can transact confidently, and offer a unique and flexible loan product that can adapt to the various needs of different properties and business plans,” he said. “The high level of demand that we are seeing for our loans now and for the last decade reinforces that borrowers value these services we are excited that Fund IV allows us to continue providing this product to the market.”

			Equity
			: Real Assets



			About Real Assets

			Real Assets are tangible raw materials, goods, property, buildings, roads, and other constructed items
			that are consumed, used to manufacture other items, or used to live in, work in, transport people and
			goods, and provide basic services like clean water, cellular service, and electricity. Real assets include
			commodities, real estate and REITs, infrastructure, pipelines, and collectibles. To encourage investments
			in these often-essential projects, governments sometimes grant special tax treatment to the returns
			or cash flows of some of these projects.
		

			Real assets are generally considered to be inflation hedges, since when the costs of goods and services
			rise (inflation increases), so does the demand for raw materials, energy, and physical systems also
			typically rise. In addition, they have historically had low 
				correlations with traditional financial assets such as stocks and bonds.



					About REITs

					Many real estate investments seek to provide attractive, growing dividends. A Real Estate Investment
					Trust (REIT) is a company that owns, and usually operates, income-producing commercial real estate,
					such as apartments, shopping centers, offices, hotels and warehouses. Most REITs are publicly-traded.
				

					A real estate investment trust is a tax designation for a corporate entity which can invest in real
					estate. The overall purpose of REITs designation is to reduce corporate income taxes, and in return
					REITs are required to distribute 90% of their taxable income to shareholders.
				

Historically, real estate investments such as REITs often have had relatively low correlations with other
						types of investments. Their total return typically relies on both cash flows from rents, and any capital
						appreciation. 


REIT performance is linked to the performance of the commercial real estate market. Property values and
						rents may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments. In addition, REITs depend on liquid
						credit markets, and there may also be special risks associated with particular sectors of the commercial
						real estate market. 


					For additional explanation please visit 
						NAREITs (the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts).
Nuveen Real Estate Income Fund (JRS)

			
					The fund invests at least 90% of its total assets in income producing common stocks, preferred stocks,
					convertible preferred stocks and debt securities issued by real estate companies; at least 80% of its
					total assets in income producing equity securities issued by REITs; and will not invest more than 25%
					of its total assets in non-investment grade preferred stocks, convertible preferred stocks and debt
					securities. The fund uses leverage.
				
				
					About Infrastructure

					Infrastructure refers to physical constructed items such as roads, bridges, water treatment, communications
					transmission, prisons, and other projects and systems that are needed or desired to support a country’s
					or business’s economic development. Infrastructure projects may be funded publicly, privately, or through
					public-private partnerships.
				

					Demand for financing infrastructure is influenced by worldwide population growth, urbanization, economic
					recovery, and maintenance and modernization of existing infrastructure.
				

The total return of infrastructure investments typically relies on cash flows from tolls or usage fees,
						as well as potential capital appreciation (when structured as an equity or stock) or pay back of principal
						(when structured as a bond or debt obligation). 


Like REITs, values, rents, and usage fees may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments.
						Some infrastructure investments may have smaller capitalization and thus lower liquidity, and global
						infrastructure investments may be subject to additional risks associated with emerging markets and different
						legal and financial systems.
Nuveen Real Asset Income and Growth
							Fund (JRI)

					Under normal market conditions, JRI’s Managed Assets will be invested:
					At least 80% in equity and debt securities issued by real asset related companies located anywhere in
						the world. 
No more than 40%, at the time of purchase, in debt securities. 
All of the Fund’s debt securities may be rated lower than investment grade quality (BB+/Ba1 or lower);
						no more than 10% the Fund’s Managed Assets may be invested in debt securities rated CCC+/Caa1 or lower
						at any time. 
At least 25% and no more than 75% in securities of non-U.S. issuers through the direct investment in
						securities of non-U.S. companies and depositary receipts.1


					JRI will employ, to a limited extent, an integrated and dynamic option writing strategy focused on securities
					issued by real asset related companies that seeks to generate option premiums for the purpose of enhancing
					the Fund’s risk-adjusted total returns over time. Initially, the notional value of the options will
					range from 5% to 10% of Managed Assets.2


					{1} A negotiable financial instrument issued by a bank to represent a foreign company’s publicly traded
					securities. The depositary receipt trades on a local stock exchange.
					

					{2} Over extended periods of time, the notional value of the call options written by the Fund may range
					from 0% to 25% of Managed Assets, depending on market conditions and Nuveen Asset Management’s ongoing
					assessment of the attractiveness of writing call options from a risk- adjusted return standpoint. There
					can be no assurance that the Fund’s options strategy will be successful. The Fund’s risk-adjusted returns
					over any particular period may be positive or negative.
				






								Investor Profile

								Are these CEFs right for you?
The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:
							

Potential for enhanced portfolio returns; 
High current income potential; 
Opportunity for capital growth.


								What are potential risks of REITS?

REIT performance is linked to the performance of the commercial real estate market. Property values
									and rents may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments. 
REITs depend on liquid credit markets, and there may also be special risks associated with particular
									sectors of the commercial real estate market.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.
