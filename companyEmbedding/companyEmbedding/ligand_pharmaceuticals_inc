Ligand Licenses Four Programs to Seelos Therapeutics


 Download as PDF

September 22, 2016

    SAN DIEGO--
      Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: LGND) announces the
      licensing of rights to four programs to Seelos Therapeutics, Inc., a
      newly formed biopharmaceutical company focused on central nervous system
      (CNS), respiratory and other disorders.
    

      The licensed therapeutic programs include Ligand's aplindore program for
      the treatment of various CNS disorders, a CRTH2 antagonist program for
      the treatment of respiratory disorders, a Captisol-enabled™
      acetaminophen program for pain and fever management and an H3 receptor
      antagonist program for the treatment of narcolepsy.
    

      Under the license agreement, Ligand is entitled to receive initial
      payments in equity or cash of $1.3 million upon Seelos’ completing a
      minimum of $7.5 million financing and up to an additional $3.5 million
      if Seelos becomes a public company and up to $145 million of additional
      cash milestones. In addition, Ligand is entitled to net sales royalties
      ranging from 4% to 10% for the various programs licensed. Ligand has
      also entered into a supply agreement for Captisol. If certain conditions
      are met, Ligand will provide a three-year convertible loan facility to
      Seelos in an amount up to $500,000. Seelos is responsible for all
      development activities under the license.
    

      "Seelos is assembling a great team of industry veterans to focus on a
      promising portfolio of mid- and late-stage programs. We are impressed
      with their development plans and with the outlook for building their
      business," said John Higgins, CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals. "Ligand has
      a track record of success with licensing foundational assets at the
      early stage of company formation, such as with Retrophin, Sage and
      Viking. All were private companies at the time of the Ligand license and
      all subsequently became public off lead programs licensed from Ligand.
      We are eager to watch Seelos progress."
    

      "We are pleased to announce the collaboration for a portfolio of CNS
      products with our partner Ligand Pharmaceuticals," said Dr. Raj Mehra,
      Chairman, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Seelos Therapeutics,
      Inc. "This partnership highlights Seelos' focus on developing late-stage
      CNS product candidates with proven mechanism of action. SLS-006, one of
      the lead assets acquired in this agreement, is a Phase-3 ready and
      clinically-validated partial dopamine agonist that is well-positioned to
      advance in development with a goal to provide relief to an estimated 1.5
      million Parkinson's disease patients in the developed world."
    

About Seelos Therapeutics, Inc.


      Seelos Therapeutics, Inc. is an emerging CNS company with late-stage
      clinical assets focused on neurological and psychiatric disorders,
      including orphan diseases. One of Seelos’ lead clinical product
      candidates, SLS-006 (formerly known as aplindore), is a Phase 3-ready,
      first-in-class, small molecule, partial dopamine agonist that has shown
      remarkable efficacy in early stage Parkinson's disease as a monotherapy.
      SLS-006 has also shown potent activity as an adjunctive therapy to
      highly reduced dosages of L-Dopa in late-stage Parkinson's disease.
      SLS-006 has been tested in more than 340 patients and has
      exhibited impressive efficacy similar to L-Dopa and an attractive safety
      profile. Seelos’ other Phase-3 ready product candidates, SLS-002 and
      SLS-004, have also been tested in clinical trials in more than 500
      patients each and have shown promising efficacy. Seelos’ mission is to
      apply its clinical expertise to develop novel therapeutics to address
      unmet medical needs for the benefit of patients with psychiatric and
      movement disorders. For more information, please contact Raj.Mehra@Seelostx.com.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals, originally called Progenx, was founded in September 1987 by Brook Byers. The company's headquarters are in San Diego, California. In January 2007, John Higgins became the new CEO of Ligand and the business was stripped down from 66 employees to 18.[2] When John Higgins became CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Daniel Loeb of Third Point Management bought into the biotech firm to cut its losses and grow revenue. Loeb invested $50 million, increased the company’s profit to $250 million, and brought back $68 million in stocks.[2][3]
As of June 2016, Ligand Pharmaceuticals' shares have returned 8.9%.[4] In June 2016, Director John Kozarich sold 1,000 shares of Ligand Pharmaceuticals' stock at an average price of $117.42, for a total transaction of $117,420. He now owns 43,361 shares valued at $5,091,448.92.[5]
Partnerships[edit]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals is partnered with approximately 120 pharmaceutical companies, which include Captisol and its partnerships.[6]
Captisol[edit]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals' platform technology is Captisol, a chemically modified clathrate compound of the cyclodextrin class designed to improve solubility, stability, bioavailability and dosing of active pharmaceutical ingredients.[7] The technology has enabled seven United States Food and Drug Administration approved products including Kyprolis and Noxafil-IV and is being developed in several clinical-stage partner programs.[3]

History[edit]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals, originally called Progenx, was founded in September 1987 by Brook Byers. The company's headquarters are in San Diego, California. In January 2007, John Higgins became the new CEO of Ligand and the business was stripped down from 66 employees to 18.[2] When John Higgins became CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Daniel Loeb of Third Point Management bought into the biotech firm to cut its losses and grow revenue. Loeb invested $50 million, increased the company’s profit to $250 million, and brought back $68 million in stocks.[2][3]
As of June 2016, Ligand Pharmaceuticals' shares have returned 8.9%.[4] In June 2016, Director John Kozarich sold 1,000 shares of Ligand Pharmaceuticals' stock at an average price of $117.42, for a total transaction of $117,420. He now owns 43,361 shares valued at $5,091,448.92.[5]
Partnerships[edit]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals is partnered with approximately 120 pharmaceutical companies, which include Captisol and its partnerships.[6]
Captisol[edit]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals' platform technology is Captisol, a chemically modified clathrate compound of the cyclodextrin class designed to improve solubility, stability, bioavailability and dosing of active pharmaceutical ingredients.[7] The technology has enabled seven United States Food and Drug Administration approved products including Kyprolis and Noxafil-IV and is being developed in several clinical-stage partner programs.[3]
Collaborations[edit]


Novartis
Onyx Pharmaceuticals
Merck & Co.
Bristol-Myers Squibb
Pfizer
Exelixis
Chiva Pharmaceuticals
Baxter International
SAGE
Lundbeck
Retrophin
Spectrum
MEI Pharma
Sanofi

TG Therapeutics[8]


Therapies[edit]
Ligand Pharmaceutical's portfolios match the medical needs for patients with diabetes, hepatitis, muscle wasting, Alzheimer’s disease, dyslipidemia, anemia, asthma, osteoporosis, thrombocytopenia, multiple myeloma, and fungal infections.[9]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
