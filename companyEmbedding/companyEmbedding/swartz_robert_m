Faculty profile


1. As Faculty Representative[1]


Robert Allen Schwartz (born June 30, 1947) is an American dermatologist.[2] He is professor and head of the Department of Dermatology at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. He is also professor of medicine, professor of pediatrics, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and professor of preventive medicine and community health at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. He is best known for the co-discovery of AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS-AIDS) and the Schwartz-Burgess Syndrome.
He earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science at the University of California, Berkeley in 1969, a Master of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health in 1970, and a Doctor of Medicine at the New York Medical College in 1974, from which he graduated at the top of his class as a member of the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society. He trained in dermatology at the University of Cincinnati and at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute. He advanced in academia, from the University of Arizona and the University of California, San Francisco, to the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, where in 1983 he became the first permanent head of dermatology, establishing a dermatology residency program in 1984.
In 1981 Schwartz led one of the three groups that first described AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS-AIDS). In 1978 he first described florid cutaneous papillomatosis. Schwartz is credited with the clinical description of new subtypes of Kaposi's sarcoma: telangiectatic Kaposi's sarcoma, keloidal Kaposi's sarcoma and ecchymotic Kaposi’s sarcoma. In 1981 he first described acral acanthotic anomaly (acral acanthosis nigricans). In 1980 Edmund Klein, Schwartz and associates published in Cancer one of the first effective treatments of Kaposi’s sarcoma, a type of cancer that became more frequent as the AIDS epidemic unfolded.
Schwartz has authored several books, including Skin Cancer: Recognition and Management, a leading book on cutaneous oncology currently in its second edition. Schwartz has also written 10 monographs, and is the author of over 250 book chapters, 500 articles, and 200 other publications. He has lectured in more than 30 different countries and, for eighteen consecutive years, was on the faculty of the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology. Schwartz has been elected an honorary member of more than 20 national dermatologic societies. He has received multiple honorary doctorates.

1. As Faculty Representative[1]


Robert Allen Schwartz (born June 30, 1947) is an American dermatologist.[2] He is professor and head of the Department of Dermatology at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. He is also professor of medicine, professor of pediatrics, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and professor of preventive medicine and community health at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. He is best known for the co-discovery of AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS-AIDS) and the Schwartz-Burgess Syndrome.
He earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science at the University of California, Berkeley in 1969, a Master of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health in 1970, and a Doctor of Medicine at the New York Medical College in 1974, from which he graduated at the top of his class as a member of the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society. He trained in dermatology at the University of Cincinnati and at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute. He advanced in academia, from the University of Arizona and the University of California, San Francisco, to the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, where in 1983 he became the first permanent head of dermatology, establishing a dermatology residency program in 1984.
In 1981 Schwartz led one of the three groups that first described AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS-AIDS). In 1978 he first described florid cutaneous papillomatosis. Schwartz is credited with the clinical description of new subtypes of Kaposi's sarcoma: telangiectatic Kaposi's sarcoma, keloidal Kaposi's sarcoma and ecchymotic Kaposi’s sarcoma. In 1981 he first described acral acanthotic anomaly (acral acanthosis nigricans). In 1980 Edmund Klein, Schwartz and associates published in Cancer one of the first effective treatments of Kaposi’s sarcoma, a type of cancer that became more frequent as the AIDS epidemic unfolded.
Schwartz has authored several books, including Skin Cancer: Recognition and Management, a leading book on cutaneous oncology currently in its second edition. Schwartz has also written 10 monographs, and is the author of over 250 book chapters, 500 articles, and 200 other publications. He has lectured in more than 30 different countries and, for eighteen consecutive years, was on the faculty of the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology. Schwartz has been elected an honorary member of more than 20 national dermatologic societies. He has received multiple honorary doctorates.

Faculty profile


1. As Faculty Representative[1]


Robert Allen Schwartz (born June 30, 1947) is an American dermatologist.[2] He is professor and head of the Department of Dermatology at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. He is also professor of medicine, professor of pediatrics, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and professor of preventive medicine and community health at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. He is best known for the co-discovery of AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS-AIDS) and the Schwartz-Burgess Syndrome.
He earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science at the University of California, Berkeley in 1969, a Master of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health in 1970, and a Doctor of Medicine at the New York Medical College in 1974, from which he graduated at the top of his class as a member of the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society. He trained in dermatology at the University of Cincinnati and at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute. He advanced in academia, from the University of Arizona and the University of California, San Francisco, to the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, where in 1983 he became the first permanent head of dermatology, establishing a dermatology residency program in 1984.
In 1981 Schwartz led one of the three groups that first described AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS-AIDS). In 1978 he first described florid cutaneous papillomatosis. Schwartz is credited with the clinical description of new subtypes of Kaposi's sarcoma: telangiectatic Kaposi's sarcoma, keloidal Kaposi's sarcoma and ecchymotic Kaposi’s sarcoma. In 1981 he first described acral acanthotic anomaly (acral acanthosis nigricans). In 1980 Edmund Klein, Schwartz and associates published in Cancer one of the first effective treatments of Kaposi’s sarcoma, a type of cancer that became more frequent as the AIDS epidemic unfolded.
Schwartz has authored several books, including Skin Cancer: Recognition and Management, a leading book on cutaneous oncology currently in its second edition. Schwartz has also written 10 monographs, and is the author of over 250 book chapters, 500 articles, and 200 other publications. He has lectured in more than 30 different countries and, for eighteen consecutive years, was on the faculty of the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology. Schwartz has been elected an honorary member of more than 20 national dermatologic societies. He has received multiple honorary doctorates.

1. As Faculty Representative[1]


Robert Allen Schwartz (born June 30, 1947) is an American dermatologist.[2] He is professor and head of the Department of Dermatology at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. He is also professor of medicine, professor of pediatrics, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and professor of preventive medicine and community health at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. He is best known for the co-discovery of AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS-AIDS) and the Schwartz-Burgess Syndrome.
He earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science at the University of California, Berkeley in 1969, a Master of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health in 1970, and a Doctor of Medicine at the New York Medical College in 1974, from which he graduated at the top of his class as a member of the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society. He trained in dermatology at the University of Cincinnati and at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute. He advanced in academia, from the University of Arizona and the University of California, San Francisco, to the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, where in 1983 he became the first permanent head of dermatology, establishing a dermatology residency program in 1984.
In 1981 Schwartz led one of the three groups that first described AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS-AIDS). In 1978 he first described florid cutaneous papillomatosis. Schwartz is credited with the clinical description of new subtypes of Kaposi's sarcoma: telangiectatic Kaposi's sarcoma, keloidal Kaposi's sarcoma and ecchymotic Kaposi’s sarcoma. In 1981 he first described acral acanthotic anomaly (acral acanthosis nigricans). In 1980 Edmund Klein, Schwartz and associates published in Cancer one of the first effective treatments of Kaposi’s sarcoma, a type of cancer that became more frequent as the AIDS epidemic unfolded.
Schwartz has authored several books, including Skin Cancer: Recognition and Management, a leading book on cutaneous oncology currently in its second edition. Schwartz has also written 10 monographs, and is the author of over 250 book chapters, 500 articles, and 200 other publications. He has lectured in more than 30 different countries and, for eighteen consecutive years, was on the faculty of the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology. Schwartz has been elected an honorary member of more than 20 national dermatologic societies. He has received multiple honorary doctorates.

Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Swartz has no media or publications listed.Background Check 0 Malpractice ClaimsNo malpractice history found for Illinois.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Swartz's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Swartz's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices. A board-certified doctor is more likely than a non-board-certified doctor to have the most current skills and knowledge about how to treat your medical condition.Dr. Swartz is Board Certified in:Hand SurgeryAccrediting Board: American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery *Orthopedic SurgeryAccrediting Board: American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery ** This information is proprietary data maintained in a copyrighted database compilation owned by the American Board of Medical Specialties.

Work Rights Press



















				Work Rights Press publishes the books of veteran union labor lawyer Robert M. Schwartz. These books explain labor law in a reader-friendly manner and are sold at prices considerably below what others charge for legal materials. Further savings go to unions that buy in bulk (25 copies or more). Work Rights Press can meet emergency delivery requests for conferences or classes.
				
				Since 1987 unions and other readers have purchased over 1.2 million of our handbooks. Some unions buy copies each year for new stewards, officers and staff members. Many university labor studies programs use the handbooks in courses.	
				
 
Note to purchasers:  Due to book seller Amazonâs anti-union policies, Work Rights Press does not supply books to Amazon.com. Nevertheless, Amazon sometimes obtains copies of our books from third-party distributors. If you order from Amazon rather than directly from Work Rights Press, you may or may not receive the latest edition or revised publication. Moreover, you will not be able to take advantage of the bulk rate discounts available to unions ordering 25 books or more. Further note:  Bulk rate discounts are only available for direct orders made by mail, telephone, or fax, not through our online store.






The Legal Rights of Union Stewards

New! The sixth (2017) edition of The Legal Rights of Union Stewards is now available. This classic handbook explains rules that apply to grievance investigations, information requests, Weingarten Rights, midterm bargaining rights, and other important labor law topics. The fourth edition is available as a two-disk CD and in a Spanish edition (Derechos Legales de los Delegados de Sindicato.).

							
Sample chapter: The National Labor Relations Act (“The NLRA declares collective bargaining as an official policy of the United States.”) 




No Contract, No Peace: A Legal Guide to Contract Campaigns, Strikes, and Lockouts

							Our latest publication vividly explains the crush of rules regulating economic warfare in the U.S., and the creative tactics that help unions win. No Contract, No Peace is a thoroughly revised and updated second edition of Strikes, Picketing and Inside Campaigns (2006). 
							
Sample chapter: Mounting a Dynamic Contract Campaign (“Creative and aggressive tactics can demonstrate the solidarity and resolve of union members and their willingness to act.“).




Just Cause: A Union Guide to Winning Discipline Cases

							The first thorough examination of union contract disciplinary principles since Carrol Daugherty issued “The Seven Tests of Just Cause” in 1965.

							A practical explanation of the rights of workers under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. 
							
Sample chapter: Snapshot (“The FMLA allows employees to take up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave each year for medical or family reasons.”) 




How to Win Past Practice Grievances

							Assists union representatives in identifying past practice violations, making grievance presentations, evaluating whether to file for arbitration, and filing labor board charges.
							
Sample chapter: Equal Treatment (“A failure to adhere to an implied agreement is as much a violation of the contract as a failure to adhere to a written provision.”).




The Labor Law Sourcebook

							Full texts of the 20 most important labor laws including the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
							
						





Praise for
							
							Work Rights Press books:

							“I've been to union schools for over 30 years, taking labor relations classes at Lansing Community College, but the best labor education I've ever had was your book: The Legal Rights of Union Stewards. I was the past president (I retired in 1997, but still work with the union free of course). We represent Lansing and nine other cities. I had filed at least three ULP's when I was president dating back to the Jimmy Carter era and all were dismissed. I never felt we'd be successful if we appealed.
							
							Now the good news: Since studying your book and reading the NLRB decisions, the NLRB has issued complaints on two of our charges. We won both cases!
							
							Your wonderful book should be required study for all labor union locals.”
							
							John Abel, NALC

							

							“These books have been instrumental in breathing new life into my local and how we do business with our company.”
							
							John Burns, IAMAW Local 725

							

							“This book has saved dozens of jobs of our members and helped to train our shop stewards.”
							
							Jim Kidwell, AFSCME Local 374

							

							“What a Godsend this book has been to me! The original edition has been my bible for several years. I was delighted to find the updated edition.”
							
							Michael S. Bentley, Teamsters Local 481

							

							“Thank you for your books and your work. The books are wonderful. We make good use of them out here!”
							
							Ray Wagner, USWA Local 9231

							

							“I have been enjoying your book. I wish I had this some time ago. I would like to commend you for the knowledge you have passed on. It will help me become a better, smarter, more effective griever.”
							
							Robert A. Morin, USWA Local 1219

							

							“I really value your books. I have a special appreciation for your FMLA Handbook since I just completed negotiating a policy with a school district.”
							
							Jeffrey D. Lewis, PSEA

							

							“The Legal Rights of Union Stewards has been a lifesaver. The stewards from the different trades on this construction site want their own. The Midwest needs this stuff bad.”
							
							Stephanie Miller, Pipefitters Local 464

							

							“When to argue, what to say, what laws to use and how to use them. This book will make you into a super steward!!! Management will not try any of their shenanigans after you use this book!! One steward of understanding can cause a hundred management of strength to tremble. This book will give you that understanding.”
							
							Sam, Detroit Teamster

							

							“This is a must-read book for all union members. Our boss really hates this book. He can no longer back us into a corner. He does the backing now.”
							
							BMann23

							

							“Anyone who is a union official has most likely heard the name Robert Schwartz and used one of his books to frame an argument or defend a member. His book The Legal Rights of Union Stewards is standard training fare for all newly elected stewards in my union, the Communications Workers. His other books on past practice, FMLA, and strike campaigns are all must-reads for any officer who wants to be informed and prepared to fight for the members.”
							
							Review for Labor Notes by Charles Borchert, Business Agent for CWA Local 1298

I am hardly the only person, lawyer or not, who believes that. Mr. Cogan is the definitive embodiment of every desirable characteristic an attorney could have, including creativity, intelligence, knowledge, integrity, work ethic, motivation, meticulousness, street smarts, sincerity, compassion, and fairness. Mr. Cogan's explosive enthusiasm for prevailing in court and winning at life in general is highly inspirational and contagious. His electric charisma (both the star and leadership kinds), dignified aggressiveness, and artistic spontaneity during trials are breathtaking. I should know better than anyone, as Mr. Cogan won all nine of my difficult-to-win cases for me. Amongst Mr. Cogan's hundreds of spectacular, screams-volumes-about-his-superhuman-talent achievements include (at one time) holding the record for the largest civil liability judgement against the Philadelphia Police Department and being the lead prosecutor of the homicide unit at the young age of 27 whilst a Philadelphia assistant district attorney. Watching this legendary, larger-than-life god in court is like watching a highly entertaining, brilliantly acted, intricately scripted, and expertly directed Broadway play, sans the frivolous song and dance. I often wondered who was actually running the show, the judge or Mr. Cogan, who invariably commands extreme respect from all involved. Mr. Cogan's youthful good looks, endless energy, and infinite passion belie his true age. I am using my real name to prove that this is a genuine, unsolicited review, not that anyone who knows Mr. Cogan would ever suspect otherwise.A M R Cohen, Esquire Law OfficesChris K. ratedM.R. Cohen is the best immigration law lawyer in Pennsylvania or New Jersey!   I say this because of my wonderful experience with him.  I dealt with a few other immigration firms before Mr. Cohen's and they're NOT all the same!I was drawn to Mr. Cohen because of his easy manner, down to earth but knowledgeable style AND HIS OVER 30 years experience.    After meeting him the first time,  I KNEW he KNEW what he was talking about!I had a difficult Permanent Residency and then later Citizenship case...  especially because I had been convicted [although I was innocent] of shop lifting.   I never thought I would be a citizen,  but Mr. Cohen's knowledge of immigration law AND the people at USCIS won the case for me!   I still can't believe it. Mr. Cohen was readily available for all my inquiries.  His calm demeanor and attention to detail were especially appreciated.   He doesn't just tell you what you want to hear, though.   He tells you his honest opinion and chances for approval.  I LIKE that!I have referred many clients to his offices.  Every single referral was satisfied-- even the one who was denied his Permanent Residency because it turned out his divorce wasn't valid!   If you need a GOOD immigration lawyer,  you can save yourself a lot of time, expense and aggravation by going FIRST to Mr. Cohen at one of his offices in PA or NJ!Coleman & Kempinskimike4chj ratedI was very apprehensive about ...I was very apprehensive about the entire process of filing for Bankruptcy, I veiwed it as a diificult process to navigate and also was concerned what others might think if it were found out that I filed, when I first met with Kimberly and Ray, I truely felt at ease right away, I noticed and appreciated that they were not some stuffed shirts type lawyers, I even felt as if I knew them longer than what I really did, Kimberly made the process so easy and non-intimidating, she and Ray both addressed all my concerns and issues on the very first visit and I did my part and before I knew it was alll done, I had a couple of creditors try to come after me even after my discharge of debts, I just simply forwarded the information to Kimberly and she jumped on it immediatley, she kept me in the loop via email and provided me with a copy of the corospondence she sent to the creditors and I never heard from them again, nor any other creditor for that matter, it's been years since I felt this level of freedom, it's like a tremedous weight is gone, the harrasing calls and letters has stopped and now I can sleep at night and rebuild my credit thanks to Coleman & Kempiski....thanks Mike V.   The Law Office of Harper J Dimmerman PCJason M. ratedMy wife and I began working with Harper over a year and a half ago, when we began experiencing build quality issues with our newly constructed home. From the very beginning Harper not only showed us that he was exceptionally knowledgeable in real estate law, but that he was also truly committed to helping us - and most importantly committed to winning our case. He is very easy to talk to and very good at explaining complex legal matters in a way anyone can understand. He is always responsive to any questions or concerns we had during the process and was always very well informed and knowledgeable. Over the course of this very long process Harper has always gone above and beyond to ensure we were well informed, and directing us to take the appropriate steps to ensure we had the strongest case possible. He is calculatedly aggressive, making smart decisions on what moves to make and who to push and how hard - never coming across as your stereotypical 'shark' of a lawyer. Harper is truly a great lawyer and we will continue to go to him for any legal needs we have for as long as he is practicing.Affordable Legal Center, LLCKhaleel D. ratedI recently hired Attorney Kaplan to help me gain some level of custody of my two sons. I was seeking a lawyer because my son's mother was not allowing me to see them, sent me paperwork stating that she was sole legal custody of our children, seemingly taking me out of the picture. Upon my initial conversation with Attorney Kaplan, I reached a level of comfort that I had not experienced in a substantial amount of time due to the foolishness that my son's mother was engaging in. In spite of my lack of knowledge concerning how these kinds of cases play out, Attorney Kaplan was not only beyond patient with me, he was also very knowledgeable, elaborate, and informative in explaining the ins and outs of my case. Needless to say, Attorney Kaplan was able to make it so that both of my sons will be spending the holiday with me. There are not enough words to truly articulate and/or express the level of gratitude that I have for Attorney Kaplan, and his entire staff for being so diligent, temperate, and long suffering, all in efforts to help enable my sons to be with their dad!The Law Office of Harper J Dimmerman PCCarlo F. ratedI have used Harper Dimmerman, Esq. for a business partnership agreement and our family has used Mr. Dimmerman's services for a complex real estate matter involving separation of title on an out-of-state vacation property, as well as in a challenge to a residential property valuation involving several city agencies. In all three instances, we have found Mr. Dimmerman to be a strong, determined and effective attorney who delivered the exact results we needed.  He is unique among attorneys in smaller practices we have seen, in that he provides individualized attention and service, and takes the time to understand each matter fully in order to recommend the best strategy for success.  He is extremely organized and very accessible by telephone and email. I was also impressed that he has chaired bar association committees and is a frequent speaker on new developments in the law. We were extremely pleased with our outcomes and would not hesitate to recommend him for any legal need. Michael J. Graves Jr. LawFred R. ratedMy wife was appointed Michael grace jr. On September 14th in court by the judge. Since September 14th she has called, emailed and texted attorney graves every single day to no avail it has been one month and she is in a worse situation that when she started she informed Mr Graves that there was an emergency situation and it needed immediate attention we would have been grateful for any help at all and have gotten none at all. Maybe he is having as bad a time in court as i am. My previous attorney who was also appointed to me didn't even bother to show on September 14th. This lack of counsel then and now is the reason she is still involved with Philadelphia family court. PA DHS is a joke and has been grossly negligent. It should be an easy win for any lawyer. There have been 27 opened and closed DHS reports prior to this case. C'mon Mr graves. Help her. She is a great mother to her son. Please.. We cannot afford a private attorney witch is why Mr graves was appointed. Smh..Anthony Petrone Attyaron.martinez.1293 ratedIf you are looking for attorne...If you are looking for attorney to act as a security blanket offering pie in the sky results...look elsewhere. Anthony is the thorough analytical type, a true student of law, who goes past the depth of other lawyers to argue you're best position. In my case Anthony was tasked with negotiating within a very specific and difficult aspect of SEC and fraud law. When I consulted with five other attorneys during the course, including the foremost attorney in this field, those who understood the issues believed that I would lose completely. Anthony, always the realist, relentlessly argued my position till the most favorable outcome was agreed to. Through his actions I have saved my business and retained enough assets to start again. Truly unexpected results. When discussing my civil issue with another highly respected attorney with whom I consulted, she described Mr. Petrone as a "brilliant legal mind".Anthony Petrone Attypatricknilson ratedAnthony Petrone is the best of...Anthony Petrone is the best of the best. Having dealt with hundreds of attorneys over the decades, few if any have been as prepared, qualified, ethical, hardworking, tactical, logical, knowledgable, sophisticated, intelligent, honest, moral, sincere, fair, passionate, motivated, meticulous, compassionate, patient, relentless, experienced, anticipatory, cutting edge, street smart, aggressive, or expert. If there is a legal way to win a case, Mr. Petrone will find it. He is the main partner of legendary "super lawyer" Dennis Cogan. Unlike many lawyers, Mr. Petrone is so good that he has never advertised. His stellar reputation screams louder than any television or radio commercial ever could. As with Fed Ex, why fool around with anyone else? I am using my real name to prove that this is an unsolicited, genuine review, not that anybody who knows Mr. Petrone would ever suspect otherwiseThe Law Office of Harper J Dimmerman PCStacey F. ratedHarper Dimmerman is an excellent attorney and I highly recommend hiring him to anyone that is in need of representation for any real estate legal matter.  My family had a problem with a deed in trust that was initiated many years ago.  Mr. Dimmerman reviewed the deed and clearly explained all of the possible options, in layman’s terms, to correct the problem.  Additionally, he quickly responded to our issue and made us feel like we were his most important clients.  Due to his thorough and knowledgeable representation, we were able to make a decision that best suited our needs.  If you have a real estate issue and you want an attorney that is experienced, unpretentious, and will provide you with the best representation, you should obtain the services of Harper Dimmerman.  My family was more than satisfied with our experience.Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
