The company’s principal activities are: operation of crude oil loading and unloading, storage and transportation facilities, LNG shipping and oil & petrochemical trading.As Sinopec’s sole red-chip subsidiary listed in Hong Kong by far, Kantons Holdings represents Sinopec's diversified capital in a significant way.

Thanks to the great support of Sinopec Group and our unremitting effort, by far we hold seven wholly or jointly owned domestic terminal companies, including one wholly-owned company-Huade Petrochemical Co., Ltd., one 90%-owned company -Tangshan Caofeidian Shihua, and five 50%-owned companies – Zhanjiang Port Petrochemical Jetty Co., Ningbo Shihua, Qingdao Shihua, Rizhao Shihua and Tianjin Port Shihua. We also have developed three overseas storage projects,of which Vesta has been under operation, while the other two are greenfield projects locating in Fujairah, UAE and Batam Island, Indonesia respectively. The company also engages in the LNG shipping business. Through two LNG shipping joint ventures it owns, Kantons Holdings plans to invest in ten LNG vessels and the related ship building work is progressing smoothly.Looking into the future, Kantons Holdings will continue with the business philosophy of competition and openness and the management tenet of maximizing profits and shareholders' return, in an effort to build Kantons Holdings into an international logistics and trading company with quality assets, scientific management, financial soundness and sharp competitive edge.

A Hidden Gem In Oil Stocks? - Sinopec Kantons Holdings Ltd (OTCMKTS:SNPKF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»A Hidden Gem In Oil Stocks?Jun.19.17 | About: Sinopec Kantons (SNPKF) Speed Success Long only, Deep Value, event-driven, arbitrageSummaryThis is a defensive stock with valuable midstream oil and gas assets.It is undervalued on a valuation basis compared with oil and gas midstream companies in the U.S.The company benefits from refinery deregulation as well as one belt, one road.The oil and gas market changed in 2014 when the price of crude oil halved. It has been struggling to recover with the global supply surplus and the shale oil revolution in the U.S. Not surprisingly, the oil price crash led to share price declines in many oil stocks. However, it should be noted that not all oil companies' profits are directly tied to the oil price. For example, companies that transport oil via pipelines generate fees from volume rather than the oil price. In the U.S., these companies are typically called master limited partnerships (MLPs). Some companies in this space are Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), Enterprise Products (NYSE:EPD), etc. Unfortunately, many of these MLPs in the U.S. are no longer undervalued, with most of them having price-to-earnings ratios over 20 times. However, a few of these opportunities still exist overseas. In this article, I will discuss a company listed in Hong Kong called Sinopec Kantons Holdings Limited (OTC:SNPKF) (OTCPK:SPKOY). Sinopec Kantons is indirectly controlled by Sinopec Corp. (SEHK: 0386) (NYSE:SNP) by its 60.3% stake via a wholly owned subsidiary called China International United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd. (UNIPEC). UNIPEC is the international oil trading arm of Sinopec Corp., responsible for procuring oil internationally for all of Sinopec Corp.'s refineries. Thus, due to the size of Sinopec Corp., it is one of the world's largest oil trading firms. As discussed on Sinopec Kantons' company website, Sinopec Corp. performed an internal restructuring in 2010 and positioned Sinopec Kantons to become a "world-class petrochemical storage and logistics company." Operationally, they essentially become the logistic arm supporting UNIPEC's globally crude oil trading. After seven years of transformation, Sinopec Kantons' assets and businesses are now 100% midstream, making it equivalent to a U.S. MLP. However, I believe markets still do not fully understand this transition and have been greatly undervaluing Sinopec Kantons since the oil price crash. Below I discuss why I believe it should deserve a higher valuation.
 Defensive stock with valuable midstream oil and gas assets The financial statements of this company are a pain to go through because Sinopec Kantons has a lot of joint ventures that don't consolidate into the balance sheet, so it's difficult to understand the full picture of the assets. Luckily, the footnotes, websites, and other reports do provide a good amount of information on its assets. Piecing everything together, Sinopec Kantons' assets are mainly divided into four categories:  Crude Oil Terminals - Sinopec Kantons has interests in seven crude oil terminals located along China's coastline. These terminals generate income mainly through charging a fixed fee per ton of crude oil loading/unloading. This business is similar to the commissions charged by a stock broker. Oil Storage - Sinopec Kantons has interests in several crude oil storage tanks located throughout Europe, the Middle East, and China that generate income by leasing out portions to other oil companies. This model is very similar to owning a commercial building and renting out sections of it as offices. Pipelines - Sinopec Kantons owns a 1000km natural gas pipeline that runs across four provinces from Inner Mongolia to Shandong as well as some crude oil pipelines via its terminals. These pipelines generates income by charging a fee on the amount of goods (e.g., crude oil and natural gas) being transmitted. This is similar to a highway toll booth that charges by the distance traveled. Vessels - Sinopec Kantons is constructing eight vessels that will be leased out for 20 years to Sinopec Corp. Each vessel generates a fixed fee per day. This business is similar to a car rental service.  The above assets make up 100% of Sinopec Kantons' revenues and almost all of its net profits. None of these assets directly depend on the oil price. Some of them are volume driven, which means they do indirectly benefit from a low oil price because of higher demand, which increases volumes. This is evident from the double-digit increase in volumes through its crude oil terminals since the oil price crash.
 From an asset prospective, Sinopec Kantons is equivalent to a typical U.S. oil and gas midstream MLP. Let's see how they compare from a valuation standpoint: Very undervalued on a valuation basis compared to oil and gas midstream MLPs in the U.S.  Valuation Between Sinopec Kantons and U.S. Oil and Gas Midstream MLPs:  Name & Ticker % Rev O&G Midstream Net Assets1  P/E2    Sinopec Kantons 100% 1,238.2 10.31x   Kinder Morgan 90.7% 34,802.0 35.90x   Enterprise Prod. 83.2% 22,266.0 20.93x   ONEOK (NYSE:OKS) 100.0% 6,177.8 22.18x   Williams (NYSE:WPZ) 100.0% 23,203.0 25.32x   12016 End of Year Net Assets; 2P/E calculated based on the share price of May 26, 2017. Source: Bloomberg Terminal (subscription required). As shown in the above table, Sinopec Kantons' valuation is two to three times below that of its U.S. peers. I've only listed the largest U.S. MLPs (as indicated by net asset size). Smaller MLPs actually have higher price/earnings ratios due to potentially higher growth, so this is a more conservative comparison. Furthermore, Sinopec Kantons is pretty much the largest midstream-only public company in China. Due to the more illiquid market, Chinese midstream assets generally are valued lower than similar assets in the U.S. This results in lower net assets, even though the revenue generated from the assets might be higher. I will illustrate this point using Sinopec Kantons' crude oil terminals. Extremely lucrative crude oil terminals About 33% of the revenues and 70% of the net profits are generated from Sinopec Kantons' crude oil terminal assets. These assets have performed remarkably well since their acquisitions in 2012. 

 Net Earnings is calculated as the total earnings from each terminal multiplied by the percentage ownership of Sinopec Kantons at the end of 2016. Return is calculated as the 2016 net earnings/initial purchase price. 2016 net assets are used for Huade Petrochemical since it was acquired prior to going public. Source: Company filings.
 It is worth noting that these assets have superior returns. Qingdao Shihua has over 106% return, meaning that just the earnings from this year are enough to cover its entire purchase price. Consequently, if these assets were sold in the market today, assuming a conservative 12x price to earnings multiple, the consideration price would be around HK$11.4 billion (~US$1.4 billion), which is higher than the market value of the entirety of Sinopec Kantons. This means that, at the current price, you are buying the oil terminals at a fair value, with all the other assets (pipelines, vessels, etc.) included for free. After reviewing this company in detail, I can see that there are definitely a few reasons why it remains undervalued:  Its financial statements are very hard to understand due to the high number of joint ventures that don't consolidate into the balance sheet. This is especially concerning when they have a lot of project-financing leverage that are off-balance-sheet. There aren't that many similar companies listed in China, so the investor base isn't as strong. Dividend payments are low. It is controlled by a state-owned enterprise like Sinopec, which might not look after minority investors.  Looking at the list above, I believe reasons 1 and 2 are just "noise" that create opportunities for astute investors. Reason 3 is currently valid as the dividend yield is quite low around 1%, but their board just increased dividends by 40% this year, with plans of future increases. Reason 4 is a valid macro concern that should warrant some discount. While I don't think Sinopec Kantons should be valued as high as a U.S. MLP, a valuation twice as low is way too low for one of the largest "MLPs" in China.

PT.West Point Terminal
  



PT. West Point Terminal（「PWT」）was established in Indonesia in January 2012. The Company held 95% equity in PWT through Sinomart KTS Development, a subsidiary of the Company. The business purpose of PWT is to develop, manage and operate an oil storage and oil blending complex and the supporting quay and port facilities with total capacity of 2,600,000 m3, and undertake waterway-dredging in the West Point Maritime Industrial Park, Batam Island, Indonesia. The project locates in the southwest part of the West Point industrial estate of the northwest part of Batam Island, Riau Islands Province, Indonesia, covering approximately 75 hectares. It is 12 nautical miles to Singapore’s Jurong refining base and 3 nautical miles to the principle channel (i.e. the channel of the Strait of Malacca) of the high sea. The project is standing within the range of Pan-Singapore oil products trading zone; moreover，the Batam Island at which it locates is the “free trade port zone” of Indonesia with its hinterland covering Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia and Middle East markets. All these bestow upon the project superior geographical and natural conditions, making it an ideal place for conducting oil storage and terminal business.The total planned investment for the project was USD 841 million. Once completed, the project will have storage facilities of a total 2.6 million m3 capacity; nine quays, including one of 300,000 tons capacity, one of 150,000 tons capacity, two of 100,000 tons capacity, one of 20,000 tons capacity, three of 10,000 tons capacity and one of 5,000 tons capacity. The design annual throughput is 50.56 million tons.

Sinopec Limited's parent, Sinopec Group, is one of the major state-owned petroleum energy and chemicals companies in China, headquartered in Chaoyang District, Beijing.[5] Sinopec's business includes oil and gas exploration, refining, and marketing; production and sales of petrochemicals, chemical fibers, chemical fertilizers, and other chemical products; storage and pipeline transportation of crude oil and natural gas; import, export and import/export agency business of crude oil, natural gas, refined oil products, petrochemicals, and other chemicals.

Corporate history[edit]
Sinopec Limited was established as a joint stock entity under the China Petrochemical Corporation Group (Sinopec Group) in February 2000. The company was simultaneously listed in Hong Kong, New York, and London in October 2000. A Shanghai listing was completed in June 2001.
Given its legacy asset base from Sinopec Group, analysts have categorized it as a more downstream oil player than PetroChina.[11] Sinopec is the largest oil refiner in Asia by annual volume processed. Sinopec produces around 1/4 as much raw crude oil as PetroChina, but produces 60% more refined products per annum.
In December 2006, Sinopec acquired the assets of Shengli Petroleum, whose main asset was a maturing domestic oil field, in order to stabilize its crude inputs and raise the utilization rate of its existing refineries.
In March 2013, China Petroleum and Chemical Corp agreed to pay $1.5 billion for Sinopec Group’s overseas oil and gas-producing assets.[12]
In August 2013, Sinopec acquired a 33% stake in Apache Corporation’s oil and gas business in Egypt for $3.1 billion.[13]
In December 2013, MCC Holding Hong Kong Corp.Ltd. and MCC Oil & Gas Hong Kong Corp.Ltd., acquired a 18% stake of Sinopec in oil and gas business for $9.3 billion.[14]




Sinopec's filling stations are a frequent sight on China's roads and rivers


Africa[edit]
Sinopec signed an evaluation deal with Gabon in 2004. During his African visit that year Chinese President Hu Jintao signed a series of bilateral trade accords with his Gabonese counterpart Omar Bongo, including a "memorandum of agreement aimed at showing the parties' desire to develop exploration, exploitation, refining and export activities of oil products". Three onshore fields were to be explored. One of the three blocks, LT2000, is some 200 kilometers (120 mi) southeast of Gabon's economic hub, Port Gentil, which lies south of the capital, Libreville, on the Atlantic coast. The other two — DR200 and GT2000 - are around 100 kilometres (62 mi) northeast of Port Gentil, according to the Gabonese oil ministry.[15]
In November 2005, Sinopec Group announced plans to partner with CNPC to purchase an oil field in Sudan, and has reportedly indicated an interest in expanding its business in Sudan.[16] Sinopec Corporation is a partner in Petrodar Operating Company Ltd., a consortium whose partners also include China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC, the 90 per cent owner of PetroChina) and Sudapet (the Sudanese state-owned oil company), among others. In August 2005, Petrodar commenced production of oil in blocks 3 and 7 in South-east Sudan. In December 2005, Petrodar announced that its first shipment of crude oil would be shipped from Sudan in January 2006. Petrodar's operations represent a major increase in overall Sudanese oil production. Sinopec is also looking into other companies such as ERHC Energy which has multiple oil block assets in the Joint Development Zone.[17]
In 2007, in eastern Ethiopia’s Ogaden Desert, a raid by an ethnic Somali rebel group on a Sinopec drilling site left 74 dead including 9 Chinese oil workers, and 7 kidnapped on 24 April 2007. The rebels, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), later released the seven abductees and warned foreign companies against working in the area. Sinopec said it had no plans to pull out of the resource-rich region despite the attack. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Jianchao says that China strongly condemns the violent attack carried out by Somalian insurgents on the premises of the oil company Sinopec in Ethiopia.[18]
In August 2009, Sinopec completed a takeover of Geneva-based Addax Petroleum for $7.5 billion marking China's biggest foreign takeover. On 31 October 2011 Addax acquired[19] Shell's 80% share of an exploration firm called Pecten that explores and drills in various offshore locations including the oil basin near Douala, Cameroon in cooperation with Total.[20]
In June 2013, Sinopec agreed to acquire Marathon Oil Corp’s Angolan offshore oil and gas field for $1.52 billion.[21]
Rest of the world[edit]
In February 2007, Saudi Aramco and Exxon signed a deal with Sinopec to revamp the Fujian oil refinery and triple its capacity to 240,000 barrels per day (38,000 m3/d) by 2009. Aramco, Exxon and Sinopec also signed contracts for a fuel marketing venture that will manage 750 service stations and a network of terminals in Fujian province.[22] Unipec, a subsidiary of Sinopec, signed a contract with French oil company Total Gabon in February 2002. Under the contract China, for the first time, bought Gabonese crude oil.[23] In the African nation of Gabon, Sinopec's joint ventures in oil exploration have been accused of violating environmental conventions by the government of Gabon. Its activities in Gabon's national parks were suspended in September 2006, by the Gabonese national parks council.[24]
On 13 April 2010 the Company announced acquisition of Conoco Phillips's 9% stake in the Canadian oil sand firms, Syncrude, for $4.65bn. The deal was granted regulatory approval from the Canadian government on 25 June 2010.[25] While largely welcomed by industry, Sinopec's Syncrude stake has raised concerns about the influence the Chinese government may try to exert on Canadian policy makers.[26]
In October 2011, the company offered C$2.2 billion ($2.1 billion) to acquire Canadian oil and gas firm Daylight Energy.[27] Daylight was renamed Sinopec Daylight Energy Ltd. after it was taken over in December 2011.[28]
On 11 November 2011 Sinopec announced that the company will invest $5.2 billion in buying a 30 percent stake in the Brazilian unit of Galp Energia SGPS SA which discovered biggest reserved in the western hemisphere since 1976.[29]
On 15 October 2012 Sinopec completed the purchase of 20 oil wells belonging to TOTAL E&P in Southern Nigeria in a deal worth around $2.45 billion. This was a remarkable achievement in the company's aim at fully exploring the oil-rich African country. Also they are presently executing an oil/gas project in STUBB CREEK region in Akwa Ibom Southern Nigeria that is capable of producing about 10,000 barrels of oil/day. This is in addition to other exploration projects currently being embarked upon both in Rivers and Akwa Ibom States. Sinopec indeed had previously taken over Addax Petroleum with numerous assets in Nigeria and Cameroon.
On 17 December 2012 Talisman Energy UK announced Sinopec has invested $1.5 billion in a 49 percent stake of Talisman's North Sea properties.[30]
In April 2013, Sinopec agreed to sell a stake of 30 percent in an oil and gas block in Myanmar to Taiwan's CPC Corp.[31]

In 2004, Sinopec prospected for oil in the 1,550 square kilometers of Loango National Park in southern Gabon and encountered criticism for what domestic and foreign environmental critics said were poor and damaging methods.[32] Primatology professor Christophe Boesch of the US-based environmental organization, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), criticized the use of dynamite and heavy machinery in exploration and road construction by Sinopec through park, noting that it might drive native gorillas deeper into the jungle, where they would be outside legal restrictions on hunting.[33] Gabonese law states that industries can extract oil from national parks, but must rehabilitate them to the prior condition. Boesch, and other international experts, have suggested that Sinopec use other methods such as horizontal drilling to minimize its environmental footprint.[24] Sinopec's activities in Gabon's national parks were suspended in September 2006, by the Gabonese national parks council.[24] In 2007, Sinopec redid its earlier environmental study, this time in conjunction with the Gabonese environmentalist group Enviropass and the World Wildlife Foundation, winning high marks from Gabonese, Western, and Chinese conservation experts. Shortly thereafter, Sinopec resumed production with more environmentally friendly methods.[34]
On 21 December 2006, gas started leaking during the drilling of a test well by the Sinopec Southern Prospecting and Development Branch in Quingxi. 12,380 people were evacuated after the leakage occurred. It took at least three attempts and two weeks for the company to seal the leak.[35]
China's top environmental watchdog warned Sinopec in 2007 to stop operations at one of its oil fields due to chronic river pollution. Zhongyuan Oilfields Petrochemical Company, a unit of Sinopec, had failed to meet waste water treatment requirements and had been ordered to pay a pollution fine and operations had to be halted, according to the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA).[36]
Guangdong Provincial Environment Bureau (GPEB) had also issued a red sign warning to 19 companies, including Sinopec Guangzhou, in February 2008. By GPEB’s standard, the companies that have involved in excessive emissions or caused serious environmental pollution accidents will be given the red sign warning and will be placed under strict supervision.[37]
On Wednesday, 28 July 2010, an explosion at an abandoned Sinopec plastics and chemicals factory in the Qixia District of Nanjing, China killed at least 12 people and seriously injured 15 more.
An oil pipeline explosion on Friday, 22 November 2013, in Qingdao, Shangdong province killed at least 62 people, injuring 136, and displacing hundreds more after oil previously leaking onto a street during the day ignited.[38]

Sinopec in Hong Kong


China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (中国石油化工股份有限公司), or Sinopec Limited (simplified Chinese: 中国石化; traditional Chinese: 中國石化; pinyin: Zhōngguó Shíhuà), is a Chinese oil and gas company based in Beijing, China. It is listed in Hong Kong and also trades in Shanghai and New York.
Sinopec Limited's parent, Sinopec Group, is one of the major state-owned petroleum energy and chemicals companies in China, headquartered in Chaoyang District, Beijing.[5] Sinopec's business includes oil and gas exploration, refining, and marketing; production and sales of petrochemicals, chemical fibers, chemical fertilizers, and other chemical products; storage and pipeline transportation of crude oil and natural gas; import, export and import/export agency business of crude oil, natural gas, refined oil products, petrochemicals, and other chemicals. In 2011 it ranked as the 5th largest company in sales in Forbes Global 2000.[6][7] In 2009, it was ranked 9th by Fortune Global 500 becoming the first Chinese corporation to make the top ten and in 2010 it was ranked 7th.[8] In 2007, it ranked first in the Top 500 Enterprises of China ranking.[9] Sinopec ranks as number 2 in 2015 Fortune Global 500 ranking.[10]

Corporate history[edit]
Sinopec Limited was established as a joint stock entity under the China Petrochemical Corporation Group (Sinopec Group) in February 2000. The company was simultaneously listed in Hong Kong, New York, and London in October 2000. A Shanghai listing was completed in June 2001.
Given its legacy asset base from Sinopec Group, analysts have categorized it as a more downstream oil player than PetroChina.[11] Sinopec is the largest oil refiner in Asia by annual volume processed. Sinopec produces around 1/4 as much raw crude oil as PetroChina, but produces 60% more refined products per annum.
In December 2006, Sinopec acquired the assets of Shengli Petroleum, whose main asset was a maturing domestic oil field, in order to stabilize its crude inputs and raise the utilization rate of its existing refineries.
In March 2013, China Petroleum and Chemical Corp agreed to pay $1.5 billion for Sinopec Group’s overseas oil and gas-producing assets.[12]
In August 2013, Sinopec acquired a 33% stake in Apache Corporation’s oil and gas business in Egypt for $3.1 billion.[13]
In December 2013, MCC Holding Hong Kong Corp.Ltd. and MCC Oil & Gas Hong Kong Corp.Ltd., acquired a 18% stake of Sinopec in oil and gas business for $9.3 billion.[14]




Sinopec's filling stations are a frequent sight on China's roads and rivers


Africa[edit]
Sinopec signed an evaluation deal with Gabon in 2004. During his African visit that year Chinese President Hu Jintao signed a series of bilateral trade accords with his Gabonese counterpart Omar Bongo, including a "memorandum of agreement aimed at showing the parties' desire to develop exploration, exploitation, refining and export activities of oil products". Three onshore fields were to be explored. One of the three blocks, LT2000, is some 200 kilometers (120 mi) southeast of Gabon's economic hub, Port Gentil, which lies south of the capital, Libreville, on the Atlantic coast. The other two — DR200 and GT2000 - are around 100 kilometres (62 mi) northeast of Port Gentil, according to the Gabonese oil ministry.[15]
In November 2005, Sinopec Group announced plans to partner with CNPC to purchase an oil field in Sudan, and has reportedly indicated an interest in expanding its business in Sudan.[16] Sinopec Corporation is a partner in Petrodar Operating Company Ltd., a consortium whose partners also include China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC, the 90 per cent owner of PetroChina) and Sudapet (the Sudanese state-owned oil company), among others. In August 2005, Petrodar commenced production of oil in blocks 3 and 7 in South-east Sudan. In December 2005, Petrodar announced that its first shipment of crude oil would be shipped from Sudan in January 2006. Petrodar's operations represent a major increase in overall Sudanese oil production. Sinopec is also looking into other companies such as ERHC Energy which has multiple oil block assets in the Joint Development Zone.[17]
In 2007, in eastern Ethiopia’s Ogaden Desert, a raid by an ethnic Somali rebel group on a Sinopec drilling site left 74 dead including 9 Chinese oil workers, and 7 kidnapped on 24 April 2007. The rebels, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), later released the seven abductees and warned foreign companies against working in the area. Sinopec said it had no plans to pull out of the resource-rich region despite the attack. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Jianchao says that China strongly condemns the violent attack carried out by Somalian insurgents on the premises of the oil company Sinopec in Ethiopia.[18]
In August 2009, Sinopec completed a takeover of Geneva-based Addax Petroleum for $7.5 billion marking China's biggest foreign takeover. On 31 October 2011 Addax acquired[19] Shell's 80% share of an exploration firm called Pecten that explores and drills in various offshore locations including the oil basin near Douala, Cameroon in cooperation with Total.[20]
In June 2013, Sinopec agreed to acquire Marathon Oil Corp’s Angolan offshore oil and gas field for $1.52 billion.[21]
Rest of the world[edit]
In February 2007, Saudi Aramco and Exxon signed a deal with Sinopec to revamp the Fujian oil refinery and triple its capacity to 240,000 barrels per day (38,000 m3/d) by 2009. Aramco, Exxon and Sinopec also signed contracts for a fuel marketing venture that will manage 750 service stations and a network of terminals in Fujian province.[22] Unipec, a subsidiary of Sinopec, signed a contract with French oil company Total Gabon in February 2002. Under the contract China, for the first time, bought Gabonese crude oil.[23] In the African nation of Gabon, Sinopec's joint ventures in oil exploration have been accused of violating environmental conventions by the government of Gabon. Its activities in Gabon's national parks were suspended in September 2006, by the Gabonese national parks council.[24]
On 13 April 2010 the Company announced acquisition of Conoco Phillips's 9% stake in the Canadian oil sand firms, Syncrude, for $4.65bn. The deal was granted regulatory approval from the Canadian government on 25 June 2010.[25] While largely welcomed by industry, Sinopec's Syncrude stake has raised concerns about the influence the Chinese government may try to exert on Canadian policy makers.[26]
In October 2011, the company offered C$2.2 billion ($2.1 billion) to acquire Canadian oil and gas firm Daylight Energy.[27] Daylight was renamed Sinopec Daylight Energy Ltd. after it was taken over in December 2011.[28]
On 11 November 2011 Sinopec announced that the company will invest $5.2 billion in buying a 30 percent stake in the Brazilian unit of Galp Energia SGPS SA which discovered biggest reserved in the western hemisphere since 1976.[29]
On 15 October 2012 Sinopec completed the purchase of 20 oil wells belonging to TOTAL E&P in Southern Nigeria in a deal worth around $2.45 billion. This was a remarkable achievement in the company's aim at fully exploring the oil-rich African country. Also they are presently executing an oil/gas project in STUBB CREEK region in Akwa Ibom Southern Nigeria that is capable of producing about 10,000 barrels of oil/day. This is in addition to other exploration projects currently being embarked upon both in Rivers and Akwa Ibom States. Sinopec indeed had previously taken over Addax Petroleum with numerous assets in Nigeria and Cameroon.
On 17 December 2012 Talisman Energy UK announced Sinopec has invested $1.5 billion in a 49 percent stake of Talisman's North Sea properties.[30]
In April 2013, Sinopec agreed to sell a stake of 30 percent in an oil and gas block in Myanmar to Taiwan's CPC Corp.[31]
Environmental and safety record[edit]
In 2004, Sinopec prospected for oil in the 1,550 square kilometers of Loango National Park in southern Gabon and encountered criticism for what domestic and foreign environmental critics said were poor and damaging methods.[32] Primatology professor Christophe Boesch of the US-based environmental organization, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), criticized the use of dynamite and heavy machinery in exploration and road construction by Sinopec through park, noting that it might drive native gorillas deeper into the jungle, where they would be outside legal restrictions on hunting.[33] Gabonese law states that industries can extract oil from national parks, but must rehabilitate them to the prior condition. Boesch, and other international experts, have suggested that Sinopec use other methods such as horizontal drilling to minimize its environmental footprint.[24] Sinopec's activities in Gabon's national parks were suspended in September 2006, by the Gabonese national parks council.[24] In 2007, Sinopec redid its earlier environmental study, this time in conjunction with the Gabonese environmentalist group Enviropass and the World Wildlife Foundation, winning high marks from Gabonese, Western, and Chinese conservation experts. Shortly thereafter, Sinopec resumed production with more environmentally friendly methods.[34]
On 21 December 2006, gas started leaking during the drilling of a test well by the Sinopec Southern Prospecting and Development Branch in Quingxi. 12,380 people were evacuated after the leakage occurred. It took at least three attempts and two weeks for the company to seal the leak.[35]
China's top environmental watchdog warned Sinopec in 2007 to stop operations at one of its oil fields due to chronic river pollution. Zhongyuan Oilfields Petrochemical Company, a unit of Sinopec, had failed to meet waste water treatment requirements and had been ordered to pay a pollution fine and operations had to be halted, according to the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA).[36]
Guangdong Provincial Environment Bureau (GPEB) had also issued a red sign warning to 19 companies, including Sinopec Guangzhou, in February 2008. By GPEB’s standard, the companies that have involved in excessive emissions or caused serious environmental pollution accidents will be given the red sign warning and will be placed under strict supervision.[37]
On Wednesday, 28 July 2010, an explosion at an abandoned Sinopec plastics and chemicals factory in the Qixia District of Nanjing, China killed at least 12 people and seriously injured 15 more.
An oil pipeline explosion on Friday, 22 November 2013, in Qingdao, Shangdong province killed at least 62 people, injuring 136, and displacing hundreds more after oil previously leaking onto a street during the day ignited.[38]

Sinopec in Hong Kong


China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (中国石油化工股份有限公司), or Sinopec Limited (simplified Chinese: 中国石化; traditional Chinese: 中國石化; pinyin: Zhōngguó Shíhuà), is a Chinese oil and gas company based in Beijing, China. It is listed in Hong Kong and also trades in Shanghai and New York.
Sinopec Limited's parent, Sinopec Group, is one of the major state-owned petroleum energy and chemicals companies in China, headquartered in Chaoyang District, Beijing.[5] Sinopec's business includes oil and gas exploration, refining, and marketing; production and sales of petrochemicals, chemical fibers, chemical fertilizers, and other chemical products; storage and pipeline transportation of crude oil and natural gas; import, export and import/export agency business of crude oil, natural gas, refined oil products, petrochemicals, and other chemicals. In 2011 it ranked as the 5th largest company in sales in Forbes Global 2000.[6][7] In 2009, it was ranked 9th by Fortune Global 500 becoming the first Chinese corporation to make the top ten and in 2010 it was ranked 7th.[8] In 2007, it ranked first in the Top 500 Enterprises of China ranking.[9] Sinopec ranks as number 2 in 2015 Fortune Global 500 ranking.[10]

Corporate history[edit]
Sinopec Limited was established as a joint stock entity under the China Petrochemical Corporation Group (Sinopec Group) in February 2000. The company was simultaneously listed in Hong Kong, New York, and London in October 2000. A Shanghai listing was completed in June 2001.
Given its legacy asset base from Sinopec Group, analysts have categorized it as a more downstream oil player than PetroChina.[11] Sinopec is the largest oil refiner in Asia by annual volume processed. Sinopec produces around 1/4 as much raw crude oil as PetroChina, but produces 60% more refined products per annum.
In December 2006, Sinopec acquired the assets of Shengli Petroleum, whose main asset was a maturing domestic oil field, in order to stabilize its crude inputs and raise the utilization rate of its existing refineries.
In March 2013, China Petroleum and Chemical Corp agreed to pay $1.5 billion for Sinopec Group’s overseas oil and gas-producing assets.[12]
In August 2013, Sinopec acquired a 33% stake in Apache Corporation’s oil and gas business in Egypt for $3.1 billion.[13]
In December 2013, MCC Holding Hong Kong Corp.Ltd. and MCC Oil & Gas Hong Kong Corp.Ltd., acquired a 18% stake of Sinopec in oil and gas business for $9.3 billion.[14]




Sinopec's filling stations are a frequent sight on China's roads and rivers


Africa[edit]
Sinopec signed an evaluation deal with Gabon in 2004. During his African visit that year Chinese President Hu Jintao signed a series of bilateral trade accords with his Gabonese counterpart Omar Bongo, including a "memorandum of agreement aimed at showing the parties' desire to develop exploration, exploitation, refining and export activities of oil products". Three onshore fields were to be explored. One of the three blocks, LT2000, is some 200 kilometers (120 mi) southeast of Gabon's economic hub, Port Gentil, which lies south of the capital, Libreville, on the Atlantic coast. The other two — DR200 and GT2000 - are around 100 kilometres (62 mi) northeast of Port Gentil, according to the Gabonese oil ministry.[15]
In November 2005, Sinopec Group announced plans to partner with CNPC to purchase an oil field in Sudan, and has reportedly indicated an interest in expanding its business in Sudan.[16] Sinopec Corporation is a partner in Petrodar Operating Company Ltd., a consortium whose partners also include China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC, the 90 per cent owner of PetroChina) and Sudapet (the Sudanese state-owned oil company), among others. In August 2005, Petrodar commenced production of oil in blocks 3 and 7 in South-east Sudan. In December 2005, Petrodar announced that its first shipment of crude oil would be shipped from Sudan in January 2006. Petrodar's operations represent a major increase in overall Sudanese oil production. Sinopec is also looking into other companies such as ERHC Energy which has multiple oil block assets in the Joint Development Zone.[17]
In 2007, in eastern Ethiopia’s Ogaden Desert, a raid by an ethnic Somali rebel group on a Sinopec drilling site left 74 dead including 9 Chinese oil workers, and 7 kidnapped on 24 April 2007. The rebels, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), later released the seven abductees and warned foreign companies against working in the area. Sinopec said it had no plans to pull out of the resource-rich region despite the attack. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Jianchao says that China strongly condemns the violent attack carried out by Somalian insurgents on the premises of the oil company Sinopec in Ethiopia.[18]
In August 2009, Sinopec completed a takeover of Geneva-based Addax Petroleum for $7.5 billion marking China's biggest foreign takeover. On 31 October 2011 Addax acquired[19] Shell's 80% share of an exploration firm called Pecten that explores and drills in various offshore locations including the oil basin near Douala, Cameroon in cooperation with Total.[20]
In June 2013, Sinopec agreed to acquire Marathon Oil Corp’s Angolan offshore oil and gas field for $1.52 billion.[21]
Rest of the world[edit]
In February 2007, Saudi Aramco and Exxon signed a deal with Sinopec to revamp the Fujian oil refinery and triple its capacity to 240,000 barrels per day (38,000 m3/d) by 2009. Aramco, Exxon and Sinopec also signed contracts for a fuel marketing venture that will manage 750 service stations and a network of terminals in Fujian province.[22] Unipec, a subsidiary of Sinopec, signed a contract with French oil company Total Gabon in February 2002. Under the contract China, for the first time, bought Gabonese crude oil.[23] In the African nation of Gabon, Sinopec's joint ventures in oil exploration have been accused of violating environmental conventions by the government of Gabon. Its activities in Gabon's national parks were suspended in September 2006, by the Gabonese national parks council.[24]
On 13 April 2010 the Company announced acquisition of Conoco Phillips's 9% stake in the Canadian oil sand firms, Syncrude, for $4.65bn. The deal was granted regulatory approval from the Canadian government on 25 June 2010.[25] While largely welcomed by industry, Sinopec's Syncrude stake has raised concerns about the influence the Chinese government may try to exert on Canadian policy makers.[26]
In October 2011, the company offered C$2.2 billion ($2.1 billion) to acquire Canadian oil and gas firm Daylight Energy.[27] Daylight was renamed Sinopec Daylight Energy Ltd. after it was taken over in December 2011.[28]
On 11 November 2011 Sinopec announced that the company will invest $5.2 billion in buying a 30 percent stake in the Brazilian unit of Galp Energia SGPS SA which discovered biggest reserved in the western hemisphere since 1976.[29]
On 15 October 2012 Sinopec completed the purchase of 20 oil wells belonging to TOTAL E&P in Southern Nigeria in a deal worth around $2.45 billion. This was a remarkable achievement in the company's aim at fully exploring the oil-rich African country. Also they are presently executing an oil/gas project in STUBB CREEK region in Akwa Ibom Southern Nigeria that is capable of producing about 10,000 barrels of oil/day. This is in addition to other exploration projects currently being embarked upon both in Rivers and Akwa Ibom States. Sinopec indeed had previously taken over Addax Petroleum with numerous assets in Nigeria and Cameroon.
On 17 December 2012 Talisman Energy UK announced Sinopec has invested $1.5 billion in a 49 percent stake of Talisman's North Sea properties.[30]
In April 2013, Sinopec agreed to sell a stake of 30 percent in an oil and gas block in Myanmar to Taiwan's CPC Corp.[31]
Environmental and safety record[edit]
In 2004, Sinopec prospected for oil in the 1,550 square kilometers of Loango National Park in southern Gabon and encountered criticism for what domestic and foreign environmental critics said were poor and damaging methods.[32] Primatology professor Christophe Boesch of the US-based environmental organization, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), criticized the use of dynamite and heavy machinery in exploration and road construction by Sinopec through park, noting that it might drive native gorillas deeper into the jungle, where they would be outside legal restrictions on hunting.[33] Gabonese law states that industries can extract oil from national parks, but must rehabilitate them to the prior condition. Boesch, and other international experts, have suggested that Sinopec use other methods such as horizontal drilling to minimize its environmental footprint.[24] Sinopec's activities in Gabon's national parks were suspended in September 2006, by the Gabonese national parks council.[24] In 2007, Sinopec redid its earlier environmental study, this time in conjunction with the Gabonese environmentalist group Enviropass and the World Wildlife Foundation, winning high marks from Gabonese, Western, and Chinese conservation experts. Shortly thereafter, Sinopec resumed production with more environmentally friendly methods.[34]
On 21 December 2006, gas started leaking during the drilling of a test well by the Sinopec Southern Prospecting and Development Branch in Quingxi. 12,380 people were evacuated after the leakage occurred. It took at least three attempts and two weeks for the company to seal the leak.[35]
China's top environmental watchdog warned Sinopec in 2007 to stop operations at one of its oil fields due to chronic river pollution. Zhongyuan Oilfields Petrochemical Company, a unit of Sinopec, had failed to meet waste water treatment requirements and had been ordered to pay a pollution fine and operations had to be halted, according to the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA).[36]
Guangdong Provincial Environment Bureau (GPEB) had also issued a red sign warning to 19 companies, including Sinopec Guangzhou, in February 2008. By GPEB’s standard, the companies that have involved in excessive emissions or caused serious environmental pollution accidents will be given the red sign warning and will be placed under strict supervision.[37]
On Wednesday, 28 July 2010, an explosion at an abandoned Sinopec plastics and chemicals factory in the Qixia District of Nanjing, China killed at least 12 people and seriously injured 15 more.
An oil pipeline explosion on Friday, 22 November 2013, in Qingdao, Shangdong province killed at least 62 people, injuring 136, and displacing hundreds more after oil previously leaking onto a street during the day ignited.[38]
