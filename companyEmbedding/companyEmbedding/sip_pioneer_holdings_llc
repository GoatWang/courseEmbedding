Ingate® Systems CEO Karl Stahl Honored as WebRTC Pioneer



Share Article


















Ingate CEO Karl Stahl has been recognized as a pioneer in the emerging WebRTC market at the WebRTC Conference & Expo IV.







WebRTC Pioneer Award

Karl is a true thought-leader in our industry"


STOCKHOLM (PRWEB)
July 03, 2014
 Karl Stahl, CEO and founder of Ingate® Systems, prolific inventor and a trailblazer in SIP- and WebRTC-based real-time communications, was honored with the WebRTC Pioneer Awards. Recipients were selected and honored for the visionary contributions to the rapid growth of WebRTC, the browser-to-browser communications technology being used in innovative business applications for improved customer service and collaboration.
“The WebRTC Pioneer Awards recognize the people that have been driving WebRTC and the webification of communications,” said Phil Edholm, event producer of PKE Consulting. “Each of the Pioneers made a unique contribution to the growth and evolution of WebRTC.”
Stahl presented the “Making Your Enterprise Ready for WebRTC” session at the WebRTC Expo, and demonstrated the high definition multiparty videoconference capabilities that WebRTC browser-based SIP clients can bring to IP-PBX, UC and call center solutions.
Stahl also led a developer discussion around “ICE and Turn Servers – Getting Through Firewalls.”
"Karl was selected for his unique and impactful contributions to SIP- and WebRTC-based real-time communications," said Dave Rodriguez, president, TMC. "He is a true thought-leader in our industry."
Ingate Systems develops the WebRTC & SIP PBX Companion, allowing PBX, UC solution and call center vendors to integrate all WebRTC features and benefits into their solutions. Ingate also develops the Q-TURN technology, first being available as a module in Ingate’s E-SBCs giving WebRTC, or any real-time communication using the ICE standard for NAT/firewall traversal, secure access and quality between the enterprise LAN and the World Wide Web, even over data-crowded Internet accesses. Ingate’s solutions advance global video conferencing utilizing the telepresence capability of WebRTC in PC’s, tablets and smartphones.
The Ingate firewall and access router technology includes the Q-TURN feature which provides the TURN server at the WAN, at the LAN and between the two assuring that WebRTC and other real-time protocols using the ICE protocol can traverse the most secure firewalls in the demanding enterprise environments, just as Ingate E-SBCs have done with SIP trunking. This is important to step up from telephony voice to potentially telepresence Hi-Fi and HD quality using WebRTC. 
Network service providers can also use Ingate’s Q-TURN technology to offer high-quality WebRTC-ready Internet access for real-time usage, in addition to data usage, in new attractive price plans for their customers, without having to invest in new bandwidth.

About Ingate® Systems
Ingate® Systems develops firewall technology to enable global SIP- and WebRTC-based person-to-person communication to provide the best access for telephony, global real-time and unified person-to-person communication for everyone.
