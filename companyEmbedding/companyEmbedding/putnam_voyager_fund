Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund and Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, which is 3% in the first year, declining to 1% in the fourth year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Performance for class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the periods, some funds had expense limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.


For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3–, 5–, and 10–year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Data is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.


Lipper rankings are based on total return without sales charge relative to all share classes of funds with similar objectives as determined by Lipper. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Rankings for other periods can be found on the Facts & Rankings tab.

PUTNAM PERSPECTIVES

Value benefits from an expanding economy
Value stocks have lagged the market in 2017, but if the economy continues to expand, rates rise, and the yield curve steepens, this trend could reverse.


ECONOMIC UPDATES AND MARKET OUTLOOKS

Currency: Don't look to the dollar for leadership
The U.S. dollar outlook continues to be most heavily influenced by the Fed, as expectations for fiscal policy have been pushed beyond the investment horizon.

Putnam mutual fund expense calculator
All mutual fund investors pay expenses, such as management fees, distribution fees (12b-1 fees), and other expenses. These ongoing expenses cover the costs of research and investment management, as well as distribution and certain administrative expenses. Mutual fund investors may also pay one-time transaction expenses, including sales charges (loads) and redemption fees. Sales charges primarily compensate financial advisors for the services they provide.
For more information about any Putnam fund's expenses, you should talk to your financial advisor and consult the fund's prospectus. The prospectus section entitled "Fees and Expenses" indicates the fees and expenses paid by the fund for its most recent fiscal year (unless otherwise indicated), organized by share class.
This calculator can help you estimate the expenses you would pay as an investor in a Putnam fund, based on information you provide as well as the fees and expenses of the selected Putnam fund and share class.
This calculator is not meant to be used by retirement plan participants or other investors eligible to purchase class A shares at net asset value.

Bond Funds




Pursue income or capital preservation with a diverse portfolio of income securities.
Bond funds — also called income or fixed-income funds — are a type of mutual fund that invests in bonds and other debt securities issued by organizations such as corporations, governments, and municipalities. Bond funds invest in a range of bonds with a variety of terms to help provide diversification. As with all mutual funds, bond funds carry a degree of risk.
Putnam's approach

We take a comprehensive view of risk to build bond funds with a broader range of investment potential. 
We actively work to determine which risks are worth taking and when. 
We have fundamental insights into a wide range of sectors, including areas beyond the benchmark index.
