Jonathan Davis


















Ideas and insights for investorsWelcome to the Independent Investor website. For more than 35 years my professional life has revolved around analysing the financial markets, initially as a journalist on national newspapers (The Times, Independent and Economist), latterly as a qualified investment professional. Aided and abetted by an extensive network of professional contacts, I offer independent insights and help to professional and private investors alike through books, columns and interviews for the Financial Times and Spectator, directorships and consultancy work, and speaking at public/private events. If you don’t know me already, you can find out more from the About link. I would be delighted to add you to my professional circle. Please feel free to join my mailing list (see below) and stay in touch.
 
Jonathan Davis MSCI, author, columnist and professional investor.




Latest newsCatching up with the list of podcastsI realise that I am shamefully a bit behind with updating subscribers to my website with the latest podcasts I have been doing for the best part of a year now. You can find all the details and a list of the most recent podcasts on the Money Makers website. Typically these run to 30 or 40 minutes and consist of a more detailed and I hope rewarding conversation
Continue reading



NewsletterI write a regular private circulation subscription newsletter, with a regular diary of notes and quotes on investment topics, short Q and As, plus market reviews and the latest performance details of a trio of model investment portfolios I monitor on a regular basis. If you would be interested in joining the circulation list, please either contact me by email or simply go to the Investment Reader website and follow the instructions on the Subscribe Now page.



PodcastsI am now doing regular podcast interviews with leading professional investors – sign up to listen to them for free on the Money Makers website. Find out what the likes of Terry Smith, Peter Warburton, John Kay, Sebastian Lyon and other leading investors think about markets now – essential weekly listening for anyone with a portfolio. If you sign up to my mailing list, you will also be notified every time a new interview has gone live.




What I'm readingMisbehaving by Richard Thaler
Professor Thaler is one of the founders of the new and exciting discipline of behavioural finance which has done so much in the last few years to explain why most human beings make poor investors. In this autobiographical book he tells the story of how a self-confessed lazy academic came to work in this increasingly influential field, and what he and other researchers have learned along the way. A brilliant and highly readable way into the subject for anyone who wants to learn more.



Portfolio watch 
Strategy and tactics

For my own money I run a core portfolio of around 10 long term favourite funds and investment trusts. I then monitor a short list of other securities to use as tactical or (occasionally) speculative overlays, adding or reducing exposure as circumstances require. New additions don’t come round very often: keeping portfolio turnover to a minimum – or “waiting for the fat pitch”, as Warren Buffett puts it – is well documented to be one of the keys to superior investment returns. You can monitor the results in The Investment Reader where I regularly review and update the core portfolio and relevant benchmarks. 



InterviewsTracking your peers
As well as original research, I have always found it pays to stay in touch with what a handful of super-smart professional investors are thinking and (especially) doing. I look to maintain a regular dialogue with a number of fund managers, strategists and media commentators whose work I have come to respect over the years. These often result in good ideas, as well as Q and As that I publish in my newsletter or on the Money Makers website. Two of my recent interviews have been with  Terry Smith, the CEO of Fundsmith (pictured) and veteran investment trust investor Peter Spiller.
