"He is a creative, hands-on, entrepreneurial business leader skilled in all areas of corporate finance. Scott's extensive financial background and experience will benefit InterDigital as we continue to grow our patent licensing and product businesses and build shareholder value.

I look forward to guiding the organization as it continues to increase shareholder value."
