Technology Benefits


The Minerva Endometrial Ablation System is a unique patented technology, based on the goal of achieving higher levels of clinical effectiveness by dramatically improving efficiency of energy delivery. The integration of three separate ablation mechanisms provides a safe and effective means of achieving improved clinical outcomes when treating excessive menstrual bleeding.




Fast Procedure Time – 3 to 4 minute average procedure time (device insertion to device removal).
Silicone Membrane Array – The lubricious nature of silicone facilitates easy insertion, seating, and a non-stick atraumatic removal.
Patented Uterine Integrity Test (UIT) – Automatically checks the integrity of the uterine cavity.
Cervical Sealing Balloon – Seals the cervical canal near the internal os.
No Measurement Entry Needed – No uterine length / width controller entries are required.




3 Mechanisms of Ablation
The Minerva Endometrial Ablation System is intended to ablate the endometrial lining of the uterus in pre-menopausal women with menorrhagia (excessive bleeding) due to benign causes for whom childbearing is complete.
The Minerva Endometrial Ablation System utilizes electrical current to ionize argon gas that is fully contained and circulated within a sealed silicone membrane. When this stretchable silicone membrane is deployed, it conforms to the uterus. When the system is energized, the argon gas is ionized, turning it in to plasma. The argon plasma heats the silicone membrane, and this thermal heat, is conducted to the tissue in contact with the membrane.During the ablation cycle, the Minerva system does not proactively evacuate the liquid contents from the uterine cavity. These liquids remain in the uterine cavity, are heated by the silicone membrane, and the retained heated liquids are used to ablate the endometrial tissue, along with the tissue penetrating bipolar RF current in an impedance-mediated resistive heating environment.
The combination of three mechanisms of ablation creates a uniform and reproducible ablation of the endometrium:


Hot Array Membrane
Plasma releases thermal energy in the form of heat which ablates surrounding endometrial tissue that is in direct contact with the silicone array membrane.

Heated Intra-Cavitary Fluids
Hot retained cavity fluids heated by the membrane ablate tissue not in direct contact with the silicone array membrane.

RF Energy
Endometrial tissue is ablated with penetrating bipolar RF electrical current which also creates Plasma by ionizes the argon (AR) gas that is fully contained in the silicone array membrane.
