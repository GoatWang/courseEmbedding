In a previous article we discussed how rising lease penetration, record CPO demand, and off-lease volume supply were creating an emerging opportunity that looks to be sustainable given previous and current-year market dynamics.

IRVINE, Calif., Sept. 2, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- AutoAlert, the leading provider of cloud-based data mining analytics and dealer portfolio management solutions to automotive retail dealerships throughout North America, announced today that it has named Brian Skutta the Company's new Chief Executive Officer, and appointed Akshaya Mehta to the newly created position of Chief Technology Officer. Boyd Warner, who served as CEO since co-founding the company in 2002, becomes Co-Chairman alongside Steve Young.
"I am delighted to welcome Brian and Akshaya to AutoAlert at this exciting time in the company's evolution," said Warner. "Brian has outstanding leadership skills, strategic vision and a strong track record that will help take AutoAlert forward, while Akshaya's expertise will be critical to the continued enhancement of our industry-leading technology platform."
Skutta has more than a decade of experience and a proven history of successfully managing growth at Cox Automotive. Following positions in business development, management and finance, Skutta led the strategic planning and execution of the Autotrader.Com Trade-In Marketplace, where he held the title Senior Director and General Manager.
Skutta then ran VinSolutions LLC, a founder-owned SaaS Customer Relationship Management solutions company acquired by AutoTrader.com. As Vice President and General Manager he matured and scaled operations of the business, strengthened the management team, and was responsible for doubling the company's revenue in just under two and a half years. In addition, he oversaw the acquisition of Haystak Digital Marketing LLC, a founder-owned business and "tuck in" acquisition to VinSolutions LLC that operates under its own brand.
"AutoAlert's advanced analytics and training capabilities have reshaped how dealers can strategically and effectively engage their customers to create more sales and vehicle acquisition opportunities," said Skutta. "I look forward to working with the team to continue to build on AutoAlert's success in driving the massive opportunity that technology solutions create for our industry."
Mehta brings more than 20 years of technology management and executive experience in the auto industry.  Prior to AutoAlert, Mehta served as Executive Vice President, Technology and Strategic Planning of Vintek Corp., where he led the M&A effort that resulted in the sale of Vintek to Dealertrack. Previous auto industry experience includes tenures as EVP and COO of American Driving Records and vice president of product development and e-commerce services for the Dealer Services Division of ADP.
"Since HGGC's investment, AutoAlert has continued its tremendous growth trajectory," said Steve Young, Co-Chairman of the Board of AutoAlert and Managing Partner of HGGC. "I have no doubt that the addition of Brian and Akshaya will help accelerate the Company's success in delivering best-in-class solutions."

SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TrueCar, Inc. (NASDAQ: TRUE) 
      announced that Brian Skutta, an online automotive and software industry 
      veteran, will become the company’s Executive Vice President of Dealer 
      Sales and Service, a new position created to strengthen relationships 
      and improve services across the TrueCar Certified Dealer network.
    


      Skutta comes to TrueCar from AutoAlert, an Irvine, California-based 
      provider of cloud-based analytics and dealer portfolio management 
      services, where he has been Chief Executive Officer since 2014. He takes 
      up his new role on Feb. 29, and will report to TrueCar President and 
      Chief Executive Officer Chip Perry.
    

      “Brian has an outstanding track record of building innovative digital 
      marketing solutions for dealers and helping them maximize their results 
      from these solutions through strong customer service,” Perry said. “I’m 
      confident that he’ll successfully lead the upcoming expansion of our 
      dealer sales and service teams which is a major part of our strategy for 
      improving the value we provide our dealer customers.”
    

      Skutta’s broad industry knowledge and expertise springs from more than a 
      decade of increasingly responsible leadership roles at AutoTrader.com, 
      where he led the launch and rapid growth of the company’s Trade-In 
      Marketplace; at VINSolutions where he served as Vice President and 
      General Manager following its acquisition by AutoTrader.com; and at 
      AutoAlert where he has been the CEO.
    

      “The opportunity to help advance the TrueCar brand to better serve the 
      needs of both dealers and consumers is exciting,” said Skutta. “As 
      TrueCar’s dynamic platform evolves, I’ll focus on bringing greater 
      balance to the needs of the company’s more than 11,000 Certified Dealers 
      and ensuring that they are maximizing the value TrueCar provides.”
