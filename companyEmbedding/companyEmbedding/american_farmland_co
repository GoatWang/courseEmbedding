Helping farmers for over 30 yearsAmerican Farm Products have been providing superior quality products to farmers for over 30 years. In 1982, convinced there was potential for a company that specilaized in high quailty silage preservates, William Absalom II formed American Farm Products. Since then, American Farm Products has manufactured silage additives and nutritional supplements available in the US, Canada and select countries world wide.

Stand Up®


STAND UP® is our most aggressive therapy for sick young animals.
It is given when a young animal is facing extreme stress resulting in severe scours and dehydration and is in danger of imminent death.It was developed for use as a last resort…when every second counts.If animals have symptoms of scours and dehydration and it is not fixed quickly and correctly they can die in a short period of time. It is important to return their gut to normal function as quickly as possible.
STAND UP® delivers billions of specialized lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as well as the nutrients they need to survive in a hostile environment.
The LAB in STAND UP® produces lactic acid and lowers the pH of the gut, like MAXIBAC® inhibiting the growth of harmful organisms. The LAB also produces some antibodies that additionally help to destroy these organisms.
STAND UP® comes in one size: 30cc syringe. There are 25 syringes in a box and 4 boxes in a case or 100 syringes. Each dose is 15cc (2 doses per syringe). This dose can be repeated in 6 hours if needed.
STAND UP®’s specific LAB are very strong and able to thrive in adverse conditions. They are potent lactic acid producers and some can produce antibodies to help fight infection. The rich nutrient media in STAND UP®, which contains enzymes and co-factors, help the LAB get a strong foothold in the animals gut and overpower harmful organisms.
Available in:30cc syringe  Min 1 box (25 syringes)

Maxibac®


MAXIBAC® is given to mature animals in situations where stress or illness may cause decreased appetite or other digestive problems.Available in 2 sizes:80cc syringe for small animals. Min 1 box (10 syringes)300cc tube for larger animals and high populations. Min 1 box (10 tubes)
In young animals, it is given to prevent or help control scours (diarrhea). Harmful organisms are usually the cause of scours. These organisms require a high pH to live. MAXIBAC® delivers 2 billion specialized lactic acid bacteria to the gut. These lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce lactic acid and lower gut pH.
The lower pH has two beneficial effects:MAXIBAC® tubes contain minerals, vitamins, and a yeast culture that helps to increase appetite and improve health. MAXIBAC® syringes contain minerals, vitamins but do not contain yeast culture because calves are monogastric and will not benefit from yeast supplementation.1. It inhibits the growth of the organisms that cause the scours.
2. It helps digestive enzymes work more effectively so there is better food absorption. This leads to better nutrition and health.
All sizes of MAXIBAC® come in boxes of 10 and a case that contains 5 boxes or 50 units. MAXIBAC® currently comes in 2 sizes:

80cc syringe for small animals.


300cc tube for larger animals and high populations.


The normal dose of MAXIBAC® is 10cc orally.
MAXIBAC® LAB is specifically developed to improve the digestive function in animals and is not by-products used as starter cultures for other fermentations. They have the ability to survive the trip to the gut, adhere to the gut wall, and have some antibiotic resistance.
MAXIBAC® is more effective than products containing billons more bacteria that will not make it to the gut.

After deducting the underwriting discount and commissions, estimated expenses of
this offering and advisory fees of approximately $9.13 million payable by us, we
expect to receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $38.87
million, or approximately $45.57 million if the underwriters' option to purchase
additional shares is exercised in full, based on the initial public offering
price of $8.00 per share. Net proceeds from this offering do not reflect that
the underwriters will not receive any underwriting discount on shares of our
common stock sold, if any, to our executive officers and founders (or their
affiliates) pursuant to any indications of interest.

We intend to contribute the net proceeds from this offering to our operating
partnership in exchange for Common Units, and our operating partnership intends
to use the net proceeds from this offering (i) to pay down $25.0 million of our
revolving credit facilities, (ii) for general corporate and working capital
purposes, including to fund capital expenditures for our existing farms
currently expected to total approximately $7.5 million for 2015, of which
$2.4 million had not yet been expended through June 30, 2015. To the extent we
receive less net proceeds from this offering, our operating partnership will use
a correspondingly lower amount of net proceeds for general corporate and working
capital purposes. To the extent we receive additional net proceeds from this
offering, our operating partnership will pay down a correspondingly higher
amount of outstanding debt under our revolving credit facilities.

As of the date of this prospectus, we had drawn down an aggregate of
approximately $52.2 million under the revolving credit facilities. The original
revolving credit facility of $25 million matures on January 1, 2019 and bears
interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) one quarter of one percent (0.25%) of
the loan amount minus the average outstanding principal balance of the loan of
the prior three (3) month period for unused amounts and (ii) for amounts drawn
upon, the 90 days London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, plus 130 basis points
(1.3%), and as of June 30, 2015, the original revolving credit facility had an
effective annual interest rate on the amount drawn upon of approximately 1.6%.
We make quarterly interest payments pursuant to the original revolving credit
facility on April 1, July 1, October 1 and January 1 of each calendar quarter.
The outstanding borrowings on the original revolving credit facility as of
June 30, 2015 of $24.25 million were primarily used to fund the acquisitions of
Falcon Farms on November 14, 2014 for approximately $8.0 million and the second
parcel of Kimberly Vineyard on December 9, 2014 for approximately $9.8 million,
with the remainder used for general corporate purposes including development
costs. The second revolving credit facility of $25 million matures on January 1,
2020 and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) one quarter of one
percent (0.25%) of the loan amount minus the average outstanding principal
balance of the loan of the prior three (3) month period for unused amounts and
(ii) for amounts drawn upon, the 90 days LIBOR, plus 130 basis points (1.3%),
and as of June 30, 2015, the second revolving credit facility had an effective
annual interest rate of approximately 1.6%. We make quarterly interest payments
pursuant to the second revolving credit facility on April 1, July 1, October 1
and January 1 of each calendar quarter. As of the date of this prospectus, the
outstanding borrowings on the second revolving credit facility of $25 million
were primarily used to fund the acquisitions of the second parcel of Golden
Eagle Ranch and the Kingfisher Ranch property. The third revolving credit
facility of $25 million matures on August 1, 2020 and bears interest at a rate
per annum equal to (i) one quarter of one percent (0.25%) of the loan amount
minus the average outstanding principal balance of the loan of the prior
three (3) month period for unused amounts and (ii) for amounts drawn upon, the
90 day LIBOR, plus 130 basis points (1.3%). We make quarterly interest payments
pursuant to the third revolving credit facility on April 1, July 1, October 1
and January 1 of each calendar year. As of the date of this prospectus, the
outstanding borrowings on the third revolving credit facility of $2.2 million
were used to fund the acquisitions of the second parcel of Golden Eagle Ranch
and the Kingfisher Ranch property. If we are successful in acquiring a portfolio
of properties, although we intend to maintain leverage consistent with our
previously stated leverage range, our leverage may increase significantly over a
shorter period of time than if we acquire properties on a farm by farm basis.


Golden Eagle Ranch

The Property. We acquired separate parcels of Golden Eagle Ranch, a mature
permanent crop farm, in Stanislaus County, California, in March 2012 and August
2012 for a combined purchase price of approximately $16.8 million. On August 18,
2015, we acquired a second farm of 135 gross acres and 130 tillable acres of
almonds, which has been aggregated with Golden Eagle. As of the date of this
prospectus, Golden Eagle Ranch consists of 1,247 gross acres, with 1,186
tillable acres, planted with young and mature almonds. We hold Golden Eagle
Ranch in fee simple through our wholly owned subsidiary Arnold (CA) LLC. On
June 30, 2015, Edwards, Lien & Toso, Inc., an accredited rural appraiser,
concluded that the market value of the property was $28.9 million prior to the
recent acquisition, relying most heavily on the income capitalization approach
to valuation. Golden Eagle Ranch was planted over a period of time to create a
sustainable almond orchard, with replanting originally scheduled to begin after
the 2013 harvest. However, due to a nutrient program utilized by the current
tenant and high almond prices, we have delayed replanting until after the 2015
harvest.

Demand Generators and Competition. While the mature permanent crop farmland
tenant base for nut crops in the region is still developing, we expect a
competitive tenant environment to develop for this property type and believe
there is a strong market already in place for direct operations as well as
associated services, including harvesting, processing (hulling, shelling and
packaging), warehousing, marketing and shipping and there are numerous
vertically integrated corporations that currently farm almonds and are highly
qualified to farm the property as tenants. Additionally, since June 2013, more
than 8.33 million almond trees were sold by California nurseries, a 25% increase
on amount of trees sold from the prior year. Of the sold trees, roughly 24% were
used to replant an orchard, 4% were used to replace trees in existing orchards,
and the remaining 72% were sold for new plantings. The increased trees and
acreage demonstrates grower confidence in the long-term growth of the almond
industry, especially as growers shift more acreage into almond production, which
we believe will generate increased leasing demand for this farm. Currently,
California produces 80% of the world's almond supply. Additionally, almond
prices have been steadily increasing over the past few years, both overseas and
domestically, as almonds are being incorporated into more products
(i.e., nutrition bars and almond milk).

(1) Farm was acquired in two tranches during 2012.

(2) Based on percentage of tillable acres currently leased.

(3) Property has been subject to a crop share lease based on gross revenues and
    starting with the 2015 crop season, is now subject to a flexible lease with
    base and participating components. There was no base rent in the leases from
    2011 to 2013. Crop share lease amounts are largely delayed in revenue
    recognition as almonds sold from the farm are largely sold in the year
    following harvest. For this reason, there is a large increase from 2012 to
    2013. Year ended December 31, 2013 is more representative of our future
    expectations.

Kingfisher Ranch

The Property. We acquired a contiguous tract of land, Kingfisher Ranch, which 
is a mature permanent crop farm, in Fresno County, California, on August 21, 
2015 for a purchase price of approximately $19.6 million. Kingfisher Ranch 
consists of 623 gross acres, with 511 tillable acres, planted with young and
mature pistachios. We hold Kingfisher Ranch in fee simple through our wholly
owned subsidiary Warren (CA) LLC.

Demand Generators and Competition. The United States is the largest supplier of
pistachios, and more than 95% of U.S. pistachios are produced in California
according to USDA data. Demand stems from international markets, who have an 
increasing appetite for nuts, including pistachios, as well as domestically, as
major pistachio producers and the American Pistachio Growers Association have
been proactively marketing pistachios to increase awarenesss and appeal. While
the mature permanent crop farmland tenant base for nut crops in the region is
still developing, we expect a competitive tenant environment to develop for this
property type and believe there is a strong market already in place for direct
operations as well as associated services, including harvesting, processing
(hulling, shelling and packaging), warehousing, marketing and shipping and there
are numerous vertically integrated corporations that are currently farm almonds
and are highly qualified to farm the property as tenants.

Operating and Occupancy Information.

Kingfisher Ranch was acquired on August 21, 2015 and was not leased prior to
acquisition. Therefore, there is no rental revenue, occupancy or leased acreage
information available or applicable for the period presented. Subsequent to the
acquisition, a five year flexible lease, including a base rent component and a
flexible rent component, was put in place on the 432 of the 511 tillable acres
that are currently planted with mature pistachio trees. The remaining 79 acres
are planted with young trees, and will be governed by the lease once mature.

Blue Heron Farms

The Property. We acquired Blue Heron Farms, a mature permanent crop farm, in
Kings County, California, in November 2013 for a purchase price of approximately
$14.0 million. On June 30, 2015, Correia-Xavier Incorporated, an independent
certified general real estate appraiser, concluded that the market value of the
property was $16.0 million, relying most heavily on the comparable sales 
approach to valuation. Blue Heron Farms consists of 430 gross acres, with 380
tillable acres, of young (19%) and mature (81%) walnut trees. We hold Blue Heron
Farms in fee simple through our wholly owned subsidiary Leland (CA) LLC.

Demand Generators and Competition. While the mature permanent crop farmland
tenant base for nut crops in the region is still developing, we expect a
competitive tenant environment to develop for this property type and believe
there is a strong market already in place for direct operations as well as
associated services, including harvesting, processing (hulling, shelling and
packaging) warehousing, marketing and shipping. Additionally, current USDA
estimates for 2014 California walnut production represent a record level of
growth as mild weather during the growing season benefitted production and
allowed for an early harvest and a higher quality crop. Walnut shipments for the
new 2014/2015 crop season are weaker than the prior season due to a decrease in
exports to Asia, slightly offset by an increase in exports to Europe; however,
domestic shipments have increased. We believe that increased production of
walnuts and the quality of the crops will generate increased leasing demand for
this farm.

(1) Farm was acquired during 2013, although we were not entitled to any of the
    participating revenues for the 2013 crop season.

(2) Based on percentage of tillable acres currently leased, excluding 109
    tillable acres for the years ended 2014 and 2013, or 39% of the 380 tillable
    acres, and excluding 71 tillable acres for the six months ended June 30, 
    2015, or 19% of the 380 tillable acres, which are planted with young walnut
    trees that have not yet reached commercial production and are therefore not
    leased.

(3) For the 2013-2014 crop season, the farm was subject to a crop share lease
    with a straight-lined component to make up for a below-market lease.
    Starting with the completion of the 2014 crop season and going forward, the
    farm is subject to a flexible lease, including a base rent component and a
    flexible component based on percentage of gross revenues.

Kane County Farms

The Property. We acquired Kane County Farms, a commodity row crop farm in the
premier corn producing area of North-Central Illinois, in June 2011 for a
purchase price of approximately $17.2 million. Kane County Farms consists of
1,652 gross acres, with 1,617 tillable acres, currently planted with corn in
rotation with soybeans on four separate parcels. We hold Kane County Farms in
fee simple through our wholly owned subsidiary Abraham (IL) LLC. On June 30,
2015, Cochran Ag Services, Inc., an independent Illinois certified general real
estate appraiser, concluded that the market value of the property was
$19.5 million, relying most heavily on the comparable sales approach to
valuation. We have no immediate plans to improve the property. We believe that
there may be some potential for residential development upon disposition in the
future as one parcel abuts the 54th ranked modern golf course, as per Golfweek's
2015 ratings, and with suburban sprawl of the greater Chicago/Aurora
metropolitan area.

Demand Generators and Competition. Kane County Farms is a commodity row crop
farm located in a premier corn-producing area of Illinois for which there is an
established and highly competitive tenant market. Continued global growth in 
population and consumer income and the demand for biofuels (e.g., ethanol from
corn) and the increasing need for feed for livestock, as well as the location 
and high-quality soils (90% Class I) of this property, should, in our opinion,
continue to drive leasing demand for this farm.

The activity of identifying, completing and realizing attractive
acquisitions of farmland is highly competitive, and we are competing for
investment opportunities with many other real estate and farmland investors,
including real estate and farmland funds, individual and institutional
investors, public and private real estate companies and REITS, developers,
municipalities and financial institutions. However, identifying and acquiring
high quality farms of the size we acquire in prime growing regions is more
difficult, and we feel our and our Agricultural Sub-Adviser's deep and local
relationships provide unique access to off-market opportunities, giving us a 
strong competitive advantage. Other investment firms that we might compete
directly against could include agricultural investment firms such as Hancock 
Agricultural Investment Group, UBS Agrivest LLC, Westchester Agricultural Asset
Management, a TIAA—CREF Company. These firms engage in the acquisition, asset
management, valuation and disposition of farms.

In our local markets, we believe that the locations of our farms, as well as the
overall quality and attractiveness of our individual farms, including their
access to adequate water supplies and superior soil quality and suitability for
crop type, enable us to compete effectively for tenants. Because our revenue
potential may be linked to the success of our tenants, depending on the
particular lease structure in place, we may indirectly share exposure to the
same competitive factors that our tenants experience in their respective markets
when trying to sell their harvest. While our tenants do not typically compete
with particular farms or farmers, oversupply of a particular crop or a decrease
in exports for such crop, resulting from increased yields from other farmers
both domestically and internationally, may affect the prices of our tenants'
crops.


Company Description
We are an internally managed real estate company that owns a diversified
portfolio of high-quality farmland, consisting of mature permanent,
specialty/vegetable row and commodity row crop farms, as well as farmland
development projects, which is located in select major agricultural regions in
the


 United States. We seek to provide our stockholders with a combination of
(i) current income from renting our stable portfolio of mature farms and
(ii) capital appreciation, partially driven by our ability to develop properties
to maximize their value. We lease our farms to professional farmer tenants under
a variety of lease structures with staggered durations, including fixed and
participating leases, which typically consist of fixed base rent and
participating revenue components. Approximately 45.6% of our 2014 contractual
rent and 50.1% of our contractual rent through the second quarter of 2015 was
comprised of fixed and base rent, some of which has annual escalators. In
addition, our participating leases typically require our professional farmer
tenants to obtain crop insurance, which seeks to protect the stability of our
cash flow. We are a Maryland corporation and aim to be the leading farmland REIT
to be traded on a U.S. stock exchange with a highly diversified portfolio,
scalable platform and a unique investment focus on permanent,
specialty/vegetable, development and commodity row crop farmland throughout the
U.S.

Our business strategy is to generate stable and growing cash flow and capital
appreciation for our stockholders. To implement our business strategy, we adhere
to four core principles: (i) diversification, (ii) high-quality standards, (iii)
a value-added approach and (iv) risk management. As of the date of this
prospectus, our portfolio is comprised of 18 farms with an appraised value of
$207.7 million, and approximately 16,136 gross acres with more than 21 crop
varieties, some of which are planted in rotation, in Alabama, Arkansas,
California, Florida, Georgia and Illinois. Each farm, other than those acquired
between the fourth quarter 2014 and the date of this prospectus (which are held
at cost), was appraised as of June 30, 2015, by an independent appraisal firm
employing a state certified appraiser with local expertise and who is certified
as either an A.R.A. (Accredited Rural Appraiser) or M.A.I. (Member of the
Appraisal Institute), or state certified as a Certified General Real Estate
Appraiser.

Summary property information by crop type for farms held as of the date of this
prospectus is shown below:

(1) Total cost includes contracted purchase price, closing costs and other
    acquisition costs as of the date of this prospectus, plus capital
    expenditures as of June 30, 2015 and includes purchase price and preliminary
    closing costs for the two properties purchased in August 2015. Total
    development capital expenditures from inception through June 30, 2015 were
    $22.2 million.

(2) Current appraised value is based on third-party appraisals as of June 30,
    2015 for all of our farms, excluding our Falcon Farms property, the second
    parcel acquired for our Kimberly Vineyard property, the second parcel of our
    Golden Eagle Ranch property and our Kingfisher Ranch property, which are
    each valued at cost due to the timing of the acquisitions.

(3) Same property rental yield, or SPRY, refers to the aggregate of fixed and
    participating rents received from all properties (excluding development
    properties) owned for the entirety of both (i) the time frame being
    presented and (ii) the same prior time frame (i.e., if SPRY is being
    presented for calendar year 2014, all properties included will have been
    owned for the full calendar years of 2014 and 2013), divided by the average
    aggregate costs of such properties over the relevant time period.

(4) Actual allocations may vary from the above targets over time based on
    different appraisal rates and market opportunities.

(5) Early on in the development lifecycle, farmland development is typically
    appraised at or below cost given the lack of comparable sales among other
    factors, resulting in a potentially negative variance between Total Cost and
    Current Appraised Value. We believe this is potentially a source of
    increasing value over time, given the value of the improvements made to the
    farm and additional income generation once the farms are productive and are
    leased to tenants.

Mission & History



Our MissionThe mission of American Farmland Trust is to save the land that sustains us by protecting farmland, promoting sound farming practices, and keeping farmers on the land.




Our HistoryAmerican Farmland Trust (AFT) began in 1980 after a small group of farmers and conservationists asked an important question: What will happen to the nation's food supply if we continue to wastefully develop our best farm and ranch land?Peggy McGrath Rockefeller, the wife of philanthropist David Rockefeller, was one of AFT's founding members. Peggy was a dedicated and accomplished farmer, raising purebred cattle on farms in Maine and upstate New York. Guided by Rockefeller, noted soil conservationist Norm Berg, California farmer Ralph Grossi, and others, AFT focused in the early years on pioneering programs around the country that use a powerful tool – conservation easements – to make the nation's best farmland off limits to developers.From the early days, AFT has been a strong advocate for voluntary conservation practices and programs that preserve not just land but also our precious soil and water supplies.

American Farmland Company, an internally managed REIT with
farmland in California, Illinois and Florida, filed on Friday with
the SEC to raise up to $100 million in an initial public offering.



The last farm-focused REIT was Farmland Partners (
FPI

), which went public in April 2014 and now trades 16% below its
offer price.



The New York, NY-based company, which was founded in 2009 and
booked $8 million in sales for the 12 months ended March 31, 2015,
plans to list on the NYSE under the symbol AFCO. Deutsche Bank,
Raymond James and FBR Capital Markets are the joint bookrunners on
the deal. No pricing terms were disclosed.

American Farmland Sets Terms for IPO

By Chris Lange October 6, 2015 12:05 pm EDT

American Farmland Company has filed an amended S-11 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its initial public offering. In the filing 12 million units are being offered in an expected price range of $8.50 to $10.50, with an overallotment option for an additional 1.8 million units. At the maximum price, the entire offering is valued up to $144.9 million. The company intends to file on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AFCO.
The underwriters for the offering are Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, Raymond James, RBC Capital Markets, FBR, Janney Montgomery Scott, Oppenheimer and Wunderlich. 


This is an internally managed real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns a diversified portfolio of high-quality farmland, consisting of mature permanent, specialty/vegetable row and commodity row crop farms, as well as farmland development projects, which is located in select major agricultural regions in the United States.
Basically, the company invests in the U.S. agricultural sector, not necessarily in development, but to generate rental income and have the potential for capital appreciation. Land operated or owned as part of a farm in the country as of the end of 2014 was more than $2.7 trillion, and the total value of agricultural sector production grown in 2014 was estimated to be $465 billion.

In the filing the company said:
We seek to provide our stockholders with a combination of (i) current income from renting our stable portfolio of mature farms and (ii) capital appreciation, partially driven by our ability to develop properties to maximize their value. We lease our farms to professional farmer tenants under a variety of lease structures with staggered durations, including fixed and participating leases, which typically consist of fixed base rent and participating revenue components. Approximately 45.6% of our 2014 contractual rent and 50.1% of our contractual rent through the second quarter of 2015 was comprised of fixed and base rent, some of which has annual escalators. In addition, our participating leases typically require our professional farmer tenants to obtain crop insurance, which seeks to protect the stability of our cash flow. We are a Maryland corporation and aim to be the leading farmland REIT to be traded on a U.S. stock exchange with a highly diversified portfolio, scalable platform and a unique investment focus on permanent, specialty/vegetable, development and commodity row crop farmland throughout the U.S.
The company intends to contribute the net proceeds from this offering to its operating partnership in exchange for common units. The operating partnership intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to pay down its revolving credit facilities, for working capital and for general corporate purposes.

        Excellent quality that lasts for an odd use
I'm impressed. I purchased this about 4 years ago and used it as a base to a fountain in my front yard.  It handles winter with no issues and blistering hot summer days with ease.

            Can this be used with saltwater aquariums? (sump, refugium, etc.)  My concern is if the material would corrode or react with the saltwater.

            Can this drain plug be easily removed &amp; than placed back in? Also what is the hole size? I'm aiming towards removing plug and running a pond pump to move water thru a waterfall. Would this work?
        


Asked by: BeckW

            Yes, the drain plug is removable, it simply screws in. The sizing is 1&quot;.

            How do people usually carry these back home?  Would it fit on top of a minivan?  If on a pickup, is it placed on it sides?
        


Asked by: joe blonski

            We would recommend picking up and transporting the Round Plastic Tank in the back of a pickup and placing on its side.

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35. There may be additional surcharges to ship to one of these areas, and this information will appear when you check out with your purchase.Show moreElectrode, Comp-166904561, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
