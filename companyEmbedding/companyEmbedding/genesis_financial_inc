Consumer Financing for Merchants and Healthcare Providers



















Expand your customer base, build your business
Offering credit to under served consumers not only provides them the purchasing power they need, but also builds the foundation for a long-term relationship that keeps them coming back to you rather than going to your competitors.
Through the Genesis Credit program, healthcare practices, merchants and retailers can provide financing solutions, such as installment credit, to customers who are typically turned down by other financing programs. This allows you to reach more prospects and customers with non-prime credit, and increase the volume of goods and services you are able to sell.
We know your industry
From home furnishings to home improvement to healthcare providers to fine jewelry; our clients look to Genesis Financial Solutions to save time and grow revenue. We realize the role that consumer credit plays in your success, so we offer both installment and revolving programs along with flexible payment plans and attractive promotions.
Your customers will appreciate Genesis Financial Solutions for a number of reasons, starting with our approach to customer service. We strive to deliver a customer experience equal to or better than any "prime" finance company. Equally important, your customers will appreciate the ability to spread payments out over time in a way that better fits monthly budgets, smoothing out the spending spikes that often accompany life’s significant milestones and unexpected events.
End-to-end financing programs
Genesis Financial Solutions full-service credit platform allows us to offer financing solutions for many of your customers’ needs. Our capabilities cover the lifespan of account management including:

Point-of-sale or web integration
Collaboration on best practices in marketing consumer credit
In store staff training and support
Receivables funding
High-touch customer on-boarding
Customer service for partners and customers available 7 days a week
Competitive product pricing











Explore the benefits of consumer financing








Attract more qualified prospects and meet the consumer credit demands of your current customers or patients.
Provide credit to those who may have been turned down by other lenders; prospective buyers with less than perfect credit. Consumers with:

Histories that have resulted in a low credit score
Limited credit experience (students, young adults, individuals who are new to credit)
Insufficient credit from traditional lenders to complete their desired purchase
