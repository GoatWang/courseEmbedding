FEATURED RELEASE   PetLife Announces Its All-Natural “Cancer Cocktail” with Applicability to Pet and Human Markets
 
The Company may be the first to offer an all-natural “cancer cocktail” combining the therapeutic benefits of the plant and animal kingdoms.
 
HANCOCK, MD — June 14, 2017 — PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB: PTLF) (the “Company”), a developer of a new generation of high potency veterinary cancer medications and nutraceuticals for pets, reports on its solution to the ever increasing problem of drug resistance and high toxicity in the treatment of cancer in pets and humans.   Each year, in the U.S. alone, more than eleven million cases of cancer in dogs and cats are reported, a number that continues to increase annually.

PetLife’s new patent-pending formulation has created a “cancer cocktail” combining both Blue Scorpion Venom Chlorotoxin with plant-based phytonutrients.  Preliminary testing has shown inhibition against certain cancer cell line studies without toxicity.  Across the world, researchers have recognized that many cells which cause disease to have the ability to become resistant to treatment when only one drug is used.  Combination therapy is increasing recommended for the treatment of both neoplastic (cancer) and infectious disease.  The “HIV Cocktail,” which changed the world approach to the treatment of HIV, is a similar approach comparison.  PetLife’s new “cancer cocktail” may prove to be the non-toxic alternative to the harmful and sometimes deadly side effects of radiation and chemotherapy.   The patent pending formulation of PetLife’s new “cancer cocktail” has the curious ability to bind selectively to cancer cells and inhibit their growth demonstrating little to no side effects to the patient.
 
For hundreds, if not thousands of years, plant-based medicinals have formed the foundation of therapeutic treatment in the Chinese, Native American and Ayurvedic traditions.  More recently, scientists have discovered the mode of action of many of these therapies.  In many cases, the chemical compounds have been manipulated or synthesized to create new chemical entitles (“NCE”).  Along with the creation of NCEs comes the inherent risk of unintended consequences and adverse reactions.  By maintaining an all-natural formulation, PetLife intends to capture the therapeutic benefit of plant-based therapy without the creation of any unintended consequences. Our team has identified certain phytonutrients which can work synergistically with Blue Scorpion Venom for inhibition of cancer cell growth. 
“Our new formulation, RX002CxN, will become the basis of PetLife Pharmaceutical’s new product portfolio, VitalzulTM., a novel treatment option for the treatment of cancer and potentially other indications.  The low toxicity of our formulation gives additional benefit.  Given the comparative biology of animals and humans, it is our hope that success in treatment of cancer in animals will lead to similar results in humans.  Our new formulation has been designed with both human and animal applications in mind.  Once testing is completed, the Company will strategically determine the best course of development in both the pet and human markets,” stated Dr. Vivekananda Ramana, Chief Medical Officer of the Company.  

“This groundbreaking, patent pending bio technology will serve as the core ingredient in our pharma product Vitalzul™ once we complete the much anticipated FDA trials.   It is well known that animal research and studies are the foundation of human applications.  Our first goal is to complete the successful testing, FDA application, and commercialization for the benefit of animals.  Then, we will move aggressively in expanding our research in the human arena, where we anticipate strong interest from industry leaders,” added Dr. Salvagno.

 NEW FRONTIER IN PET ONCOLOGICAL TREATMENT
A new generation of high potency veterinary cancer medications and nutraceuticals for pets




 PetLife Announces Its All-Natural “Cancer Cocktail” with Applicability to Pet and Human Markets
The Company may be the first to offer an all-natural “cancer cocktail” combining the therapeutic benefits of the plant and animal kingdoms.

PetLife's new patent-pending formulation has created a 'cancer cocktail' combining both Blue Scorpion Venom Chlorotoxin with plant-based phytonutrients. Preliminary testing has shown inhibition against certain cancer cell line studies without toxicity. Across the world, researchers have recognized that many cells which cause disease, have the ability to become resistant to treatment when only one drug is used. Combination therapy is increasing, recommended for the treatment of both neoplastic (cancer) and infectious disease. The 'HIV Cocktail', which changed the world's approach to the treatment of HIV, is a similar approach comparison. PetLife's new 'cancer cocktail' may prove to be the non-toxic alternative to the harmful and sometimes deadly side effects of radiation and chemotherapy. The patent pending formulation of PetLife's new 'cancer cocktail' has the curious ability to bind selectively to cancer cells and inhibit their growth demonstrating little to no side effects to the patient. 








 



 



 



 

 Applying science to discover therapies that significantly improve 
and extend pets lives.

It is estimated that 70-80 million dogs and 74-96 million cats are owned in the United States.
Every day 10,000 dogs and 6,000 cats are diagnosed with cancer.

PetLife Pharmaceuticals' CEO, Dr. Ralph Salvagno, Issues Letter to Shareholders


HANCOCK, MD / ACCESSWIRE / July 20, 2017 / PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB: PTLF) (the "Company"), a developer of a new generation of high potency veterinary cancer medications and nutraceuticals for pets, has issued a letter to its shareholders from Ralph Salvagno, MD, CEO and Chairman of the Company, as follows:
Dear PetLife Pharmaceuticals Shareholder:
PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("PetLife") continues to make progress towards our goal of bringing effective, affordable and safe products to our companion animals and their pet families.
Our recent acquisition of Dr. Geoff's pet food product line has the team working to build out the appropriate materials for test marketing and sales within the next 3 months. The team has worked to establish the manufacturing and distribution channels necessary for success as well as having identified strategic partners for advertising and promotion. PetLife Advisory Board member and world renown Veterinarian, Dr. Geoffrey Broderick, continues to promote the new brand, "Dr. Geoff's by PetLife," as well as drawing attention to the work being done by PetLife for the treatment of cancer through VITAZULTM.
We have engaged our in-country team for the development of our PetLife Scorpion Ranch. Scorpions have been collected and plans continue to have the ranch fully functional and extracting venom within 60-90 days. Venom is one of the world's most precious liquids and is valued at over $7,000 /gm ($198,000/oz.). PetLife intends to use all its production of venom on proprietary PetLife products for the treatment of cancer and intends to continue research on Vitalzul™'s potential as a cancer preventative.
Management expresses its disappointment at the recent stock performance. We recognize that there are forces in play that hope to capitalize on the volatility in small cap markets. The Company also recognizes that the fundamentals of our research, our patent pending technology, our mission, and our team, should outweigh any short-term trends in stock price. PetLife will be "on the road" in the next several weeks to bring our message to investors on the west coast. The schedule of "road shows" will be published as soon as it is finalized.
The Company continues to investigate strategic partnerships that will enhance the mission and value of the Company. As these relationships develop beyond the discussion phase, the Company will make this information public, as appropriate. The Company is actively seeking partnerships in nutraceutical and complementary products. We recognize the unmet need for safe and effective products for treatment of arthritis, autoimmune and neuromuscular diseases and are working to develop solutions based on our patent pending technology.
On behalf of the PetLife team, I appreciate your continued support in our goal of improving the quality of life for our companion animals and the families that love them.
Sincerely, 
Ralph Salvagno, MD 
CEO and Chairman

PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB: PTLF) Breaking News -
June 14, 2017
 


PetLife Announces Its All-Natural 
“Cancer Cocktail” with Applicability to Pet and Human Markets 






The Company may be the first to 
offer an all-natural “cancer cocktail” combining the therapeutic benefits of the 
plant and animal kingdoms.





HANCOCK, MD - June 14, 2017 - PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB:
PTLF) (the 
"Company"), a developer of a new generation of high potency veterinary cancer 
medications and nutraceuticals for pets, reports on its solution to the ever 
increasing problem of drug resistance and high toxicity in the treatment of 
cancer in pets and humans. Each year, in the U.S. alone, more than eleven 
million cases of cancer in dogs and cats are reported, a number that continues 
to increase annually.

PetLife’s new patent-pending formulation has created a “cancer cocktail” 
combining both Blue Scorpion Venom Chlorotoxin with plant-based phytonutrients. 
Preliminary testing has shown inhibition against certain cancer cell line 
studies without toxicity. Across the world, researchers have recognized that 
many cells which cause disease to have the ability to become resistant to 
treatment when only one drug is used. Combination therapy is increasing 
recommended for the treatment of both neoplastic (cancer) and infectious 
disease. The “HIV Cocktail,” which changed the world approach to the treatment 
of HIV, is a similar approach comparison. PetLife’s new “cancer cocktail” may 
prove to be the non-toxic alternative to the harmful and sometimes deadly side 
effects of radiation and chemotherapy. The patent pending formulation of 
PetLife’s new “cancer cocktail” has the curious ability to bind selectively to 
cancer cells and inhibit their growth demonstrating little to no side effects to 
the patient.

For hundreds, if not thousands of years, plant-based medicinals have formed the 
foundation of therapeutic treatment in the Chinese, Native American and 
Ayurvedic traditions. More recently, scientists have discovered the mode of 
action of many of these therapies. In many cases, the chemical compounds have 
been manipulated or synthesized to create new chemical entitles (“NCE”). Along 
with the creation of NCEs comes the inherent risk of unintended consequences and 
adverse reactions. By maintaining an all-natural formulation, PetLife intends to 
capture the therapeutic benefit of plant-based therapy without the creation of 
any unintended consequences. Our team has identified certain phytonutrients 
which can work synergistically with Blue Scorpion Venom for inhibition of cancer 
cell growth. 

“Our new formulation, RX002CxN, will become the basis of PetLife 
Pharmaceutical’s new product portfolio, VitalzulTM., a novel treatment option 
for the treatment of cancer and potentially other indications. The low toxicity 
of our formulation gives additional benefit. Given the comparative biology of 
animals and humans, it is our hope that success in treatment of cancer in 
animals will lead to similar results in humans. Our new formulation has been 
designed with both human and animal applications in mind. Once testing is 
completed, the Company will strategically determine the best course of 
development in both the pet and human markets,” stated Dr. Vivekananda Ramana, 
Chief Medical Officer of the Company. 

“This groundbreaking, patent pending bio technology will serve as the core 
ingredient in our pharma product Vitalzul™ once we complete the much anticipated 
FDA trials. It is well known that animal research and studies are the foundation 
of human applications. Our first goal is to complete the successful testing, FDA 
application, and commercialization for the benefit of animals. Then, we will 
move aggressively in expanding our research in the human arena, where we 
anticipate strong interest from industry leaders,” added Dr. Salvagno.

PetLife Completes Its TV 
Commercial for Newly Acquired Dr. Geoff's by PetLife, Preparing for Regional 
Launch 




Clip of TV Commercial at 
http://www.petlifepharma.com/drg







HANCOCK, MD - June 6, 2017 - PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB:
PTLF) (the 
"Company"), a developer of a new generation of high-potency veterinary cancer 
medications and nutraceuticals for pets, announced today that its wholly owned 
subsidiary, Dr. Geoff's by PetLife, Inc. ("Dr. Geoff's by PetLife"), PetLife's 
product line of natural pet food, supplements, and treats, has initiated its 
comprehensive product rollout.

The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, will proceed with an initial 
regional pilot launch, followed by a national rollout. The introductory product 
launch will focus on two Superfood Supplements: ImmunoPower™ and Antioxidant 
Boost™, and several canned food products, with extensive plans for product line 
expansion.

ImmunoPower™ is a unique, proprietary blend of micro-ingredients that equips the 
pet's body with the nutrients to support overall well-being and is formulated to 
deliver as much antioxidant power as possible.

Antioxidant Boost™ uses the power of antioxidant vitamins, antioxidant chelated 
minerals, phytonutrients, digestive enzymes and probiotics combined in this 
unique super-food.

The TV commercial for the product launch has been prepared and completed by a 
world-class production and media team. Media buys are currently being sourced to 
provide the best value. For a short segment view of the TV commercial, visit: 
http://www.petlifepharma.com/drg/. This TV commercial will be incorporated into 
an infomercial and promoted through 
social media.

"The strategic advantage of launching our food product in advance of the 
anticipated FDA approved Vitalzul™ is that it provides the Company the advantage 
of revenues, profits and enhanced cash flow," stated Dr. Ralph Salvagno, CEO of 
PetLife. "Brand awareness is a key component for success given the competitive 
market in the pet food industry. We believe that our core product, Vitalzul™, 
when infused into pet food, will create an extraordinary, proprietary and world 
class product for pets and their owners. The Company plans to offer two 
additional food products infused with Vitalzul™: a veterinary prescribed, 
therapeutic form for pets with cancer, and a product proposed as a preventive 
for older dogs. Statistically, 49% of dogs and 38% of cats will be stricken with 
some form of cancer after the age of 10."

PetLife plans to roll out a complete line of 25 foods, treats, supplements, and 
pet accessories. These include nutraceuticals, shampoos, creams, sprays, and 
other natural products for dogs and cats. PetLife is in discussions with third 
parties to provide specific complementary products that would not be "just 
another product on the shelf" but those that have proprietary properties that 
will enhance PetLife's reputation as a quality provider of natural-based 
solutions for animal diseases and conditions.

PetLife Files for Patent for 
the Treatment of Cancer for Pets






HANCOCK, MD - May 30, 2017 - PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB:
PTLF) (the 
"Company"), a developer of a new generation of high potency veterinary cancer 
medications and nutraceuticals for pets, announced today that they have filed 
for patent protection in India and the United States for the formula for 
VitalZul™.

The Company, through an officer of the Company, has filed for a patent in India 
titled, A Composition for Targeting Cancer in Canines and Humans. The patent 
protection is for both process and composition thus protecting not only the 
physical elements of our formulation but also the process by which they are 
combined. The patent formulation is intended for both animal and human use, 
pending further testing.

The filing in the United States was titled the same as the India patent with the 
same attributes as filed in India.

The elements of the formulation of VitalZul™ have been shown to have extremely 
minimal toxicity. The components of the formulation are natural, not synthetic.

Dr. Ralph Salvagno, CEO of PetLife, stated, "Our team of scientists and 
researchers in India and in the U.S. have worked diligently to bring VitalZul™ 
to the next stage of our growth plan. With the patents filed, we will continue 
the course towards our FDA application. The goal is to bring VitalZul™ to market 
by the end of 2018."

PetLife Management Comments on 
Recent Market Activity






HANCOCK, MD - May 28, 2017 - PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB:
PTLF) (the 
"Company"), a developer of a new generation of high potency veterinary cancer 
medications and nutraceuticals for pets, announced the Company's comments on 
recent developments in its stock price and trading performance.

The Company is confident that the main reason of the investors' interest in its 
stock is our business performance, which is reflected on the Company's website 
and its press releases (http://www.petlifepharma.com/investor-relations/), as 
well as has been presented to numerous investors during road shows conducted by 
the Company in several cities. We have been pleased to announce a string of 
positive developments with our business, which we believe to have been the 
procuring cause of investors' buying our stock at or about the times when the 
Company announced such good business-related news or has investor presentations. 
At the same time, we became aware of the efforts to promote our stock by various 
penny stock-touting websites, newsletter publishers and IR marketing services, 
unknown to and unaffiliated with the Company. We first noticed that activity in 
February 2017, and observed the same type of efforts recently.

It is our understanding that such promotional activities happen when companies 
quoted on OTC Markets publish news, which cause the prices of their respective 
stocks to move. Third party stock promoters scan the market, mention stocks, 
which they find on the move, to their subscribers, claim credit for such moves, 
and solicit payments from both subscribers and others.

We do not believe that such promotional activities unauthorized, unrelated to, 
and not approved by the Company, can cause a significant number of investors to 
buy our stock. We strongly believe that the main reasons for the investors 
buying the stock of our Company have been our business performance reflected in 
press releases and presented to multiple accredited investors during our road 
shows. Unfortunately, the activities of third party stock promoters seeking to 
exploit positive developments in our business and appreciation of our stock 
price have a clear adverse effect on our stock price as follows. Apparently, 
market makers engaged in predatory short selling are among the most active 
subscribers to the services of such stock promoters. For example, our stock 
price moved up recently as the result of the positive press release published on 
May 23, 2017. That was picked up and exploited by some stock-touting websites 
and already on May 25, 2017 (according to FINRA's web page tracking the 
short-selling at http://regsho.finra.org/FORFshvol20170525.txt), 226,257 shares 
of our stock were sold short in one day. That is 60% of the daily volume of 
trading on that date. We have also observed what appears to be a very active 
short-selling activity on May 26, 2017, when another positive press release 
caused our stock price to move up. The Company may be addressing this with the 
market regulators, including 
naming the most active short-selling market makers, in a hope that both OTC 
Marketplace and FINRA interfere with their predatory market price manipulations.

It is our obligation to OTC Marketplace and the investors to hereby state that 
after inquiry of the Management of the Company, we have determined that the 
directors, control persons, its officers, directors, or any controlling 
shareholders (defined as shareholders owning 10% or more of the Company's 
securities) have not, directly, or indirectly, been involved in any way 
(including payment of a third-party), with the creation or distribution of 
promotional materials related to the Company and its securities. Furthermore, 
after inquiry of management, we have determined that the directors and control 
persons, the Company, its officers, directors or any controlling shareholders 
have sold or purchased the Company's securities within the past 90 days.

In order to further address the concerns related to the unauthorized promotional 
activities the Company will be putting out a SEC Form 8-K enumerating all the 
relevant press releases as well as naming the list of third party providers 
engaged by the Company to provide investor relations services, public relations 
services, marketing, or other related services, including the promotion of the 
Company or its securities, since January 1, 2016. We are also planning to 
address in the same SEC Form 8-K filing, the detailed information about shares 
or convertible instruments issued by the Company allowing conversion to equity 
securities at prices constituting a discount to the current market rate at the 
time of the issuance.

Furthermore, the Company needs to draw attention of some materially inaccurate 
and outdated information, which has been included in the unauthorized and 
unapproved disseminations. In particular, the mentioning of "Gain" of 349% 
relating to a historical stock price is materially incorrect as it fails to 
account for a 5:1 reverse merger that occurred during the interval in question. 
Additionally, as part of our negotiations with our former CEO, we have removed 
all mentions of Escozine from the approved Company literature, including any 
claims made by the manufacturer of Escozine. The Company abandoned the use of 
the term "organic" in its authorized publications. The use of the term "Escozine 
for Pets" was abandoned by the Company in favor of VitalzulTM. The Company does 
not currently describe its products as "a preventative and treatment for 
cancer." Additionally, the Company has no opinion on the accuracy of any 
technical analysis represented in some unauthorized disseminations. No technical 
analysis has been performed by the Company regarding its stock.

PetLife Explores New Scorpion 
Venom-Based Therapies for Growing Product Line






HANCOCK, MD - May 26, 2017 - PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB:
PTLF) (the 
"Company"), a developer of a new generation of high potency veterinary cancer 
medications and nutraceuticals for pets, announced today that they are exploring 
various new products for their product line.

PetLife research has verified that scorpion venoms may also have antibacterial 
and anti-inflammatory properties. The action of most venoms may be due to the 
primary toxin but, also is likely influenced by other components in the venom. 
These components, even in small quantities, may hold the key to the true action 
of scorpion venom. The advantages of using natural venom, as opposed to 
synthetic venom, is that all components of the venom are included in the 
therapeutic formulation. The effect of certain venoms as anti-tumor agents has 
been cited in the literature. Aside from the known anti-tumorigenic action of 
the primary toxin, other components of the venom may explain the venom's action 
on other disease 
state cells. The PetLife research team is evaluating the potential for scorpion 
venom-based therapy for common companion pet diseases, such as Lyme disease and 
arthritis.

Dr. Ralph Salvagno, CEO of PetLife, stated, "Traditionally, research in scorpion 
venom therapy has centered around the treatment of 'envenomation,' which is the 
scientific name for scorpion stings. Our research team recognizes the potential 
benefit of scorpion venom for the treatment of significant medical conditions 
that affect our pets and will continue with their research in this field. We 
hope to be able to add non-toxic natural-based treatment for several diseases to 
our portfolio in the future."

About PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:

The Company

PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a registered U.S. Veterinary Pharmaceutical 
company whose mission is to bring its scientifically proven, bioactive 
medication and nutraceuticals -- “Vitalzul™” -- to the world of veterinary 
oncology. The Company specializes in the research, development, sales and 
support of advanced drugs and nutraceuticals for pet cancer and autoimmune 
related diseases such as arthritis.

PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Petlife” with the trading symbol OTCQB: PTLF) 
has developed a new advanced generation of potentiated veterinary cancer 
medications and nutraceuticals based on the Company’s formula of Blue Scorpion 
venom and other natural compounds. 

Petlife's products have shown the potential to prevent and treat cancer, as well 
as to dramatically improve quality of life and extend the longevity of pets with 
cancer. This is accomplished without the harmful side effects of conventional 
chemotherapy and other traditional treatment programs. Nutraceuticals, food, pet 
treats, and the anticipated registration of an FDA approved drug for the 
treatment of cancer in animals are all in the works today. 

PetLife is building a team of industry leaders with the primary goal of 
diversifying its core product line. There are many opportunities available in 
the pharmaceutical space for introducing new and improved drugs to treat the 
most common diseases facing our companion pets and animals today. PetLife’s 
mission is to identify, perfect, and bring these opportunities to market with 
the goal of improving the quality of life in our companion animals. 

What will the Company do?

PetLife, which the name defines the intent of the Company, plans to address 
cancer in dogs and cats. Many pet owners have already dealt with cancer and 
their beloved pet. PetLife, managed by pet lovers, desires to provide pet owners 
options to prevent and/or assist with, cancer in their pet. 

Most people grew up with a pet and still have a pet. Pet owners, as the 
marketplace indicates strongly, will do anything for their pet. If PetLife can 
provide quality of life for the pet suffering, even prolonging life with 
quality, much less help prevent potential cancer, then the Company, its 
management, and its shareholders will benefit in two ways: 1) helping pet owners 
and their pet, and 2) creating a success, job creating company that will be 
respected in the industry.

The PetLife Team

The management of the Company is Ralph T. Salvagno, MD (Chief Executive 
Officer), Dr. Vivek Ramana (Chief Medical Officer), and Clifford H. Price (Vice 
President of Sales & Marketing).

Operations and Manufacturing The Company uses a manufacturing facility that is 
certified in CMC (certified manufacturing control), GMP (good manufacturing 
practice), GLP (good laboratory practice) under international guidelines meeting 
FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) standards.

The Science

For millennia, the scorpion has been steeped in mystery. The pursuit of its 
secret healing properties has been the focus of many generations.

From scorpion fossils in the Silurian period, 430 million years ago, to the 
Pharaohs and Chinese dynasties to Cuban and Dominican traditional remedies, 
scorpion venom is now the focus of today’s modern, scientifically based research 
across the globe. The interest has been so great that several EU countries 
formed Venomics, sponsored by the French government to specifically study and 
identify the therapeutic possibilities of all known venoms including Scorpion 
Venom.

The University of Chicago, Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles, Cornell University, 
Michigan State University and the University of Washington have extensively 
researched the therapeutic effects of scorpion venom. 


Scientists at PetLife have taken this research to another level. Instead of 
separating the single molecule from the original complex natural structure and 
synthesizing it, our scientists decided to keep the scorpion peptide in its 
original form since the mechanism of action of the scorpion venom is 
multi-dimensional and complex.

Since the histology (cellular biology) of humans, dogs and cats is quite similar 
at the molecular level, and given the growing body of new preclinical research 
demonstrating the effectiveness of polarized scorpion venom in human malignancy, 
many companion animal owners as well as veterinarians have been drawn to use 
Vitalzul for Pets™.

Applying science to discover therapies that significantly improve
and extend pets lives.

How many companion animals are diagnosed with cancer each year?
It is estimated that 70-80 million dogs and 74-96 million cats are owned in the 
United States.

Every day 10,000 dogs and 6,000 cats are diagnosed with cancer.

PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PTLF) is a registered U.S. Veterinary 
Pharmaceutical company. PetLife's mission is to bring its new, non-toxic, 
bioactive nutraceuticals and prescription medications to the world of veterinary 
oncology with the ultimate goal of preventing cancer and extending the life of 
pets suffering from cancer while improving their quality of life. The Company’s 
first product, Vitalzul™, is currently in testing. Vitalzul’s™ active 
ingredients have been shown to have activity against several different cancer 
cell lines.

is anticipated to begin FDA trials in the upcoming months. The drug is an 
all-natural compound. The FDA trials are estimated to take approximately 18-24 
months. PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a publicly traded company. The stock 
symbol is PTLF on the OTCQB market. PetLife is a new biotech company developing

VET ENDORSEMENTS

Dr. Joel Beth Mitchell-Navratik

Bootsy is almost 17 years old and I have been treating her since she was an 
8-week-old kitten. In July 2014 Bootsy came in for not feeling well and she had 
labored breathing. Chest radiographs showed a large pulmonary mass. 

Bootsy also has well controlled hyperthyroidism, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 
chronic renal disease. At the time of diagnosis, Bootsy was almost 15 years old. 
Based on additional diagnostics including, and abdominal ultrasound, and other 
laboratory tests, the tumor appeared to only be in the lung lobe and had not yet 
spread. I had given her a few months to live. Needless to say, Ms. Blessing was 
devastated. All of the current treatment options which included a thoracotomy to 
remove the lung lobe, chemo or radiation were all more than what the owner 
wanted. Ms. Blessing did not want to pursue surgery due to her advanced age and 
multiple health issues, and did not want to do chemotherapy due to the possible 
side effects. 

She inquired about alternative treatment and an associate of mine prescribed 
some Chinese herbs, but she did not tolerate them well. A few days later she had 
an episode of heavy breathing again and Flovent was initiated. In late August, 
she was not eating well and displayed signs of nausea and she was started on 
nausea medicine and appetite stimulants. The owner was considering euthanasia.


In Mid-September, I learned about Vitalzul™ and offered for her to be a part of 
our anecdotal clinical trial. We repeated radiographs that week and the tumor 
size had not changed. Radiographs were repeated on November 2nd and the masses 
appeared smaller radiographically, which was only 7 weeks after starting 
Vitalzul™. We repeated radiographs again on 11/26/15 to make sure the previous 
radiograph was not distorted due to positioning. Again, the radiographs showed 
the tumor was smaller. Radiographs were taken 12/9/14 and 10/15/16 and 10/26/15 
and all show the tumor to be smaller. 

The tumor was not gone but smaller. Bootsy has been on Vitalzul™ twice daily for 
over 2 years and has serial exams and chest radiographs. She has a good quality 
of life and is doing well today. Bootsy is also taking multiple other 
medications without apparent drug interactions which include Methimazole, 
Atenolol, Flovent, Cerenia, Zoran and k/d diet and she has not suffered the 
typical side effects of chemotherapy.

We will be continuing her VitalZul for Pets™ and following her progress. 
Aventura Animal Hospital & Pet Resort is a full-service veterinary medical 
facility located in Aventura, Florida. 

Before Treatment with Vitalzul™ for Pets Noticeable soft tissue pulmonary 
infiltrate

One Week After Treatment with Vitalzul™ for Pets Soft tissue pulmonary 
infiltrate has begun to show signs of reduction

Seven Weeks After Treatment with Vitalzul™ for Pets Dramatic decrease in soft 
tissue pulmonary infiltrate

Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine from the University of Florida. After 
university, she undertook an internship in Small Animal Medicine and Surgery at

years, she joined the Aventura Animal Hospital and was soon promoted to the 
position of Chief of Staff within the facility. This is a position she has held

(OTCQB: PTLF) a developer of a new generation of high potency veterinary cancer medications and nutraceuticals for pets, issues a shareholder letter to update investors on recent advancement in the company. Dear Fellow Shareholder, It has been an exciting few months at your company. In a very short time we have revitalized the company by adding a new management team and have worked tirelessly to revamp our upcoming new website. We have initiated an entirely new social media campaign and have seen our stock price move steadily upward. We have welcomed many new investors. This is all great news for Pets and Pet Lovers. Our new media campaigns have worked to educate the public about the risk of cancer in their companion animals while at the same time creating excitement about what Petlife will bring to the market in the future. We at Petlife are excited about the rebranding of our flagship product (Escozine for PetsTM) and will soon be announcing our new branding strategy for our product line. Most importantly is that through our engagement of Innovision Therapeutics we have started on our pathway towards seeking approval of Escozine for PetsTM as an FDA approved product for cancer treatment in certain types of cancer seen in companion animals.  Innovision has registered many drugs successfully with the FDA and has specific experience and knowledge with Escozine.  The formal announcement of this collaboration will be forthcoming. As we move down this pathway Petlife Pharmaceuticals will be seeking approval for other forms of cancer and will begin to investigate Escozine’ s use in other disease states. The possibility of addressing other diseases is very promising and we look forward to potential news regarding these additional applications. Our journey, like any other noble quest, will not yield instantaneous results but we have advanced a reasonable timeline based upon the respected input of our Advisory Board and Chief Medical Officer. These individuals all have significant experience in the approval process for oncology drugs and have worked successfully with Escozine in several international markets. I am grateful that you are part of this exciting journey. I look forward to working for you to create a healthy future for our pets and a healthy financial future for our shareholders.

 Management Expressing an Optimistic Outlook for PetLife Pharmaceuticals' Future 																Hancock, Maryland				-				July 21, 2017								- (Newswire.com)								PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB: PTLF) (the "Company"), a developer of a new generation of high potency veterinary cancer medications and nutraceuticals for pets, has issued a letter to its shareholders from Ralph Salvagno, MD, CEO and Chairman of the Company, as follows:Dear PetLife Pharmaceuticals Shareholder:PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("PetLife") continues to make progress towards our goal of bringing effective, affordable and safe products to our companion animals and their pet families.Our recent acquisition of Dr. Geoff's pet food product line has the team working to build out the appropriate materials for test marketing and sales within the next 3 months.  The team has worked to establish the manufacturing and distribution channels necessary for success as well as having identified strategic partners for advertising and promotion. PetLife Advisory Board member and world renown Veterinarian, Dr.  Geoffrey Broderick, continues to promote the new brand, "Dr. Geoff's by PetLife," as well as drawing attention to the work being done by PetLife for the treatment of cancer through VITAZULTM.We have engaged our in-country team for the development of our PetLife Scorpion Ranch. Scorpions have been collected and plans continue to have the ranch fully functional and extracting venom within 60-90 days. Venom is one of the world's most precious liquids and is valued at over $7,000 /gm ($198,000/oz.). PetLife intends to use all its production of venom on proprietary PetLife products for the treatment of cancer and intends to continue research on Vitalzul's potential as a cancer preventative.Management expresses its disappointment at the recent stock performance. We recognize that there are forces in play that hope to capitalize on the volatility in small cap markets. The Company also recognizes that the fundamentals of our research, our patent pending technology, our mission, and our team, should outweigh any short-term trends in stock price. PetLife will be "on the road" in the next several weeks to bring our message to investors on the west coast. The schedule of "road shows" will be published as soon as it is finalized.The Company continues to investigate strategic partnerships that will enhance the mission and value of the Company. As these relationships develop beyond the discussion phase, the Company will make this information public, as appropriate. The Company is actively seeking partnerships in nutraceutical and complementary products. We recognize the unmet need for safe and effective products for treatment of arthritis, autoimmune and neuromuscular diseases and are working to develop solutions based on our patent pending technology.On behalf of the PetLife team, I appreciate your continued support in our goal of improving the quality of life for our companion animals and the families that love them.Sincerely,Ralph Salvagno, MDCEO and ChairmanAbout PetLife PharmaceuticalsPetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
