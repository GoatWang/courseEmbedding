M’athchomaroon!

My name is David J. Peterson, and I’m a conlanger (i.e. language creator). I’ve created languages for HBO’s Game of Thrones, Syfy’s Defiance, Syfy’s Dominion, the CW’s Star-Crossed, the CW’s The 100, Showtime’s Penny Dreadful, MTV’s The Shannara Chronicles, NBC’s Emerald City, and Marvel’s Thor: The Dark World. I’m also the author of Living Language Dothraki and The Art of Language Invention.
If you’re looking for information on language creation, you’ve come to the right place! For some quick tips, you can check out my YouTube series called The Art of Language Invention which explores every aspect of language creation in as much detail as five and a half or so minutes will allow.
