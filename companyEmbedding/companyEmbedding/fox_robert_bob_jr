The future of U.S. relations with Iran hinges on Tehran coming clean about the whereabouts of a former FBI agent who vanished a decade ago in the Islamic republic, Sen. Marco Rubio told Fox News.






Robert “Bob” Levinson disappeared in 2007 from Iran’s Kish Island, where the retired FBI agent had traveled on an unauthorized mission to recruit an intelligence source for the CIA. With the exception of a proof-of-life video in late 2010, there has been no credible sighting of Levinson or confirmation of who, specifically, is holding him and why. Iranian leaders deny knowing his whereabouts – a claim U.S. officials categorically reject.
"Bob Levinson went missing because of the Iranian regime,” Rubio, R-Fla., said Friday. “I believe with all my heart they know where he is, they know what’s happened to him and we should hold them completely and entirely responsible for his fate, his whereabouts and the outcome of this.”
“It should influence everything we do with Iran moving forward,” Rubio said. “How this case is handled up to this point and from this point forward will in many ways determine U.S. policy towards Iran.”

Rubio, who among several other lawmakers has been closely involved with the case -- Levinson is from Coral Springs, Fla. – said it’s not known whether he is still alive but said U.S. officials should be operating as if he is. Levinson’s wife, Christine, told Fox News in April the FBI believes her husband is alive – a theory that, if true, makes Levinson the longest-held hostage in American history.

“I certainly believe that everything we do – whether it’s pressure on Iran, outreach to Iran or working through third parties – should all be predicated on the assumption that he is alive and that his return to his family is still possible,” said Rubio, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.



Rubio said there were “a lot of missed opportunities in the past” at bringing Levinson home, though he did not fault the previous administration, acknowledging the complexity of a case spanning a decade. He stressed that Iran should face “consequences” if it continues to evade questions about Levinson’s whereabouts.
“What those consequences are, obviously the administration will make a determination,” he said.
Levinson, a father of seven and 20-year veteran of the FBI, traveled to Kish Island on March 8, 2007, on a 24-hour rogue assignment. He was last seen leaving the Hotel Miriam on the island and getting into a taxi for the airport. Iranian state-run television reported at the time that Levinson was in the hands of Iranian security forces – but no group officially claimed responsibility for taking him.

On Thursday, Levinson’s family met with State Department officials in Washington to discuss efforts to locate him, according to The Associated Press, which cited an unnamed U.S. official. The source – who spoke on condition of anonymity – told the AP many U.S. government officials believe Levinson is no longer alive.
The reported meeting follows a July 11 letter from U.S. lawmakers, spearheaded by Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., to President Trump, calling on the administration to “re-engage” with the Islamic Republic over Levinson’s whereabouts.
“Bob’s return is an urgent humanitarian issue,” the letter reads. “It is critical that the United States maintain pressure on Iran to see that he is returned as soon as possible.”
“Bob has suffered long enough,” the lawmakers said. “We must never rest until he is returned to his family. We owe them nothing less.”
A senior administration official said President Trump is committed to bringing Levinson home.
"Iran has previously committed to cooperating with the United States to determine the whereabouts of Mr. Levinson," the official said. "We will continue to press Iran to cooperate in working to bring Mr. Levinson home."

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Conditions TreatedAnal and Rectal CancerAnorectal AbscessCholecystitis and GallstonesHemorrhoidsIncisional HerniaInguinal HerniaLipomasUmbilical HerniaVaricose VeinsEducationMedical SchoolDes Moines Univ Coll Of Osteo Med & SurgGraduated in 1970Languages SpokenEnglishMemberships & Professional AffiliationsDr. Fox Jr does not have any memberships or affiliations listed.
