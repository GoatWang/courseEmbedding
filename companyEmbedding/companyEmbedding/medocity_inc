We’ve built a fantastic company around this vision with the most comprehensive technology, clinical intelligence, and integrated services available to deliver on our promise: Enabling even better care at lower total cost driving better outcomes from healthier, engaged patients – all delivered virtually. It’s what we do.

From Our Patients & Caregivers





                              “I was introduced to iCancerHealth when my oncologist invited me to review the app before the initial launch.  Like most I’ve heard from, I really love the pill box.  The reminders are great especially with chemo brain.  I also enjoy connecting with other survivors in the iCancerHealth community,” - Stacy Hobbs, Oncology nurse, breast cancer patient and advocate.




                              “I have been using it myself, and have recommended it to many of the women I meet at LifeChanges on a daily basis.  I only wish I had access to this type of complete, comprehensive, helpful information when I needed it.  I utilize it now to track medications and appointments,” - Diana Klunk, cancer survivor and owner of LifeChanges Boutique in Hanover, PA.




                              “iCancerHealth has been a great resource. No one is prepared for a cancer diagnosis, but this has been a useful tool in dealing with the overwhelming burden of navigating life after diagnosis.” – Cancer patient feedback.




                              “It is very helpful keeping things straight with your meds,what your eating how your feeling. While we are getting treated sometimes we don't realize if we have taken our meds, ate or even when are emotions are out of order.” - JoAnn Smith, breast cancer patient.




                              “It's a great app. Reminds me to take my meds and helps me figure out symptoms/side effects that happen after every chemo.” – Cancer patient feedback.
