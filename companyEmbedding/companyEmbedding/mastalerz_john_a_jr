John Mastalerz Jr., principal accounting officer for the H.J. Heinz Co., left his position with the company Friday, according to a document filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In his role, Mastalerz was responsible for overseeing all aspects of global accounting. Prior to taking the role of principal accounting officer in June, Mastalerz most recently served as vice president and corporate controller at Heinz, according to an SEC document filed in August. Mastalerz joined the company in 2001 after spending more than 11 years at Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP.




 


In an email, Michael Mullen, senior vice president of corporate and government affairs at Heinz, said it was Mastalerz's decision to leave the company. He has been replaced by Bob Bonacci, an executive that has been with Heinz (NYSE: HNZ) since 1999, according to Mullen.




On Jan. 10, Heinz announced the departure of a number executives that were promoted in June, following the close of the company's acquisition by Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) and 3G Capital.
