HOUSTON and VANCOUVER, July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - ESSA Pharma Inc. (TSX: EPI; NASDAQ:    EPIX) ("ESSA" or the "Company"), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel small molecule drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer, today provided a further update on its intention to pursue an equity offering. As outlined in its announcement on July 18, 2017, the Company had received sufficient investor interest to advance the proposed transaction but was denied conditional approval by financial regulators due to levels of insider and institutional participation. While alternative transaction structures have been identified that may be pursued, additional data is currently being received from the higher dose cohorts in the Phase 1 clinical trial of EPI-506. As a result, the Company intends to delay an offering until after that data can be announced from the ongoing highest dose cohorts. The Company will provide further updates as they become available. 








The securities described herein have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. Securities Act"), or any state securities laws, and accordingly, may not be offered or sold to, or for the account or benefit of, persons in the United States or "U.S. persons," as such term is defined in Regulation S promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act ("U.S. Persons"), except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities requirements or pursuant to exemptions therefrom. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the Company's securities to, or for the account of benefit of, persons in the United States or U.S. Persons.
Forward-Looking Statement DisclaimerThis release contains certain information which, as presented, constitutes "forward-looking information" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and/or applicable Canadian securities laws. Forward-looking information involves statements that relate to future events and often addresses expected future business and financial performance, containing words such as "anticipate", "believe", "plan", "estimate", "expect", and "intend", statements that an action or event "may", "might", "could", "should", or "will" be taken or occur, or other similar expressions and includes, but is not limited to, the anticipated timing of the Company's proposed equity offering, statements about the Company's Phase 1 clinical trial of EPI-506, including patient cohorts, data and results thereof; and the implementation of the Company's business model and strategic plans including the advancement of the Company's development portfolio. 
Forward-looking statements and information are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the ability of ESSA to control or predict, and which may cause ESSA's actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied thereby. Such statements reflect ESSA's current views with respect to future events, are subject to risks and uncertainties and are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by ESSA as of the date of such statements, are inherently subject to significant medical, scientific, business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties and contingencies. In making forward looking statements, ESSA may make various material assumptions, including but not limited to (i) the accuracy of ESSA's financial projections; (ii) the Phase 1 portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial proceeding as expected; (iii) obtaining positive results of clinical trials; (iv) obtaining necessary regulatory approvals; and (v) general business, market and economic conditions. 
Forward-looking information is developed based on assumptions about such risks, uncertainties and other factors set out herein and in ESSA's Annual Report on Form 20-F dated December 14, 2016 under the heading "Risk Factors", a copy of which is available on ESSA's profile at the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com, ESSA's profile on EDGAR at www.sec.gov, and as otherwise disclosed from time to time on ESSA's SEDAR profile. Forward-looking statements are made based on management's beliefs, estimates and opinions on the date that statements are made and ESSA undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements if these beliefs, estimates and opinions or other circumstances should change, except as may be required by applicable Canadian and United States securities laws. Readers are cautioned against attributing undue certainty to forward-looking statements.

ESSA Pharma Inc. Key Developments

ESSA Pharma Announces Receipt Of NASDAQ Notice Of Bid Price Deficiency
Jul 20 17
ESSA Pharma Inc. announced that it has received written notification (Notification Letter) from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Rules for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of  $1.00 per share, and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of the Company's common shares for the 30 consecutive business days from June 6, 2017, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement. The Notification Letter does not impact the Company's listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market at this time. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until January 15, 2018, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the Company's common shares must have a closing bid price of at least US $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by January 15, 2018, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance. The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common shares between now and January 15, 2018 and intends to cure the deficiency within the prescribed grace period. During this time, the Company's common shares will continue to be listed and trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company's business operations are not affected by the receipt of the Notification Letter. The Company is also listed on the TSX and the Notification Letter does not affect the Company's compliance status with such listing.


ESSA Pharma Announces Data from Phase 1 Trial of EPI-506
May 17 17
ESSA Pharma Inc. announced that early data from the Phase 1 portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of its product candidate, EPI-506, will be presented in a poster presentation at the upcoming 2017 American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting held June 2-6, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois. EPI-506 is currently in an open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study of end-stage patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have failed existing treatments including abiraterone or enzalutamide, or both, and may have also received one prior line of chemotherapy. At the time of the abstract submission, minor PSA declines in 3/18 patients had been observed at doses from 80 to 1,280 mg. The respective human exposure at these dose levels correlate to sub-therapeutic exposure derived from mouse xenograft studies. The data demonstrate that EPI-506 is well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile, with pharmacokinetics indicating dose proportionality at doses up to 1,280 mg. Since the submission of the abstract, the company has completed one additional cohort of 2400 mg, and is currently enrolling patients in two additional cohorts dosed at 3,600 mg once-daily or 1,800 mg twice-daily (3,600 mg total daily dose). In a clinical study update in April 2017, ESSA reported that pharmacological results confirmed that a dose of 2,400 mg achieves drug exposures within the targeted therapeutic range. ESSA plans to obtain additional data from a broader group of patients at higher dose levels to aid in the determination of an optimal Phase 2 dose.

HOUSTON and VANCOUVER, May 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - ESSA Pharma Inc. (TSX: EPI; NASDAQ:    EPIX) ("ESSA" or the "Company"), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel small molecule drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer, announced that early data from the Phase 1 portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of its product candidate, EPI-506, will be presented in a poster presentation at the upcoming 2017 American Society for Clinical Oncology ("ASCO") Annual Meeting held June 2-6, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois. Information contained in the abstract (http://iplanner.asco.org/am2017/#/session/11958) was as of the time of submission on January 31, 2017. ESSA intends to announce updated results at the time of the poster presentation at the ASCO Annual Meeting.








Abstract 5032Efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of EPI-506 (ralaniten acetate), a novel androgen receptor (AR) N-terminal domain (NTD) inhibitor, in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) progressing after enzalutamide and/or abiraterone. 




 Presenter: 
 Kim N. Chi, M.D., British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC 


 Session Title: 
 Genitourinary (Prostate Cancer) 


 Poster Board: 
 #106 


 Date/Time: 
 Monday, June 5, 2017 at 1:15pm – 4:45pm Central Time 


 Location: 
 Hall A 




EPI-506 is currently in an open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study of end-stage patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have failed existing treatments including abiraterone or enzalutamide, or both, and may have also received one prior line of chemotherapy.
At the time of the abstract submission, minor PSA declines in 3/18 patients had been observed at doses from 80 to 1280 mg. The respective human exposure at these dose levels correlate to sub-therapeutic exposure derived from mouse xenograft studies. The data demonstrate that EPI-506 is well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile, with pharmacokinetics indicating dose proportionality at doses up to 1280 mg. Since the submission of the abstract, the company has completed one additional cohort of 2400 mg, and is currently enrolling patients in two additional cohorts dosed at 3600 mg once-daily or 1800mg twice-daily (3600mg total daily dose).
In a clinical study update in April 2017, ESSA reported that pharmacological results confirmed that a dose of 2400 mg achieves drug exposures within the targeted therapeutic range. ESSA plans to obtain additional data from a broader group of patients at higher dose levels to aid in the determination of an optimal Phase 2 dose. 
About ESSA Pharma Inc. ESSA is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel and proprietary therapies for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer ("CRPC") in patients whose disease is progressing despite treatment with current therapies. ESSA believes that its product candidate, EPI-506, can significantly expand the interval of time in which patients suffering from CRPC can benefit from hormone-based therapies. Specifically, EPI-506 acts by disrupting the androgen receptor ("AR") signaling pathway, which is the primary pathway that drives prostate cancer growth. EPI-002, the primary metabolite of EPI-506, prevents AR activation by binding selectively to the N-terminal domain ("NTD") of the AR. A functional NTD is essential for activation of the AR. Blocking the NTD prevents activation of the AR by all three known mechanisms of activation. In preclinical studies, blocking the NTD has demonstrated the capability to overcome the known AR-dependent mechanisms of CRPC. ESSA was founded in 2009. 
About Prostate CancerProstate cancer is the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and the fifth most common cause of male cancer death worldwide (Globocan, 2012). Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is dependent on androgen for tumor progression and depleting or blocking androgen action has been a mainstay of hormonal treatment for over six decades. Although tumors are often initially sensitive to medical or surgical therapies that decrease levels of testosterone, disease progression despite castrate levels of testosterone generally represents a transition to the lethal variant of the disease, mCRPC, and most patients ultimately succumb to the illness. The treatment of mCRPC patients has evolved rapidly over the past five years. Despite these advances, additional treatment options are needed to improve clinical outcomes in patients, particularly those who fail existing treatments including abiraterone or enzalutamide, or those who have contraindications to receive those drugs. Over time, patients with mCRPC generally experience continued disease progression, worsening pain, leading to substantial morbidity and limited survival rates. In both in vitro and in vivo animal studies, ESSA's novel approach to blocking the androgen pathway has been shown to be effective in blocking tumor growth when current therapies are no longer effective.

Chi, M.D., at the BC Cancer Agency in Vancouver, presented the poster entitled, "Efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of EPI-506 (ralaniten acetate), a novel androgen receptor ("AR") N-terminal domain ("NTD") inhibitor, in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ("mCRPC") progressing after enzalutamide and/or abiraterone."The data presented were from the Phase 1 portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of EPI-506. The open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study is evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated dose ("MTD"), and anti-tumor activity of EPI-506 in men with end-stage mCRPC who have progressed after prior enzalutamide and/or abiraterone treatment, and may have received one prior line of chemotherapy. Twenty-one patients were available for analysis as of the May 12, 2017 ASCO data cut-off and each patient had received four or more prior therapies for prostate cancer at the time of study entry.The 21 patients self-administered oral doses of EPI-506 ranging from 80 mg to 2400 mg, with mean drug exposure of 87 days (range of 21 to 427 days). Seventeen patients discontinued treatment, primarily due to progressive disease, and four remain on study. Three patients have undergone  prolonged treatment (median of 286 days; range 219 – not reached), after intrapatient dose escalation. Prostate-specific antigen ("PSA") declines ranging from 4% to 29% have been observed in four patients at higher doses (≥1280 mg). An analysis of human drug exposures (AUC) compared to exposure levels derived from a xenograft model of castration resistant prostate cancer ("CRPC") showed that EPI-506 doses of ≥2400 mg were beginning to reach the anticipated target range for significant tumor growth inhibition as indicated by the model. Additional Phase 1 cohorts continue to be enrolled to evaluate a 3600 mg dose (either once-daily or 1800 mg twice-daily).EPI-506 was well tolerated and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in doses up to 2400 mg. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. The most common adverse events ("AEs") were diarrhea (8/21) and nausea (6/21), either Grade 1 or 2. Anemia was the only AE ≥Grade 3 observed in more than one patient (3/21) but was considered by investigators to be unrelated to EPI-506. Other AEs ≥Grade 3 considered potentially related to EPI-506 included a single case of elevated AST reported as possibly related, and a single case of elevated amylase deemed probably related ("DLT")."To see some indication of PSA responses in such a heavily treated patient population is encouraging. Given the acceptable safety and tolerability seen to date, we look forward to additional data that will be forthcoming from patients receiving higher doses of EPI-506," said Dr. Chi. "Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men. Despite the therapeutic advances made in recent years, prostate cancer patients eventually progress on these treatments, so finding new options to complement or follow these therapies is absolutely essential."Read More"EPI-506 represents a novel approach to blocking the androgen pathway, and we are very pleased to have our first clinical data presented at ASCO," said David R. Parkinson, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of ESSA. "We have observed signs of clinical activity at the higher doses in this analysis, which correlates with our preclinical modeling, and are continuing to enroll patients in dose cohorts higher than those reported here."About Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and the fifth most common cause of male cancer death worldwide (Globocan, 2012). Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is dependent on androgen for tumor progression and depleting or blocking androgen action has been a mainstay of hormonal treatment for over six decades. Although tumors are often initially sensitive to medical or surgical therapies that decrease levels of testosterone, disease progression despite castrate levels of testosterone generally represents a transition to the lethal variant of the disease, mCRPC, and most patients ultimately succumb to the illness. The treatment of mCRPC patients has evolved rapidly over the past five years. Despite these advances, additional treatment options are needed to improve clinical outcomes in patients, particularly those who fail existing treatments including abiraterone or enzalutamide, or those who have contraindications to receive those drugs. Over time, patients with mCRPC generally experience continued disease progression, worsening pain, leading to substantial morbidity and limited survival rates. In both in vitro and in vivo animal studies, ESSA's novel approach to blocking the androgen pathway has been shown to be effective in blocking tumor growth when current therapies are no longer effective.About ESSA Pharma Inc. ESSA is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel and proprietary therapies for the treatment of CRPC in patients whose disease is progressing despite treatment with current therapies. ESSA believes that its product candidate, EPI-506, can significantly expand the interval of time in which patients suffering from CRPC can benefit from hormone-based therapies. Specifically, EPI-506 acts by disrupting the AR signaling pathway, which is the primary pathway that drives prostate cancer growth. EPI-002, the primary metabolite of EPI-506, prevents AR transcriptional activity by binding selectively to the NTD of the AR. A functional NTD is essential for transactivation of the AR. In preclinical studies, blocking the NTD has demonstrated the capability to overcome the known AR-dependent mechanisms of CRPC. ESSA was founded in 2009.Forward-Looking Statement DisclaimerThis release contains certain information which, as presented, constitutes "forward-looking information" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and/or applicable Canadian securities laws.

Androgen Receptor - ESSA Pharma

























































ESSA Pharma






Development of small molecule drugs for cancer treatment 














Androgen Receptor









Androgen Receptor
The androgen receptor (AR) plays an essential role in controlling the effects of androgen hormones and cell growth in certain cancers including prostate and breast cancer.

The AR is composed of three domains:
Ligand-binding domain – binds to androgen hormones
DNA-binding domain – binds to DNA in cells
N-terminal domain – controls the ability of the AR to regulate gene transcription
The N-terminal domain controls the transcriptional activity of the AR, a critical function necessary for AR-driven cancer cell growth.
Cancer cell adaptations (such as mutations) maintain AR-driven tumor growth despite low circulating levels of androgen and despite the potential presence of androgen inhibitors. Furthermore, some truncated AR splice variants that lack a ligand-binding domain retain their activity independent of androgen and represent a resistance mechanism to existing hormone therapies.
By directly inhibiting the AR N-terminal domain, EPI compounds have the potential to overcome these biological adaptations.

Development of small molecule drugs for cancer treatment 














Clinical Trial









Clinical Trial
EPI-506 is currently being tested in patients with advanced prostate cancer (clinicaltrials.gov)
 
Prostate Cancer
Prostate Cancer has the highest incidence and is the second most common cause of death in men1. Generally, prostate cancer growth is dependent on the interaction of androgens with the androgen receptor.
Initially, prostate cancer is sensitive to medical or surgical therapies that decrease androgen levels (i.e., androgen deprivation therapy). However, once disease progression occurs, this generally represents a transition to the lethal form of prostate cancer, called castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
12016, American Cancer Society, Inc., Surveillance Research
Revolutionizing the Way Prostate Cancer is Treated
Many CRPC patients will have been treated with Xtandi® (enzalutamide) or Zytiga® (abiraterone) or both, the current standard-of-care drugs in metastatic CRPC.
However, resistance to these therapies can occur over time and effective treatments in this setting are needed.
ESSA’s novel approach to blocking the androgen receptor with the EPI compounds has been shown to be effective in preclinical studies by inhibiting prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth (see Publications).
 
The EPI-506 Trial
ESSA is currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of EPI-506 in patients with metastatic CRPC.
During Phase 1 (dose escalation), the study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and maximum tolerated dose of once-daily dosing with EPI-506. During Phase 2 (dose expansion), the study will evaluate the efficacy of EPI-506 in patients with CRPC who have failed abiraterone or enzalutamide or both.


EPI-506 is the first androgen receptor N-terminal domain inhibitor to be tested in clinical trials.
The study is currently enrolling in the United States and Canada (Clinicaltrials.gov# NCT02606123; study number EPI-506- CS-0001).
