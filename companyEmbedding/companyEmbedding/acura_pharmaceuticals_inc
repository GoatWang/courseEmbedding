Company Overview

Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing and commercializing tamper-resistant products to combat medication abuse and misuse. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that one person dies every 19 minutes from prescription drug abuse in the United States. For over a decade, Acura has been on the forefront of developing solutions to combat this epidemic, with products utilizing the Company’s proprietary abuse deterrent LIMITX™, IMPEDE® and AVERSION® Technologies. 
We have discovered and developed three proprietary platform technologies which can be used to develop multiple products.  Our AVERSION® and LIMITX™ Technologies are intended to address methods of abuse associated with opioid analgesics while our IMPEDE® Technology is directed at minimizing the extraction and conversion of pseudoephedrine into methamphetamine.
OXAYDO® Tablets (oxycodone HCl, CII), which utilizes the AVERSION® Technology, is the first and only approved immediate-release oxycodone product in the United States with abuse deterrent labeling.  We entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Egalet Corporation pursuant to which we exclusively licensed to Egalet worldwide rights to manufacture and commercialize OXAYDO®.  OXAYDO® is currently approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States in 5mg and 7.5mg strengths and was launched in the United States late in the third quarter of 2015.

NEXAFED® Tablets (30mg pseudoephedrine HCl) and NEXAFED® Sinus Pressure + Pain Tablets (30/325mg pseudoephedrine HCl and acetaminophen), utilizing the IMPEDE® Technology, were launched by us into the United States market in December 2012 and February 2015, respectively.  We have multiple pseudoephedrine products in development utilizing our IMPEDE® Technology.  On March 17, 2017, we entered into a licensing agreement with MainPointe Pharmaceuticals to exclusively market both NEXAFED® and NEXAFED® Sinus Pressure + Pain Tablets in the U.S. and Canada.  MainPointe will also assume all manufacturing and commercialization activities from Acura for both products.  On June 15, 2015, we and Bayer Healthcare LLC entered into a License and Development Agreement pursuant to which we granted Bayer an exclusive worldwide license to our IMPEDE® Technology for use in an undisclosed methamphetamine resistant pseudoephedrine-containing product and providing for the joint development of such product using our IMPEDE® Technology for the U.S. market.

Our third abuse deterrent technology, LIMITX™, is designed to retard the release of active drug ingredients when too many tablets are accidently or purposefully ingested.  We have completed our first clinical study, Study AP-LTX-400, of our lead LIMITX™ immediate release oral abuse deterrent drug candidate using the opioid hydromorphone HCl (LTX-04).  The FDA has designated the development program for LTX-04 as Fast Track, which is designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.  On April 13, 2016 and June 8, 2016, we announced that top line interim results from cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, of Study 400 for one test formulation of LTX-04 successfully demonstrated the release of the active opioid ingredient was reduced when three or more tablets were ingested, but that additional formulation development will be required for LTX-04 to deliver a sufficient amount of the active ingredient when one or two tablets are administered.  We are also developing an immediate-release hydrocodone bitartrate with acetaminophen product utilizing our LIMITX™ Technology.

AVERSION®
Acura’s lead product, OXAYDO® (oxycodone HCI, USP) Tablets CII, was approved for marketing by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 17, 2011. OXAYDO® represents the first immediate-release oxycodone product approved by the FDA that applies Acura’s AVERSION® Technology. AVERSION® is a mixture of inactive ingredients incorporated into pharmaceutical tablets and capsules designed to address some common methods of product tampering.
On January 8, 2015, Acura entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with Egalet US, Inc. and Egalet Ltd. granting them exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize OXAYDO®. On September 9, 2015 OXAYDO® was launched for commercial distribution in the United States.
On October 13, 2016, Acura entered into a worldwide License Agreement with KemPharm Inc. in which we license our AVERSION® Technology to KemPharm for its use in the development and commercialization of three products using 2 of KemPharm’s prodrug candidates.  KemPharm also has an option to extend the Agreement to cover two additional prodrug candidates.  KemPharm is responsible for all development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities under this agreement although Acura may provide initial technical assistance where needed.
Acura has developed several other tamper-resistant opioid products using AVERSION® Technology. The Company is currently considering commercialization opportunities for these products and product candidates.
IMPEDE®
Acura has developed for commercial sale NEXAFED®, a 30mg immediate-release formulation of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and NEXAFED® Sinus Pain + Pressure, a 30mg immediate-release formulation with 325mg of acetaminophen. NEXAFED® was commercially available for sale in December 2012 and NEXAFED® Sinus Pressure + Pain was commercially available in February 2014.  Both of these products utilize IMPEDE® Technology. Acura aims to develop a full line of immediate and sustained-release products utilizing the IMPEDE® Technology for commercialization in the United States.  On March 17, 2017, Acura entered into a licensing agreement with MainPointe Pharmaceuticals granting them the authority to exclusively market both products in the United States and Canada.  Prior to this date, we marketed these products on our own.
On June 15, 2015, Acura entered into a license and development agreement with Bayer. This agreement grants Bayer an exclusive worldwide license to our IMPEDE® Technology for the development of an undisclosed methamphetamine resistant product that contains pseudoephedrine to be marketed in the United States. This agreement also provides the rights to negotiate a license IMPEDE® Technology for certain other products.
Acura also seeks to establish partnerships outside the United States for products using its IMPEDE® Technology.

Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Special Call
Jun 28 17
To discuss the results from clinical study AP-LTX-401


Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Advances LTX-04 and its LIMITx™ Technology
Jun 28 17
Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that the results from its second clinical study, study AP-LTX-401 (Study 401). Study 401, when considered with the results of its first clinical study (Study AP-LTX-400 or Study 400) demonstrate that the maximum plasma level of drug (Cmax) following oral excessive tablet abuse (Oral ETA dosing levels are in excess of 2 tablets at a time) of the early development stage product LTX-04P3 are reduced by up to 65% compared to currently marketed products. The single tablet dose of LTX-04P3 in Study 401 achieved a Cmax that was 52% of the Cmax of the marketed comparator indicating the current LTX-04 formulation contains excess buffering ingredients resulting in incomplete release of drug. The company is developing plans for a buffer dose ranging study to guide the reformulation of the tablet buffers to increase the single dose Cmax, while retaining a reduction in Cmax in multiple LIMITx tablets. A change in development focus is planned from LTX-04, an immediate-release hydromorphone product, to LTX-03, an immediate-release hydrocodone bitartrate product, in subsequent studies. Hydrocodone bitartrate is more likely to be abused by Oral ETA. The patented LIMITx technology works by neutralizing stomach acid with buffering ingredients as increasing numbers of tablets are swallowed and relies on stomach acid to play a role in the release and subsequent systemic absorption of the active ingredient from micro-particles contained in the tablets. At the seven tablet dose, the Cmax of LTX-04P3 was 35% of the Cmax for the marketed comparator. The seven tablet LTX-04P3 dose, on a dose proportionality basis, demonstrated a 32% further reduction in Cmax when compared to the single tablet dose. Comparatively, in Study 400 there was an approximate 20% further reduction in Cmax for 8 tablets compared to a single tablet dose based on a dose proportionality analysis.


Acura Pharmaceutical Initiates Second Clinical Study on LTX-04
May 18 17
Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that the Company has completed enrollment and initiated dosing in a second Phase 1 human pharmacokinetic trial of LTX-04, its lead development candidate utilizing Acura’s novel LIMITx™ technology.  The patented LIMITx technology works by neutralizing stomach acid as increasing numbers of tablets are swallowed and relying on stomach acid to play a role in the release and subsequent systemic absorption of the active ingredient from micro-particles contained in the tablets. The Company expects dosing to complete by the end of May with topline results announced in June. Study AP-LTX-401 (Study 401) is a randomized, fasted, crossover design testing Acura’s new formulation designated LTX-04P3 in healthy adult subjects. In laboratory dissolution tests LTX-04P3 released drug faster with one tablet but also demonstrated better abuse deterrence with multiple tablets than the Company’s initial formulations. Study 401 enrolled 60 subjects who will be randomly assigned to one of two cohorts. Cohort 1 subjects are taking one LTX-04P3 tablet versus a marketed hydromorphone reference product with the objective to establish efficacious blood levels of the active ingredient and preferably bioequivalence. Cohort 2 subjects will be further assigned to two subgroups. Subgroup A subjects are taking 7 tablets of LTX-04P3 and the marketed hydromorphone reference product with the objective to demonstrate a reduction in peak blood levels of the active ingredient with LTX-04P3. Subgroup B subjects are being dosed in an undisclosed, exploratory protocol.

Company Overview

Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing and commercializing tamper-resistant products to combat medication abuse and misuse. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that one person dies every 19 minutes from prescription drug abuse in the United States. For over a decade, Acura has been on the forefront of developing solutions to combat this epidemic, with products utilizing the Company’s proprietary abuse deterrent LIMITX™, IMPEDE® and AVERSION® Technologies. 
We have discovered and developed three proprietary platform technologies which can be used to develop multiple products.  Our AVERSION® and LIMITX™ Technologies are intended to address methods of abuse associated with opioid analgesics while our IMPEDE® Technology is directed at minimizing the extraction and conversion of pseudoephedrine into methamphetamine.
OXAYDO® Tablets (oxycodone HCl, CII), which utilizes the AVERSION® Technology, is the first and only approved immediate-release oxycodone product in the United States with abuse deterrent labeling.  We entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Egalet Corporation pursuant to which we exclusively licensed to Egalet worldwide rights to manufacture and commercialize OXAYDO®.  OXAYDO® is currently approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States in 5mg and 7.5mg strengths and was launched in the United States late in the third quarter of 2015.

NEXAFED® Tablets (30mg pseudoephedrine HCl) and NEXAFED® Sinus Pressure + Pain Tablets (30/325mg pseudoephedrine HCl and acetaminophen), utilizing the IMPEDE® Technology, were launched by us into the United States market in December 2012 and February 2015, respectively.  We have multiple pseudoephedrine products in development utilizing our IMPEDE® Technology.  On March 17, 2017, we entered into a licensing agreement with MainPointe Pharmaceuticals to exclusively market both NEXAFED® and NEXAFED® Sinus Pressure + Pain Tablets in the U.S. and Canada.  MainPointe will also assume all manufacturing and commercialization activities from Acura for both products.  On June 15, 2015, we and Bayer Healthcare LLC entered into a License and Development Agreement pursuant to which we granted Bayer an exclusive worldwide license to our IMPEDE® Technology for use in an undisclosed methamphetamine resistant pseudoephedrine-containing product and providing for the joint development of such product using our IMPEDE® Technology for the U.S. market.

Our third abuse deterrent technology, LIMITX™, is designed to retard the release of active drug ingredients when too many tablets are accidently or purposefully ingested.  We have completed our first clinical study, Study AP-LTX-400, of our lead LIMITX™ immediate release oral abuse deterrent drug candidate using the opioid hydromorphone HCl (LTX-04).  The FDA has designated the development program for LTX-04 as Fast Track, which is designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.  On April 13, 2016 and June 8, 2016, we announced that top line interim results from cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, of Study 400 for one test formulation of LTX-04 successfully demonstrated the release of the active opioid ingredient was reduced when three or more tablets were ingested, but that additional formulation development will be required for LTX-04 to deliver a sufficient amount of the active ingredient when one or two tablets are administered.  We are also developing an immediate-release hydrocodone bitartrate with acetaminophen product utilizing our LIMITX™ Technology.

Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like advancements in personalized medicine and immunotherapy – and it's coming faster than we can imagine.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
