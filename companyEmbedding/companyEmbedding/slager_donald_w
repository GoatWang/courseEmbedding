Republic Services was named to the Forbes "America's Best Employer List" for 2017. It was the only recycling and waste management company to make it to this year's list.[17]
Glassdoor rated Don Slager among its “100 Highest Rated CEOs” for 2017.[18] [19] The selection was based on the anonymous reviews of Republic Services employees, earning Slager an overall rating of 94%.[20]
Education[edit]
Slager completed the Northwestern University Kellogg School Advanced Executive Program and he holds a certificate from Stanford University Board Consortium Development Program.[1][21]
Board memberships[edit]
Along with being a director of Republic Service’s Board of Directors, Slager is a board member of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.[21] where he serves on the Finance Committee and on the Ethics, Environment, Safety and Health Committee. He is also on the governing board of Together for Safer Roads, an innovative coalition that brings together global private sector companies, across industries, to collaborate on improving road safety. From 2009 until January 2016, Slager was an independent Director of UTi Worldwide, Inc. where he was Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and a member of both the Compensation and Risk Committees.[21] Don Slager is also a board member of the Arizona Commerce Authority, a group that attracts and cultivates commerce throughout the state.[22]

Glassdoor just announced the results of its 2017 Employees' Choice Awards for the highest-rated CEOs leading companies with 1,000 or more employees in North America and parts of Europe. The results are based on the anonymous feedback of employees who complete a company review of their CEO's leadership.
While some of the CEOs are household names (everyone's heard of Elon Musk, No. 8, and Mark Zuckerberg, No. 10), many of the CEOs are relatively unknown to the general public. Regardless, each has earned a spot on the Glassdoor list.

Fleets & Technology>Trucks WasteExpo 2017 News and Product Updates from Day Three


    The third day of WasteExpo 2017 in New Orleans brought a fresh round of news announcements.
  

Waste360 Staff | May 11, 2017


































Firms that reported news during the third day of WasteExpo included Rubicon Global, SCS Engineers, Cayan, Republic Services and Momentum Fuel Technologies.
 
Rubicon Global Launches RubiconPro with Goodyear Tire Discounts for Independent Haulers and Truckers
 
Rubicon Global announced that The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. has joined its elite group of manufacturers, retailers and maintenance providers as part of the RubiconPro consortium buying program, which delivers fuel, equipment, maintenance and financial benefits to independent haulers and truckers across North America.
 
Rubicon Global made the announcement at WasteExpo 2017.
 
Through RubiconPro, independent hauling and truck fleets can now purchase Goodyear tires at special discounts—including the Goodyear Endurance WHA waste haul tire, Goodyear’s longest-wearing waste haul tire, and its matching retread.
 
The Goodyear Endurance WHA waste haul tire features a new, scrub-resistant compound and a deep, 24/32-inch tread depth for more miles to removal.
 
The Goodyear Endurance WHA and its matching retread are key elements of Goodyear’s Total Solution of trusted products, a nationwide network, reliable services and fleet management tools, all designed to help lower waste haul fleet operating costs.
 
In addition, through the program, Goodyear will provide discounts on Goodyear and Dunlop brand commercial truck tires; Goodyear brand retreads; and Goodyear, Dunlop and Kelly brand auto and light truck tires. 
 
“Goodyear is an exciting new addition to our RubiconPro suite of offerings,” Rubicon Co-founder Marc Spiegel said in a statement. “At Rubicon, we’re committed to providing value-added, essential equipment to help independent haulers and truck fleets expand and compete.”
 
“We are excited about extending Goodyear’s Total Solution of trusted products, a nationwide network, reliable services and fleet management tools to Rubicon members,” said Spiegel.
 
SCS Engineers Signs Master Services Contract with Prudential Mortgage Capital Company
 
SCS Engineers signed a Master Services Agreement with the Prudential Mortgage Capital Co. (PMCC). Through the contract, SCS Engineers will provide engineering and environmental services to support PMCC’s commitment to generating loans for the commercial and industrial real estate sector in North America.
 
As part of a larger due diligence team, SCS will provide Phase I and II Environmental Assessments, Property Condition Assessments, and Seismic Analyses. This comprehensive package will allow PMCC to evaluate any potential environmental risk, as well understand any structural issues that may exist.
 
“The services offered under this contract will help ensure that Prudential Mortgage Capital and its clients understand the potential risk they might be taking on,” Tony Maggio, project director, SCS Engineers, said in a statement. “The team’s assessments will also make sure that projects are adequately funded.”
 
Cayan Announces Acquisition of Card Payment Services
 
Cayan, a payment technology company, today announced it has acquired Card Payment Services (CPS) LLC, a Dallas-based payments processing company specializing in the waste industry. 
 
CPS serves businesses throughout the country and processes in excess of $700 million in Visa and MasterCard transactions annually. In addition to waste haulers, CPS serves municipalities, waste equipment providers, transfer stations and other players within the waste space. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
 
The waste removal market is a significant new vertical industry for Cayan, one that strategically complements the company’s strengths. Waste haulers of all sizes are rapidly shifting to accepting payments by credit card and need secure and cost-effective payments processing technology and support. Through the acquisition, Cayan attains CPS’ 18 years of market expertise, waste management software integrations, exclusive partnerships with key ISVs, its customer base of major waste removal companies, and its leadership including Andrew Caine. 
 
“We’re thrilled to welcome CPS into the Cayan family,” Cayan CFO Chris Menard said in a statement. “The waste removal market is an industry with plenty of untapped opportunity and one we’ve had our eye on for a while as part of our M&A strategy. The synergies between CPS and us make this acquisition a natural fit.” 
 
“Cayan has clear strengths in technology and support as well as a proven track record in niche vertical markets, such as home heating,” Andrew Caine of CPS, said in a statement. “This, combined with CPS’ deep market expertise and our experience securing utility rate savings for waste hauling customers, will surely pave the way for growth.”
 
Republic Services Makes Forbes America's Best Employers 2017 List
 
Republic Services Inc. has been named to the Forbes America's Best Employer 2017 List, an employer ranking based on the results of an independent survey conducted among 30,000 U.S. workers at companies and institutions across the country. Republic is the only recycling and waste company named to this year's list. The Company is included in the Large Employer category, under Utilities.
 
"Our employees wear the Republic star with pride every day, and have helped to define a higher standard of excellence in our industry," Republic President and CEO Don Slager said in a statement. "We believe that an engaged, empowered and diverse team is another way we differentiate ourselves. We strive to be the place where the best people come to work, to deliver a superior product and fulfill our promise to our customers. This recognition is a great indicator of success."
 
The Forbes America's Best Employers List includes 500 employers selected based upon the results of an independent national employee survey (1,000 or more employees for midsized companies and 5,000 or more employees for large companies). Employees were contacted anonymously without the involvement of their employer. Employees were asked a series of 35 questions on work-related topics. The willingness of an employee to recommend their employer is considered the most important criteria of the survey. The survey uses the Net Promoter Score theory, which is how companies measure the willingness of customers to recommend or to gauge a customer's overall satisfaction with their products or services.
 
Momentum Fuel Technologies, Geotab Deliver Live CNG Data Reports
 
Geotab announced support for compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel level and temperature on all Momentum Fuel Technologies’ CNG fueling tanks and systems. Fleets with CNG vehicles can now have visibility into fuel usage and driver behavior that is already offered to other vehicles using Geotab’s fleet management solution.
 
This integration addresses the industry’s limited ability to use telematics to report CNG level from the vehicle for accurate fuel level readings. With a limited network of CNG stations and an average slow-fill CNG vehicle fill up taking eight to 10 hours, this insight into how much fuel a vehicle actually receives can help enable increased vehicle uptime, timely deliveries and reduce anxiety around fuel levels for fleet managers and drivers.
 
“The ability to support these parameters allows fleets to combat driver range anxiety in addition to providing accurate fuel usage reports by vehicle, allowing them to understand fuel usage by vehicle or by driver,” Scott Sutarik, associate vice president, commercial vehicle solutions, said in a statement. “Developing this capability for CNG vehicles, which according to the U.S. Department of Energy are said to have six to 11 percent less emissions, is another step in Geotab’s long-standing commitment to creating a greener world.”
 
Momentum Fuel Technologies and Geotab developed the integration using Geotab’s patented curve logic algorithm to receive high-resolution data via the vehicle’s diagnostic port. The Geotab GO device transmits data from Momentum Fuel Technologies systems via cellular networks, delivering comprehensive reports and dashboards to readily and easily visualize trends and monitor levels.
“Customer response to Momentum’s integration with Geotab has been outstanding,” Mike Zimmerman, general manager, Momentum Fuel Technologies, said in a statement. “Being able to remotely monitor fuel level can greatly improve driver productivity and fuel utilization, which is important to all CNG customers, including those in the refuse industry.”
