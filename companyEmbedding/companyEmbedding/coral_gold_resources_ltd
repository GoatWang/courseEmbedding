(CLH: TSX.V, the “Company” or “Coral”) announced today that, further to the Company’s news release dated June 21, 2016, Coral has closed the purchase and sale agreement (the “Agreement”) with Barrick Cortez Inc. (“Barrick”), a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, for the sale of the Robertson Property in Lander County, Nevada, to Barrick.The Agreement with BarrickThe consideration under the Agreement includes a cash payment (the “Cash Consideration”) to Coral of US$15.75 million (approximately Cdn $21.2 million based on the current exchange rate, before transactional costs) and a sliding scale 1% to 2.25% net smelter returns royalty on the Robertson Property (see details below).“The sale of Robertson to Barrick, and the potential for long-term royalty income down the road, represents a major turning point for Coral and its shareholders,” said Coral’s President and CEO David Wolfin. “Coral is evolving quickly with a fresh business model and strategy, looking to capitalize on our experience, knowledge and relationships in Nevada, particularly on the Cortez gold trend. We’re thrilled to see Barrick use its vast experience in the region to advance Robertson towards production.”The cash payment provides Coral with a significant infusion of non-dilutive capital. “The cash consideration received from Barrick, along with a reduction of approximately 8.7% of Coral’s basic shares outstanding, creates substantial immediate value for Coral shareholders. In addition, I am very excited about the NSR consideration received by Coral. As Robertson is advanced to production, Coral’s NSR could be become a very valuable asset for Coral shareholders and provide continued economic benefits. We also have the opportunity to participate in enhanced economic returns as gold prices increase.”The funds also allow Coral to advance its other projects on the Cortez Trend. “The Eagle, JDN and Norma Sass properties represent excellent, early-stage projects,” noted Wolfin. “We will use the extensive knowledge gained from our exploration at Robertson to advance our Nevada portfolio.”Rob Krcmarov, Barrick’s Executive Vice President, Exploration and Growth, said, “We are excited to add Robertson to our pipeline of projects at the Cortez property, where our vision is to create a multi-mine operation that will deliver long-term value to our shareholders and our government and community partners in Nevada. Consolidating ownership of the Robertson project will allow us to realize synergies with the Cortez operation, benefitting both Barrick and Coral shareholders as the project advances.”The Robertson PropertyRobertson is an advanced-stage exploration property located along the Cortez gold trend adjacent to Barrick’s Cortez/Pipeline Gold Mine which produced over a million ounces of gold in 2016 and recently reported gold reserves of 10.2 million ounces proven and probable. Over the past 25 years, exploration at Robertson by Coral and its various senior partners identified at least six mineralized gold zones with an inferred mineral resource of 2.7 million ounces* (191,725, 418 tons grading 0.0143 oz Au/Ton). Coral completed a positive Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) and Plan of Operation towards pre-feasibility in 2012. The property spans approximately 8,480 acres, comprised of 415 claims and 9 patented claims.*Note: Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant issues. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred resources as an Indicated or Measured mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to the Indicated or Measured mineral resource category.Agreement DetailsIn addition to the Cash Consideration to Coral, Coral will receive:The return of 4,150,000 common shares of Coral held by Barrick (which represent approximately 8.7% of the Company’s basic common shares outstanding) for cancellation by the Company (the “Share Reduction”); andA sliding scale 1% to 2.25% net smelter returns royalty (the “NSR”) on the Robertson Property, payable quarterly, subject to potential advance royalty payments as outlined below, as well as a right of first refusal enabling Barrick to acquire the NSR in the event that the Company wishes to sell the NSR to any third party.The sliding scale NSR rate will be determined based on the observed gold price during each quarterly period based on the average LBMA Gold Price PM during the quarterly period, as follows:Average Gold Price/Oz During the Quarter (USD)Applicable NSR Royalty RateUp to and including $1,200.001.00%$1,200.01 to $1,400.001.25%$1,400.01 to $1,600.001.50%$1,600.01 to $1,800.001.75%$1,800.01 to $2,000.002.00%Over $2,000.002.25%Based on the Company’s current number of basic common shares outstanding, adjusted for the Share Reduction, the Cash Consideration alone, excluding the value of the NSR, on a per share basis is equal to approximately Cdn $0.48, as compared to the closing price of Coral’s common shares on June 20, 2016 and June 2, 2017 on the TSX Venture Exchange of Cdn $0.195 and Cdn $0.31 respectively.Pursuant to the Agreement, as amended, and due to the delay in closing, in the event that the Robertson Property is not placed into production by December 31, 2024, then beginning on January 1, 2025, and continuing on an annual basis thereafter until the earlier of (i) the date commercial production commences and (ii) January 2, 2034, Barrick will make advance royalty payments to Coral Gold of US$0.5M, which will be non-refundable and fully credited against any future obligations under the NSR. These dates have all been extended by one year from the dates in Coral’s earlier announcement.Barrick will also assume all liabilities relating to the Robertson Property, and will provide replacement security for the reclamation bond.The Robertson Property includes the properties also known as the Core, Gold Ridge, Excluded and the RUF mining claims, but does not include the properties known as the Norma, Sass, Eagle and JDN mining claims. Robertson is located in eastern Lander County, Nevada, sixty miles southwest of Elko.Qualified PersonCoral’s projects are under the supervision of Robert McCusker, P.Geo, Coral Consultant, who is a qualified person within the context of National Instrument 43-101. Mr. McCusker has reviewed and approved the technical data herein.About CoralCoral Gold Resources is exploring a portfolio of strategically-located claim blocks along the Cortez gold trend in north-central Nevada.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

Treasury yields rebound on raft of solid economic data and AT&T debt deal
              
              Treasury yields recover from the previous session’s slide on Thursday as a spate of solid economic data lift growth and inflation expectations, which could invigorate second-quarter GDP figures and strengthen the case for monetary tightening

Nasdaq Composite pivots sharply lower in afternoon trade
              
              The Nasdaq on Thursday afternoon turned sharply lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was most recently down 72 points, or 1.1%, as the index was jolted suddenly lower, with some investors and traders citing a combination of concerns about valuations and market participants taking some money off the table following a brisk run for the high-flying sector. The abrupt retreat for the tech-centric gauge came as the other main equity benchmarks pared an earlier advance. All three equity gauges notched all-time intraday trading highs at the open, but the S&P 500 index  was most recently down 0.5% at 2,464 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  traded flat at 21,710, buoyed by gains in Verizon Communication , while Dow component and tech-giant Apple Inc. , sold off by 2.7%, cutting about 30 points from the blue-chip gauge.  The popular tech-focused exchange-traded fund, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF , was trading down 1% in recent trade.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd.

Untitled Document




















Following the successful drill program of 2006-07, Coral Gold is planning for another major drill campaign in 2008.




At Glance



Partnered in Nevada with Cortez
          Gold Mines and Levon Resources.



Strategically-located and 100%-
owned claim blocks on Nevada’s
Cortez gold trend.



Robertson Property gold resource
growing rapidly, with major drill
campaign completed in 2007.



Robertson Property updated resource estimate report under preparation by Beacon Hill to become available by February 2008.






UPDATED RESOURCE ESTIMATE
The updated resource estimate recently received from Beacon Hill Consultants (1998) Ltd. for the Robertson property increases Coral’s estimate by 110% to 2.3 million ounces of gold.
    The estimate incorporates results from drilling programs done since the last published resource estimate of April 2006. The 43-101 compliant report is under preparation by Beacon Hill and will be available by February 2008.
WHERE THE GOLD IS


      Independently, and through agreements with Cortez Gold Mines and Levon Resources Ltd., Coral Gold Resources is exploring a portfolio of strategically located claim blocks along the Cortez gold trend in north-central Nevada. These properties are situated in the active Crescent Valley region. Coral’s primary asset in Nevada is the Rproject. Robertson adjoins Cortez GoldMines’ Pipeline Mine to the south, whereBarrick Gold Corporation (60%) and Kennecott Minerals Company (40%) have established proven and probablereserves of 11 million ounces of gold.















The large Pipleline open pit (Barrick/Kennecott)and the nearby Robertson Property owned by Coral Gol lResources





 EXCLUDED CLAIMS JV

      
      The Excluded Claims operate under a joint venture with Cortez Gold Mines (Coral Gold Resources 39% carried interest; Cortez 61%), in which Cortez is the project operator. The property lies approximately 4,000 feet north of the Pipeline Mine and it encompasses a number of important structural elements.






Coral’s various Robertson holdings are situated in the active Crescent Valley region on the Cortez gold
          trend. Cortez Gold Mines’ Pipeline Mine adjoins the Excluded and Ruf claims to the south. Barrick Gold
          Corporation (60%) and Kennecott Minerals Company (40%) have established proven and probable
          reserves at Pipeline/Cortez of 11 million ounces of gold.




NORMA SASS PROPERTY
ROBERTSON PROPERTY


Norma Sass, an early-stage exploration project located immediately south of the Gold Acres open pit mine and west of the Pipeline Mine, represents one of Nevada’s best remaining exploration targets. Previous drilling at Norma Sass encountered ore-grade gold values hosted by favorable, lower-plate carbonate strata.
 The Norma Sass property is owed 66.6% by Coral Gold and 33.3% by Levon Resources Ltd.
The Robertson property is located along the prolific Battle Mountain-Eureka trend four miles north of the Pipeline/South Pipeline complex operated by Cortez Gold Mines, in eastern Lander County, Nevada. The deep drilling program began July 20 and was completed September 8, 2007.

Coral
Precious coral is a species of coral that grows in rocky seabottoms, typically in dark environments either in the depths or in dark caverns. The coral skeleton is composed of hard calcium carbonate, colored by carotenoid pigments. Coral exhibits a range of warm reddish pink colors ranging from salmon pink to deep red; the word coral is also used to name such colors. Owing to its intense and permanent coloration and luster, precious coral skeletons have been harvested since antiquity for decorative use. Coral jewelry has been found in ancient Egyptian and prehistoric European burials. Most precious coral is harvested in the Mediterranean Sea, especially in Sardinia. Deposits are also found in the Pacific, in Japan, Taiwan and Australia.
