 Educational Background



Master's Degree in Business Administration 


Thunderbird School of Global Management

                  Since our inception in 1946, Thunderbird has focused exclusively on educating global leaders in the intricacies of international management. While other business schools scramble to add global curriculum and keep pace, Thunderbird remains firmly at the forefront. That’s because all we do, all we are, is global. It’s not part of what we offer. It’s everything we offer.

We educate global leaders who create sustainable prosperity worldwide.

We will dramatically grow our positive impact in a world economy in dire need of the global leadership talent we were founded to provide.

Global leaders are entrusted with authority, governance and influence over people and profits. But more than that, leaders are entrusted with responsibility and accountability. Their actions hold great power – to create or destroy value, to build communities or tear them down, to establish a society of stability or one of volatility. Conducting business as ethical global citizens is paramount. And at Thunderbird, it’s our pledge. Read Thunderbird's Professional Oath of Honor.
Thunderbird History

Thunderbird School of Global Management is the oldest and largest graduate school for international business in the United States. Founded in 1946, the school reflected the post-World War II shift toward a global economy and has changed with the times to provide international business leaders with the tools they need to be successful in today's culturally diverse business environment. Read more about Thunderbird's rich history and legacy.
Ranked Among the World's Best

Thunderbird consistently ranks #1 in the world in international business education and among the top 10 worldwide in executive education
