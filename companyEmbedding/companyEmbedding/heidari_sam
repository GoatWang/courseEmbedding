Good afternoon. My name is Stephanie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Quantenna Communications First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
A Webcast of this call can be accessed through our Web-site, quantenna.com, and will be archived for 90 days. Also, a replay will be available by dialing 800-585-8367 and referencing conference ID number 10150228 shortly after the conclusion of today's call. A copy of today's press release dated May 8, 2017 for the quarter ended April 2, 2017 and related financial tables can be found in the Investor Relations portion of Quantenna's Web-site.
During the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including those related to our preliminary financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 ended April 2, 2017, financial outlook for the second quarter of 2017 fiscal year and beyond, strategy, future business and financial performance, product development and technology, customer relationships, and market opportunities, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that we discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC including our recent Form 10-K filed on March 2,2017.
These risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. The forward-looking statements made on this call apply only as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call.
Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release.
I would now like to turn the call over to Vern Essi, Director of IR and Strategic Finance for Quantenna Communications. Please go ahead.
Vernon Essi, Jr.
Thank you, Stephanie, and welcome everyone to our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me today are Dr. Sam Heidari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Sean Sobers, Chief Financial Officer. Before we start our prepared comments, I want to call your attention to our supplementary financial commentary and supplementary earnings presentation, both of which were included in our 8-K filing today and are available on our Investor Relations Web-site at quantenna.com.
Since we are providing the financial commentary with trended financials, Sean's remarks will be abbreviated and certain metrics not discussed in today's call, including historical comparisons and GAAP to non-GAAP measures, will appear in these supplementary materials. The financial commentary and earnings presentation should be referenced in conjunction with both today's conference call remarks and the earnings press release issued today. We will briefly refer to the earnings presentation supplementary during today's call, but note that we will not be speaking to every slide in sequence.
On our call today, Sam will discuss Quantenna's highlights from the first quarter and the market opportunity for our premium Wi-Fi solutions. This will be followed by Sean with a financial overview and guidance. Sam will then conclude our prepared remarks and then open the call for question-and-answer.

Before I turn the call over to Sam, I would like to announce the investor conferences that we will be participating in during the second quarter. These include the Benchmark One-on-One Investor Conference in Chicago on June 1, as well as the 37th Annual William Blair Growth Stock Conference on June 14.
Now, I will turn the call over to Sam. Sam?
Sam Heidari
Thank you, Vern. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Q1 of 2017 marked another excellent quarter for Quantenna. Please note that this was our first full quarter as a publicly held company. Today we have a lot of good news to share with you and I appreciate your interest and support in Quantenna.
Let us start by briefly reviewing our Q1 financial highlights. I'm pleased to report that Quantenna produced record revenues, delivering $37.9 million for the first quarter. This represents an impressive 55% growth over the first quarter of 2016. And to add, we have a strong balance sheet with $114 million in cash.
Regarding Quantenna's product mix, our 802.11ac Wave 2 performed well and we expect incremental growth in Q2 that will exceed its record Q4 level. Further, our 802.11n product saw continued strength in Q1 that was driven by increased market share. Finally, our 10G Wave 3 revenue continued to grow as we have seen increasing interest from our customers and we expect this momentum to continue through the rest of the year.
During the first quarter, we had three announcements across our ecosystem that reinforced our position as the leading provider of the highest performing Wi-Fi technology on the planet. First, we announced the QSR5G-AX. This is a follow-on product to industry's first 802.11ax introduction or 12-stream QSR10G-AX. The QSR5G leverages Quantenna proprietary architecture and is ready to take advantage of our customer pipeline and established footprint of 802.11ac solutions. We expect this product to position us well for success in the mainstream Wi-Fi market. We expect our 5G-AX and our 10G-AX will be critical new products for the next generation of Wi-Fi. Convergence to the next standards will take time to unfold, as has been the case historically, but we anticipate to be the first to the market and ready to lead our customers to a better Wi-Fi experience.
Second, we introduced a carrier-grade full-duplex Wi-Fi range extender with Greenwave Systems. And finally, we introduced SONiQ, or Self Optimizing Network software that unites various network devices. Coupled with our semiconductor solution for residential gateways, repeaters and video clients, SONiQ can transform the home Wi-Fi experience via an intelligently managed network. It will detect and route the best connection for any of your client devices.
In addition, I'm also excited to report that in the first quarter we sold past the shipment of our 100 millionth Wi-Fi chip. This is a major milestone that represents over a decade of intense development efforts led by our world-class team. This milestone demonstrates a scalable operational efficiency.
As you may recall, what makes our Wi-Fi technology unique on the last call, we discussed what makes our Wi-Fi technology unique on the last call. This is demonstrated on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. Now I would like to take an opportunity to share with the investors the market growth forecast for premium Wi-Fi solution.
If you refer to Slide 5, we have a chart that shows our market opportunity. ABI Research forecasts that the non-portable Wi-Fi enabled devices that have 4x4 MIMO technology or greater, which we define as premium, will grow from $200 million in 2016 to $1.3 billion in 2021. That is a 50% compound annual growth rate.
Even though we don't separately break this out, the 8x8 MIMO market is expected to have a more impressive growth rate of 82% compound annual growth from 2016 through 2021. Please note that we are still the only 8x8 solution currently offered.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Sean.
Sean Sobers
Thanks, Sam, and good afternoon everyone. As Vern previously stated, our financial commentary should be referenced in conjunction with both my remarks and the earnings press release issued today.
We are pleased to report record revenue of $37.9 million in the first quarter. This represents 55% growth over the first quarter last year and is up 1% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential growth was particularly strong given the typical seasonal industry softness experienced in Q1. Also let me remind you that Q4 2016 was an extended 14-week quarter, and Q1 2017 we are back to our normal 13-week quarter. Taking this into account and adjusting for the extra week, the sequential growth over Q4 would have been 9%.
Our first quarter gross margin was in line with our expectations at 49.2%, and declined 230 basis points sequentially but gained 50 basis points year-over-year. As we noted on our fourth quarter earnings call, our gross margin is typically impacted by mix.
Our operating expenses were in line with our expectations, reflecting increased staffing levels and costs associated with being a public company that were recognized in sales and marketing and G&A. R&D expenses declined sequentially due to the timing of development projects. We used $400,000 in cash from operations in the first quarter, or $0.01 per share, due to expanding our working capital as the business continues to grow.
Our non-GAAP EPS, which excludes stock-based compensation, was $0.03 for the first quarter compared to $0.03 for the fourth quarter of 2016, and a loss of $0.04 in the first quarter of 2016.
Turning to our balance sheet, we closed Q1 2017 with $114 million in cash and cash equivalents. Accounts receivable ended at $17.8 million or 42 days sales outstanding. This compares to $14.5 million or 35 days in Q4 2016. This increase was primarily due to the timing of customer payments.
Inventory ended at $13.4 million, or 5.8 annualized turns, in the first quarter, compared to $15.8 million or 4.6 annualized turns in the fourth quarter. This decline was due to heavier shipments of our legacy products coupled with an inventory decline due to improving operational efficiencies.
Now for a discussion of revenue segmentation by Wi-Fi technology; as we anticipated, our 802.11ac Wave 2 product declined 5% sequentially in Q1 due to typical seasonal softness from our customers as well as one less week in the first quarter relative to the fourth. Wave 2 products doubled over the first quarter of 2016, growing 100% year-over-year, due to continued strong customer interest. We anticipate Wave 2 revenue to grow sequentially in Q2 and exceed our Q4 levels.
Our legacy 802.11n revenue grew 27% sequentially in the first quarter on relatively smaller revenue levels as a result of increased market share. 802.11n products declined 22% year-over-year in the first quarter, in line with our overall expectations that this product area will decline over time.
Our Wave 3 10G product grew from 1% of revenue in the fourth quarter to 3% in the first quarter or $1 million. While still relatively small to our overall revenue, we expect Wave 3 revenue to grow sequentially in Q2 and continue to grow throughout the second half of 2017 as service providers ramp design wins into volume production.
I will now cover our guidance for the second quarter of 2017. As the second quarter progresses, we have seen continued demand from our customers for our 802.11ac Wave 2 products, coupled with the ramp of our 10G products. Taking this into consideration, we expect second quarter revenue to be between $42 million and $44 million.
We expect our product mix to improve in the second quarter. Accordingly, we anticipate our non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter to be between 48.5% and 50.5%. However, as we have stated in our prior call, we anticipate the gross margin on our 10G product will be below the corporate average until we complete cost optimization efforts toward the end of 2017. Thus, gross margin performance may fluctuate in the second half of 2017.

In Q2, we plan to invest in R&D and add incremental headcount as well as incur increased expenses related to development projects. Note that our R&D expenses will generally fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing of these projects. Also we anticipate sales and marketing and G&A to grow modestly. Thus, we expect second quarter operating expenses to grow 10% to 15% sequentially with R&D accounting for most of this increase. In the second quarter, we expect tax expenses to be in the range of $200,000 to $300,000.
So, to summarize, for the second quarter, we anticipate a GAAP loss of $0.00 to $0.02 per share and the non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.04 and $0.06. Please refer to our GAAP to non-GAAP business outlook reconciliation contained in our earnings release for more information. We are excited about our revenue growth as the demand for our products continues.
Finally, I would also like to note that while we understand there is interest related to our large service provider customers, we do not plan to share specifics about our customer relationships. Therefore, we will not be discussing or updating specific design wins or details with investors on a regular basis. We appreciate your understanding.
I would like to now turn the call over to Sam for concluding remarks.
Sam Heidari
Thank you, Sean. As I discussed earlier on the call, we continue to work diligently to bring the best Wi-Fi experience with service providers. Strategically, we are finding our efforts are much more readily monetized in this area relative to retail and enterprise. Of course we are still working closely with key partners in both retail and enterprise market.
We continue to partner with our service provider customers as they broaden their presence in the residential market. They are absorbing a very dynamic market here, such as traditional cable operators that are quad-bundling mobile phone services and satellite operators being bought by mobile carriers. For us, this presents a significant opportunity. The key to this augmentation often therefore is a very reliable and high-performance Wi-Fi fabric. Because of our positioning, the market is rapidly moving toward us.
For example, if you were to look at one of our key target markets, the residential hotspots, the growth is exceptional. According to Cisco, total Wi-Fi residential hotspots will grow from 85 million in 2016 to 526 million in 2021. This represents a 44% compound annual growth over the five-year period. Quantenna is not just participating in this growth, we are enabling it.
If you think we are crazy about Wi-Fi, you are right, but you are not alone. In a recent study conducted by Comcast XFINITY, 34% of multiunit residential managers ranked Wi-Fi as an amenity that's most important to their renters. This compared to just 13% who identified in-room laundry facilities. Wi-Fi could soon be considered a utility just like electricity and running water.
So, in summary, we are very proud of our heritage of enabling the best-in-class Wi-Fi solution that improves everyone's life. We just posted a back-to-back record revenue in the quarter and announced a strong outlook for Q2. We have a portfolio of leading-edge products that are capturing the market needs of today and tomorrow. We couldn't be more excited about our future. And finally, we have a great team that brings their A-game to work every day. I couldn't be more proud of that.
Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. We would like to open the call for your questions. Stephanie?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Suji Desilva with ROTH Capital.
Suji Desilva
Congratulations on the strong results here as a gate and also congratulations on making 100 million units. I wanted to ask about the unit number here, it's about 100 million, two quarters ago it was about 80 million. That metric helps us kind of understand your unit shipments. Can you talk about how we should think about blended ASP along with that in the trend, any puts and takes we should think about as you roll out the newer products and multiple products?

Sean Sobers
I think as we discussed in the past, ASPs are climbing as we migrate towards 10G. That's for two reasons. One, overall the higher end and higher performance, but you're also getting more real estate from the overall chipset. So we are having both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz. Before, our products were only 5 GHz. So if you think about ASP as you migrate to 10G, you are seeing around doubling of that, if not more.
Suji Desilva
Okay, good. And then in terms of the competitive landscape, can you give us a sense versus three months ago and your thoughts there? Competitors certainly are trying to catch up to you. And then what you're seeing in the design competitions that you have encountered more recently?
Sam Heidari
So as far as we are concerned today, I mean easily we are still the only 8x8 product out there offering in the designs. We have not seen any evidence of any other product having been in our customers' hand. So, we are leading that. Meanwhile, we are continuing to ship and win even new design wins with our legacy 4x4 solution.
Suji Desilva
Very good. And then last quick question, you talked about carrier-grade extender. Sam, is that a meaningful incremental market opportunity for you guys and would that show up in whatever interface and protocol it's handling or would it be a separate line item, help us understand if that's something we should be paying attention to as an incremental opportunity?
Sam Heidari
So the entry to the market, I don't think that is going to be identified as a separate line item for the time being. I don't think it will have – and it is definitely a – the significance of that and importance of that is it provides a complete solution to the service providers and their end customers as a one-stop shop, but it is going to be maybe more meaningful in the years to come. I don't see it in 2017-2018.
Suji Desilva
Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys. Congrats again.
Operator
Your next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.
Quinn Bolton
I want to echo my congratulations on the strong results and guidance. Sean, just wanted to come through the guidance for the second quarter, you said that Wave 2 would be back to or above record levels from the fourth quarter. So it sounds like Wave 2 solution should be about $31.5 million or better. I think you said 802.11n would decline and that was around $7 million. So it kind of sounds like the core business is probably somewhere around $38.5 million. If that's right, it sounds like the Wave 3 or 10G solution could be anywhere from about $2.5 million to $6.5 million in the second quarter. And I just want to make sure that that's kind of the right expectation you are setting or do you think that the Wave 2 802.11ac stuff sees some significant growth above the previous 4Q 2016 record level?
Sean Sobers
It's a very good question and you do know how to do math very well, but we're not going to be more specific than what we said earlier. We are expecting over time obviously on the Wave 3 10G product to continue to grow and grow significantly, but I can't give you any more specifics.
Sam Heidari
We did say that Wave 2 will be higher than Q4.
Sean Sobers
Yes, exactly.
Quinn Bolton
Okay. And then I guess just with your mixing towards the 10G solutions yet your gross margin sort of uptick in the second quarter despite that mix towards the 10G solution, can you tell us what's going on in Wave 2 product line that's standing for the better mix shift or is the 10G solutions coming a little bit better than perhaps previously expected?
Sean Sobers
So I mean we talk a lot about kind of the three pieces, 11n and then Wave 2 ac and then Wave 3 or 10G ac, when we talk about it on that level, inside that level there is a multiple chipset that could make up different product sets that have different profiles. So when the product mix is in there and it comes in differently, it can have a different impact on the overall outcome. But there's nothing – we're still working towards cost optimization on the 10G product as we progress through the end of 2017.

Quinn Bolton
Okay. And then just one more for Sam and then I'll hop back in the queue, just Sam, what are you seeing in terms of demand for the 8x8 MIMO? You're still the only provider with 8x8 on the market. Are service providers kind of waiting for kind of first design wins for 8x8 to ramp before making their decisions or are you already layering in additional 8x8 design wins on top of your initial QSR10G ramp?
Sam Heidari
Quinn, if I may go back to the conversations we have had at the time of IPO, even as earlier as a couple of months ago, I stated how many different service providers are there in deployment and the new ones which are coming on, which we kind of showed that landscape to you before. We talked about 27 at the time being deploying service providers and we have about 40 overall design wins in deployment. So a good number of them are coming up. A good number of the ones which are coming up are 8x8 design wins. So 8x8 is getting good traction in the market today and we expect multiples of this going to deployment this year and then follow up to be by the following year.
Quinn Bolton
Great. Thanks for the additional color.
Operator
Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
Blayne Curtis
I'll echo my congrats as well. Sean, just wanted to go back on the prior question. I know you don't want to breakout specific numbers, but it sounded like with the OpEx line going up, I'm assuming that's a tape-out, so maybe if you could just talk about the timing of Wave 3, is it progressing as you expected and have talked about prior? And then if you are taping out the cost down, is that also going to – can you talk about the timing of that and the impact to the gross margin?
Sean Sobers
So you are right in a sense that the developments that are happening in R&D when we talk about projects, those are generally tape-outs. We're not going to talk about specifically which one, but we are tracking in what we believe we forecasted for the full year as it relates to 10G and when the cost-down is going to come as well as when the revenue ramp is going to come. So no real changes there from anything we talked about or thought about in the past.
Blayne Curtis
Okay. And maybe you could just talk about the strength you're expecting in June in Wave 2 coming back, where are you seeing that strength from?
Sean Sobers
I think generally it's across our customer base. We have quite a few service providers that are in rollout and ramping up across their customer base. So we can have a view to what's going to happen in Q2. Obviously we're halfway through Q2 as we speak right now, so we have a good visibility towards what's going to happen in the quarter.
Blayne Curtis
Perfect. And then just the OpEx guidance for June, just want to make sure I understand the moving pieces. Obviously you're a small company and tape-outs can matter. So, March was depressed, it was lower than expected. Now June is with $19 million. How do you think about that OpEx line in the back half of the year?
Sean Sobers
And I think you are right on the impacts of the tape-outs are going to be the things that fluctuate mostly. Obviously we're a company that's growing pretty rapidly, above 50%. So, hiring is going to be a big portion of that as well. So those are the big drivers. The focus areas for expense growth is going to come out of R&D. It's not going to be, for the most part, sales and marketing and G&A. But as tape-outs happen and hiring comes, that's where the driver is going to be.
Operator
Your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore
With regards to the 10G product, it seems like it's a differentiated product for the retail market as well and it seems like there would be demand for that. Can you talk about any potential milestones we may see in terms of their ability to just start ramping more of a presence in the retail router market?

Sam Heidari
As we have mentioned earlier, retail is an opportunistic market for us. We definitely have our eyes on it. We have been engaged with a top-tier retail OEM. And we execute towards having a presence there. It is going to be – in a shorter term, I think it's not going to be a significant portion of our revenue, and in the longer term it will be meaningful but not significant portion of our revenue. Our focus today I think, that is service provider market, is growing very rapidly and we are going to leverage from there what we have into the retail market when there is an opportunity.
Joe Moore
Okay, great. And then in the service provider market, there were a bunch of supply disruptions earlier in the year around one of their customers struggled to get DRAM and another one was struggling to get chipsets, and obviously you've grown nicely through that, but have you seen any impact of that supply-chain disruption and is there any effect on your either Q1 or Q2 numbers?
Sean Sobers
This is Sean. No, we haven't actually seen any impact of that. I mean we were obviously getting similar questions as we were going through closing our Q4 and such, but we haven't seen any impact to us on that case.
Joe Moore
Great. Thank you and congratulations.
Operator
Your next question comes from Anil Doradla with William Blair.
Anil Doradla
Sam and team, congrats from my end too. So, Sam, when you deal with the service providers today and there are discussions that you have with them, the choices are between different MIMO streams, between Wave 2 and Wave 3, can you share some insights into kind of the types of discussions or some of the criteria that is pushing these service providers in configuring their MIMO streams versus Wave 2 and Wave 3 right now?
Sam Heidari
So the problem statement has been the same, and it is I think what you hear from the service provider is very clear, the Wi-Fi connectivity is frequently linked usually in the full network and the device's performance and the bandwidth into the home is judged based on an end-to-end measurement of the throughput.
So, when they select a technology, it's not just about 8x8 versus 4x4, which I think 8x8 contributes significantly toward the right direction and better performance of the system, it's about guaranteeing the whole home coverage, future-proofing it for the services, reducing the service cost and being able to advertise the differentiation of their network compared to someone else.
And these are the fundamental needs which have been indicated for the past few years that we've been in the business and we've foreseen it to be the reason for going forward. And it includes all those things that I mentioned, that is, it differentiates us and is needed for service providers.
Anil Doradla
What I was hoping, Sam, is that is it like a tipping point, like when you talk about 8x8, is it 1 gigabit per second that people, the service providers are pushing at 8x8 or is there some bandwidth requirements where a certain MIMO constellation is made in?
Sam Heidari
Right. So I think that 1 gigabit per second for example, or you take any number, 100 megabits per second, for entire home coverage, it's still going to get a benefit from 8x8 because 8x8 is going to take that curve further out in your home coverage. At the same time, within the home communication, going from one device to another, doing a backup and your home networking channel within the home, is going to take a benefit of the higher throughput that 8x8 analysis has to offer.
At the same time, the Wi-Fi is a shared medium. You share the frequency with your neighbors. So the faster you can communicate, the more air time you can free up in order to help your neighbors or not to get hurt by your neighbors by being able to transmit your packet and open a slot over the air. All of these are the reasons that 8x8 gets selected today.

Anil Doradla
Okay. And finally, when do you think competition will come in with 8x8 solutions? You said you are the only guys there today. Thanks a lot.
Sam Heidari
Right. So, I mean last earnings call we had a conversation about that based on the news release. We have not seen anything otherwise since then. And I might add, we have had this product for a couple of years, it does take time to mature it. So we think that there is a level of lead time for us here still because of our maturity of the product as coming together.
Anil Doradla
Congrats, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Regiment.
Ross Seymore
Just wanted to look first, in the quarter you got [substance] [ph] of your guidance nicely. What was the cause of that?
Sean Sobers
So a big driver perhaps in general on growth is going to be service providers introducing new products and rolling out them across their customer base. So I think that's kind of general. But we do see the growth is going to be coming from Wave 2 ac as well as 10G as we migrate towards the back half of the year. Obviously, both of those are somewhat of a driver as it relates to Q2's activity as well.
Ross Seymore
So a similar question, the 802.11n market share gains, little surprised that that performed so well. I know you said earlier that it will go down over time. But what led to the market share gains there in what I would assume to be a more competitive market?
Sean Sobers
On the 802.11n side, it's actually a smaller group of customers there and we have one customer in particular go and convert kind of an older SKU that wasn't Quantenna into a Quantenna SKU. So now they are only selling Quantenna Wi-Fi. So that was able for us to capture market share that way. It did have somewhat of a meaningful impact. I guess when you look at what 802.11n has done historically, recent and near quarters too, what was able to be done in Q1. But we think over time, as with all the standard products, they migrate on to the next generation from n to ac and then ac to ax.
Ross Seymore
Then the last question, one for Sam, and you touched on this a little bit earlier about the 10G product, but I just wondered if in lieu of talking about one specific customer or any specific customer, which I know you're not going to do, can you talk a little bit about the breadth of adoption of the 8x8 solutions and is there any way for us to judge by the number of service providers that are adopting that to get a good idea of what the revenue trajectory of the Company may be going forward and also as a sign of the competitive intensity and your ability to stay ahead of those competitors?
Sam Heidari
Right. So we do have a definite lead against the competitors today and these design wins that we have mentioned earlier with the service providers are very sticky and for the long-term. So the ones that you establish and go to deployment, you get to deploy them for a while. So now if you want to quantify that, the numbers of the design wins that we are talking about right now are intense. So there are a meaningful number of the design wins that are going to convert to 8x8 as a function of time. So I mean that's all I can tell you about, but it is not a novelty number of designs.
Ross Seymore
Great. Congrats guys. Thanks.
Operator
There are no further questions. I will now turn it back over to Sam.
Sam Heidari
Thank you. On the behalf of Quantenna worldwide team, I would like to thank you for your interest and continued support. Operator, this concludes the call.

Vern Essi
Thank you, Maria. And welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Dr. Sam Heidari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Sobers, Chief Financial Officer. Before we start our prepared comments, I want to call your attention to our supplementary financial commentary, which was included in our 8-K filing today and is available on our Investor Relations website at quantenna.com.
For providing the financial commentary written in financials, Sean’s remarks will be abbreviated and certain metrics not discussed in today’s call including historical comparisons and GAAP to non-GAAP measures will appear in the financial commentary. Financial commentary should be referenced in conjunction with both, today’s conference call remarks and the earnings press release issued today.
On our call today, Sam will discuss Quantenna’s highlights from the fourth quarter and our competitive differentiation. This will be followed by Sean with financial overview and guidance. Sam will then conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for question-and-answer.
Before I turn the call over to Sam, I would like to announce the investor conferences that we’ll be participating in, during the first quarter. These include the Morgan Stanley Technology Media and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on March 2nd, as well as the 29th Annual Roth Conference in Orange County on March 13th.

Now, I’ll turn the call over to Sam. Sam?
Dr. Sam Heidari
Thank you, Vern. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2016 was an excellent year for Quantenna, and I’m excited to share with you our accomplishments. Today, we have a lot of good news to share, and I appreciate your interest and support in Quantenna.
Let us start by briefly reviewing our Q4 and 2016 financial highlights.
I’m pleased to report that Quantenna produced a strong revenue growth, delivering $37.5 million for the fourth quarter and $129 million for the year. This represents a growth of 48% over the fourth quarter of 2015 and 54% over the full year 2015. We have a very strong balance sheet with $117 million in cash, and generated positive cash from the operations in both, fourth quarter and the full year 2016.
During the fourth quarter, we had several milestones that reinforce our position as a leading provider of the highest performance Wi-Fi technology on the planet. I’m excited to report that in the fourth quarter, we started shipping production quantities of our QSR10G products. This product was first announced in September 2015. QSR10G’s unmatched performance takes Wi-Fi technology to a whole new level, addressing additional markets and applications. QSR10G offers the fastest Wi-Fi speed available on the market today. We’re now going to start offering investors quality update on our 10G Wave 3 revenue in addition to the revenue from our core growth in 802.11ac Wave 2 and legacy 802.11 offerings. Please refer to our financial commentary and information which Sean will discuss later today.
Also, during the fourth quarter, we announced the industry’s first 802.11ax Wi-Fi chipset, built on and is pin compatible to our QSR10G Wave 3 platform. We believe we have a time to market advantage, and we are well-positioned to address users high density needs when the 11ax standard starts rolling out to customers.
And lastly, something which I think most of you are aware of. We successfully priced our IPO and raised approximately $100 million in net proceeds. Not only being a public company made us more attractive to hire top engineering talent, it has also boosted our profile with our customers and supply chain. And under IPO, I would just like to take a moment to thank all the employees who have created the most innovative a state-of-the-art product. It really does take a strong team to push the envelope on what is possible, and I couldn’t be more proud of our employees. I would also like to thank our customers, every single one of them, particularly the especial thanks goes to the ones who supported us in our early growth phase.
Now, I would like to address the questions that we have heard from some investors for our news or story. What makes Quantenna differentiated from other Wi-Fi chipset vendors? Isn’t the Wi-Fi technology built on well-defined standards? Well, while it’s true that our products are based on the IEEE 802.11ax standard, the opportunity for differentiation is broad. Implementation of the mandatory standard features matter; above that there are optional and proprietary features that are implemented uniquely by chipset vendors. Using the automobile analogy to our mandatory set of features for cars, such as engine, tires and steering wheel but not all cars are created equal. The technique and the knowhow in the implementation of these mandatory features significantly matters. These basic features embody essentially what the IEEE specs outline for minimum Wi-Fi functionality, while vendors’ implementation makes all the difference.
Furthermore to add, IEEE spec also outlines optional features such as MIMO order, higher channel bandwidth and beamforming. It is up to the chipset vendor to implement or not these optional features. The chipset vendors, based on their cost, performance and scheduled trade off may or may not decide to implement these features. Quantenna has always taken a pioneering approach in implementation of these standard optional features. We have been the first with beamforming, first with 4x4 MIMO, first with Multi-User MIMO, first 8x8 with the highest bandwidth utilization, and there are many other examples as such.

Additionally, we laid on top of this our proprietary features that truly separates us from our competitors. These include but are not limited to our unique algorithm for the utilization of radar bands or network analytic platform or network optimization software and more. Much like we are entering a new era of traveling by automobile where navigation and diagnosis are driven by sophisticated algorithm or Wi-Fi solutions are algorithmic intensive and enable another domination of intelligence and performance. This unique layer that we have created on top of their standard has enabled us to win top tier account addressing challenging needs such as a whole home coverage on wireless linear video distribution. In the latter, we succeeded against the only competition at the time which was a wired connection.
As many of you know, we are partnering with the leading service providers in their mission to deliver the best connectivity experience to the end users. So, the major change occurring in the web service provider are approaching their business model. Traditionally, it has been a risk to bring the largest broadband pipes to your doorsteps. Today, however, we are inside your home, building a state-of-the-art high-performance network that is ready for the future. They want to own these signal path end-to-end, not only to solve the current home connectivity challenge but also offer a wide range of services that are only beginning to emerge. We plan to be the strategic partner for this highest performance and most reliable Wi-Fi technology today and for the future.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Quantenna’s Chief Financial Officer, Sean Sobers. Sean?
Sean Sobers
Thanks, Sam. Good afternoon, everyone. As Vern previously stated, our financial commentary should be referenced in conjunction with both my remarks and the earnings press release issued today.
We are pleased to report record fourth quarter revenue of $37.5 million and record annual revenue of $129 million. This represents 48% growth over the fourth quarter last year and 54% growth over full year 2015.
Our fourth quarter gross margin was a record 51.5%. Gross margin improved due to a combination of factors but primarily due to favorable customer mix. We also generated $600,000 in positive cash from operations in the fourth quarter and generated $2.3 million for the full year 2016. Our non-GAAP EPS, which excludes stock-based compensation was $0.03 for the fourth quarter and $0.04 for 2016. 
Turning to our balance sheet, we closed 2016 with $117 million in cash and cash equivalents. Accounts receivable ended at $14.5 million or 35 days sales outstanding, this compares to $17.3 million or 46 days in the third quarter. The improvement was primarily due to favorable timing of customer payments. Inventory ended at $15.8 million or 4.6 annualized turns in the fourth quarter compared to $10.2 million or 6.7 annualized turns in the third quarter. This increase was due to an increased purchases of inventory in anticipation of future product sales in subsequent quarters. For the first quarter, we expect inventory to remain flat or mostly decline -- or moderately decline as we continue to ramp products into our channels to support customer demand.
We are pleased to share with the investment community our revenue segmentation by Wi-Fi technology, which should help investors better understand the adoption curve and lifecycle of our technology innovations.
Our 802.11ac Wave 2 products increased from 71% of revenue in the third quarter to 84% in the fourth quarter. Our legacy 802.11n revenue decreased from 29% of revenue in the third quarter to 15% in the fourth quarter. And as Sam mentioned earlier, we experienced our first production shipments of our 802.11ac Wave 3 10G product, which at 1% of revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to grow materially off this relatively small base throughout 2017.

I will now cover our guidance for the first quarter of 2017. For background, please note that Quantenna just completed a 14-week period in the fourth quarter; in our current, we shift to a regular 13-week period. As the first quarter progresses we have seen continued demand from our customers in our 802.11n and ac Wave 2 products coupled with the ramp in our 10G products. As a result, and prior years have indicated, historically Q1 revenue is seasonally lower than Q4 revenue. Additionally, we are operating with one last week sequentially. Taking all this into account, we expect first quarter revenue to between $34.5 million to $36.5 million.
Our product mix in the first quarter is not anticipated to be as favorable as we experienced in the fourth quarter. Although less meaningful, as we’ve discussed previously with investors, we anticipate the gross margin on our 10G product will be below the corporate average until we complete cost optimization efforts toward the end of 2017. Accordingly, we anticipate our GAAP gross margin for the first quarter to be between 48% and 50%.
We continue to invest in sales and R&D however. We’ll have one less week in the first quarter relative to the fourth. Thus, we expect first quarter operating expenses to decline between 5% to 10% sequentially as we shift to a standard 13-week first quarter. In the first quarter, we expect upfront tax expenses related to establishing our new corporate structure as a public company. As a result, we’re expecting additional tax expenses in the range of $250,000 to $350,000 in the first quarter, plus what we believe will be our normal tax rate of 3% to 7%.
To summarize, for the first quarter, we anticipate a GAAP loss of $0.03 per share to a $0.05 per share loss; and for non-GAAP earnings per share to be between breakeven and $0.02. Please refer to our GAAP to non-GAAP business outlook reconciliations contained in our earnings release for more information.
I would also like to note that while we understand there’s interest related to our larger service provider customers, we do not plan to share specifics about our customer relationships. Therefore, we’ll not be discussing or updating specific design win details with investors on a regular basis. We appreciate your understanding.
I’d like to now turn the call over to Sam for concluding remarks. Sam?
Dr. Sam Heidari
Thank you, Sean. As I discussed earlier on the call, we continue to work diligently to bring the best Wi-Fi experience to our customers in the service providers’ space. On top of that opportunity, we’re also working with key partners in the retail space for high performance Wi-Fi solutions. Furthermore, in the software-intensive enterprise space, we’re focused on our customer engagement.
One final thing, I’d like to discuss the market opportunity for our products. ABI Research forecast that non-portable Wi-Fi enabled devices will grow at a compound annual growth of 11% from 2016 through 2021. Diving in to that data a layer deeper, the 4x4 MIMO market is expected to have a 50% CAGR from 2016 through 2021, and 8x8 MIMO market is expected to have an 82% CAGR from 2016 through 2021. We’re effectively the only Wi-Fi -- the only 8x8 solution currently offered in the market.
So, in the summary, we’re very proud of our heritage of bringing the best-in-class Wi-Fi solutions to the market to better everyone’s life. We’re Wi-Fi perfector.
This concludes our prepared remarks. We’d now like to open the call up to your questions. Maria?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore
You talked a little bit about the 10G ramp; you still have the same assumption that the cost down products sort of improves the gross margins in the fourth quarter, any new updates there? And then, how quickly do you see adoption, if you can talk about your new customers, from existing customers, how quickly do you see 10G rolling into production? Thank you.

Sean Sobers
This is Sean. We expect the 10G product ramp to be kind of as we talked about it in the past, to be a really second half event. Our customers generally take a while for rollout. So, it will happen in the back half of 2017. From a gross margin, perspective, we are continuing to do cost optimization, which will start to impact the financial statements in the back half of 2017 as well.
Joe Moore
And I noticed that one of your competitors today press released their 11ax solution pump. I know you guys are sampling early this year; I don’t know if you can sample that yet, if you can give an update there. And then, is that product that can go into production? You see volume more 2018 2019, just an update on your latest thoughts on ax? Thank you.
Dr. Sam Heidari
Yes. Traditionally, all competitors have followed us as a function of time. We did notice the announcement today, and we think that this -- what they have announced and their performance matches our 5G product that we announced earlier. We still believe that we have the highest performance available in the market and the fact that we are ahead of them in the market with the product maturity.
Operator
Our next question comes from line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore
On the revenue side in the quarter and the guide were both couple million stronger than I had expected. Can you talk a little bit about -- was that just conservatism in our prior discussions or was something actually better than you had expected? And if so, what was it?
Sean Sobers
Our overall philosophy is to be able to print the numbers, not guide them. So, we want to see that it’s there. So, you can maybe say, there’s a little bit conservatism in there. But we also did feel, we had a strong quarter and we are very comfortable with our outlook.
Ross Seymore
And as I look at the OpEx side of the equation, Sean, I know you had 14 weeks, so that messed up the comparisons a little bit. But if I think about OpEx going forward from the mid-16 level that you are applying, $16 million that is. How should we think about that growing, as we go through the rest of the year?
Sean Sober
We are going to continue to invest in the business, specifically in R&D on the technical sales as well. So, you are going to see us grow over time. Obviously, it’s going to grow less than we expect revenue to grow, so that’s where we have -- or expect to have margin expansion. So, it’s similar to things that we discussed in the past.
Ross Seymore
Then, I guess the last question on my side on the gross margin side of the equation, Joe asked a little bit about the trajectory when the 10G product really ramps. But generally speaking, as we think about the mix that you are now segmenting by those different products, is it almost always going to be that it’s the new products initially ramp up that pulls the gross margin down for a period of time or is this specific to the 10G product launch?
Sean Sobers
No. I think that’s a reasonable assumption. We are generally opting [ph] the leading edge, trying to make the best things and get into our customers’ hands as fast as possible. Then, the evolution of the products and the cost of the products, go through the cost optimization over time; so that’s when you start to see margin expansion.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
Blayne Curtis
Maybe a follow-up, couple of on the gross margin. Sean, maybe if you could just talk about, you said mix throughout the trend in December. If you could just maybe elaborate on what the puts and takes there. And I think when you look into March, I am just trying to figure out the puts and takes as well. Was December just a high mix and it is kind of reverting back to a more normal? And then, maybe you could talk about 10G timing of that and the impacts to gross margin in March versus prior expectations?

Seas Sobers
Yes. I think as we stated little bit in prepared remarks is 10G is going to have a below corporate average margin, which will have some impact on the margin as it grows. That’s one of the impacts into Q1. And then, there is just general mix expectation as we go into Q1 that’s going to have the gross margin itself off late.
Blayne Curtis
Okay. And then, maybe just from a revenue perspective, I don’t know if you want to address it by either customers or maybe geographic, it’s easier to talk about where you saw particular strength in the summer?
Sean Sobers
I think it was essentially across the board. I mean, we’re seeing the highest level of Wi-Fi need across the board in general. Obviously, you start to see our ac product, the traditional or mainstream products, 4x4 11ac products continuing to pick up and 11n going down. So, you are starting to see that. But, it wasn’t any one geography or any one customer.
Blayne Curtis
And then just one housekeeping, the share count that you are implying for March, just given all the moving pieces?
Sean Sobers
It’s not much different.
Blayne Curtis
Okay.
Sean Sobers
Hold on a second. We around 38 million. Yes, it’s about that.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton of Needham & Company.
Quinn Bolton
Hey, guys. I will offer my congratulations on the nice revenue and margins. Sean, I just wanted to come back to the fourth quarter results. Can you give us some sense, was the upside sort of -- you said was across the board, was that really with existing customer or were there any new service providers that ramped in the quarter that also contributed to the results?
Sean Sobers
Yes. Quinn, that’s a good question. There was definitely growth across our existing customers for sure, and then we had a couple of guys turning online in Q4 but in insignificant amount, so wasn’t really big number movers. So, it was really the existing customer base.
Quinn Bolton
Okay. And any similar comments about Q1, is that mostly existing customers or couple of guys that started to turn on in Q4, start to contribute a little bit more substantially in that Q1?
Sean Sobers
That’s exactly. They are turning on and it should get bigger as we go through Q1 and that’s our expectation, so those newer customers. In addition, we expect to continue to maintain and grow our existing customer base.
Quinn Bolton
Great. And then, for Sam, this Qualcomm 8x8 MIMO solution was introduced this morning, but I think their total throughput is about 5 gig versus your 10 gig solution; I think the difference is sort of the 80 megahertz channel. As you look at that really from the competitor, are there other things that you think you’ve got a leadership position other than the channel capacity of your chipset versus their chipset?
Dr. Sam Heidari
We’re definitely looking at that closely right now and studying it. Obviously, we just saw the announcement today as well. What you identified is definitely one of the parameters. Definitely this product that we have today, which is shipping and is reaching a level of maturity and twice the performance is definitely an advantage there too, because the level of maturity and work which has been on it, it is definitely differentiation for the foreseen future and obviously performance as you mentioned.
Quinn Bolton
Okay. And then, last question from me, I know that AX standard is still sort of being finalized, any sort of sense when you think you might see these AX solutions coming to market?
Dr. Sam Heidari
Yes. So, we are still under same forecast as we have talked about that it will be toward the end of the year when you start seeing the AX products making into market. You saw the announcements of Qualcomm today, which we do welcome in a sense that it does bring clients into the market. We do believe, it is going to take time for them to get those products ready and shipping. And we are going to be ready with that with our super 11 ax APs to serve them the best way possible.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Suji Desilva of ROTH Capital.
Suji Desilva
Can you talk about the revenue visibility you see into the first quarter; how do you guys think about it in terms of backlog coverage or any other ways you can describe…
Sean Sobers
Yes. I think one of the things that we’ve talked about in the past is our lead time from build to revenue is about 14 weeks. So, we have a really good view to the coming quarter. You can quickly do the math and we’re half way through the quarter, so we’re even more confident on where we think we’re going to be as we close out the quarter. So, visibility for the quarter is good and we’re obviously and looking towards Q2 already.
Suji Desilva
And then, on the OpEx side, can you talk specifically about the R&D and whether there’s tape outs coming at certain points in the year that we should call out to know that there’ll be movement in R&D versus a typical linearity?
Sean Sobers
The tapeouts do cause some movements in R&D, there’s nothing of significance to note in Q1. And if there are things to point out, we’ll point them out to you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla of William Blair.
Anil Doradla
A couple of questions. So, Sam, when you look at 2017, clearly, there’s an upgrade cycle going on with the DOCSIS 3.1; whether you talk to the tuner guides, antenna guides, there’s clearly a trend there. Can you share how much you guys are going to benefit in 2017 with this 3.1?
Dr. Sam Heidari
Well, that is a hard question for me to answer because I know it’s going to lead toward some customer assumptions. But nevertheless, any type of upgrade of the residential gateway, it is in our benefit. I would say, DOCSIS 3.1 is going to require a higher -- well, it’s a highest performance DOCSIS yet to deploy and therefore, it should have a matching Wi-Fi to go with it. And when that cycle happens, I hope that the cable providers are providing the best Wi-Fi performance to match their DOCSIS performance.
Anil Doradla
So, your engagements, if we go beyond the United States and North America, do you see engagements with cable operators beyond North America at this stage in 2017?
Dr. Sam Heidari
Yes. North America has been our -- the design wins that we’ve had with the cable guys has been mostly focused around North America. We’re exploring other geographies as a functional plan.
Anil Doradla
And, you talked about the state of the industry’s being around 4x4. Some of my peers have asked questions about Qualcomm solution. So, all these deployments that are going on, is it fair to say that anything above 4x4 today is pre-Wi-Fi Alliance certified?
Dr. Sam Heidari
Anything above 4x4 today is pre-Wi-Fi Alliance certified, that’s correct. The features above 4x4, because everything above 4x4 is a super set of 4x4; so you can’t have the Wi-Fi Alliance certification but some of those features have not made it to the Wi-Fi certification yet.
Anil Doradla
And that’s your strength, to some extent. So, as I look at 2017, Sam, should I be looking at -- most of your incremental growth especially as we look at some of the 10G, some of the ac products, largely structured around greater than 4x4 pre-Wi-Fi certified Alliance deployments?
Dr. Sam Heidari
So, 2017 is going to be a mix of new designs that we have had -- or 4x4 designs. So, we are still wining designs in that arena, as recent as last few months. And we have obviously -- we are the only one who is providing solutions above 4x4 or in 8x8. So, 2017, revenue growth is going to be a mix of both. There are yet products to be introduced in the market, which are not there, or 4x4 raised to 11ac product. Going back to the earlier conversation, this is again, another way of looking at the product maturity matters. So, even though our competitors have announced 4x4 solutions for some time now, we are still winning in that market, even though our competitor has announced the 8x8 solution today, which has yet to reach a level of maturity; and the features set that we have today is not included in that. So, we strongly believe we will win with both products that we have in our disposal today in those markets.

Anil Doradla
And if I can squeeze one in for Sean. Sean, can you give us some qualitative color on the breakdown between enterprise and service provider today?
Sean Sobers
Yes, Anil. I think historically, we are very focused on the service provider, and from a revenue split perspective, most of revenue is from service provider today. We are focused on enterprise going forward, as Sam talked about. And I think that will become more impactful as we leave 2017 and into 2018.
Operator
I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Sam Heidari for any additional or closing remarks.
Dr. Sam Heidari
Thank you, Maria. And thank you, everyone. On the behalf of Quintana’s worldwide team I would like to thank you for your interest and continued support. Operator, that concludes the call.
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s fourth quarter and 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

802.11ac: How to Know When it's the Right Time to Upgrade


The 802.11ac standard has brought with it the promise of delivering the fastest Wi-Fi speeds, better range, and more stable connections. However, as with previous standards, there's been a lot of consumer confusion about what all the Wi-Fi terminology on the box means, and when it's time to buy. The simple answer regarding 802.11ac is, not right now. Not unless you want to waste your money.
Although we’ve seen an initial surge of 802.11ac products, not all 802.11ac chips are built… Continue

For New Wi-Fi Applications, Old Standards Don’t Measure Up


When it comes to measuring technological performance, it’s hard to resist the allure of a simple number. To compare digital cameras, buyers carefully compared megapixel count. For decades, clock speed—megahertz, then gigahertz—served as the universal shorthand for CPU performance. The higher the number the better it is, most people thought.
Of course it was never true, and that became evident once single-core CPU performance plateaued. Manufacturers began touting their caching, their… Continue

Sam Heidari: Perfecting Wi-Fi Technology






By Jahandad Memarian































With the goal of harnessing the untapped potential of Iranian-Americans, and to build the capacity of the Iranian diaspora in effecting positive change in the U.S. and around the world, the West Asia Council has launched a series of interviews that explore the personal and professional backgrounds of prominent Iranian-Americans who have made seminal contributions to their fields of endeavor.  Our latest interviewee is Sam Heidari.
Dr. Sam Heidari serves as the Chief Executive Officer of Quantenna Communications, Inc., chairman of the board of directors of SiTune Corporation, board member of Global Semiconductor Alliance and member of advisory board to the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California.  Previously, Dr. Heidari served as the Chief Technology Officer of Ikanos Communications, Inc.  Dr. Heidari has authored and published over a dozen refereed journals and conference papers. For more details, please click (here).
Tell our readers where you grew up and walk us through your background. How did your family and surroundings influence you in your formative years?
I was born in Northern Iran, in the green province of Gilan by the Caspian Sea.  I moved to the US when I was 17 and finished my high school here in Menlo Park.  I think that there were two main factors that have influenced me till today:
First, the value of education was ingrained in me (like many Iranians) since an early age. I grew up in a learned family surrounded by like-minded friends. Growing up, the value of education was way above anything else such as wealth and luxury.
The second factor was the drive to make a positive difference in the lives of others, which was also ingrained in me since an early age, a combination of what my parents emphasized and the idealized version of our cultural background, which stresses, in its classical literary texts of prose and poetry, that care for humanity is a main purpose of life.
What has been your personal key to success? What were the biggest inspirations for your career?
It is a strange question for me since "success" can be defined in different ways. I think of life as a journey, and material success is very relative with an expiration date associated with it.  If you look at it financially, given the poverty and the hardship in the world, the majority of professionals living in this country are doing very well. Now, the question is am I the top single digit percent or fraction of percent, etc., but who cares.
But the sources of my inspiration have evolved through time. In all candor, as a young man, my inspiration and ambition was to make a name for myself.  I wanted to leave a legacy behind (in a good way). But I have come to realize that I enjoy the process of building, nurturing and enhancing things. Things being products, companies or my fruit trees in my backyard. Planting and harvesting it. Being part of the team to build the fastest DSL modem in the world, or being part of the team to build a unique innovative company with a set of values and culture that is to become an innovation and creation engine, give me similar satisfaction. So does putting our homegrown fruits on the table. The satisfaction of creating and building. That is what drives me. The process of building and looking at the end product, and feeling growth, inspire me.
Under your leadership, Quantenna has been raising the bar on users' experience by delivering the most advanced Wi-Fi hardware and software solutions and enabling new applications. Can you describe its significance?
 Wireless connectivity is an essential part of our lives today.  And within that Wi-Fi is the dominant interface in the world. There are billions of Wi-Fi devices in operation today, more than any other kind of connectivity (wired or wireless) in history.  Meanwhile, by pushing the performance bar on Wi-Fi, Quantenna is enabling applications that were not possible before through wireless technology. Our technology not only enables a new consumer experience but also ends up saving operating costs and equipment costs for service providers. For example, TV service providers such as your typical Cable or Satellite companies can bring programming into every room of your house (or as matter of fact into your back yard) without spending a lot of money on cabling your house.  Or you don't have to worry about no-access areas in your home, or spend a lot of money on new equipment or service to fix it. Meeting the demands of seamless connectivity is only going to get more challenging with time, as more devices are connected to the Wi-Fi network, with bandwidth requirements per device increasing and with interference from other Wi-Fi networks increasing. Quantenna is working to make sure that success of Wi-Fi continues for years to come and new applications are more and more enabled on those Wi-Fi networks.
Since you have a PhD in electrical engineering, can you address the relationship between academia and industry in your field? How can their relationship be optimized?
University is obliviously where it all starts both in terms of talent development and ideas creation.  Industry is in continuous need of well-trained and educated talent, and a continuous supply of engineering and science talent is a core requirement of our economy. But it is also certain that many of the great ideas of our time were created in academia away from the pressure of quarterly financial reporting. From the other end of the spectrum, a main contribution of industry to academia, besides providing financial support through grants, is to provide the feedback required to close the loop on intended use of academic research.  No system ever evolves for better without a feedback mechanism.  Industry must be the feedback mechanism to academia and the builder of bridges to bring ideas to practice and enabling the "commercialization" of ideas, to see if and how ideas work in practice.
You have spent almost all of your career in startups. How is that different from working for large companies?
First, I must say that startups are not for everyone, just as large companies are not for everyone. To use an analogy, being in a large company is like a bus ride.  In general, it is safe and predictable. But you are only a passenger with little input of where it goes and when it goes. But the safety could go away when a crazy or drunk bus driver takes over, and you have zero say in the driver's selection. Small companies start like a bike ride. It takes more energy, but the ride could be fun and you are in control. On rainy days, especially when you have a flat tire, you regret being there, but the ride on the nice days makes up for everything. It is the challenge that you cannot let go of, and the journey itself (independent of the destination) makes you a better person.  You are in charge so you can take the short cut in the woods to be way ahead of the bus. The excitement of the dealing with first taken paths, the excitement of the unknown and chaos in front of you and defining it, these make up for a lot.  It is up to you to grow the bicycle to a motorcycle or graduate to an eventual sports car or even a bus. You are in charge of the ride.
On the team level in a startup, there is a huge camaraderie and there should be a huge "care factor". Everyone in a startup should realize that while everyone has an influence on the direction, they are all rowing together for a common goal; they will all succeed together or sink together. There is little "office politics."
Furthermore, in today's economy, where Wall Street quarterly reporting is dictating much of your business, the most innovative work happens in the startups.  If you like to work on the latest and greatest with faster impact, startups are probably for you.
How do you see Silicon Valley's innovation ecosystem. Can it be replicated?
The short answer is, no you cannot and here is why. Technology startups are impacted in general by five factors: 1) access to capital, 2) government regulations, and 3) access to experienced management and technical talent, 4) local culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, and 5) a supportive eco-system of customers and partners. While, one can argue that most of these could be provided in other geographies, Silicon Valley is unique in most or all of these factors.
1) Access to capital. No jurisdiction in the world is as rich in venture capital as Silicon-Valley. While we see that governments are financing startups and technology innovation in many jurisdictions, essentially to imitate Silicon Valley, but it is not the same. Silicon Valley is financially driven and is riding on decades of investment and entrepreneurship experience.  The fact that they have no other motivation than building great standalone businesses does manifest itself in the great companies, technologies, and outcomes that we have seen coming from this area.
2) Government regulations:  I must say that while government does provide little or no financial incentives to start a business in California, it has not overly regulated the process of starting a business, and the flexible labor laws do enable the risk taking nature of the startup.
3) Access to experienced management and cutting-edge technical talent. Some of the greatest universities in the world are located in California and some within miles of Silicon Valley, which supply graduates to area's economic and technological engine.  You seldom see these graduates leaving the area for work elsewhere. The historically entrenched culture of migration and the ease of movement from overseas to the U.S.  - and the reverse - provides access to the best and brightest talent in the world. The open immigration policies of the US for talented and motivated individuals enables access to a global pool of technology talent. The multicultural environment of the Valley encourages many to move here from the four corners of the earth and feel at home.
4) Local culture of innovation and entrepreneurship.  Put simply, there is nowhere like it in the world. The conversations in the restaurants, bars, parks and bus stops is about the latest and greatest companies, as well as innovation and entrepreneurship.  It does not take long to convince your spouse that you are letting go of your well paid job to join a group of young kids with great ideas.  The historical record of success provides a very unique environment. The model of building a growing company is well understood and is common knowledge.
5) Eco-system.  Many of your present and future customers and partners are close by.  It makes it easier to validate ideas, develop winning designs and have access to complementary technology when needed. There are thousands of companies and businesses that can complement you within miles from your business is based.
You hold more than 40 US and international patents. Can you tell us which ones have been your greatest achievement? What is the first thing new inventors should consider? What should they avoid?
 I am not sure if I have a favorite, there were a couple that have a level of excitement associated with them and some took a long time to become reality in products; they were a bit too much ahead of their time.
The first thing that an inventor (new or old) should consider is the problem statement, what is the problem that he/she is trying to solve?  They say that need is the mother of invitation. You cannot innovate for the sake of innovation; the problem comes ahead of the solution. There are too many times when I see that we have a solution that is looking for a problem. That is not the most productive approach to innovation. 
What was your motivation for writing Time-Full Friendship? What is this book about?
This short children's book is about three friends: Mr. Hour, Mrs. Minute and Miss Second, and it is meant as a fun educational means to teach the concept of time and the operation of a clock to kids.  I first got the idea during my English class when I had just moved here, where I was asked to describe the concept of machinery, and I thought that by giving life and character to the building blocks of a clock, we could make it fun for kids to learn. It took me many years, but it was a personal desire to take the class story to the next stage by getting it published.  The second motivation or what gave me energy to work on it, were my kids. It was a great opportunity for me to interact with my kids in the process.  I did appreciate their thoughts and feedback all along, and in the end, we committed to give our proceedings to children's charities.  I hope it thought them (and me) about the most important things in life.
