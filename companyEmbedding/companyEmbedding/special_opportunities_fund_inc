P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.

Sep 21, 2016 5:31 PM EDT













 




























































  Special Opportunities Fund, Inc. (NYSE: SPE) (the "Fund") today announced that it is offering to purchase up to 1.15 million common shares of the Fund at 97% of the net asset value ("NAV") per common share as determined at the close of the regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange on the Termination Date (as defined below). In accordance with the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), the Fund may purchase additional shares not to exceed 2% of the outstanding shares without amending or extending the tender offer.  The tender offer will commence on September 21, 2016 and will expire at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on October 21, 2016 (the "Termination Date"), unless the tender offer is extended. The offer is being made upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the tender offer statement, which will be mailed on or about September 28, 2016 to record holders of common shares as of September 27, 2016. A stockholder that holds shares in street name and wishes to accept the tender offer should check with his or her custodian to confirm when it requires notice (which may be prior to October 21, 2016).  This announcement is not a recommendation, an offer to purchase or a solicitation to sell any securities of the Fund. The Fund has filed with the Commission a tender offer statement on Schedule TO under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to the tender offer. Common stockholders of the Fund should read the tender offer statement carefully as it contains important information. Stockholders may obtain the tender offer statement and other filed documents without charge at the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov.
