Science-Based Product Formulation
NAI scientifically designs and customizes nutritional products based on the unique needs of individual clients. New products and formulas are researched and tested prior to full-scale production. NAI continuously produces pilot or sample runs of product formulation prototypes to ensure stability and/or efficacy and to determine ingredient interaction and prospective customer acceptance of the final product. The company also directs and participates in clinical research studies to establish consumer benefits and scientific efficacy supporting both product claims and marketing initiatives.
NAI's team of scientists utilizes the verified results of these clinical studies to design customized nutritional products. NAI has performed numerous clinical investigations in affiliation with renowned universities and research institutions, both in the United States and internationally. The study results are presented at various scientific meetings and symposia and are published in numerous peer reviewed scientific journals. The science behind our formulations ensures that our customers receive the most advanced nutritional supplements available.[back to top]

Raw Material Acquisition and Analysis 
The manufacturing process begins when NAI receives a formal copy of the customer's purchase order. The order is entered into a state-of-the-art BAAN computer system, which manages all aspects of production scheduling, raw material delivery, packaging coordination, and shipment tracking. A printout is generated specifying which raw materials are needed to complete the order. Raw material vendors are then contacted. NAI has agents searching for raw materials in locations around the globe. NAI uses only the finest materials available. Materials are kept in quarantine and rigorously tested to ensure quality, purity and potency.[back to top]
Production
 In September 1999, NAI opened a new facility in Vista, California for
        materials receiving, warehousing, weighing and blending and distribution.
        The facility consolidates these operations into one location to improve
        materials and inventory management, work-in-process manufacturing, product
        distribution, as well as overall manufacturing and quality process controls.
        Quantities of each material are weighed out according to specifications
        outlined in the batch record, verified by a second party and are then
        assigned to a designated blender.
Raw materials are added to the blender in sequence and rotated according to a prescribed mixing time. Formulations are assayed by batch, ensuring the potency and purity of every product we manufacture. The blended material is then encapsulated or compressed into solid dosage forms of either chewable wafers or tablets, producing capsules, tablets or caplets that adhere to exacting standards.[back to top]
Testing and Quality Assurance 
Our onsite laboratory continuously monitors the output of the production facility to ensure the highest quality of finished goods. We conduct extensive laboratory testing on state-of-the-art laboratory equipment including High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrophotometry (ICP), Dissolution and Absorption, Microbiological Testing, and Fourier Transform Near Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-NIR). All products are meticulously examined for weight, ingredient homogeneity, color standardization and content levels. Tablets are tested for hardness, thickness, dissolution and integrity. This extensive laboratory testing ensures that NAI's customers are supplied with products that conform to the highest standards.
NAI certifies that each raw material used meets or exceeds the requirements upheld by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP) and the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia (TGA). Raw materials are also tested to ensure that they are free of harmful pesticides and herbicides and have no trace of heavy metal contamination. NAI maintains a Retention Room where samples of product, Certificates of Analysis and identification of vendors and lot numbers for raw materials are stored for a minimum of five years. This enables the Company to trace the source of every element of every product.
NAI maintains compliance with both USP and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) for Food, Drugs and Cosmetics, which are used internationally to ensure that products manufactured under these strict guidelines fulfill required standards of quality for nutraceutical products. NAI's quality control is part of every step of its manufacturing and procurement processes.
In October 1999, NAI received certification and approval from the prestigious Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia (TGA) for its encapsulating and tableting operations. In March 2000 the Company was re-certified in all areas including its new packaging operations. The TGA is a Division of the Federal Department of Health and Aged Care and is responsible for administering the provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Act. The TGA evaluates new therapeutic products, prepares standards, develops testing methods and conducts testing programs to ensure products are high quality, safe and effective. TGA certification also enables the Company to manufacture products for export into countries which have signed the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and includes most European countries as well as several Pacific Rim countries. The TGA's goal is to protect public health by ensuring that products meet definable standards of quality assurance and are manufactured in conditions that are clean and free of contaminants. These stringent standards ensure standardized quality in all products manufactured by NAI.[back to top]
Packaging 
Once encapsulation and tableting are completed, finished products are assigned to a packaging line. In April 2000, NAI began operating its own finished goods packaging facility in Vista, CA. This new capability substantially eliminates the need to use outside packaging services to produce finished goods. NAI's packaging capabilities include bottles, powder fill, blister cards and packets. Management believes the ability to offer in-house packaging will help control costs and improve inventory management/quality control. As an example, product components are checked for lot identification, quality and adherence to specifications both prior to and during the packaging process. Tamper-evident safety seals are applied to each bottle to ensure the integrity of the product.

After packaging is completed, the finished product is palleted, labeled and prepared for shipment. NAI's Graphic Design team works with each customer to create labels that have aesthetic appeal and adhere to Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) guidelines for consumer labeling set forth by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration.[back to top]
Marketing Support
NAI's marketing and product development experts are accomplished in the areas of market research, supplement design, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, international product registration and regulatory compliance. The Company provides in-house graphic design capabilities and works with clients to create label designs, brochures, videos and other promotional tools to appropriately market its products. The combination of these components is part of a cohesive strategy designed to increase mass-market consciousness, boost brand awareness among the health-conscious consumers and facilitate expansion into new markets and channels of distribution. 
As part of its marketing strategy, NAI works with nationally recognized physicians to both increase our understanding of the ever-changing marketplace and to develop branded products that reflect unique approaches to restoring, maintaining or improving health. 
NAI's success in the formulation, development, manufacturing and marketing of specialized products is predicated on its dedication to research and development, technology, science and state-of-the-art manufacturing. The comprehensive services NAI offers has established NAI as an innovator in the field of nutritional science.[back to top]

CARLSBAD, Calif., July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Natural Alternatives International, Inc. ("NAI") (Nasdaq:   NAII), a leading formulator, manufacturer and marketer of customized nutritional supplements, and Indur, a health and wellness lifestyle and products company dedicated to empowering individuals to take control of their own physical health and appearance, recently announced the inclusion of the clinically proven full daily dose of SR CarnoSyn® sustained release beta-alanine in Indur's newly released workout accelerator product, Indur Launch.








Kenneth Wolf, President and Chief Operating Officer of NAI stated, "We are pleased that Indur is the first sports nutrition brand to bring SR CarnoSyn® powder to consumers at retail, delivering the clinically proven daily dose of 6.4 grams of CarnoSyn® beta-alanine. SR CarnoSyn®, in its powder form, is a new delivery system for CarnoSyn® beta-alanine, offering a sustained release profile designed to provide increased daily dosing amounts of up to 6.4 grams per serving with limited paresthesia side effects."
Beta-alanine combines with histidine in the body to form carnosine, which acts as a buffer and helps to delay the onset of muscle fatigue and failure. SR CarnoSyn® beta-alanine is the fastest CarnoSyn® loading system available. The sustained release ingredient stays in the body longer for extended absorption, higher muscle retention, and a significant increase in muscle carnosine levels to extend endurance, speed muscle recovery, build muscle strength, and enhance peak performance capabilities.
"SR CarnoSyn® provides formulation flexibility, extending the benefits of beta-alanine to a much broader group of consumers," said Mark A. LeDoux, NAI's CEO and Chairman. "This proprietary and patented form of beta-alanine shows tremendous market growth potential in applications for serious athletes, as well as active individuals and the healthy aging market." 
About SR CarnoSyn®
SR CarnoSyn® is a clinically studied advanced delivery system of beta-alanine available exclusively from Natural Alternatives International, Inc. An ingredient with application in the areas of sports nutrition, healthy aging, wellness and mental acuity, SR CarnoSyn® is preservative-free, allergen-free, contains no artificial flavors or colors, and is non-GMO. It is suitable for use in a variety of formulations. This vegetarian ingredient is also self-affirmed GRAS, allowing NAI to provide unique SR CarnoSyn® product offerings to the specialty food category. Manufactured using a patented and proprietary microencapsulation technology, SR CarnoSyn® is an ultra-pure amino acid that carries the SR CarnoSyn® logo, ensuring the ingredient is backed by our commitment to the highest quality, potency and manufacturing standards.

Natural Alternatives International, Inc. Key Developments

Nutrabolt Extends its License to Patented Carnosyn Beta-Alanine from Natural Alternatives International, Inc. Through 2026
Jun 26 17
Nutrabolt announced that it has partnered with Natural Alternatives International, Inc., to extend its license to patented CarnoSyn® beta-alanine through 2026. On June 6, 2017, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a new patent to NAI directed to a broad range of improved methods of beta-alanine intake, targeting such benefits as delaying muscle fatigue, increasing anaerobic capacity, increasing muscle strength and increasing muscle endurance. This new intellectual property significantly extends the patent coverage for CarnoSyn® beta-alanine. Nutrabolt, given its market dominance in sports nutrition and vision for the future of nutrition in sports and other fields, was a natural business partner for NAI. Nutrabolt is proud to include the patented, trademarked, and clinically studied CarnoSyn® beta-alanine in several of its products, including its award winning C4® brand of pre-workout products. CarnoSyn® beta-alanine is not only included in the category leading C4® Original pre-workout product but is included in a variety of newly released C4® branded products including C4 Ripped®, C4 Sport®, C4 Extreme EnergyTM, C4 Ultimate® and its ready to drink formula C4 On The Go®. As the only clinically studied form of beta-alanine, CarnoSyn® beta-alanine has been shown to provide numerous performance enhancing benefits including an increase in muscular endurance, making it the perfect addition to a pre-workout product engineered to improve performance. Nutrabolt is proud to display the CarnoSyn® logo on its C4® and other product labels and to continue to conduct University based clinical studies on the performance enhancing benefits of its formulas containing CarnoSyn® beta-alanine. Nutrabolt is proud to partner with NAI, who has a long history of investing significant monies funding research and brand awareness related to beta-alanine around the world, as well as vigorously protecting its intellectual property rights against infringers, providing further value to its licensees.


Natural Alternatives International Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the Third Quarter and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2017
May 15 17
Natural Alternatives International Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the third quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported net sales of $25.135 million compared to $30.006 million a year ago. Income from operations was $0.993 million compared to $3.105 million a year ago. Income before taxes was $1.050 million compared to $4.607 million a year ago. Net income was $0.745 million or $0.11 per basic and diluted share compared to $3.023 million or $0.46 per basic and diluted share a year ago. 

For the nine months, the company reported net sales of $89.761 million compared to $78.502 million a year ago. Income from operations was $7.642 million compared to $7.568 million a year ago. Income before taxes was $8.136 million compared to $9.009 million a year ago. Net income was $5.701 million or $0.86 per diluted share compared to $6.104 million or $0.92 per diluted share a year ago. The increase in net income in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2016 excluding the one-time gain on sale in fiscal 2016, was primarily  attributable to favorable foreign currency activity related to the private label contract manufacturing segment and increased product margin from CarnoSyn® beta-alanine sales due to increased sales and lower supply chain costs.


Natural Alternatives International, Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the Second Quarter and Six Months Ended December 31, 2016; Provides Consolidated Revenue Guidance for the Fiscal 2017
Feb 14 17
Natural Alternatives International, Inc. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the second quarter and six months ended December 31, 2016. For the quarter, the company’s net income of $2.466 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, on net sales of $30.559 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, compared with net income of $1.868 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, on net sales of $26.911 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2015. Net sales during the three months ended December 31, 2016 increased $3.6 million, or 13.6%, from the comparable prior year period. Income from operations was $3.113 million against $2.735 million a year ago. Income before taxes was $3.500 million against $2.660 million a year ago. 

For the six months, the company’s net sales increased $16.1 million, or 33.3%, to $64.626 million from $48.496 million recorded in the comparable prior year period. Net income for the first six months of fiscal 2017 was $4.956 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared to net income of $3.081 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, in the comparable prior year period. This increase was primarily attributable to increased sales related to the company’s private label contract manufacturing segment and increased product margin from CarnoSyn® beta-alanine sales due to increased sales and lower supply chain costs, partially offset by increased legal costs associated with the company’s efforts to enforce compliance with the company’s patents related to instant release CarnoSyn® and to protect the company’s trade name in the market place against parties who are using it without the company’s consent. Income from operations was $6.649 million against $4.463 million a year ago. Income before taxes was $7.086 million against $4.402 million a year ago. 

On an annualized basis, the company now expects its consolidated fiscal 2017 revenue growth percentage to be approximately 5% to 10% due to reductions in contract manufacturing orders and customer forecasts from Australia, Asia, and Europe. The company expects a majority of this decline to occur in its third fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2017 and to a lesser extent in its fourth fiscal quarter. The company believes this international revenue decline will be temporary in nature and will reverse as the company enters fiscal 2018 beginning July 1, 2017. With respect to its CarnoSyn® beta-alanine business, the company expects its current sales growth rate to continue for the balance of this fiscal year as the company continues to expand its research, its patent estate and its client base.

CARLSBAD, Calif., Nov. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Natural Alternatives International, Inc. ("NAI") (Nasdaq:   NAII), a leading formulator, manufacturer and marketer of customized nutritional supplements, today announced net income of $2.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, on net sales of $34.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.








Net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $12.5 million, or 57.8%, from $21.6 million recorded in the comparable prior year period.  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, private label contract manufacturing sales increased $11.1 million, or 68.3%, from the comparable quarter last year.  Our first quarter fiscal 2017 contract manufacturing sales were favorably impacted due to timing and shipment of orders and new product launches. On an annualized basis we expect our fiscal 2017 revenue growth percentage to be approximately 20% to 30%. CarnoSyn® beta-alanine royalty, licensing and raw material sales revenue increased 25.7% to $6.7 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to $5.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  The increase in CarnoSyn® beta-alanine revenue was primarily due to the addition of new customers and increased material shipments to existing customers.  
Net income for our first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $2.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to increased sales and improved operational throughput with lower per unit manufacturing costs related to our private label contract manufacturing segment and increased product margin from CarnoSyn® beta-alanine sales due to increased sales and lower supply chain costs, partially offset by increased legal costs associated with our efforts to enforce compliance with our patents related to instant release CarnoSyn® and to protect our trade name in the market place against parties who are using it without our consent.
As of September 30, 2016, NAI had cash of $17.8 million and working capital of $37.8 million compared to $19.7 million and $36.7 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, we had $10.5 million available under our line of credit agreements.
Mark A. Le Doux, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, "Our first fiscal quarter was outstanding on a year over year comparative basis, both revenues and profits soared for the period.
"Now that we have concluded much of our capacity enhancements in both California and Switzerland, we are focused on expanding our sales partnerships throughout the world.  We look forward to continued growth as strategic sales initiatives, new product introductions, and new product registrations allow."
NAI, headquartered in Carlsbad, California, is a leading formulator, manufacturer and marketer of nutritional supplements and provides strategic partnering services to its customers. Our comprehensive partnership approach offers a wide range of innovative nutritional products and services to our clients including: scientific research, clinical studies, proprietary ingredients, customer-specific nutritional product formulation, product testing and evaluation, marketing management and support, packaging and delivery system design, regulatory review and international product registration assistance. For more information about NAI, please see our website at http://www.nai-online.com.
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are not historical facts and information. These statements represent our intentions, expectations and beliefs concerning future events, including, among other things, our future revenue profits and financial condition, our ability to maintain our patents, generate revenues from the commercialization of our patents and trademarks, secure compliance with our intellectual property rights, and develop, maintain or increase sales to new and existing customers, as well as future economic conditions and the impact of such conditions on our business. We wish to caution readers these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and outcomes for future periods to differ materially from any forward-looking statement or views expressed herein. NAI's financial performance and the forward-looking statements contained herein are further qualified by other risks including those set forth from time to time in the documents filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

("NAI") (NAII), a leading formulator, manufacturer and marketer of customized nutritional supplements, and Indur, a health and wellness lifestyle and products company dedicated to empowering individuals to take control of their own physical health and appearance, recently announced the inclusion of the clinically proven full daily dose of SR CarnoSyn® sustained release beta-alanine in Indur's newly released workout accelerator product, Indur Launch.Kenneth Wolf, President and Chief Operating Officer of NAI stated, "We are pleased that Indur is the first sports nutrition brand to bring SR CarnoSyn® powder to consumers at retail, delivering the clinically proven daily dose of 6.4 grams of CarnoSyn® beta-alanine. SR CarnoSyn®, in its powder form, is a new delivery system for CarnoSyn® beta-alanine, offering a sustained release profile designed to provide increased daily dosing amounts of up to 6.4 grams per serving with limited paresthesia side effects."Beta-alanine combines with histidine in the body to form carnosine, which acts as a buffer and helps to delay the onset of muscle fatigue and failure. SR CarnoSyn® beta-alanine is the fastest CarnoSyn® loading system available. The sustained release ingredient stays in the body longer for extended absorption, higher muscle retention, and a significant increase in muscle carnosine levels to extend endurance, speed muscle recovery, build muscle strength, and enhance peak performance capabilities."SR CarnoSyn® provides formulation flexibility, extending the benefits of beta-alanine to a much broader group of consumers," said Mark A. LeDoux, NAI's CEO and Chairman. "This proprietary and patented form of beta-alanine shows tremendous market growth potential in applications for serious athletes, as well as active individuals and the healthy aging market."About SR CarnoSyn®SR CarnoSyn® is a clinically studied advanced delivery system of beta-alanine available exclusively from Natural Alternatives International, Inc.

Leadership by the Girl Scouts organization were quick to take action by blocking Trump from coming in contact with their young members. The Boy Scout leaders need to man up and resign. This group must live under a rock in the woods to be that stupid as to how Trump is. These are not the type of men we want to lead our Boy Scouts any more.Join the Conversation1 / 5197

Natural Alternatives International (NAI) is an American company based in San Marcos, California which manufactures nutritional supplements such as Juice Plus. NAI was founded in 1980 by Mark A. LeDoux,[1] and had 241 employees in 2007. NAI's manufacturing facilities are located in Vista, California, Switzerland and Japan.[2]
Product Lines[edit]
NAI manufactures products sold by other companies such as National Safety Associates, Mannatech, [3] NuSkin Enterprises, Jenny Craig, and Dr. Reginald Cherry. NAI previously held a multimillion-dollar contract with the U.S. Olympic Committee, which expired in March 1997.[4]
NAI experienced a dramatic shift in its financial situation when NuSkin Enterprises, one of NAI’s largest customers, did not renew its manufacturing contract and began the process of transferring to another manufacturer. Sales subsequently declined 15.5% from $67.9 million USD in 1998, with a net profit of $5.9 million, to $57.4 million in 1999, with a net loss of $2.9 million.[5]
Juice Plus[edit]
One of their main products is Juice Plus, launched in 1993, which was brought up during the O. J. Simpson murder case in 1995, since O. J. Simpson was the product's chief spokesperson.[6]
NAI manufactures Juice Plus products through an exclusive worldwide manufacturing agreement with National Safety Associates.[7] During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, National Safety Associates accounted for approximately 38% of NAI's net sales.[8]
