Never assume hotel or hostel prices are fixed. Book right and massive savings are possible on  rooms.
 We've  25 tips for bagging cheap accommodation, including how to grab  special opening rates, get up to 13% cashback and exploit free cancellation policies.

1Do your research  to pick the right hotel
2Bag the best price using comparison sites
4Play detective  uncover 'secret' hotels
5Save using the 'rebook your hotel' trick
9Sign up for email alerts for extra discounts








11Register with loyalty schemes for mates' rates

22Try a house-swap holiday
23Camp under the stars






Staying in the UK or want a secret-hotel bargain? This guide focuses on worldwide hotels  while some tips apply to the UK too,   also see the dedicated UK Hotels guide. Plus we've a   guide on how to play detective and    Uncover Secret Hotels.




 Do your research first to pick the  right hotel
      Whether you want to spend a few nights in luxury, fancy a cosy boutique hotel or just want a basic room as cheap as chips, the trick is to pick the right   hotel first, within your budget, then try to get it for  the best price possible. You might already have a particular hotel in mind, but if not, it's important to do your homework. 
 When picking your hotel there are a couple of things to watch out for:
Don't trust the star system

Amenities determine star ratings, not quality  a 5* rating is often based on a pool, big foyer and conference facilities, not how nice the place is.
 As there's no universal worldwide standard, stars may be given by governments, review organisations or even the hotel itself, so treat them with a big pinch of salt. See a full guide to 
                      what stars mean.
Check TripAdvisor

A worldwide institution, TripAdvisor* lists detailed reviews and customer ratings for hotels by past guests.

However, always remember anyone can pen a review.    Some hoteliers sign up and post glowing reports of their own hotels.

Once you've settled on a hotel  or a shortlist of several  check out the direct price on its website, but don't book yet. This will give you a good benchmark for the going rate  a useful starting point if you want to haggle later on too. It's also a good way to find out if the hotel's offering any special deals for those who do book direct.

 



 Comparison sites usually give the best price
Check the top comparison sites to see who's selling it cheapest  the same room can be sold at vastly different prices. Here are our three top pick sites:


Try HotelsCombined* or Trivago*   they tend to be cheapest.


To broaden your search, try TravelSupermarket*.


Popular review site TripAdvisor* lets you read reviews and do quick comparisons.


While it's not a comparison site, it's also worth checking Hotels.com* for extra discounts, free stays and member-only prices.
Once you've found the best comparison site price, call the hotel to see if it'll beat it  sometimes they  offer direct bookers  early booking promos or three-for-two night deals that comparison sites miss.
It's all very well us saying it, but to see how it works in reality, and how much you could save, here are a few  successes from those at MSE Towers:

I booked five nights for two people in a five-star hotel in Zanzibar, all inclusive, for £714 total via Trivago. That's less than half  the £1,620 price booking direct. - MSE Nick

I got seven nights in a four-star hotel on the coast near Rome for £565 total, including breakfast. That saved over £100 compared to booking direct, and I got 13% cashback on it too. - MSE Sally


 Beware of hidden taxes and charges
Some brokers hide the true cost of a stay until  the final booking page. In some cases, the first time you'll find out the true figure is at the hotel. 
Many countries charge a £10-£30 per day room tax, which isn't always clearly indicated. Even if a website says that taxes at a particular percentage rate apply on top of the price displayed, you may not find out the actual cost until later. This can mean that some sites unfairly come up cheapest when you're searching. 

      Even comparison sites  sometimes show the price minus taxes, so always click through to check the final price before choosing. See  Revealed: Hidden hotel charges.
Also watch out for rooms 'on request'
If a site says it has rooms 'on request', this means it has only asked for rooms from the hotel  there may  actually not be a room available.  Be careful not to go for one of these and lose a firm cheap deal elsewhere.



Play detective and uncover 'secret' hotel bargains

With a bit of detective work, mega   bargains are available from sites selling 'secret hotel' rooms. Here,  you're just told a star level and rough location  only once you've paid do you  find out the hotel's name. This  means rock-bottom prices, as hotels needn't worry about losing trade from those who go to them directly.
        
      You can never be 100% sure which hotel you'll be staying at before you book, so these sites aren't for those desperate to stay at a particular place. But there are usually sneaky ways to discover the hotels' identities to see if it's worth it.
The top sites which do this include Lastminute.com* and Hotwire for UK and worldwide deals, and the bidding site Priceline*. For a full how-to and more details, see our Uncovering Secret Hotels guide.






 Hotel rebook trick 1  if you book with free cancellation, you can save if the price drops
Whether you've booked via  a travel agent or direct with the hotel, often you're able to cancel for free  up to a certain point, typically 24-48 hours before your stay starts. (If you don't have free cancellation, you may be able to  take advantage of sites' price promises  see more on how below.)
If you book or have booked a room, you can save by cancelling if the price drops after you've booked. Simply cancel the original booking, then rebook at the cheaper price.  Often this can work  with the  site you  booked with.
Most booking sites and hotel websites give you a non-refundable and a free cancellation option for each room type. Non-refundable rooms tend to be cheaper, so you'll need to weigh up if paying more for free cancellation is worth it. 
Here's some inspiration to show it can work:
 I saved £200 when the price dropped two days before travel! - Alison, via Twitter
Even if cancelling your booking isn't free, it's worth weighing  up the cancellation charge against how much the price has dropped  if the charge is small you could still  be quids in. 
How to check if there's free cancellation      
If it's not clear, check the terms and conditions  they should clarify your cancellation rights  before you book. It's  not likely to be free cancellation if you're asked to pay upfront, though it depends what site you book through.
If you can't see a free cancellation room in the options for the hotel you want, call it  and check. 
What to watch out for
Although this can save £100s, it's not foolproof, so:

Check your booking for any hidden  T&Cs  make sure that cancelling really is free, and there aren't any extra charges.
Bear in mind some sites make you  pay in full when booking, even if you can cancel penalty-free. If so, you'll need to factor in if you can afford to rebook, given  the refund from the original booking may take days or even weeks to come through. 
Be aware  that if you booked in a currency other than sterling, the value of your refund could be less  or more  due to currency fluctuations.


This is just one of the 'life hacks' we feature on the site. See our  80+ MoneySaving Life Hacks guide for lots more  including an app which lets you eat neighbours' food for free, how to turn your phone into a free sat-nav and a tool to check if hackers have stolen your info. 




Hotel rebook trick 2  some sites have price promises and will refund the difference
Some sites offer price promises, guaranteeing to refund the difference if the price of the hotel you've booked drops before your stay, or you find it cheaper elsewhere. So even if you didn't book with free cancellation, you may still be able to get money back.      
The comparable hotel must be on exactly the same terms as your original booking. So the same room, hotel and dates, plus the same booking type  for example, bed and breakfast, non-refundable. It also must be available to book, in the same currency you originally paid in or booked using, and the price must include all taxes and fees. 
Secret hotels, where you find out the name of the hotel after you've paid, are generally excluded. It's also worth noting that screenshots aren't accepted as proof  when you claim under the price guarantee, the site you're claiming from must be able to find the deal itself. 
Here are some of the big sites which do this:  

Expedia has a price guarantee which applies if you find the same booking cheaper no later than 48 hours before you're due to check in. Submit your claim by filling out  its claim form. 
Ebookers will also refund the difference up to 48 hours before check-in  fill in this claim form. (If you booked a flight and hotel together it’ll only  refund  the difference if you find the exact same deal within 48 hours of  booking.)
Hotels.com suggests cancelling and rebooking  if you can cancel for free (as do we  see above). But if your booking is non-refundable, it'll offer you the difference back  in vouchers you can use on a future Hotels.com booking. You'll need to submit a claim via this Hotels.com page. 
HotelsCombined also offers a price guarantee, though it's  more limited than the three above. You've  just 24 hours after booking to make a claim and you can't do it if the cheaper price you've found is via  a site that features on HotelsCombined (see the full T&Cs). 

Spotted a price promise that's not on our list? Let us know  in the forum.

 Use cashback sites for up to 13% back
Cashback websites pay you when you click through via them to spend. In essence, it's nothing more than an extra click before you get to where you want. 

With travel, it can shave £100s off the cost of your holiday  especially when it comes to hotels. Although rates vary, Topcashback* and Quidco*  the two biggest cashback sites  pay up to 13% when booking hotels through particular sites. For example, at the time of writing, booking through Hotels.com  via Topcashback gives you 13% cashback or get 12% cashback on Expedia via Quidco.  
Of course, we're not saying book via a certain site because the cashback is high  always do a comparison and ensure you couldn't get a cheaper price overall elsewhere. And remember too cashback's not guaranteed, so think of it as a bonus  see our Top Cashback Sites guide for more info.



 Sign up for free to short-term hotel sales  sites
Special members-only websites such as Conde Nast Traveller, Secret Escapes and Travelzoo* offer big but short-lived discounts on luxury hotels worldwide. It's free to sign up  you just need to log in to see what's available. 
For example, we found an executive king room  at the Mövenpick Ibn Battuta Gate Hotel,  Dubai for £93/night with Secret Escapes, compared with  £145/night when booked directly. The Chateau Monfort in Milan was £78/night through the site and £290/night booked directly.
Hotel companies and travel brokers also often offer short-term sales  and these can be worth looking at. But always do your own independent research to see if you're really  getting a good deal, or if you can beat it elsewhere. 



 Register for websites' email alerts to bag extra discounts  and make sure you log in
One way to secure an added discount is to sign up for different sites' email alerts. Priceline*, for example,  sends out 15% blanket discount codes via email, and many others do similar   if you can, sign up to a few. If you get tired of the emails after you've booked, you can always unsubscribe when you don't need to look for a hotel and re-subscribe when you do. 
 It can also help to have an account with the site you're using as some  offer exclusive deals or discounts just for registered users. Booking.com*, Expedia*, Hotels.com* and Venere.com* are among those to do this  make sure you log in when searching.



 Scout around for special opening rates
New hotels often offer special rates to drum up custom. Typically this can be at least 50%   off or even complimentary stays. To find new hotel openings,  scour   industry publications such as Hotel News Resource and Hotel Designs   these cover news worldwide.
It's also worth keeping an eye on forum threads and social media for alerts on opening rate discounts. You can even try the brazen approach and just call up the hotel to ask about  about special rates  a bit of sweet talk goes a long way. 



 Register with loyalty schemes for mates' rates
 Many hotel chains have free-to-join loyalty schemes  some of the big ones include Best Western Rewards, Hilton HHonors*, Intercontinental Hotels Group Rewards Club* and Marriott Rewards. These loyalty schemes are worth joining not so much for the free stays  which can take ages to clock up  but for the special offers they  send to members.

      Plus, if you call  the hotel and ask for a discount or  an   upgrade when you check in, you're always more likely to get one as a 'preferred   guest'. 



Going in a group? Villas, apartments and Airbnb can undercut hotels
 If you're travelling with  extended family or a gaggle of friends, cottages, villas and apartments  can massively undercut similar quality hotels  and the bigger the group, the bigger the potential saving.

     It's usually self-catering, and  you'll have to do your own cleaning and washing up. But if you   want   space, privacy, a  kitchen, washing machine and more, it can   be a   winner. And with the rise in popularity of sites such as Airbnb, it's now easier than ever to find rooms or properties for your party abroad.
For example, we found a three-bedroom villa in Malaga priced at £352  for a week's stay in mid-August, compared with a nearby hotel costing £1,420.
We've more on this in our Cheap Holiday Rentals guide, including how to score discounts booking directly with owners. And for inspiration:

We've stayed at wonderful places in Europe and the Caribbean using rental sites and have always been delighted. It's   way more cost-effective than hotels.  

    Barbecues on relaxing evenings with glasses of wine, jump in the pool anytime, do washing as you go. Loads of privacy and space to enjoy yourselves as a family... I love it.

 Consider worldwide hostels  dirt-cheap, not dirty
 Hostels can offer massive savings over hotels. While a few may be  dodgy, many are clean and friendly, with free internet access and   breakfast. Plus you're more likely to strike up a conversation in a hostel   than a Hilton. And you won't necessarily be bunking up in a dorm either  many offer   singles, twins and doubles.
The centrally located Riverside Lodge hostel in Berlin, for example, has excellent reviews and double rooms are priced at £55/night  staying at a nearby hotel would cost around £70/night. 
Another example, found by forumite Caro200, is the YMCA hostel in Hong Kong, which has doubles for £140/night and the same spectacular views as the Peninsula Hotel next door, where doubles cost around £340/night.
To check  prices and availability, use Hostelbookers.com* and Hostelworld*     both give hostels a percentage rating based on users'   experiences. Even if they say a hostel's full, always try emailing   direct, in case there's a spare room that doesn't show up.  To read more   reviews from past  guests and compare prices, try hostelz.com.
On top of cheap prices there are further discounts to be had. With a £20/year Youth Hostels Association* membership (£15/year by direct debit), you can get up to £3 off per night at Hostelling International hostels. Under-26s can bag membership for £10/year (£5/year by direct debit).



 Traditional package	hols are often cheaper than DIY trips

Package holidays often win  if you're heading for a traditional  tourist destination (eg, Rhodes, Malaga)  for seven, 10 or 14 days. 
When we looked, we found a week on the Costa Brava in August for a family of four, including flights, transfers and accommodation, at £197/person. Going DIY, the flights alone for the same dates were around £115/person  add  a hotel and it pushes the cost per person to around £250. Plus with a package, you get  ATOL protection (see below for what this means). 

      For package holiday prices skimpier than Rihanna's bikini,  always book  late.  But if you   need special   facilities, book early and consider carefully whether booking a package really will save you money. See Cheap Package Holidays for a full guide. 



Pay by credit card or book hotels and flights together to protect your booking
Package holidays are usually protected (always check) under either the ATOL or ABTA consumer protection scheme. This means if your tour operator goes bust, you're covered. 
If you don't opt for a package holiday though, there are still ways to make sure you're covered:


Get ATOL protection on DIY bookings. ATOL doesn't protect standalone hotel bookings. But even if you're not booking a package, if you book a flight and separate hotel or car hire together (or within 24 hours) from the same travel  website (not airline), you also get ATOL protection.

      Even better, if you book flights and a hotel together, Expedia*, Ebookers* and Lastminute.com* sometimes give extra discounts. Compare this with booking the cheapest flight and hotel separately to see if this  protection 'costs' you.

Pay by credit card. If a hotel stay's more than £100 and you pay by credit card, you'll get extra protection. That's because under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, for purchases over £100 the credit card provider is equally liable if something goes wrong. See our Section 75 guide for more info.

Booked directly with a firm that went bust?  Check your insurance policy. Some insurers will cover you in the event of cancellation, and possibly for other elements of your trip too, like flights,  if you can't find anywhere else to stay. Alternatively, if you booked using a credit or debit card, see above.



 
 Stay in a swanky spare room
Spare  room and apartment rental sites have mushroomed in recent years, and  can often offer cheap short-term stays  worldwide. The idea  is hosts put you up in their spare room or rent out their   whole apartment to earn cash on the side. You can  stay everywhere from   swanky LA lofts to houseboats in Paris, and it's a great  way to meet   locals.

      Crashing  in spare rooms often beats hotel prices, too. We found   a night in a double room in  a Barcelona flat for £49  a similar   quality hotel cost £90.
The sites below act as middlemen between hosts and guests to help. It's worth trying  a few, as sometimes prices differ for the same room between sites. When  comparing, always click through to the payment page, as they can add extra fees  at the final stage.

Best for breadth: Airbnb. It's the biggest name in spare room renting, over 3,000,000 listings worldwide. It charges guests a 6-12% fee to stay.
Smaller selection but can be cheaper: Wimdu*. Another major player, it features over 350,000 listings worldwide. It's free for hosts to list, so some price at slightly lower rates to reflect this. Guests pay a 15% flat fee to stay, shown on the payment page.
 For belt 'n' braces: 9flats.com*. It covers slightly fewer properties, but it's also worth a look. The site features over 200,000 listings worldwide. It doesn't charge any extra fees for guests, but charges hosts 15% of the transaction.


Before booking... find out as much as you can about the host, neighbourhood and property. Scour reviews from visitors and check photos closely. When you pay, go through the site's own payment system for added protection rather than handing over cash  that way, your money will be held for 24 hours after you've checked in.




Couchsurf and stay with strangers for FREE

If you don't mind  kipping on people's couches, the Couchsurfing site allows you to sign up to stay on  sofas around the world.     You won't need to pay anything (though there is an optional £13 fee to  verify your ID). 
Rooming with strangers can be a lottery. This   isn't for types who  like to run fingers   along doorframes for dust.  Sometimes check-in times are restricted or   email replies slow.
Before  booking, always do your research and find out as much info as possible about the host,   neighbourhood and  property. Check reviews from visitors and inspect   photos closely.

Pay with the right plastic to get the best rates
This isn't a specific hotels tip, but it's one that needs to be high on your agenda if you're paying for a hotel in foreign currency. There's one way to spend abroad that smashes all others  using a specialist travel credit card.

  Our long-term winner is the Halifax Clarity* Mastercard credit card. Use it to spend and you get the same perfect exchange rate the banks get and it's has low ATM withdrawal fees. Plus apply before 3 September and get £20 cashback on your first purchase abroad before 30 September 2017. The cashback will be credited to your card account within 90 days.
The Barclaycard Platinum Visa* is our top pick for cash withdrawals as it has no fees, and charges no interest on overseas withdrawals if you pay IN FULL every month. There's no cashback though.
Before applying, we've a canny eligibility calculator, which leaves NO credit file mark and lets you see how likely you are to get 'em. Always pay both cards off IN FULL each month, or you'll pay 18.9% rep APR on each.
An added bonus is that if booking on a credit card you get Section 75 protection for anything over £100. For other options, see our Travel Credit Cards guide, or if you want to take cash, use our TravelMoneyMax tool to ensure you get the best rates.



Bag £100s off hotels with Tesco points
Regular Tesco shoppers who have saved up Tesco Clubcard points can trade them in for Rewards Vouchers, which can  be spent around the world at  hotel chains such as  Mercure and Best Western. 
 The big advantage is that Clubcard points are worth 1p in store,   but they're worth three or four times as much when converted into 'Rewards'. 

      The snag though is that hotels usually only let you use vouchers against their   rack  rates (ie, normal prices), which are often much higher than their cheapest internet   ones. So before exchanging your Clubcard vouchers, carefully compare prices   on Trivago* first, as you may get better value for your vouchers elsewhere.

This guide helps you cut the cost of any hotel worldwide, but it's always worth looking out for special one-off promotions which can save you a packet. 
Keep your eyes peeled for discounts and deals on our Hotel Sales  page  and, of course, make sure you're signed up to our weekly email. 



Staycationing? UK bargains include cheap rooms in the capital and £15 breaks
If you're planning on staying back in Blighty,  there are a host of special ways you can cut accommodation costs, from cheap university rooms in London and hostels with Game of Thrones views to £15 breaks using newspaper vouchers. 
For full tips and details, see our UK Hotels guide.



 Try a house-swap  holiday 
A number of home-swapping sites such as Home Base Holidays and Homelink    allow you to switch your home with someone's elsewhere in the world.   
To join you'll need to pay a fee    Home Base Holidays is £49 for a year's membership and Homelink's a pricier £99, though it claims to offer a more personal service, with representatives around the world.  Then you upload photos and a description of your place.
Feedback varies  some have found it a way to make lifelong friends, while others wouldn't try it again  so you'll need to decide if it's for you.  See the Great Travel Swapping Hunt for tons more tips on this.



 Camp under the stars
Good ol' camping's a fun way to explore the great outdoors and get away on the cheap, especially if you're staying within Europe. Pack up a car with your own equipment and book a pitch at one of the many campsites across the continent.

As a starting point, check out the European Federation of Campingsite Organisations and Holiday Park Associations'  website or Campingo, which lists campsites in more than 85  countries. 
This can save on accommodation costs, even if you're travelling further afield   for example, when we looked we found  a week's stay for a family of four at the Bloomfield Beach Camp in Tropical North Queensland for around £200. You'd pay around £900 in a nearby hotel.
For a full list of MoneySavers' top tips on safe, hassle-free camping, see the Great Camping Hunt in the forum.



Check if the price includes breakfast  and if it's really worth it

When you're booking a room it's always worth checking if the price includes breakfast  sometimes it will,  sometimes it won't. Always check.
There's no hard and fast rule on this. Sometimes booking-sites or hotels will throw in a 'free' breakfast as an added incentive to book and it's worth it, but sometimes you'll find you end up paying much more for the night as a result. So factor in the cost.
Most places are likely to have nearby cafes, bakeries and eateries that will allow you to pick up inexpensive breakfast items if you don't pay. However, if breakfast is  included for only a little more, it might be worth shelling out the   extra amount.
Breakfast also makes an excellent haggling point  if you're trying to persuade a hotel to beat a comparison site's price, ask them if it'll throw in breakfast for free.



Work for your food and board
It's sometimes possible to bag free food and accommodation in exchange for a few   hours' work each day, usually on farms. Two of the biggest programmes are HelpX and WWOOF (Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms). Prices differ depending on which country you're in for HelpX, but WWOOF is free for basic members.
On the site workaway.info, jobs are listed in return for accommodation and sometimes food. It operates in around 140 countries and you'll need to pay around £25 for a one-year membership. We found vacancies listed near Rio working on a country estate; jobs  include gardening, cooking and working in the plantation.
However, none of the sites we've mentioned will organise, or help to organise, a working visa for you. For most countries outside the European Union, you're likely to need one to work. If you're not sure either way, contact the UK embassy in the country you plan to work in  it should be able to help.

Functional. Clean, no frills, with minimal facilities.
 More facilities. A telephone, private bathroom and TV.
 More style and comfort. Often have pools in hot climates. 
 Upmarket. Nice dining facilities, pool and public spaces.

How this site works
We think it's important you understand the strengths and limitations of the site. We're a journalistic website and aim to provide the best MoneySaving guides, tips, tools and techniques, but can't guarantee to be perfect, so do note you use the information at your own risk and we can't accept liability if things go wrong.

This info does not constitute financial advice, always do your own research on top to ensure it's right for your specific circumstances and remember we focus on rates not service. 
Do note, while we always aim to give you accurate product info at the point of publication, unfortunately price and terms of products and deals can always be changed by the provider afterwards, so double check first.
We don't as a general policy investigate the solvency of companies mentioned (how likely they are to go bust), but there is a risk any company can struggle and it's rarely made public until it's too late (see the Section 75 guide for protection tips).
We often link to other websites, but we can't be responsible for their content.
Always remember anyone can post on the MSE forums, so it can be very different from our opinion.

MoneySavingExpert.com is part of the MoneySupermarket Group, but is entirely editorially independent. Its stance of putting consumers first is protected and enshrined in the legally-binding MSE Editorial Code.

Vail Resorts, Inc.

 Share this article




























































BROOMFIELD, Colo., July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Vail Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:    MTN) today announced that the Company will aggressively pursue a comprehensive sustainability commitment, called "Epic Promise for a Zero Footprint". This ambitious undertaking, announced to employees at a companywide event today, commits to zero net emissions by 2030, zero waste to landfill by 2030 and zero net operating impact to forests and habitat.








"Everything we do at Vail Resorts is driven by the spectacular natural surroundings where our employees, guests and communities live, work and play. The environment is our business, and we have a special obligation to protect it," said Rob Katz, chairman and chief executive officer of Vail Resorts. "As a growing global company so deeply connected to the outdoors, we are making a commitment to address our most pressing global environmental challenge and protect our local communities and natural resources. Through improved business practices, capital investment and continued innovation and environmental stewardship, we are setting a goal of achieving a zero net operating footprint by 2030. With our 'Epic Promise for a Zero Footprint', Vail Resorts is both doing the right thing for the environment and for our business."
"It's the leadership of companies like Vail Resorts that recognize that this is good business and good for the environment that will truly make a difference in the world," said Carl Pope, co-author of Climate of Hope and former head of the Sierra Club. "We will combat climate change through commitments such as this and others from cities, municipalities and companies across the country."
Inspired by Whistler Blackcomb's environmental commitment, the Company intends to go beyond setting a partial emissions reduction target by executing on a more expansive and ambitious plan. "Epic Promise for a Zero Footprint" comprises three pillars: emissions, waste, and forests and habitats, with a thoughtful approach to each that was developed in consultation with leading sustainability experts in the industry. 
Zero net emissions by 2030 Vail Resorts will achieve net zero emissions in its operations by 2030 through the following initiatives:

Reducing the Company's electricity and natural gas use by another 15 percent – in addition to the 19 percent already achieved – by improving operating practices and investing $25 million in innovative, energy-saving projects, such as low-energy snowmaking equipment, green building design and construction, and more efficient grooming practices and equipment. 

Since 2008, Vail Resorts has implemented an aggressive plan to reduce its electricity and natural gas use and has already achieved a 19 percent reduction, after adjusting for acquisitions and new business locations.   

Purchasing 100 percent renewable energy equivalent to Vail Resorts' total electrical energy use and working with utilities and local, regional and national governments to bring more renewable energy to the grids where the Company operates its resorts. 

The Company is already a member of Ceres Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy as well as RE100, a global collaborative initiative of influential companies committed to using 100 percent renewable electricity.

Investing in programs such as tree planting to offset the use of other types of energy (e.g., gasoline and diesel). 
Engaging with the Company's vendors and suppliers to identify and collaborate on opportunities for them to reduce their emissions and environmental impact. 
Providing resort guests with information and opportunities for them to reduce or offset their carbon footprint. 
Sharing the Company's progress in achieving its "Epic Promise for a Zero Footprint" goals in an annual sustainability report following the fiscal year ending July 2018, which will follow the Global Reporting Initiative's standard. 

Vail Resorts intends to achieve a 50 percent reduction in its net emissions by 2025, based on 2016 levels. 


Zero waste to landfill by 2030Vail Resorts plans to achieve its 2030 goal of "zero waste to landfill" by diverting 100 percent of the waste from its operations to more sustainable pathways. Currently at a 40 percent waste diversion rate across its entire operations, the Company has set its sights on an interim target of diverting 50 percent of its waste by 2020. Vail Resorts plans to achieve this goal by:

Improving its recycling and composting program. 
Engaging with vendors to reduce packaging and to source recyclable and compostable products. 
Working with local resort communities to increase options for reuse and diversion. 
Increasing awareness and engagement with employees and guests through signage, labeling and training. 

Zero net operating impact to forests and wildlife habitatTo protect the spectacular mountain landscapes in which Vail Resorts operates, the Company commits to the following initiatives:

Minimizing or eliminating the impact of any future resort development. 
Planting or restoring an acre of forest for every acre of forest displaced by the Company's operations, with the goal of achieving improved species and age diversity, resulting in healthier, more resilient forests. 
Continuing and expanding Vail Resorts' existing commitments to partner with and fund local organizations focused on the health of forests, habitat and wildlife. In 2016, for example, the Company contributed more than $1 million to 50 environmental stewardship projects through direct grants, the Company's $1 guest donation initiative, and the 1% for the Forest commitment, made in partnership with the National Forest Foundation and The Nature Conservancy.

Vail Resorts' "Epic Promise for a Zero Footprint" will enable resort guests – visiting Vail, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge and Keystone in Colorado; Park City in Utah; Heavenly, Northstar and Kirkwood in the Lake Tahoe area of California and Nevada; Whistler Blackcomb in British Columbia, Canada; Perisher in Australia; Stowe in Vermont; Wilmot Mountain in Wisconsin; Afton Alps in Minnesota and Mt. 
Brighton in Michigan – and its more than 30,000 employees the opportunity to enjoy the natural environment and resources without leaving an impact.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
