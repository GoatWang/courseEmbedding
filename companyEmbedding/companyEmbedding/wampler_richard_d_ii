Richard Wampler 2011 Award Winner - SARTA: Sacramento Regional Technology Alliance




























Richard Wampler 2011 Award Winner
Instituted by MedStart in 2010, the Claire Pomeroy Awards recognize and celebrate excellence in med tech innovation by honoring regional inventors whose products have had a global impact in transforming some aspect of medicine for the better. The awards committee received seven nominations in the 2010-11 award cycle, and we are pleased to announce that the winner of this year’s Claire Pomeroy Award is Richard Wampler, M.D. for his innovative efforts in developing the Hemopump, the basis for second generation non-pulsatile left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) like the HeartMate II, to supplement or restore blood flow in patients suffering severe congestive heart failure, and more recently, the HVAD,by HeartWare, in which the pump is more elegantly reduced to a single moving part suspended within the pump housing in the blood and powered entirely by external electro-magnetic fields.
Dr. Wampler’s invention of the Hemopump and its dramatic initial use at the Texas Heart Institute was reported in the New York Times and Time Magazine in 1988. First generation heart pumps had attempted to mimic the beating heart and its pulsing pump action, while the Hemopump demonstrated that a much smaller continuous action pump could drive a substantial amount of blood flow with much less invasiveness required for implantation. Patients on the Hemopump and its descendants can survive with barely any pulse at all. Wampler worked on early iterations of the Hemopump with engineers at the predecessor of Thoratec, Nimbus, Inc. in Rancho Cordova, which had spun out of Aerojet to pursue development of pulsatile LVAD. The idea for the Hemopump occurred to him based on submersible pumps used in water wells he had seen in the Egypt. The later idea to simplify it to run off of magnetic fields was inspired by seeing a spinning top magnetically suspended in a novelty shop. He built the first prototype of the magnetic version in his garage in Granite Bay, and received an NIH grant to advance this work.
Dr. Wampler was a surgical resident at University of Oregon Health Sciences Center, but then turned to emergency medicine. While practicing in the Sacramento region, he took classes in engineering at CSUS, to master the fluid dynamics and other skills needed to develop his pumps. While the recognition is gratifying, he reports that the greatest satisfaction has come when he has been introduced to patients in whom his devices have been successfully implanted, such as occurred at a recent community picnic. Dr. Wampler continues to work on further iterations of his heart pumps, to make them ever smaller and less invasive to implant, so that their benefits might be extended to even sicker patients who could not otherwise survive the procedure, and for treatment of earlier phase heart failure to aid in recovery of heart function.
.SARTA’s and MedStart’s job is to communicate and amplify positive stories like Richard’s throughout our community, so that a strong culture of innovation can take root, and so that the commercialization process can proceed more efficiently and with more of the economic benefit of it retained in our community. The Claire Pomeroy Awards Committee would like to congratulate and recognize Richard, and the 2011 Finalists for their innovative efforts in medical technology enhancements.

Acquisition Information:
 Donated  by Barbara W. Melby and Lawrence D. Bowers in May of 2009.
Provenance:
 The  bulk of this collection came from the Wampler family’s Sunny Slope Farm Property.  In 2009, James Madison University History  Professor Daniel Kerr was in communication with Barbara Melby who occupied the Sunny  Slope property at that time.  Mrs. Melby  identified the storage of documents within the barn.  After an initial inspection of the material,  arrangements to transfer the material to Special Collections for cleaning,  rehousing, and processing were made. 
Biographical/Historical  Note:
The  Wampler family emerged upon the American poultry industry in the early  twentieth century changing the industry practices and beliefs.  As a result of their success, the Wamplers became one  of the most influential families in Rockingham County, Virginia and helped the  Shenandoah Valley garner the moniker, "Turkey Capital of the Nation.”  In 1811, John Wampler and family, members of  the Brethren Church, moved from Pennsylvania to the Timberville area of the  county during a period when large groups of Brethren were migrating south.  During the Civil War, John Wampler III gained  notoriety for supposedly thwarting Union General Philip Sheridan’s attempt to  burn his family’s barn.  After the war, in  1871, John Wampler III purchased a farm in Dayton that he named Sunny Slope and  built a house there.  Under the setting of  Sunny Slope, John Wampler III’s children and grandchildren made their many  significant contributions to agriculture. 
Charles W. Wampler, third son of John Wampler III  born in 1886, took quickly to the agricultural development of the County.  He became a County Agricultural Agent and was  an accomplished livestock farmer raising chickens and cattle.  Eventually, he settled into turkey farming  and started Rockingham County’s first turkey hatchery.  It was during this time that he became known  as the “Father of the Modern Turkey Industry” because of his success in various  agricultural experiments that changed the face of modern turkey farming.  One of his earliest experiments was using  chicken incubators to hatch turkey eggs.   Starting with only ninety eggs, Wampler Sr. was able to hatch fifty-two  poults.  Another Charles Wampler Sr.  innovation all but ended the wide spread practice of free-range turkey farming  in commercial operations.  Wampler Sr.  believed, and was able to show, that free-range turkeys were less cost  effective to raise as they expended more energy and required more feed at the  expense of the farmer.  Wampler practiced  “incubation and confinement” which soon became the standard among successful poultry  growers.  
Charles Wampler Sr. also served as the first  Rockingham County Extension Agent and founded the Wampler Feed and Seed Company  in 1927 with two of his brothers.  The  company mixed feed for distribution to livestock and turkeys.  Wampler Feed and Seed was the first in the  nation to contract with farms to grow poultry.   Wampler also helped found the National Turkey Federation.  Among his many philanthropic activities,  Charles Wampler Sr. served on the Board of Trustees for Bridgewater College, on  the Board of Visitors for Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and on the Board of  Directors for the Children’s Home Society of Virginia. 
Charles Wampler Jr. was born at Sunny Slope on  November 25th 1915 as one of 9 children (six daughters and three  sons.) He attended Bridgewater College for two years and Rutgers University for  one year. His early indoctrination in the poultry business began at the age of seven  when he and a sister, with the aid of their mother, prepared feed for turkeys  in the family business.  Crushed eggs and  oatmeal were the two main components of the feed.  In 1936, his career officially began as a “field  man” for Wampler Feed and Seed--traveling to various growers and inspecting  livestock.  Eventually,  Charles Jr. became the company’s general  manager when Charles Sr. retired.  In  1969, Wampler hatcheries, feed mills, and grower operations joined with  Virginia Valley Processing to become Wampler Food Incorporated.  Poultry processing, hatcheries, and growers were  combined as a single corporation with Charles Wampler Jr.  as president.   In 1984, Charles Jr. oversaw the merger between Wampler Foods and  Longacre Farms out of Franconia Pennsylvania.   By 1986, Wampler-Longacre acquired the Rockingham Poultry Cooperative and formed WLR Foods Incorporated  with Charles  Jr. as chairman of the board. 
In addition to his business career, Charles Wampler  Jr. had an equally distinguished career in service.  Charles Jr. was a District Representative for  Rockingham County in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1954 until 1965  serving on several committees including Agriculture, Finance, and Labor.  In 1957, he co-founded the United Way of  Harrisonburg and Rockingham County.  From  1971 to 1984, Charles Jr. served as president and chairman of the board for the  Rockingham Memorial Hospital.  He has  also served on James Madison University’s Board of Visitors and the Rockingham  County School Board.  In 1990, he  received James Madison University’s Common Wealth award in recognition of  outstanding contributions to the community.   In addition, Charles Wampler Jr. was a member of the Church of the  Brethren in Harrisonburg.
Scope and Content:
The Wampler Family Business Records, 1918-1972,  consists of 12.3  linear feet of material documenting Wampler Foods Incorporated.  The collection features personal and business  correspondence of Charles Wampler Jr. and Charles Wampler Sr. and includes  bound ledgers, financial documents, print material, reports, memoranda, and  pictures.  The collection is arranged chronologically  by topic in eleven series.  Series include:  Administrative Files, Correspondence, Date Books, Farm Ledgers, Financial  Papers, Philanthropy and Professional Organizations, Photographs, Press and  Advertising Files, Print and Ephemera, and Reports and Studies.
 
Series I, Administrative Files, 1937-1972, includes a diverse assortment of administrative documents  representing the business’ large-scale farming operations. Insurance  information and documents represent a large portion of the series regarding farm  capital and employees. Another large section of the series is “testing documentation”  for the various animals owned and bred by the Wamplers such as chickens,  turkey, cows, and sheep. Nearly all of these animals required regular government-regulated  testing, and the corresponding findings and results are within this series.
 
Series II, Correspondence, 1918-1971, consists of letters ranging in date from 1918 to 1972. Early correspondence  to and from Charles Wampler Sr. in regard to his turkey business and his  position as County Farm Agent may be found here. Through the 1940’s, the  letters concern both agricultural and World War II topics as the Wampler businesses  supported the American war effort through food production.  Intermixed throughout this range are letters  regarding both the financial and agricultural support Charles Wampler Jr. provided  to colleges and universities through his service on their Boards of Visitors.  Letters written during his terms as State representative can be found in the  1950’s and 1960’s with some addressed to Virginia Governors and the notable Virginia  politician, Harry F. Byrd.
 
Series III, Date Books, 1939-1965, consist of date books signed by Charles W. Wampler Jr. which  include personal appointments, business schedules, and notes on farm  production.
 
Series IV, Farm Ledgers, 1932-1951, contains information on the day-to-day operations of the Wampler  properties.  Some ledgers specify:  Ralston Farm, Dry River, Sunny Slope Farm, Glendale Farm, and Blossom Farm.  Other ledgers do not specify property names  but do contain information such as expenses, account information, flock  details, and livestock weights. Items are arranged chronologically.
Series V, Financial Papers, 1941-1971, houses all loose-paper financial documents relating to the Wampler  businesses. The majority of the series consists of receipts from shipping,  Wampler Feed & Seed, Sunny Slope Farm, travel expenses, and general  purchases while the second part of the series contains miscellaneous bank  statements, account information, tax documents for state and federal income, business  taxes, and some Wampler family business documents.
Series VI, Philanthropic and Professional Organizations,  1939-1971, consists of memoranda, meeting  minutes, summaries, and administrative information for various organizations  with which Charles Wampler Sr. and Jr. were involved. The series is arranged  alphabetically under Local and National subseries, of which agricultural  organizations figure prominently.  See  also Series X: Reports and Studies for philanthropic reports relating to the  Bridgewater College Board of Trustees, Virginia Tech Board of Visitors and  Children’s Home Society of Virginia.
 
Series VII, Photographs, 1947-1962, contains documentary livestock pictures from the Wampler Farms  and from farmers across the country with letters attached regarding breeding  opportunities and purchase requests. Several personal photographs of the  Wampler children are included here. 
 
Series VIII, Press and Advertising Files, 1920-1963, consist of marketing materials for the Wampler businesses that  includes poultry advertisements and newspaper clippings. Because Charles  Wampler Jr. was a respected community member and recognized authority in the  poultry industry, the collection also includes speeches, articles, and press  releases authored by or about Charles Wampler Jr. 
 
Series IX, Print and Ephemera, 1929-1971, includes agricultural publications such as “Turkey World.” This  series also includes biographical information on Charles Wampler Jr. from magazines,  newspapers, and farm sale books from auctions held on his properties. A number  of printed brochures from various manufacturers and charitable organizations  also reside this series.
 
Series  X, Reports and Studies, 1927-1969, holds  typed or printed reports in two subseries: Agriculture and Other.  Agricultural materials from the U.S. Farm  Bureau, National Turkey Federation, the U.S.D.A., and the Virginia and  Pennsylvania Departments of Agriculture which include livestock disease reports,  castor bean testing data, poultry stock reports, and inspection and market  information.  In addition, legislation  related to agricultural issues is also represented.  Other materials include: reports regarding  educational and charitable organizations in which Charles Wampler had a  philanthropic interest (such as Bridgewater College, Virginia Tech, and Children’s  Home Society of Virginia); 1954 legislative Actions; War savings and Fund  Campaigns; Senatorial Remarks; House of Representative Committee rules; and  Virginia State Legislation and sub-committee reports.
