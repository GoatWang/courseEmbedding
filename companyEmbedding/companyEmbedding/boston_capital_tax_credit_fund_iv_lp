(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements including our intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, strategies and predictions of our future activities, or other future events or conditions. These statements are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by these acts. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, including, for example, the factors identified in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, the inclusion of this information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved.  Liquidity  The Fund's primary source of funds was the proceeds of its Public Offering. Other sources of liquidity include (i) interest earned on capital contributions unpaid for the three months ended June 30, 2014 or on working capital reserves,  The Fund is currently accruing the fund management fee. Fund management fees accrued during the quarter ended June 30, 2014 were $1,238,949 and total fund management fees accrued as of June 30, 2014 were $49,750,945. During the three months ended June 30, 2014, $159,053 of the accrued fund management fees were paid. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, these liabilities will be deferred until the Fund receives proceeds from sales of the Operating Partnerships that will be used to satisfy these liabilities. The Fund's working capital and sources of liquidity coupled with affiliated party liability accruals allow sufficient levels of liquidity to meet the third party obligations of the Fund. The Fund is currently unaware of any trends that would create insufficient liquidity to meet future third party obligations of the Fund.  Liquidity (continued)  As of June 30, 2014, an affiliate of the general partner of the Fund advanced a total of $1,426,472 to the Fund to pay some operating expenses of the Fund, and to make advances and/or loans to Operating Partnerships.
