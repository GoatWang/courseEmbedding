2014 Outstanding Technical Leadership

                
                With the presentation of the Outstanding Technical Leadership Award, the Microsoft Technical Community Network recognizes Harry Shum for his transformative impact on Search Development at Bing in OSD.
                
                When Steve Ballmer handpicked Harry Shum to lead the then-struggling Bing search quality team in 2007, Shum considered himself a “surprising choice.” As we shall see, this faith in Shum was well founded: In relatively short order, Shum righted the ship and spearheaded a series of science and engineering enhancements that would turn Bing into a viable consumer alternative with a rapidly increasing search query share in the U.S.
                
                Nevertheless, when asked about his achievements, Shum downplays his role. In typical leadership fashion, he would much prefer the spotlight shine on his team. “I think the Bing search quality team has done a fabulous job putting search quality on a par with Google over the past few years—actually beating Google on a number of measures. This achievement really belongs to the entire team.”
                
                By his own admission, Shum had very little experience in running a large-scale engineering team at the time Ballmer reached out to him. Having earned a Ph.D. in robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, Shum joined Microsoft Research in 1996. After two years in Redmond, he moved to Beijing as a founding member of Microsoft Research China. Over the span of nine years he would climb the ranks, starting as a researcher and ultimately rising to the role of managing director for the by-then renamed Microsoft Research Asia (MSR Asia)—not to mention Distinguished Engineer of Microsoft Corporation. 
                
                During his 3½-year tenure as managing director, Shum became increasingly cognizant of the looming importance of search and online advertising. This ultimately led Shum to make an interesting proposal to Yusuf Mehdi, who was then leading MSN search and ads team. “I suggested to Yusuf that I would like to build a search team for him,” recalls Shum. “We would essentially work for the search team in Redmond, but I would run it out of Beijing by leveraging MSR Asia.” It was an unusual proposition, and Mehdi boldly decided to go for it. 
                
                Shum’s resulting Search Technology Team (STC) set the tone for joint collaboration between Search product team and MSR that Shum would continue in the future. “It probably had some influence on Steve’s decision to have me take on the search job,” says Shum.
                
                The Bing Search Development team in Redmond numbered roughly 300 when Shum assumed responsibility in 2007 as corporate vice president. Shum laughingly notes that his lack of traditional software engineering experience probably made him “more bold” than other colleagues, which was maybe both good and bad. “It took me a couple of years to really learn a lot of the basics,” he says. “And I got very lucky because I had great support from my manager Satya [Nadella] and had some very strong direct reports.” In particular, he calls out Technical Fellow Darren Shakib, instrumental in creating elements of the cloud infrastructure used by Bing and, later, the entire company. Also Gaurav Sareen, who ran the index serving team and is now one of Shum’s successors as corporate vice president in Search Development.
                
                Shum knew that getting things on track at Bing would mean reformulating their approach. “We realized that search is as much a science problem as an engineering problem,” he explains. “You have to reformulate the search quality problem as a science problem or research problem.”
                
                Identifying search ranking as the crux of the search quality challenge, the team collaborated with MSR in pursuing a solution based in machine learning—essentially applying the problem to a sort of machine-based neural network. This was different from the rule-based methodologies used by others in the industry at the time.
                
                The ultimate result was FastRank, initially proposed by Chris Burgess and his colleagues at MSR Redmond, a machine-learning algorithm using boosted decision trees that reduced training time exponentially (from a hundred hours to one) and could be tuned for rapid experimentation. Another advancement was AEther, an experimental platform that enabled engineers to combine existing models and build on each other’s work. More recently, the Bing team and MSR Asia together are bringing forth a new index serving system called Tiger, providing significant index serving performance improvement.
                
                The overall list of collaboration examples between Bing and MSR implemented under Shum’s leadership is too broad to describe in detail. It includes the Kirin store, mobile search improvements, smart motion thumbnail in Bing Video Search, active answers, relevance measurement (pSkip), web N-gram services for broad research community, and many more.
                
                The results have been impressive. Using internal metrics and blind tests, Shum’s team came up with a formula for measuring and scoring search results. According to Shum, their scores finally caught up with Google about three years ago. 
                
                Shum says he is now confident in describing Bing as a credible consumer alternative to Google. It seems consumers increasingly agree: according to ComScore, Bing’s search query share is now 18.2 percent in the U.S., more than doubled since its launch. Evidence can be found at Bing It On (bingiton.com), a site offering an impartial comparison of search results between Bing and Google, akin to the Pepsi Challenge blind taste tests.
                
                In addition to these performance metrics, Shum points to his team itself as further evidence of success. “I feel incredibly proud that we have built this very strong Bing engineering team,” says Shum. “Over six years we have grown one technical fellow, two corporate vice presidents, three distinguished engineers, and 20 partner engineers.”
                
                Although the TCN Technical Leadership Award is a fitting and well-deserved testimonial to Shum’s leadership, he recently earned an even bigger endorsement. At the conclusion of 2013, Steve Ballmer once again tapped Shum for a critical leadership role, this time as executive vice president of Microsoft’s Technology and Research Group. Shum now oversees Microsoft Research, as well as the company Trustworthy Computing Group and Technology Policy Group.
                
                “My new charter is to drive the company’s overall technical direction with SLT, especially for the mid-term and long-term,” says Shum. “We are already building products in a 12- to 18-month time frame. So we want to look beyond 18 months into the future. At MSR we have the charter to look ahead even five or ten years to where all the technology is headed.”
                
                Shum says he is comfortable leaving his position at Bing, knowing his team is positioned to continue its great work. And he leaves with a great deal of satisfaction in what was accomplished. “I am proud of what we achieved as a team,” he concludes. “I am proud that we have built a very high-quality search engine comparable to Google and with differentiating features. We have provided to society, even to humanity, a different voice than Google.”

Eyecare at Dr. Shum's office is perhaps the most thorough eye care you will ever receive! What makes us different?


Comprehensive pediatric & adult vision testing
A caring, well trained staff - Our staff is encouraged to attend educational seminars and required to read journal articles pertinent to their job responsibilities.
Dilation with no drops and no blurriness - We now use Optos, a retinal wellness scanner that replaces dilation in most cases. Because there is no blurriness, you are able to resume normal activities, such as driving, immediately after your dilation. Dr. Shum strongly recommends that you include this in your annual eye exam.
Unique and Innovative Eyewear - Our frame selection offers you a wide range of styles that will enhance you cosmetically while providing excellent comfort. Our eyeware, bought from the same sources as boutiques in Manhattan, are assured to be the latest styles and best quality. Our optician will assist you in finding the right pair for you.
Exclusive two year warranty on frames and lenses - This warranty covers broken frames and scratched, chipped or broken lenses. There is no additional charge for the warranty and no charge when a replacement is made.
If you purchase a second pair of spectacles or a pair after a contact lens fit, you get fifteen percent off the second pair.
We provide free consultations regarding refractive laser surgery, non-surgical myopia reduction (orthokeratology) and contacts for difficult to fit contact lens patients.
Custom contact lens fittings
Keratron Z-Wave custom contacts for unusual corneas
Keratoconus (corneal disease)
Scleral contact lenses
Post refractive surgery
Dry eye therapy to allow contact lens wear
Highly astigmatic corneas
Bifocal and trifocal contact lenses
Gelflex custom TORIC for astigmatism
Post corneal graphs
Share the Care- Eyecare Referral Program - We strive to remain at the forefront of eyecare technology. You trust your eyes to us, and we wish to express our gratitude. Send your friends and family to us for the finest eyecare available and receive substantial savings on your next pair of glasses or contact lenses.

Microsoft Build 2017: Redefining Business with AI and My New Role




★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★



 


May 10, 2017May 16, 2017 by Guggs // 0 Comments

Today at Build Microsoft Executive Vice President Harry Shum, who heads the AI & Research organization, talked about how AI is impacting society and how we are supporting developers to infuse AI into all their efforts. If you missed his keynote I encourage you to watch it on demand. He also talked about how AI will redefine broad sets of business processes across many, if not all, industries which in turn has helped me find my next mission within Microsoft.
The thing that I am most excited about with this year’s Build conversation is our ability to highlight how AI will impact developers and our ability to demonstrate both the platform to enable that work and how we’re using these capabilities to enhance our own products. I encourage you to try out the AI technologies in your apps and solutions, we think you’ll be surprised on what you can accomplish.
AI at Build 2017

For developers, AI introduces changes to how software will be designed moving forward. Where generations of developers have focused on programming everything that the computer did, future programs will get insights from the data and take predictive actions based on advanced algorithms, machine learning, deep neural networks (DNN) and a broad set of tools to continuously refine and optimize business processes and outcomes. During Harry’s Build keynote, he talked about some of the technologies within the Microsoft AI Platform that we are making available to assist developers. These include updates to the broadest collection of Cognitive Services with a new Video Indexer Service, the Cognitive Services Lab plus the ability to customize core cognitive services such as Speech and Vision. Building on last year’s conversational AI announcements, we have also made updates to the Microsoft Bot Framework to make developers more productive while developing bots, introduced adaptive cards for cross channel/platform bot development, the ability to publish to new channels and enabled the implementation of our payment request API.  Developers can also build a skill for Cortana via the Bot Framework Channel announced today. These skills will run across Cortana apps and new devices including the new Harman Kardon Invoke speaker and the Cortana Skills Kit is now available in the US, with other regions coming. To learn more about how developers are using Cortana Skills check out our video. In addition, some developers will want to use compute in the cloud to run their own models. In Azure, we have made this easier by supporting the ability to run models on several CPUs, GPUs and eventually FPGAs. Harry has more details on many of these announcements in his blog post.
Redefining business with your data

Compute and algorithms are critical to having a powerful AI engine but data is the fuel that makes that engine run. At Microsoft, we are very fortunate to have a variety of unique data sets. Bing and LinkedIn provide a wealth of world knowledge, while the Microsoft Graph provides a wealth of work knowledge including signals from Office 365, Dynamics and even devices. When these data sources are combined with your data there is the potential for incredible solutions.
With cloud compute, data, AI platforms, tools and algorithms; developers have a variety of options for using AI within their products and solutions. Yet for many businesses, even with these building blocks there will be significant hurdles to overcome. AI expertise is in short supply compared to the significant demand. Business leaders often don’t recognize what AI is capable of, how to apply it to their business and most don’t have the AI expertise to integrate AI into their business processes.
As Harry mentioned, AI has the potential to disrupt every business app and process in every industry. Across industries and departments like sales and marketing, we are working with developers and businesses to avoid being disrupted by redefining their businesses with AI using our platform technologies, data, AI expertise and our long history in developing for enterprise needs.
We have been applying AI to our own business processes and needs with great initial success. For example, contacting customer support can be a difficult experience for many. Customers want solutions to their problems now in a personalized and convenient way. Agents are challenged to handle these broad range of questions across different channels, to provide the best solution for the customer. Microsoft’s Customer Support Services team uses our customer care intelligence solution to address this challenge. Applying ML and analytics to our knowledge bases, including FAQ documents, web pages and historical chat data, we extract the knowledge required to effectively answer our customers’ questions. Conversational AI helps us answer in a personalized way. Using our bot and AI technologies, we provide expedient self-help support to our customers or connect them to an agent augmented with the conversation context and AI-driven content to better serve them. To continuously evolve the system, we used deep reinforcement learning, to learn from each customer/agent interaction.
Another area of focus is helping our finance teams make the most informed decisions they can. People have often turned to Bing to help pick March Madness, World Cup and Oscar winners. Beyond sports, entertainment and politics, there are key business scenarios where powerful insights can impact a business’ bottom line. Microsoft’s treasury uses our market intelligence solutions to help manage our cash and short-term assets. Institutional investors leverage our macro-economic predictions to better inform their trades and investments. We apply our ML algorithms for entity extraction, sentiment analysis, query understanding and more on aggregated and anonymized data from Bing and the web to do forecasting, financial predictions, product reviews and more.
When world data is combined with workplace data and your business data, incredible insights and associated actions can be enabled. Combining various signals from marketing automation, CRM, Bing, LinkedIn and interaction patterns can help sales people quickly triage leads and accelerate closing deals. Computer vision can create safer work environments by identifying safety hazards before there is a problem.
There is a lot happening in this Business AI space and we are just getting started. We will have more to share in the future.
DX Leadership Changes
With the advancements in AI and the opportunity to redefine businesses with AI, I’m happy to use this BUILD to transition into AI & Research. Over the last 4.5 years I have had the good fortune to lead the developer evangelism group (DX) where we have worked with developers and ISVs from around the world to help them leverage the incredible advancements in software and tools to deliver incredible new products, solutions and tools for their customers and partners. This journey has included interacting with students exploring computer science, fast growing startups, enterprise developers, technical and business communities, ISVs and so many other interesting and thoughtful individuals. Over just the short time of this journey, software development has changed significantly but the drive of developers to shape the world through software continues. As Microsoft accelerates its AI investments to amplify human ingenuity, I look forward to seeing what Charlotte Yarkoni, CVP, John Shewchuk, Technical Fellow, and Ron Huddleston, CVP, do for developers and ISV’s as they onboard the teams that previously comprised DX.
It’s been a privilege running Build for so many years, I look forward to attending next year, and hope you enjoy the Day 3 keynote video from John Shewchuk and I on Channel 9 this Friday but you can see the exciting trailer here now.
I’m looking forward to seeing what you build!
Cheers,
Guggs

2014 Outstanding Technical Leadership

                
                With the presentation of the Outstanding Technical Leadership Award, the Microsoft Technical Community Network recognizes Harry Shum for his transformative impact on Search Development at Bing in OSD.
                
                When Steve Ballmer handpicked Harry Shum to lead the then-struggling Bing search quality team in 2007, Shum considered himself a “surprising choice.” As we shall see, this faith in Shum was well founded: In relatively short order, Shum righted the ship and spearheaded a series of science and engineering enhancements that would turn Bing into a viable consumer alternative with a rapidly increasing search query share in the U.S.
                
                Nevertheless, when asked about his achievements, Shum downplays his role. In typical leadership fashion, he would much prefer the spotlight shine on his team. “I think the Bing search quality team has done a fabulous job putting search quality on a par with Google over the past few years—actually beating Google on a number of measures. This achievement really belongs to the entire team.”
                
                By his own admission, Shum had very little experience in running a large-scale engineering team at the time Ballmer reached out to him. Having earned a Ph.D. in robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, Shum joined Microsoft Research in 1996. After two years in Redmond, he moved to Beijing as a founding member of Microsoft Research China. Over the span of nine years he would climb the ranks, starting as a researcher and ultimately rising to the role of managing director for the by-then renamed Microsoft Research Asia (MSR Asia)—not to mention Distinguished Engineer of Microsoft Corporation. 
                
                During his 3½-year tenure as managing director, Shum became increasingly cognizant of the looming importance of search and online advertising. This ultimately led Shum to make an interesting proposal to Yusuf Mehdi, who was then leading MSN search and ads team. “I suggested to Yusuf that I would like to build a search team for him,” recalls Shum. “We would essentially work for the search team in Redmond, but I would run it out of Beijing by leveraging MSR Asia.” It was an unusual proposition, and Mehdi boldly decided to go for it. 
                
                Shum’s resulting Search Technology Team (STC) set the tone for joint collaboration between Search product team and MSR that Shum would continue in the future. “It probably had some influence on Steve’s decision to have me take on the search job,” says Shum.
                
                The Bing Search Development team in Redmond numbered roughly 300 when Shum assumed responsibility in 2007 as corporate vice president. Shum laughingly notes that his lack of traditional software engineering experience probably made him “more bold” than other colleagues, which was maybe both good and bad. “It took me a couple of years to really learn a lot of the basics,” he says. “And I got very lucky because I had great support from my manager Satya [Nadella] and had some very strong direct reports.” In particular, he calls out Technical Fellow Darren Shakib, instrumental in creating elements of the cloud infrastructure used by Bing and, later, the entire company. Also Gaurav Sareen, who ran the index serving team and is now one of Shum’s successors as corporate vice president in Search Development.
                
                Shum knew that getting things on track at Bing would mean reformulating their approach. “We realized that search is as much a science problem as an engineering problem,” he explains. “You have to reformulate the search quality problem as a science problem or research problem.”
                
                Identifying search ranking as the crux of the search quality challenge, the team collaborated with MSR in pursuing a solution based in machine learning—essentially applying the problem to a sort of machine-based neural network. This was different from the rule-based methodologies used by others in the industry at the time.
                
                The ultimate result was FastRank, initially proposed by Chris Burgess and his colleagues at MSR Redmond, a machine-learning algorithm using boosted decision trees that reduced training time exponentially (from a hundred hours to one) and could be tuned for rapid experimentation. Another advancement was AEther, an experimental platform that enabled engineers to combine existing models and build on each other’s work. More recently, the Bing team and MSR Asia together are bringing forth a new index serving system called Tiger, providing significant index serving performance improvement.
                
                The overall list of collaboration examples between Bing and MSR implemented under Shum’s leadership is too broad to describe in detail. It includes the Kirin store, mobile search improvements, smart motion thumbnail in Bing Video Search, active answers, relevance measurement (pSkip), web N-gram services for broad research community, and many more.
                
                The results have been impressive. Using internal metrics and blind tests, Shum’s team came up with a formula for measuring and scoring search results. According to Shum, their scores finally caught up with Google about three years ago. 
                
                Shum says he is now confident in describing Bing as a credible consumer alternative to Google. It seems consumers increasingly agree: according to ComScore, Bing’s search query share is now 18.2 percent in the U.S., more than doubled since its launch. Evidence can be found at Bing It On (bingiton.com), a site offering an impartial comparison of search results between Bing and Google, akin to the Pepsi Challenge blind taste tests.
                
                In addition to these performance metrics, Shum points to his team itself as further evidence of success. “I feel incredibly proud that we have built this very strong Bing engineering team,” says Shum. “Over six years we have grown one technical fellow, two corporate vice presidents, three distinguished engineers, and 20 partner engineers.”
                
                Although the TCN Technical Leadership Award is a fitting and well-deserved testimonial to Shum’s leadership, he recently earned an even bigger endorsement. At the conclusion of 2013, Steve Ballmer once again tapped Shum for a critical leadership role, this time as executive vice president of Microsoft’s Technology and Research Group. Shum now oversees Microsoft Research, as well as the company Trustworthy Computing Group and Technology Policy Group.
                
                “My new charter is to drive the company’s overall technical direction with SLT, especially for the mid-term and long-term,” says Shum. “We are already building products in a 12- to 18-month time frame. So we want to look beyond 18 months into the future. At MSR we have the charter to look ahead even five or ten years to where all the technology is headed.”
                
                Shum says he is comfortable leaving his position at Bing, knowing his team is positioned to continue its great work. And he leaves with a great deal of satisfaction in what was accomplished. “I am proud of what we achieved as a team,” he concludes. “I am proud that we have built a very high-quality search engine comparable to Google and with differentiating features. We have provided to society, even to humanity, a different voice than Google.”
