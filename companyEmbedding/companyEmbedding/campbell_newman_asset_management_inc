DISCIPLINE.
JUDGEMENT.
RESULTS.



							Campbell Newman specializes in Large Cap Dividend Growth and Small Cap Growth investing. Our time-tested investment process is based on discipline, judgement and results.						

								ABOUT US							






Large Cap Dividend Growth
Designed to provide upside participation and downside protection, this strategy focuses on companies with a history of annual dividend increases and higher than average current yields.
OUR STRATEGY

 
Small Cap Growth
Designed to consistently outperform the Russell 2000 Growth Index over rolling three-year periods at lower levels of risk, as defined by standard deviation of returns. The strategy is intended for investors who are seeking long-term capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of high-quality growth companies with market capitalizations typically between $200 million and $7 billion.
OUR STRATEGY

 
Bottom-up Stock Selection
Our team of portfolio managers/analysts select stocks on a bottom-up basis. The Large Cap Dividend Growth portfolio is benchmarked against the S&P 500 Index, actively managed and concentrated, with between 25 to 35 stocks. The Small Cap Growth portfolio is benchmarked against the Russell 2000 Growth Index, actively managed and concentrated, with between 45 to 55 stocks.

Serving clients since 1977






History


Campbell Newman Asset Management was founded in 1977 and has long been known as a high-quality growth stock manager. Our current management and investment staff has been in place since 2003. While the firm has successfully transferred management and ownership to its second generation, the Campbell Newman name was retained in honor of company founders, Leonard Campbell, Jr. and Raymond F. Newman.
Campbell Newman provides separate account equity portfolio management services to a variety of taxable and tax-exempt clients, including Taft-Hartley funds, public funds, pensions, foundations and private clients. We offer a focused product line of two equity products: Large Cap Dividend Growth and Small Cap Growth. Both products utilize the same bottom-up driven research process. The products are differentiated by the screening criteria used to define each strategy’s research universe, the indices to which their investment performance is benchmarked and the characteristics of the portfolios.

 Educational Background



BA 


Wheaton College - Massachusetts

                  Wheaton College is a four-year, private liberal arts college with a student body of approximately 1,600. Wheaton's residential campus is located in Norton, Massachusetts, between Boston, Massachusetts, and Providence, Rhode Island. Founded in 1834 as a female seminary, it is one of the oldest institutions of higher education for women in the United States. In 1912, the trustees officially changed the name of the institution to Wheaton College after receiving a college charter from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The school began admitting men in 1988, after more than 150 years as a female-only institution.

								ABOUT US							






Large Cap Dividend Growth
Designed to provide upside participation and downside protection, this strategy focuses on companies with a history of annual dividend increases and higher than average current yields.
OUR STRATEGY

 
Small Cap Growth
Designed to consistently outperform the Russell 2000 Growth Index over rolling three-year periods at lower levels of risk, as defined by standard deviation of returns. The strategy is intended for investors who are seeking long-term capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of high-quality growth companies with market capitalizations typically between $200 million and $7 billion.
OUR STRATEGY

 
Bottom-up Stock Selection
Our team of portfolio managers/analysts select stocks on a bottom-up basis. The Large Cap Dividend Growth portfolio is benchmarked against the S&P 500 Index, actively managed and concentrated, with between 25 to 35 stocks. The Small Cap Growth portfolio is benchmarked against the Russell 2000 Growth Index, actively managed and concentrated, with between 45 to 55 stocks.
