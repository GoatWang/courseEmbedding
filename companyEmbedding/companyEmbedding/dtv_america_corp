History[edit]
In the early 2010s, DTV America secured programming agreements with several networks around the country for quality programming. DTV America owned and/or operated stations are currently or soon to be affiliated with either Antenna TV, Soul of the South TV, Telemundo, estrellaTV, or Doctor TV. Doctor TV is the newest network that offers programming devoted to healthy living, featuring fitness shows, healthy cooking shows, and lifestyle programming. Several of DTV America's stations carry Doctor TV on a digital subchannel, but some on their main channel. MyNetworkTV is also being offered by several DTV America-owned stations as secondary affiliations with programming with another network surrounding MyNet's primetime programming.
To date, DTV America is the largest group of Doctor TV affiliates when that channel was initially launched in 2014, whether it be on the main channel or a digital subchannel on a given station DTV America owns and/or operates.[2]
In December 2014, DTV America gained rights to launch MundoFox (Which is now MundoMax) affiliates in select markets.
In 2015, DTV America and Raycom Sports reached an agreement for three of DTV America-owned or operated Antenna TV/MyNetworkTV dual affiliates to broadcast Atlantic Coast Conference football and men's basketball games under the ACC Network label. They were WCZU-LD/Bowling Green, Kentucky, WYJJ-LD in Jackson, Tennessee, and KPJO-LP in Joplin, Missouri.

History[edit]
In the early 2010s, DTV America secured programming agreements with several networks around the country for quality programming. DTV America owned and/or operated stations are currently or soon to be affiliated with either Antenna TV, Soul of the South TV, Telemundo, estrellaTV, or Doctor TV. Doctor TV is the newest network that offers programming devoted to healthy living, featuring fitness shows, healthy cooking shows, and lifestyle programming. Several of DTV America's stations carry Doctor TV on a digital subchannel, but some on their main channel. MyNetworkTV is also being offered by several DTV America-owned stations as secondary affiliations with programming with another network surrounding MyNet's primetime programming.
To date, DTV America is the largest group of Doctor TV affiliates when that channel was initially launched in 2014, whether it be on the main channel or a digital subchannel on a given station DTV America owns and/or operates.[2]
In December 2014, DTV America gained rights to launch MundoFox (Which is now MundoMax) affiliates in select markets.
In 2015, DTV America and Raycom Sports reached an agreement for three of DTV America-owned or operated Antenna TV/MyNetworkTV dual affiliates to broadcast Atlantic Coast Conference football and men's basketball games under the ACC Network label. They were WCZU-LD/Bowling Green, Kentucky, WYJJ-LD in Jackson, Tennessee, and KPJO-LP in Joplin, Missouri.

History[edit]
In the early 2010s, DTV America secured programming agreements with several networks around the country for quality programming. DTV America owned and/or operated stations are currently or soon to be affiliated with either Antenna TV, Soul of the South TV, Telemundo, estrellaTV, or Doctor TV. Doctor TV is the newest network that offers programming devoted to healthy living, featuring fitness shows, healthy cooking shows, and lifestyle programming. Several of DTV America's stations carry Doctor TV on a digital subchannel, but some on their main channel. MyNetworkTV is also being offered by several DTV America-owned stations as secondary affiliations with programming with another network surrounding MyNet's primetime programming.
To date, DTV America is the largest group of Doctor TV affiliates when that channel was initially launched in 2014, whether it be on the main channel or a digital subchannel on a given station DTV America owns and/or operates.[2]
In December 2014, DTV America gained rights to launch MundoFox (Which is now MundoMax) affiliates in select markets.
In 2015, DTV America and Raycom Sports reached an agreement for three of DTV America-owned or operated Antenna TV/MyNetworkTV dual affiliates to broadcast Atlantic Coast Conference football and men's basketball games under the ACC Network label. They were WCZU-LD/Bowling Green, Kentucky, WYJJ-LD in Jackson, Tennessee, and KPJO-LP in Joplin, Missouri.

History[edit]
In the early 2010s, DTV America secured programming agreements with several networks around the country for quality programming. DTV America owned and/or operated stations are currently or soon to be affiliated with either Antenna TV, Soul of the South TV, Telemundo, estrellaTV, or Doctor TV. Doctor TV is the newest network that offers programming devoted to healthy living, featuring fitness shows, healthy cooking shows, and lifestyle programming. Several of DTV America's stations carry Doctor TV on a digital subchannel, but some on their main channel. MyNetworkTV is also being offered by several DTV America-owned stations as secondary affiliations with programming with another network surrounding MyNet's primetime programming.
To date, DTV America is the largest group of Doctor TV affiliates when that channel was initially launched in 2014, whether it be on the main channel or a digital subchannel on a given station DTV America owns and/or operates.[2]
In December 2014, DTV America gained rights to launch MundoFox (Which is now MundoMax) affiliates in select markets.
In 2015, DTV America and Raycom Sports reached an agreement for three of DTV America-owned or operated Antenna TV/MyNetworkTV dual affiliates to broadcast Atlantic Coast Conference football and men's basketball games under the ACC Network label. They were WCZU-LD/Bowling Green, Kentucky, WYJJ-LD in Jackson, Tennessee, and KPJO-LP in Joplin, Missouri.

DTV America explained
DTV America CorporationType:PrivateLocation:Sunrise, FloridaKey People:John Kyle II  (President & CEO) [1] Area Served:United States (Nationwide, although not in all markets)Industry:Broadcast televisionProducts:Digital terrestrial TV stations (mostly low-power)Subsidiaries:Regal Media, LLCKing Forward, Inc.Woods Reality, LLCHomepage:www.dtvamerica.comDTV America is an owner of low-power television stations in the United States. These stations carry programming from the English-language networks Antenna TV, DrTV, MyNetworkTV, and Bounce TV, Grit, Escape, Laff, Buzzr, and the Sonlife Broadcasting Network. Some DTV America operated stations also carry programming from Spanish-language networks Azteca, estrellaTV, and Telemundo.



, the chief executive officer is John Kyle II.



History
In the early 2010s, DTV America secured programming agreements with several networks around the country for quality programming. DTV America owned and/or operated stations are currently or soon to be affiliated with either Antenna TV, Soul of the South TV, Telemundo, estrellaTV, or Doctor TV. Doctor TV is the newest network that offers programming devoted to healthy living, featuring fitness shows, healthy cooking shows, and lifestyle programming. Several of DTV America's stations carry Doctor TV on a digital subchannel, but some on their main channel. MyNetworkTV is also being offered by several DTV America-owned stations as secondary affiliations with programming with another network surrounding MyNet's primetime programming.
To date, DTV America is the largest group of Doctor TV affiliates when that channel was initially launched in 2014, whether it be on the main channel or a digital subchannel on a given station DTV America owns and/or operates.[2]
In December 2014, DTV America gained rights to launch MundoFox (Which is now MundoMax) affiliates in select markets.
In 2015, DTV America and Raycom Sports reached an agreement for three of DTV America-owned or operated Antenna TV/MyNetworkTV dual affiliates to broadcast Atlantic Coast Conference football and men's basketball games under the ACC Network label. They were WCZU-LD/Bowling Green, Kentucky, WYJJ-LD in Jackson, Tennessee, and KPJO-LP in Joplin, Missouri.
