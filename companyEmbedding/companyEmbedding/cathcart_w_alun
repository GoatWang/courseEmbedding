Jack Wilshere denies spitting at elderly neighbour in row over netting in garden





































































Jack Wilshere and the netting in his back garden.

Jack Wilshere has strongly denied claims that he spat at his elderly neighbour and threatened him, two months after the Arsenal footballer won a planning battle over 18ft-high nets in his back garden.
The allegations are the latest in a number of off-the-pitch controversies involving the 24-year-old, who is already being investigated over a fracas outside a London nightclub last month. 
Alun Cathcart, 71, had reportedly complained to the England midfielder about the netting that had been raised in his garden to stop balls flying over the fence. 
The businessman, who is the former chairman of Avis Europe,​ claimed he had just parked next to his house in Hertfordshire when Wilshere drove past, wound down the window and spat in his direction. 
“It wasn’t spittle but proper thing, front and the back of the nose and throat," Mr Cathcart told the Sun. “The car was playing very heavy music - as he was getting out of the car rap music was being played at full belt.”
​

Mr Cathcart, who called police to report a public order offence, said Wilshere turned up later and waited for him at the edge of the property.  
“He just said to me, ‘a word please’," Mr Cathcart said. “He said, ‘What about these lies, what is this all about?’
“Then he can’t help himself, his temper gets the better of him. His parting shot was, ‘You do not want to mess with me’.”
Mr Carthcart claims a man claiming to be Wilshere’s “personal security agent” then arrived. “He was quite intimidating, shouting,” he said.
The businessman, who said he plans to press charges, called police again, claiming he feared for his safety, the newspaper reported.

Wilshere’s agent told The Sun: “This is a private matter but Jack totally denies this incident happened.”
The footballer also took to Twitter to defend himself. He said the claims were "completely untrue, me spitting at an OAP? Come on...this is harmful to me and my family!"
​  Hertfordshire Police said no further action would be taken unless he went ahead and pressed charges, the newspaper reported.





Today's sun story is completely untrue, me spitting at an OAP? Come on....this is harmful to me and my family!!— Jack Wilshere (@JackWilshere) May 6, 2016







Hertfordshire Police said no further action would be taken unless he went ahead and pressed charges, the newspaper reported.
The alleged incident comes two months after the council allowed Wilshere to keep the nets in the garden of his £3.6m home after complaints from neighbours that they were a "monstrosity".
Arsenal reminded Wilshere, who has 28 England caps, of his responsibilities last month after allegations of the nightclub incident emerged.
Last May, Wilshere clearly appeared drunk during the celebrations for the FA Cup final victory and he has previously been twice photographed holding a cigarette and once with a shisha pipe.
