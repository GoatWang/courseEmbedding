	There is nothing like reading a great book! Catholic books have played a significant role in the history of the written word. In the past, monks and scribes diligently compiled hand-written religious manuscripts, and today Catholic books continue to uphold the mission of evangelization. Reading a good religious book can definitely be entertaining. But in addition to this, it can also help you know more about your faith, learn how to defend it, or help you grow spiritually. Whatever you are hoping to achieve, there is a book that's right for you! The Catholic Company is pleased to offer thousands of titles on a wide array of fascinating and informative subjects. Religious books make wonderful gift ideas for weddings, birthdays, Baptism, Confirmation, RCIA, or anytime. Some books are even suitable for personalization!

Rosaries, Chaplets, and Rosary Accessories 
CATEGORY

Audio & Video
Books
Chaplets
Rosary Beads
Rosary Cases




	Shop our wide selection of rosaries, chaplets, and rosary accessories including books, cases, holders, audio/video, and more. These make great gift ideas for Baptism, First Communion, Confirmation, birthdays, or any special occasion. Rosaries and chaplets are sacramentals of the Catholic Church: outward, sacred signs of our faith that are used as objects of devotion along our Christian walk. After the Mass, the rosary is the most highly regarded of the Church's prayers. It consists of meditations on the life of Christ, through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, while counting prayers on the rosary beads. Learn how to pray the rosary. Chaplets are like rosaries but each one expresses a different devotion, such as the St. Michael Chaplet or the Divine Mercy Chaplet, and has a different prayer structure than the traditional rosary.

Cross & Crucifix Necklaces & Pendants 
CATEGORY

Crosses
Crucifixes
Four-Way Crosses (Medals)



To wear a Catholic cross or crucifix necklace is an outward sign of faith and symbolizes our gratitude for the sacrifice Jesus made on the Cross. The Catholic Church places much emphasis on the Crucifix. Before a Catholic Mass even begins the Crucifix is carried to the altar during the opening procession, where it is then prominently placed for the celebration of mass and again precedes even the Priest out of the Sanctuary after the final blessing. A Catholic Cross or Crucifix necklace not only outwardly affirms the wearers faith, but projects its blessings inwardly, for the protection of the soul.
