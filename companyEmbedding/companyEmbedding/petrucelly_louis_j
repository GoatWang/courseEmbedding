After spending ten years at FalconStor

        This is a Press Release edited by StorageNewsletter.com on 2016.10.21





 



PASSUR Aerospace, Inc., a business intelligence, predictive analytics, and big data company, announced several senior additions to its management team to support the company's long-term strategic plan to drive customer value and company revenue growth.
Matthew A. DeLellis has been hired as chief growth officer, Louis J. Petrucelly has been hired as SVP and CFO, and David M. Henderson has been promoted to chief product officer.
"We continue to build upon and strengthen our management team to help us achieve the next level of growth and deliver even greater value to our customers," said Jim Barry, president and CEO. "Hiring Matt DeLellis as chief growth officer and moving David Henderson to chief product officer will be instrumental in allowing us to focus on the more complete solutions that are most critical to our customers. Lou Petrucelly joins us with years of public company experience, and deep involvement with technology companies - he is a great addition to our management team."
DeLellis joins PASSUR as chief growth officer, where he will initially be responsible for providing broader and more complete customer solutions through partnerships and alliances. These new relationships will also help to scale PASSUR's solution suite to reach more customers, both domestically and internationally. He previously was SVP of strategy and corporate development at Landmark Aviation, an aviation services company serving the general aviation, government, and business aviation industries. He has over twelve years of public company and portfolio company experience across multiple industries and has been a proven leader in the execution of several organic and inorganic growth strategies throughout his career. Previously, he served as the VP and treasurer at publicly traded Cardtronics, Inc. and began his professional career as an investment banker with Lehman Brothers. He received his BA in Mathematics from Dartmouth College and his MBA from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.
Louis J. Petrucelly rejoins PASSUR after spending almost ten years at FalconStor Software, Inc., a software-defined storage data services company, serving most recently as EVP, CFO and treasurer. Prior to FalconStor, he spent time in senior financial positions at both Granite Broadcasting Corporation and PASSUR, where he was CFO from 2002 to 2004. He began his career with Ernst & Young, LLP. He received his B.S. from the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University.
Henderson joined PASSUR last year as CFO and is moving into the newly created role of chief product officer, where he will work with sales, account management, product management, and marketing teams to drive the execution of PASSUR's strategic plan, improve product positioning and commercialization, and articulate PASSUR's solutions' value to the marketplace.
