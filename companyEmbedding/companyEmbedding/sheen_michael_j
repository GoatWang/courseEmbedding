The predecessor to "The West Wing" (seriously, see how many plot points are later repeated in that show), this film stars Michael Douglas as a father, widower, resident of Wisconsin, card-carrying member of the ACLU, member of the Democractic Party, and...oh yeah, President of the United States.  Facing an approaching re-election, a fierce Republican rival, a crime bill headed for Congress, a state dinner with the President of France, problems with the Middle East, and a possible love interest, played by Annette Bening, the man's day is certainly never boring...and neither is this film.  Michael Douglas comes off as a likable guy, so it's no wonder that he enters this film under high regard and respect.  Unfortunetly, his desire to keep his job (who doesn't have that these days) soon interfears with all that high regard and respect stuff and the White House staff find themselves on shakey grounds.  Annette Bening's character is definetly more focused as she fights to save the envierment and hopes to get the president's support for such a plan.  Though a deal is struck, both characters have a lot of work ahead of them and will have their character and marols tested along the way.  This is a film worth watching and owning if you can never seem to catch it on television.  While there are those who regard this film as a "libereal fantasy", I remind everyone that it's simply a movie and not a documentary.  If you want to learn about politics, read a book.  Otherwise, just enjoy this film.Read more0Comment|

I watch few movies and no television.When I search for a movie, I do so realizing that whatever I watch will use up nearly 2 hours that I could spend on something more productive. So, quality is important to me.This movie is rated PG13 for a handful of profanity, two light kissing scenes, and one brief scene with minor adult sexual content.I recommend this movie to mature audiences. It's good entertainment.Read more0Comment|

A friend was talking about Michael J Fox's role in this movie as the Presidents Adviser in light of the recent debates for the 2016 Presidential election and he could not believe I had not seen this movie, 'The American President'.  We sat down and rented it on Prime and I really enjoyed the movie.  Even if you have already seen it, everyone should watch it for a little reminder about the Politicians we vote into office.  Great film!Read more0Comment|

I grew up in DC among a political family so the dynamics of political bargaining/lobbyists/press jockeying is all too familiar.  The comedic homage to the White House and the Presidency is beautifully acted by Douglas and Benning and beautifully/romantically filmed.  I have watched it again and again.  Gotta love our nation's capitol and the games that go on there.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsthis is a great movie! Try it you will like it!Byboleoon February 7, 2013Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseI love this movie. It reminds me of "Dave" in that there is an "interloper" throwing a wrench in the story. Both are political movies that concentrate on the People rather than strictly about the issues and the actions taken. but much more than that is the way  the central characters  care about the people. The Pres. is a widower raising a teenage daughter and juggling the job/the daughter//the relationship/and his own time. This movie sets that conflict as a core part of the story. I love movies that are story- centered with well defined characters. Michael J  Fox  is wonderful. He is frantic most of the time; He is in motion, over-reacting,self-important, always sees the worst thing possible, and thinks he has everything under control but is fighting to keep his lapses hidden. All parts are well written, well cast and well acted! Thanks Amazon for including this delightful movie in its sale lists.Read more0Comment|

Carlos Irwin Estévez (born September 3, 1965), known professionally as Charlie Sheen, is an American actor. Sheen rose to fame after a series of successful films such as Platoon (1986), Wall Street (1987), Young Guns (1988), Eight Men Out (1988), Major League (1989), Hot Shots! (1991), and The Three Musketeers (1993).
In the 2000s, Sheen became best known for his television roles. He replaced Michael J. Fox in Spin City and his performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy and then starred in Two and a Half Men which earned him several Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominations. He most recently starred in the FX comedy series Anger Management, which concluded its 100-episode run in 2014. In 2010, Sheen was the highest paid actor on television and earned US$1.8 million per episode of Two and a Half Men.[2]
Sheen's personal life has made headlines, including reports of alcohol and drug abuse and marital problems, as well as allegations of domestic violence. His contract for Two and a Half Men was terminated by CBS and Warner Bros. in March 2011. Sheen subsequently went on tour.[3] On November 17, 2015, Sheen publicly revealed that he was HIV positive, having been diagnosed about four years earlier.

Early life
Carlos Estévez was born on September 3, 1965, in New York City,[4][5] the youngest son of actor Martin Sheen (born Ramón Antonio Gerardo Estévez) and artist Janet Templeton.[6] His paternal grandparents were emigrants from Galicia (Spain) and Ireland, respectively.[7] His father is a "devout Catholic" and his mother is a "strict Southern Baptist".[8] Sheen has two older brothers, Emilio and Ramon, and a younger sister, Renée, all actors. His parents moved to Malibu, California, after Martin's Broadway turn in The Subject Was Roses. Sheen's first movie appearance was at age nine in his father's 1974 film The Execution of Private Slovik. Sheen attended Santa Monica High School in Santa Monica, California, along with Robert Downey, Jr., where he was a star pitcher and shortstop for the baseball team.[6][9]
At Santa Monica High School, he showed an early interest in acting, making amateur Super 8 films with his brother Emilio and school friends Rob Lowe and Sean Penn under his birth name. A few weeks before graduation, Sheen was expelled from school for poor grades and attendance. Deciding to become an actor, he took the stage name Charlie Sheen. His father had adopted the surname Sheen in honor of the Catholic archbishop and theologian Fulton J. Sheen, while Charlie was an English form of his given name Carlos.[10][11]
Acting career
Film
Sheen's film career began in 1984 with a role in the Cold War teen drama Red Dawn with Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Grey. Sheen and Grey reunited in a small scene in Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). He also appeared in an episode of the anthology series Amazing Stories. Sheen had his first major role in the Vietnam War drama Platoon (1986). In 1987, he starred with his father in Wall Street. Both Wall Street and Platoon were directed by Oliver Stone. In 1988, Stone asked Sheen to star in his new film Born on the Fourth of July (1989), but later cast Tom Cruise instead. Sheen was never notified by Stone, and only found out when he heard the news from his brother Emilio. Sheen did not take a lead role in Stone's subsequent films,[12] although he did have a cameo role in Money Never Sleeps.
In 1987, Sheen was cast to portray Ron in the unreleased Grizzly II: The Predator, the sequel to the 1976 low budget horror movie Grizzly. In 1988, he starred in the baseball film Eight Men Out as outfielder Happy Felsch. Also in 1988, he appeared opposite his brother Emilio in Young Guns and again in 1990 in Men at Work. In 1989, Sheen, John Fusco, Christopher Cain, Lou Diamond Phillips, Emilio Estévez and Kiefer Sutherland were honored with a Bronze Wrangler for their work on the film Young Guns.[13]
In 1990, he starred alongside his father in Cadence as a rebellious inmate in a military stockade and with Clint Eastwood in the buddy cop film The Rookie.[6] The films were directed by Martin Sheen and Eastwood, respectively. In 1992, he featured in Beyond the Law with Linda Fiorentino and Michael Madsen. In 1994, Sheen was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[13] In 1997, Sheen wrote his first movie, Discovery Mars, a direct-to-video documentary revolving around the question, "Is There Life on Mars?". The next year, Sheen wrote, produced and starred in the action movie No Code of Conduct.[14]
Sheen appeared in several comedy roles, including the Major League films, Money Talks, and the spoof Hot Shots! films. In 1999, Sheen appeared in a pilot for A&E Network, called Sugar Hill, which was not picked up. In 1999, Sheen played himself in Being John Malkovich. He also appeared in the third, fourth and fifth entries in the popular horror-spoof series Scary Movie.
Sheen has also done voices for animation, appearing as Charlie in All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 (replacing Burt Reynolds), as well as Dex Dogtective in the Lionsgate animated comedy Foodfight.[14]
In 2012, Sheen was cast to star alongside Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray in Roman Coppola's surreal comedy film A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III.[15]
For the 2013 film Machete Kills, in which Sheen played the President of the United States, he was credited under his birth name Carlos Estévez. It was a one-time move, due to the film's Hispanic theme; it was Sheen's idea to use his birth name for the film. The trailer and opening credits for the film used an "and introducing..." tag when showing Sheen's birth name.[16]
Sheen's next feature film project will be the ensemble film 9/11 (2017), an adaptation of the 9/11 stage play Elevator written by Patrick Carson. The film will also feature Whoopi Goldberg, Gina Gershon, Luis Guzmán, Wood Harris, Jacqueline Bisset and Bruce Davison.[17]
Television




Sheen in March 2009


In 2000, Sheen debuted on the small screen when he replaced Michael J. Fox for the last two seasons of the sitcom Spin City (which also had fellow Ferris Bueller actor Alan Ruck as Stuart Bondek). For his work on Spin City, Sheen was nominated for two ALMA Awards and won his first Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy.[18][19] The series ended in 2002.
In 2003, Sheen was cast as Charlie Harper in the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, which followed the popular Monday night time slot of Everybody Loves Raymond. Sheen's role on Two and a Half Men was loosely based on Sheen's bad boy image.[20] The role garnered him an ALMA Award and he gained three Emmy Award nominations and two Golden Globe award nominations.[18] During his eighth and final season on the show, Sheen earned $1.8 million per episode.[2]
Warner Bros. dismissal
Production of Two and a Half Men went on hiatus in January 2011 while Sheen underwent a substance rehabilitation program in his home, his third attempt at rehab in 12 months.[21][22][23] The following month, however, CBS canceled the season's four remaining episodes after Sheen publicly made derogatory comments about the series' creator, Chuck Lorre,[24] and Warner Bros. banned Sheen from entering its production lot.[25] Sheen, already the highest-paid actor on television,[2] responded by publicly demanding a 50 percent raise,[26] claiming that in comparison to the amount that the series was making, he was "underpaid".[26]
CBS and Warner Bros. terminated Sheen's contract on March 7, 2011.[27] He was replaced by Ashton Kutcher.[28][29] In the aftermath of his dismissal, Sheen remained vocally critical of Chuck Lorre,[30] and filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Lorre and Warner Bros., which was settled the following September 26.[31] That same month, Sheen, while presenting an award at the Primetime Emmy Awards, addressed "everybody here from Two and a Half Men" and stated, "From the bottom of my heart, I wish you nothing but the best for this upcoming season. We spent eight wonderful years together and I know you will continue to make great television."[32] In 2012, Sheen returned to television in Anger Management, the spin-off of the movie of the same name.[33]
Meltdown
In the wake of the dismissal, Sheen had a highly publicized "meltdown" which was broadcast on television and the Internet. He made bizarre statements in television interviews, suggesting that he was a "warlock" with "tiger blood" and "Adonis DNA", and that he was "winning".[34] He also posted videos to YouTube showing himself smoking cigarettes through his nose, and cursing out his former employers.[35] He told one TV interviewer, "I'm tired of pretending I'm not special. I'm tired of pretending I'm not a total bitchin' rock star from Mars."[36]
Other
On September 19, 2011, Sheen was roasted on Comedy Central. It was watched by 6.4 million people, making it the highest rated roast on Comedy Central to date.[37]

In 2006, Sheen launched a clothing line for children, called Sheen Kidz.[38] In 2011, Sheen set a Guinness World Record for Twitter as the "Fastest Time to Reach 1 Million Followers" (adding an average of 129,000 new followers per day[39]) as well as the Guinness record for "Highest Paid TV Actor Per Episode – Current" at $1.25 million while he was a part of the cast of Two and a Half Men sitcom.[40] On March 3, 2011, Sheen signed with Ad.ly marketing agency specializing in Twitter and Facebook promotions.[41][42]
On March 10, 2011, Sheen announced a nationwide tour, "My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat is Not An Option", which began in Detroit on April 2.[43] The tour sold out in 18 minutes, a Ticketmaster record.[44] However, on April 1, 2011 the Detroit Free Press featured an article that stated as of March 30 that there were over 1000 tickets available from a third-party reseller, some at 15% less than the cheapest seats sold at the Fox Theater.[45] The Huffington Post reported that it was expected Sheen would earn $1 million in 2011 from Twitter endorsements and $7 million from the North American tour.[46] Many of those attending the performance of April 2 in Detroit found it disappointing;[47] the subsequent performance in Chicago, which featured some adjustments, received a more positive reception.[48]
Sheen was announced as the face of and partner in "NicoSheen", a line of disposable E-cigarettes and related products.[49]
On August 13, 2011, Sheen hosted at the 12th annual Gathering of the Juggalos, an event created by the Insane Clown Posse. He received a mixed reaction from the audience,[50] but has expressed appreciation for the culture by describing himself as a Juggalo[51] and wearing a baseball cap featuring the Psychopathic Records logo in public and during production meetings for Anger Management.[52]
Personal life
Family and relationships
Sheen has been married three times. He has five children and one grandchild.
His first daughter, Cassandra Jade Estevez, was born on December 12, 1984, to his former high school girlfriend, Paula Profit,[53][54] whose name has also been given as Paula Speert.[55] Through Cassandra, Sheen has one granddaughter, Luna (born July 2013).[56]
In January 1990, Sheen accidentally shot his fiancée, Kelly Preston, in the arm.[57] She broke off the engagement soon after.[58][59][60] In the 1990s, Sheen subsequently dated a number of adult film actresses, including Ginger Lynn[57][61][62] and Heather Hunter.[57]
On September 3, 1995, Sheen married his first wife, Donna Peele.[63] That same year, Sheen was named as one of the clients of an escort agency operated by Heidi Fleiss.[64] Sheen and Peele divorced in 1996.[6]
Sheen met actress Denise Richards on the set of Good Advice in 2000.[65] However, they did not begin dating until October 2001, when Richards guest-starred on Sheen's TV show Spin City.[65] They became engaged on December 26, 2001, and married on June 15, 2002, at the estate of Spin City creator Gary David Goldberg.[65] They have two daughters together, Sam J. Sheen (born March 9, 2004)[66] and Lola Rose Sheen (born June 1, 2005).[67] In March 2005, Richards filed for divorce, accusing Sheen of alcohol and drug abuse and threats of violence.[68] The divorce was finalized in November 2006 and preceded a custody dispute over their two daughters.[69][70][71]
On May 30, 2008, Sheen married third wife Brooke Mueller.[72][73][74] They have twin sons, Bob and Max (born March 15, 2009).[75] In November 2010, Sheen filed for divorce. On March 1, 2011, police removed Bob and Max from Sheen's home. Sheen told NBC's Today, "I stayed very calm and focused."[76] According to People, social services took the children after Mueller obtained a restraining order against Sheen. The document said, "I am very concerned that [Sheen] is currently insane."[77] Asked if he would fight for the children, Sheen texted People, "Born ready. Winning."[77] Sheen and Mueller's divorce became final on May 2, 2011.[1][78][79]
On March 1, 2011, Sheen was concurrently living with pornographic actress Bree Olson and model and graphic designer Natalie Kenly, whom he collectively nicknamed his "goddesses".[80][81][82][83][84] Olson left Sheen in April 2011, and Kenly left in June 2011.[85][86] In a January 2013 interview on Piers Morgan Tonight, Sheen stated that he was in a relationship with adult film actress and 2011 Penthouse magazine Pet of the Month Georgia Jones.[87]
Then in February 2014 Sheen became engaged to former adult film star Brett Rossi[88] who began going by her real name, Scottine Ross.[89][90] With a wedding planned for November 2014, the engagement was broken off in October with an announcement that the two had "mutually decided" to separate. Sheen stated, "I've decided that my children deserve my focus more than a relationship does right now. I still have a tremendous fondness for Scotty and I wish her all the best."[91] A month later it was reported that Rossi was hospitalized for an apparent drug overdose.[92]
Substance abuse, legal issues and health
On May 20, 1998, Sheen suffered a stroke after overdosing while using cocaine and was hospitalized. Sheen was found in his seaside home by a friend, after which paramedics had to give emergency life-saving treatment and rushed him to Las Robles hospital. He was described as being in a "serious condition" after his stomach was pumped.[93] Sheen subsequently checked into a rehab clinic days later but told doctors within hours that he did not intend to stay. Sheriffs later forced Sheen back into the clinic after he fled only hours after arriving.[94] On August 11, 1998, Sheen, already on probation in California for a previous drug offense, had his probation extended for an extra year and entered a rehab clinic.[95][96] In a 2004 interview, Sheen admitted that the overdose was caused by his injecting of cocaine.[97]
On December 25, 2009, Sheen was arrested for assaulting his wife, Brooke Mueller in Aspen, Colorado. He was released the same day from jail after posting an $8,500 bond.[98][99] Sheen was charged with felony menacing, as well as third-degree assault and criminal mischief.[100] On August 2, 2010, Sheen, represented by Yale Galanter,[101] pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault as part of a plea bargain that included dismissal of the other charges against him. Sheen was sentenced to 30 days in a drug rehab center, 30 days of probation, and 36 hours of anger management.[102]
On October 26, 2010, the police removed Sheen from his suite at the Plaza Hotel after he reportedly caused $7,000 in damage.[103] According to the NYPD, Sheen admitted to drinking and using cocaine the night of the incident.[103] He was released after entering a hospital for observation.[104]
On November 17, 2015, Sheen publicly revealed that he was HIV positive, having been diagnosed roughly four years earlier.[105] In an interview, he referred to the phrase HIV as "three hard letters to absorb".[106] He manages his condition with a triple cocktail of antiretroviral drugs, and said that it was impossible that he could have infected any of his partners.[107] Sheen noted that since 2011, he had paid extortionists approximately $10 million to keep his HIV status secret.[107] A source indicates that Sheen had over 200 sexual partners after he learned he had HIV. Sheen stated that he was upfront about his HIV positive condition with all of his past consorts.[107]
In an episode of The Dr. Oz Show taped in late 2015 and aired January 12, 2016, Sheen stated "I'm [sic] been off my meds for about a week now," receiving alternative treatment in Mexico from Sam Chachoua, who claims to have an effective vaccine for HIV; according to his manager, however, after the episode was taped he resumed taking his medications.[108]
In April 2016, Sheen reduced the monthly child support that he had to pay to his two ex-wives, Brooke and Denise, from $55,000 to $10,000 after they demanded more child support money than he was currently paying.[109] The same month, it was announced that Sheen was under investigation by the LAPD stalking unit for threatening to kill his former fiancée Scottine Ross.[110]
Activism
Charity work
Sheen was the 2004 spokesperson for the Lee National Denim Day breast cancer fundraiser that raised millions of dollars for research and education regarding the disease. Sheen stated that a friend of his died from breast cancer, and he wanted to try to help find a cure for the disease.[111]
A major donor and supporter of Aid For AIDS since 2006, Sheen was honored with an AFA Angel Award, one of only a few ever given, at the nonprofit's 25th Silver Anniversary Reception in 2009.[112] In addition to his financial support, he has volunteered to act as a celebrity judge for several years for their annual fundraiser, Best In Drag Show,[113] which raises around a quarter of a million dollars[112] each year in Los Angeles for AIDS assistance.[114][115] He has brought other celebrities to support the event, including his father, actor Martin Sheen.[116] Sheen's interest in AIDS was first reported in 1987 with his support of Ryan White, an Indiana teenager who became a national spokesperson for AIDS awareness after being infected with AIDS through a blood transfusion for his hemophilia.[117][118]
On March 27, 2008, Sheen and Jenna Elfman co-hosted the Scientology-affiliated New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project charity event.[119]
Sheen donated one dollar from each ticket sold from his “My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat is Not An Option Show” 2011 tour to the Red Cross Japanese earthquake Relief Fund.[44]
In 2011, Sheen took on a Twitter challenge by a grieving mother to help critically ill babies born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia by supporting CHERUBS – The Association of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Research, Awareness and Support.[120]
On July 16, 2012, Sheen announced that he would donate at least $1 million to the USO. This will be among the largest single donations ever given to the troop morale-boosting organization.[121]
Sheen, a lifelong fan of the Cincinnati Reds, announced in August 2012 that he would donate $50,000 to the team's community fund, which supports various charities. The donation came after the team raised another $50,000 in an attempt to get broadcaster Marty Brennaman to shave his head on the field after a Reds victory. After Brennaman shaved his head, Sheen offered to match the previous donation total.[122]
September 11 attacks
Sheen has become an outspoken advocate of the 9/11 Truth movement.[123] On September 8, 2009, he appealed to President Barack Obama to set up a new investigation into the attacks. Presenting his views as a transcript of a fictional encounter with Obama, he was characterized by the press as believing the 9/11 Commission was a whitewash and that the administration of former President George W. Bush may have been responsible for the attacks.[124][125]
Vaccination
Sheen is staunchly opposed to vaccinations. After separating from Denise Richards he sent a legal notice to his daughters' physician stating his lack of consent to vaccinate them.[126] The dispute over vaccines seems to have played an important role in the failure of the marriage. Richards said in an interview in 2008, "When I vaccinated Sam, he accused me of poisoning her. And I knew when he said that that the marriage wasn't going to work."[127]

He’s sorry! Charlie Sheen revealed during an interview with the Kyle & Jackie O show on Wednesday, January 25, that he regrets the way he treated his Two and a Half Men replacement, Ashton Kutcher.

“I was stupidly mean to him because I overlooked the reality and difficulty of taking over a show,” he told the radio hosts. “Which I did, I took over Spin City when Michael J. Fox was too sick to work, but no one ever put those two together … So I should have been nicer.”

The 51-year-old actor starred on the CBS sitcom for eight seasons, but the show went on hiatus in January 2011 when the Anger Management star entered rehab. Two months later, Sheen — who was the highest-paid actor on TV at the time — was infamously fired from the gig for insulting the show’s creator, Chuck Lorre, in several interviews. The following year, Sheen’s character, Charlie Harper, was killed off and replaced by Kutcher’s billionaire businessman character, Walden Schmidt.

Even years later, Sheen frequently trashed the That ‘70s Show alum, 38, on social media, calling him Jon Cryer’s “lame side-kik” in 2014 and saying he needed to “quit barfing on my old brilliant show.” Kutcher later responded during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and asked Sheen to “shut the f--k up” and stop slamming him on Twitter.








In his interview on Wednesday, Sheen recalled the moment that the two stars buried the hatchet. “I saw him at a Dodgers' game back in November and I forced him into a handshake. I said, ‘Give me that cup of coffee, young man, and shake my hand,’” Sheen told Kyle & Jackie O. “He was tasked with such an uphill struggle, and I was more into my own ego than I was aware of his own battle and for that I am regretful.”

Of making nice with Kutcher, he added: “It was awkward, but I made it fine because I felt bad for him. He thought he was going to catch a right cross, but I just wanted to give him a hug."Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Fox, David Paymer, Anna Devere Smith), a sneering opponent (Richard Dreyfuss), state dinners, formal protocol, informal moments, global crises - all come into focus as Reiner and his stars explore the balance between private romance and public Presidency.DetailsLength 1 hrs. 55 mins.Rating PG-13
