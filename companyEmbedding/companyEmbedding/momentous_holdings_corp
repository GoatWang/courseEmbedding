The health and fitness app development industry is highly competitive. We
compete with a variety of companies, many of which have greater financial and
other resources than us, or are subsidiaries or divisions of larger
organizations. In particular, the industry is characterized by a small number of
large, dominant organizations that perform related services.

The major competitive factors in our business are the timeliness and quality of
customer service, the quality of finished products, and price. Our ability to
compete effectively in providing customer service and quality finished products,
depends primarily on the level of training of our staff, the utilization of
computer software and equipment, and the ability to perform the services with
speed and accuracy. We believe we compete effectively in all of these areas.

Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical,
managerial, marketing and other resources than we do and they may compete more
effectively than we can. If our competitors offer services at lower prices than
we do, we may have to lower the prices we charge, which will adversely affect
our results of operations. Furthermore, many of our competitors are able to
obtain more experienced employees than we can.

The net proceeds to us from the sale of up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock
offered at a public offering price of $0.04 per share will vary depending upon
the total number of shares sold. The following table summarizes, in order of
priority the anticipated application of the proceeds we will receive from this
offering if the maximum number of shares is sold:

                                                       Amount Assuming                    
                                                           Maximum           Percent of

1 Commissions: Shares will be offered and sold by us without special
  compensation or other remuneration for such efforts. We do not plan to enter
  into agreements with finders or securities broker-dealers whereby the finders
  or broker-dealers would be involved in the sale of the Shares to the 
  investors. Shares will be sold directly by us, and no fee or commission will 
  be paid. However, we reserve the right to utilize the services of licensed
  broker/dealers and compensate these broker/dealers with a commission not to 
  exceed 10% of the proceeds raised.

2 Product Development, Facility and Equipment: We intend to use approximately
  $100,000 of the net proceeds of this offering to develop our existing apps,
  create new apps, lease space, purchase certain equipment such as laptops and
  domain names.

3 Advertising and marketing: We intend to use approximately $10,000 of the net
  proceeds of this offering to improve our search engine optimization. We also
  plan to explore other forms of digital marketing, in areas such as click 
  through advertising.

4 Labor: We intend to use approximately $55,000 of the net proceeds of this
  offering to compensate contractors/staff who assist with the process of app
  development on an as-needed basis.

5 Legal and accounting: A portion of the proceeds will be used to pay legal,
  accounting, and related compliance costs.

In the event that less than the maximum number of shares is sold we anticipate
application of the proceeds we will receive from this offering, in order of
priority, will be as follows:

                                 Amount                        Amount                        Amount

The health and fitness app development industry is highly competitive. We
compete with a variety of companies, many of which have greater financial and
other resources than us, or are subsidiaries or divisions of larger
organizations. In particular, the industry is characterized by a small number of
large, dominant organizations that perform related services.

The major competitive factors in our business are the timeliness and quality of
customer service, the quality of finished products, and price. Our ability to
compete effectively in providing customer service and quality finished products,
depends primarily on the level of training of our staff, the utilization of
computer software and equipment, and the ability to perform the services with
speed and accuracy. We believe we compete effectively in all of these areas.

Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical,
managerial, marketing and other resources than we do and they may compete more
effectively than we can. If our competitors offer services at lower prices than
we do, we may have to lower the prices we charge, which will adversely affect
our results of operations. Furthermore, many of our competitors are able to
obtain more experienced employees than we can.
