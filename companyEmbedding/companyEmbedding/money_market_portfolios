LendingHome’s high-yield real estate assets have returns that range from 8% to 10%. We fund all of our loans before they become available to you as investments, so you start earning interest from the very first day you invest.

Institutional Quality
You can access the same mortgage platform trusted by some of the largest credit funds in the world. Our credit guidelines have been fully vetted by our institutional investors, and we do an in-depth analysis of each mortgage.

Money Market: Conclusion













The money market refers to the market for short-term, high quality debt securities issued by government and corporate borrowers. Maturities can range from overnight to up to a year.
The money market creates liquidity for these borrowers to fund their short-term cash flow needs.
Common money market instruments include Treasury bills (T-bills), certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial paper, banker’s acceptances, eurodollars and repurchase agreements (repos) among others.
The money market is best known as a place for large institutions and governments to manage their short-term cash needs. However, individual investors have access to the market through a variety of different securities. In this tutorial, we'll cover various types of money market securities and how they can work in your portfolio.

LendingHome’s high-yield real estate assets have returns that range from 8% to 10%. We fund all of our loans before they become available to you as investments, so you start earning interest from the very first day you invest.
Backed by Real Assets
We source creditworthy real estate professionals looking for short-term mortgages of 12 months or less to be used for purchasing and rehabilitating homes. These mortgages are backed by the underlying value of the properties that they fund.
Institutional Quality
You can access the same mortgage platform trusted by some of the largest credit funds in the world. Our credit guidelines have been fully vetted by our institutional investors, and we do an in-depth analysis of each mortgage.
Build a Diversified Portfolio With the Click of a Button
Our online platform makes it easy to build a diverse real estate portfolio. The AutoInvest feature can do the work for you, spreading out your investment across a variety of fractional notes based on your preferences. Or, customize your portfolio by selecting individual loans on your own.
Easy Access
Individuals can access LendingHome’s opportunities with as little as $5,000 per investment and none of the fees of traditional real estate investing. Once you’ve built a portfolio, you’ll get on-demand updates on its performance.

Is my money safe?
What’s the minimum required to earn interest?
How is this different from a savings account?
How can I maximize my earnings?
Is it easy to access and move my money?





Yes. Your deposits will be FDIC insured up to the maximum ($250K) allowed by law. We offer products and
                        across the country, and we employ a wide range of security measures to ensure the safety of your digital information. EverBank has also received industry recognition for safety and financial strength from a number of respected sources.


EverBank & TIAAPlease note: EverBank® is a division of TIAA, FSB. TIAA, FSB also offers deposit accounts through its TIAA Direct® division. EverBank and TIAA Direct accounts are considered together when determining deposit insurance coverage under applicable FDIC regulations.

No minimum is required to earn interest. However, a $5,000 minimum deposit is required to open the account.1 Check out the compare & calculate section above to see just how much interest you could earn in your first year.
There are a few important differences between a savings and money market account. While both are easy to open, FDIC-insured, and fall under specific transaction rules9, their features may be different. For instance, money market funds are usually more accessible (via debit cards, ATM withdrawals, checks and electronic transfers) than funds in a traditional savings account.
Our 1-year intro APY is available on balances up to $250,000 for first-time money market clients.1 If depositing more than this amount, consider opening a companion Yield Pledge Checking Account. This account offers the same 1-year intro APY on balances up to $250,000 for first-time checking clients. Many of our new clients choose to maximize their first year earnings by opening both accounts.

Keep in mind this is a money market account so standard transaction limitations will apply. You may make up to six transfers or withdrawals per month without incurring a fee.9 But yes, it’s easy to access your money, including at ATMs across the country.
Speaking of ATMs, we’ve got your back when it comes to fees. First, we’ll never charge you a fee. And if you keep $5,000 or more in your account, we’ll even reimburse you for all ATM fees charged by other U.S. banks.5
As for making deposits, choose from a range of convenient solutions such as mobile check deposits6 via our mobile app, by online transfer or by simply mailing us a check. Use our mobile app to stay connected to your money anytime, anywhere.

The Yield Pledge® Money Market Account is a tiered, variable rate account, unless it was opened prior to 11/06/2016, in which case it is a variable rate account but not tiered. The quoted Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are accurate as of 7/21/2017 12:00:00 AM. A fixed, 1-year introductory APY is available for first-time Yield Pledge Money Market account holders on balances up to $250,000. The 1-year introductory APY for balances (i) up to $250,000 is 1.21%, and (ii) from $250,000.01 to $10,000,000 is best expressed as a range: 1.21% to 0.72%. Otherwise the variable ongoing APY applies (by balance tier, if applicable). Ongoing APYs and tiers may change without notice. If your average daily balance is within a tier, then your entire balance will have that corresponding APY, except as described above for the 1-year introductory APY. Current ongoing APYs and tiers are: 0.71% for $100,000 - $10,000,000; 0.71% for $50,000 - $99,999.99; 0.71% for $25,000 - $49,999.99; 0.71% for $10,000 - $24,999.99; and 0.71% for balances under $10,000. For accounts opened prior to 11/06/2016, the current ongoing APY for balances up to $10,000,000 is 0.71%. Higher balances are accepted. Accounts opened and initially funded with money transferred from another EverBank account are not eligible for the 1-year introductory APY. The required minimum opening deposit is $5,000. Fees may reduce earnings.
EverBank promises that the yield on your Yield Pledge® Checking and/or Money Market Account will stay in the Top 5% of Competitive Accounts based on Bankrate Monitor National Index survey data from the last week of each month.

This includes data from the 5 largest banks and 5 largest thrifts in each market, except in markets without 5 banks and 5 thrifts. Each week Bankrate.com surveys these institutions and distributes its results on a paid subscription basis. Not all institutions report each week. EverBank reserves the right to change its Yield Pledge calculation method as necessary to accommodate changes in Bankrate's survey methodology at any time.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
