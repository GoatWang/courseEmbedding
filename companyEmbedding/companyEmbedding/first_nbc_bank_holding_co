First NBC Bank Holding Receives Letter From Nasdaq Regarding Delisting
May 1 17
First NBC Bank Holding Company (First NBC) announced that it received a letter from the staff of Nasdaq today advising the company that it has determined that First NBC’s common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market. According to the Nasdaq Staff Determination Letter, the determination to delist First NBC’s securities was based on the commencement of the receivership of First NBC Bank, First NBC’s principal asset and wholly-owned operating subsidiary.  The letter also indicated that First NBC’s failure to file its periodic reports as required by Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) served as an additional basis for delisting.  Under the letter, First NBC may request an appeal of the delisting determination to the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel; however, the company does not intend to do so.  Therefore, trading of First NBC’s common stock will be suspended at the opening of business on May 10, 2017, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove First NBC’s securities from listing and registration with Nasdaq.

				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7. Subject to applicable transfer or advance fees. 8. Benefits apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo. 9. Surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators may apply. For the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program, Wells Fargo will waive its own ATM access fee (U.S. and international) when you withdraw cash from a non-Wells Fargo ATM from your primary checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program. Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10. No fee for Wells Fargo personal checks — except desk checks or home office style (3-on-a-page). Check discounts apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM) N/A     Market Cap $315,388     Shares Outstanding 19.23 M     Public Float 17.93 M     Yield FNBCQ has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.     Latest Dividend N/A     Ex-Dividend Date N/A       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

The net proceeds to us from the sale of our common stock in this offering will 
be approximately $91.5 million, or approximately $105.6 million if the 
underwriters elect to exercise in full their purchase option, based on the 
initial public offering price of $24.00 per share, and after deducting 
estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us generated by this offering to support 
our organic growth and for other general corporate purposes. We believe that 
these net proceeds can be deployed to support our organic growth without 
significantly diluting our earnings per share. Although we may, from time to 
time in the ordinary course of our business, evaluate potential acquisition 
opportunities that we believe are complementary to our business and provide 
attractive risk-adjusted returns, we do not have any immediate plans, 
arrangements or understandings relating to any material acquisition.


We compete with a wide range of financial institutions in our market, including
local, regional and national commercial banks, thrifts and credit unions, and
our primary competitors are the larger regional and national banks.
Consolidation activity involving out-of-state financial institutions has altered
the competitive landscape in our market within recent years. As of June 30,
2005, approximately 70% of the deposits in the New Orleans market were held in
banks that were based in this market. Based on deposit data as of June 30, 2012,
that number had decreased to less than 25%, due in large part to the acquisition
of several large, locally-based financial institutions by large out-of-state
banks, two of which held in the aggregate more than 50% of the in-market
deposits at the time of their respective acquisitions. Although competition
within our market area is strong, we believe that the customer disruption
associated with these acquisitions, as well as the loss of in-market
decision-making and relationship-based banking, will continue to provide us with
additional growth opportunities as the largest bank holding company
headquartered in the New Orleans market.

The following table depicts the top depository institution competitors within
our marketplace, by holding company, and presents the respective market share of
each competitor within the New Orleans market as of June 30, 2012. These figures
have been adjusted to reflect subsequent acquisitions.

We also compete with mortgage companies, investment banking firms, brokerage
houses, mutual fund managers, investment advisors, and other “non-bank”
companies for certain of our products and services. Some of our competitors are
not subject to the degree of supervision and regulatory restrictions that we
are.

Interest rates, both on loans and deposits, and prices on fee-based services are
significant competitive factors among financial institutions generally. Many of
our competitors are much larger financial institutions that have greater
financial resources than we do and that compete aggressively for market share.
These competitors attempt to gain market share through their financial product
mix, pricing strategies and banking center locations. Due to the benefits of
scale, our larger regional and national bank competitors can, in many cases,
offer pricing that is more attractive than that which we can offer, although
this pricing has historically been reserved for customers of a size for which we
generally would not compete.

Other important competitive factors in our market area include office locations
and hours, quality of customer service, community reputation, continuity of
personnel and services, capacity and willingness to extend credit, and ability
to offer sophisticated cash management and other commercial banking services.
Many of our competitors are organized along lines of business and use efficient
but impersonal approaches to providing products and services to customers.

While we seek to be competitive with respect to rates, we believe that we
compete most successfully on the basis of our service and relationship-based
culture. We adjust our pricing to maximize our share of each customer’s total 
financial service spending. Because we are unburdened by legacy main frame 
computer systems, we believe that our technology platform enables us to be more 
flexible in developing and implementing new services in a competitive 
marketplace.


Company Description
We are a bank holding company, headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana, which
offers a broad range of financial services through our wholly-owned banking
subsidiary, First NBC Bank, a Louisiana state non-member bank. Our primary
market is the New Orleans metropolitan area and the Mississippi Gulf


 Coast. We
serve our customers from our main office located in the Central Business
District of New Orleans, 31 full service branch offices located throughout our
market and a loan production office in Gulfport, Mississippi. We believe that
our market exhibits attractive demographic attributes and presents favorable
competitive dynamics, thereby offering long-term opportunities for growth. Our
strategic focus is on building a franchise with meaningful market share and
strong revenues complemented by operational efficiencies that we believe will
produce attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. As of December
31, 2012, on a consolidated basis, we had total assets of $2.7 billion, net
loans of $1.9 billion, total deposits of $2.3 billion, and shareholders’ equity
of $248.1 million.

We are the largest bank holding company by assets headquartered in New Orleans
as of December 31, 2012. We are led by a team of experienced bankers, all of
whom have substantial banking or related experience and relationships in the
greater New Orleans market. We believe that recent changes and disruption within
our primary market caused by significant acquisitions of local financial
institutions and the operating difficulties faced by many local competitors have
created an underserved base of small and middle-market businesses and high net
worth individuals that are interested in banking with a company headquartered
in, and with decision-making authority based in, the New Orleans market. We
believe our management’s long-standing presence in the area gives us insight
into the local market and the ability to tailor our products and services,
particularly the structure of our loans, to the needs of our targeted customers.
We seek to develop comprehensive, long-term banking relationships by
cross-selling loans and core deposits, offering a diverse array of products and
services and delivering high quality customer service. In addition to the
reputation and local connections of our management, we believe that our strong
capital position gives us an instant advantage over our competitors.
