Fitch Rates Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2014-2 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2014-2
    





April 23, 2014 01:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to the Santander Drive 
      Auto Receivables Trust 2014-2 notes:
    

      --$330,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$275,620,000 class A-2A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$125,000,000 class A-2B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$163,550,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$189,330,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$191,720,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$74,780,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$81,938,000 class E notes 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Weaker Credit Quality: 2014-2 is backed by marginally weaker collateral 
      versus 2014-1 and 2013 pools, with modestly weaker internal loss 
      forecast credit scores (LFS), and extended term loans (60+ months) 
      increased to 90%, up from 2014-1 to the highest level to date.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement and Structure: The cash flow distribution 
      is a sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for 
      the class A, B, and C notes is unchanged from 2014-1, but increased for 
      the D and E notes. Hard target CE is slightly lower for the class A-C 
      notes but increased from the D and E notes, all versus 2014-1.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: SCUSA's portfolio and 
      2010-2012 securitization performance improved since the recession, with 
      relatively low losses. However, recent 2013 losses have risen and are 
      tracking slightly above the 2012 vintage, driven by marginally weaker 
      collateral underwriting combined with lower recoveries as used vehicle 
      values softened over the past year.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: SCUSA recorded solid financial results recently 
      and has been profitable since 2007. Fitch rates Santander, majority 
      owner of SCUSA, 'BBB+/F2' with a Stable Rating Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: SCUSA demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer as evidenced 
      by historical portfolio delinquency, loss experience, and securitization 
      performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of SCUSA would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of SCUSA would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to SDART 2014-1 to 
      increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and credit losses, showing a potential downgrade of 
      one or two categories under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) 
      scenario, especially for the subordinate bonds. The notes could 
      experience downgrades of up to three or more rating categories, under 
      Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes

                            [Dow Jones & Company, Inc. · 2007-04-04] - The following is a press release  from Moody's Investors Service: Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes $1.2 Billion of Asset-Backed Securities Rated.
                        

                            New York,  April 04, 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned ratings to the  notes issued by Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1.
                        

                            This  is the first subprime auto loan securitization for 2007 and the first  public transaction for Drive Financial Services Inc. (successor to Drive Financial Services LP).
                        

                            The complete rating action is as follows:
                        


                                Issuer: Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1
                            

                                $204,000,000 5.324% Class A-1 Asset backed Notes, rated Prime-1
                            

                                $340,000,000 5.20% Class A-2 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $185,000,000 5.05% Class A-3 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $471,000,000 LIBOR + 0.05% Class A-4 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            


                            Moody's said the rating of Prime-1 for the Class A-1 notes is based primarily on the expected cashflows on the underlying receivables during the collection periods prior to the Class A-1 final maturity date, and partially on the financial guaranty insurance policy provided by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), whose insurance financial  strength rating is Aaa. The ratings of Aaa for the remaining classes of notes are based primarily on the FGIC policy. Moody's believes the risk  assumed by FGIC in insuring the notes is investment- grade at closing.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
