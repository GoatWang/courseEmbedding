2011 Fiscal Year Financial Results 




 

March 2012, New York

InkSure's president & CEO Tal Gilat, attributes the growth in revenues to a fundamental change in the company's marketing and R&D approach. "In 2010 we repositioned ourselves as ‘The Make Sure Authority' and set out to increase our brand recognition and bring products to the market that address specific market needs. Today InkSure is the de facto leader in machine-readable taggants thanks to our R&D innovations which are exemplified by our recent large scale global implementations."

New Areas of Business
 
Two new large-scale tax stamp projects were initiated in 2011 with the release of ScanSure. ScanSure is used in both tax stamp programs for system-wide and item-level authentication and track & trace of taxable items. ScanSure has made tax collection and law enforcement more effective and efficient in both programs. One ScanSure project provides authentication and track & trace for tax stamps issued for electronics, the other project for cultural items.  To date over 30 people have been arrested and approximately 2 million pirated products have been seized as a result of ScanSure use by governments.
 


  


  





  


 
In addition, two new projects were initiated in 2011 with the release of CarSure. CarSure is currently being used for car document authentication in two countries, one in Africa and one in Eastern Europe.  Both projects use CarSure on car registration tags issued for the purpose of motor vehicle tax collection.
 
CarSure was implemented in both countries in order the make it easier for law enforcement officials to detect counterfeit car documents. CarSure enables counterfeit car documents to be identified in seconds by traffic police equipped with a CarSure reader. This allows the police to issue tickets without physically entering the vehicle or the owner being present, making the process of checking for counterfeit car documents much more efficient and cost effective for governments.
 
New Products
 
InkSure released three new products in 2011 which have been positively received by the anti-counterfeiting and brand protection market:

 




  


·


CarSure, a currency-level reader that authenticates documents and holograms through car windshields.  CarSure is the only taggant-based technology able to compete with the RFID-based solutions on the market for car document authentication. CarSure is available for a fraction of the price of its RFID-based alternatives.





 




  


·


FuelSure, a turnkey solution that keeps counterfeit and smuggled fuel out of the supply chain. FuelSure determines not only if fuel is counterfeit, but also if it has been diluted, a common problem in the fuel market





 




  


·


ScanSure, a combination track & trace and authentication reader with an accompanying track & trace platform. ScanSure introduced the next generation of barcode reading technology to guard against common supply chain vulnerabilities;  In one click ScanSure will determine if a product is counterfeit, diverted, illegitimate or part of a "third shift counterfeiting" operation (unauthorized production).




 
Industry Awards and Recognitions
 
InkSure's innovations and contributions to the anti-counterfeiting industry were acknowledged with three industry recognitions in 2011:
 




  


·


Tal Gilat, InkSure's president & CEO received the prestigious ID People Award for establishing new growth areas for the adoption of auto ID technology in supply chain management, logistics and critical asset control.



 




  


·


CarSure was commended by the International Hologram Manufacturers Association (IHMA) for Best Applied Security Product.



 




  


·


InkSure made Global Identification Magazine's Top 25 Suppliers of Anti-Counterfeiting and Product Security Technologies list.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (USD in thousands)  In this section, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation," references to "we," "us," or "our," refer to New York Global Innovations Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and dollar amounts are in thousands, except as otherwise stated. For the period prior to August 23, 2016, results discussed below are based on the results of Artemis Pharma Inc. (formerly, Artemis Therapeutics Inc.), a Delaware corporation ("Artemis").  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that may constitute "forward-looking statements." Generally, forward-looking statements include words or phrases such as "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "projects," "could," "may," "might," "should," "will," the negative of such terms, and words and phrases of similar import. For example, when we discuss certain developmental and investment milestones, we are using forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. These risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement represents our expectations or forecasts only as of the date it was made and should not be relied upon as representing its expectations or forecasts as of any subsequent date. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, even if our expectations or forecasts change.  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements, related notes and other information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report.  OVERVIEW  On August 23, 2016, we consummated our Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Artemis and Artemis Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary (the "Subsidiary"), pursuant to which Artemis merged with and into the Subsidiary, with Artemis being the surviving entity (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, we ceased to be a shell company.  Immediately following the consummation of the Merger Agreement, but immediately prior to the issuance and sale of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock and common stock to an investor, Artemis stockholders owned an equivalent of approximately 82% of our common stock, on a fully diluted basis. Following the issuance and sale of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock and common stock to an investor, ownership was reduced, after which Artemis stockholders owned approximately 73% of the Company's common stock, on a fully diluted basis. After giving effect to the Merger, Artemis became our wholly owned subsidiary. Following the Merger, we adopted the business plan of Artemis.  Artemis is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of novel, safe, and effective agents for the prevention and treatment of severe and potentially life-threatening infectious diseases. The company's lead product candidate, Artemisone, is a clinical-stage synthetic artemisinin derivative with antiviral and antiparasitic properties. Artemis expects to advance Artemisone initially as an antiviral agent to address unmet clinical needs in the growing population of immunocompromised patients infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and other related clinical indications.  On May 31, 2016, Artemis entered into a License Agreement with Hadasit Medical Research Services & Development Ltd. ("Hadasit") and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology R and D Corporation Limited ("RDC"), pursuant to which Artemis acquired a worldwide, royalty-bearing license to make any and all use of certain patents and know-how owned by Hadasit and RDC relating to Artemisone. Artemis will rely primarily on the License Agreement with respect to the development of Artemisone, its lead product candidate.  Artemis agreed to certain development milestones, including the completion of Chemistry and Manufacturing Controls development and manufacturing for Phase I by the fourth quarter of 2017, completion of Phase I by the fourth quarter of 2019, completion of Phase IIA by the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first regulatory submission by the fourth quarter of 2027. Additionally, Artemis agreed to certain investment milestones, including the requirement to obtain financing of not less than $700,000 within seven months of the effectiveness of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), $1 million within 12 months of the Effective Time and $2 million within 24 months of the Effective Time. In the event that Artemis fails to meet the development milestone and investment milestones as set forth in the License Agreement, Hadasit has the right to terminate the License Agreement.  In addition, pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Artemis agreed to first offer Dr. Dana Wolf's laboratory at Hadassah Medical Organization, over equivalent alternatives, the option to perform all pre-clinical, research and development activities within Dr. Wolf's expertise and her laboratory's capabilities, each such provision of services to be conducted under a separate agreement between Artemis and Hadasit, the terms of which to be mutually agreed between Artemis and Dr. Wolf (each a "Sponsored Research Agreement"). The first Sponsored Research Agreement is to be entered into within 45 days of the Effective Time, whereby Artemis shall order services to be performed by Dr. Wolf during two 12 month consecutive periods.  In addition, pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Artemis is required to enter into a Consulting Agreement by and between Artemis, Dr. Wolf and Hadasit, effective as of the Effective Time (the "Consulting Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Consulting Agreement, Dr. Wolf will serve as the Chief Science Officer and a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of Artemis and shall oversee research and development activities for Artemis. Hadasit shall permit to make Dr. Wolf available to perform services for Artemis for up to 15 hours per month, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. The term of the Consulting Agreement is 3 years, subject to automatic renewal terms of 12 months, unless earlier terminated by the parties. Artemis may terminate the Consulting Agreement within 21 days of Hadasit filing a petition for bankruptcy or liquidation, immediately in the event Hadasit or Dr. Wolf breaches a material term of the Consulting Agreement and such breach is not cured, if curable, within 21 days of delivery to Hadasit of written notice of such breach. Hadasit may terminate the Consulting Agreement within 21 days of Artemis filing a petition for bankruptcy or liquidation, immediately in the event the Company breaches a material term of the Consulting Agreement, License Agreement or Sponsored Research Agreement and such breach is not cured, if curable, within 21 days of delivery to the Company of written notice of such breach. Dr. Wolf may terminate the Consulting Agreement upon 60 days prior notice. As consideration for the execution and performance of the Consulting Agreement, Artemis agreed to a monthly service fee to Dr. Wolf in the amount of $2,000 per month, plus value added tax, a fee of $300 per hour for any hour in excess of 15 hours worked by Dr. Wolf, $1,500 per day for trips made abroad by Dr. Wolf, as well as stock options in the amount of an aggregate of 300 shares to Hadasit (entitled to 50 of such option shares) and Dr. Wolf (entitled to 250 of such option shares), representing 3% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Artemis on a fully diluted basis, each subject to vesting. In that regard, Dr. Wolf was awarded an option to purchase: (i) 625,000 shares of the Company's common stock, whereby 208,334 shares of common stock vests upon the date of grant and 208,333 shares of common stock vest upon the one and two year anniversaries of the grant date, with the option becomes fully vested on August 22, 2018, and (ii) 21.35 shares of Series B Preferred Stock which vest upon the date of grant and 21.35 shares of Series B Preferred Stock which vest upon the one and two year anniversaries of the grant date, with the option becoming fully vested on August 22, 2018. Such 64.05 shares of Series B Preferred Stock are exercisable into 4,678,801 shares of common stock.  To date, we have not generated revenue from the sale of our lead product candidate and do not anticipate generating any revenue for an extended period of time. Our financing activities are described below under "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  Artemis was formed in April 2016; accordingly, we have not provided comparative data to prior periods.  REVENUES. The Company has no revenue-producing operations.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs for administrative, finance and general management personnel, insurance, legal, accounting and administrative costs. General and administrative expenses were $18, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to professional expenses.  NET LOSS. We incurred a net loss of $18 in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with a net loss of $0 in the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase in net loss was primarily related to an increase in professional expenses.  PERIOD FROM APRIL 2016 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  REVENUES. The Company has no revenue-producing operations.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs for administrative, finance and general management personnel, insurance, legal, accounting and administrative costs. General and administrative expenses were $36 in the period ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to professional expenses.  NET LOSS. We incurred a net loss of $36 in the period ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to professional expenses.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS. On May 31, 2016, Artemis entered into a License Agreement with Hadasit and RDC, pursuant to which Artemis acquired a worldwide, royalty-bearing license to make any and all use of certain patents and know-how owned by Hadasit and RDC relating to Artemisone. Artemis will rely primarily on the License Agreement with respect to the development of Artemisone, its lead product candidate.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $36 and a positive working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $979. Losses will probably continue in the foreseeable future.  We do not have any material capital commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2016.  We have sustained significant operating losses in recent periods, which has resulted in a significant reduction in our cash reserves. Artemis has not been profitable and we cannot predict when we will achieve profitability. Artemis has experienced net losses and has had no revenues since its inception in April 2016. We do not anticipate generating significant revenues until we successfully develop, commercialize and sell our proposed products, of which we can give no assurance. We are unable to determine when we will generate significant revenues, if any, from the sale of any of such products. As of September 30, 2016, we had accumulated liabilities of $68.  As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,001. We had negative cash flows from operating activities of $55 in the period from inception through September 30, 2016. The negative cash flows from operating activities in the period from inception through September 30, 2016 are attributable mainly to a net loss of $36 and accrued expenses and other payables of $19.  We had positive cash flows of $1,056 from financing activities in the period ended September 30, 2016. The positive cash flow from financing activities in the period months ended September 30, 2016 were attributable mainly to the issuance of common stock in the amount of $481 and $575 attributable to the acquisition of a subsidiary in connection with a reverse acquisition.  We have had no cash flows from or used for investing activities.  Nov 14, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
