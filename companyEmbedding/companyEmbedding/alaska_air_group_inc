Terms and conditions: Seats are limited and may not be available on all flights or all days. If nonstop service is offered during the advertised travel period, the advertised fare applies to the nonstop flights only. Bag fees apply for checked baggage. An additional VAT fee from $2.15 (CAD) per bag for bags checked in Canada may apply. For travel solely within the state of Alaska, customers may check up to three bags free of charge. Additional fees apply to check more than three bags or overweight or oversized items. These fares are nonrefundable and are only available on flights marketed by Alaska Airlines for travel on Alaska Airlines, Virgin America, Horizon Air, SkyWest, or PenAir. A ticket purchased at an Alaska Airlines airport location or through one of our reservation call centers will cost $15.00 more per person than the advertised fare. Applicable fare and tax differences apply to any changes made after ticketing. A $125(USD) change fee per person applies to changes made within 60 days of ticketed travel. The change fee is waived when travel is wholly within the state of Alaska on flights operated by Alaska Airlines. Fares include U.S. government taxes and fees. Canadian and Mexican government taxes and fees that are included in the fares shown are based on the current currency exchange rate and are subject to change. All fares are in U.S. dollars and are subject to change without notice, and other restrictions apply. Some markets may not operate daily service.

History[edit]




Headquarters for Alaska Air Group


It was formed in 1985 and acquired Horizon Air and Jet America Airlines the next year. Jet America Airlines was merged into Alaska Airlines in 1987.[citation needed]
Alaska Air Group subsidiaries had 14,710 employees in 2007,[5] 14,143 in 2008[6] and 12,440 in 2009.[7] On December 31, 2011, Alaska Air Group has 12,806 employees (9,640 at Alaska Airlines and 3,166 at Horizon Air), compared to 12,039 (9,013 at Alaska Airlines and 3,202 at Horizon Air) on December 31, 2010.[8][9] Alaska Airlines operates only U.S. built Boeing aircraft with up to 181 seats while Horizon operates only Canadian built Bombardier Aerospace aircraft with up to 76 seats.[10]
In 2011, Alaska Air Group replaced the AMR Corporation in the Dow Jones Transportation Average.[11]
On December 14, 2016, Alaska Air Group completed its acquisition of Virgin America.[12] The total price for the acquisition was approximately $2.6 billion. Until 2019, Alaska Air Group will continue to operate Alaska Airlines and Virgin America as separate airlines and will continue to honor the loyalty programs of both groups.[13] On March 22, 2017 the company announced that Alaska Air Group will merge Virgin America and Alaska Airlines. The airline will operate under the Alaska Airlines brand and is expected to be fully merged in 2019. [14]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Alaska Air Group shares are mainly held by institutional investors (T. Rowe Price, The Vanguard Group and others[15])
Operations[edit]
Fleet[edit]
As of April 2016, Alaska Airlines' fleet consisted of 153 jet aircraft while Horizon Air's fleet consisted of 52 turboprop aircraft.[8] With the Virgin acquisition and ongoing merger, the combined fleet under Alaska Air Group's management numbers 286 aircraft.[16]
Alaska Air Group has created a new branding identity for its Horizon Air subsidiary and any other independently owned and separately directed affiliate regional airlines it chooses to contract to do regional flying business into markets too limited to be flown only on Alaska Airlines mainline equipment. Among the other airlines now sub-contracted to do additional flying for the Alaska Air Group are; SkyWest, Inc.'s, SkyWest Airlines whose Canadair CRJ-700 aircraft dedicated to providing service for the Alaska Air Group are painted in a very similar manner to Alaska Horizon's. SkyWest's fleet however, are branded Alaska SkyWest to differentiate that airline's aircraft from those of Horizon Air.[citation needed]
Route network[edit]
Through its two principal airline subsidiaries, Alaska Air Group services the passenger and cargo markets of the Pacific Northwest with its extensive route network hub through the cities of Seattle and Portland. After the demise of Aloha Airlines and ATA Airlines in 2008, the Alaska Air Group has expanded heavily centering on Hawaii and other non-airline hub secondary mainland cities and airports.[17]
On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced plans to acquire Virgin America, pending approval from US government regulators and Virgin America shareholders.[18]

History[edit]




Headquarters for Alaska Air Group


It was formed in 1985 and acquired Horizon Air and Jet America Airlines the next year. Jet America Airlines was merged into Alaska Airlines in 1987.[citation needed]
Alaska Air Group subsidiaries had 14,710 employees in 2007,[5] 14,143 in 2008[6] and 12,440 in 2009.[7] On December 31, 2011, Alaska Air Group has 12,806 employees (9,640 at Alaska Airlines and 3,166 at Horizon Air), compared to 12,039 (9,013 at Alaska Airlines and 3,202 at Horizon Air) on December 31, 2010.[8][9] Alaska Airlines operates only U.S. built Boeing aircraft with up to 181 seats while Horizon operates only Canadian built Bombardier Aerospace aircraft with up to 76 seats.[10]
In 2011, Alaska Air Group replaced the AMR Corporation in the Dow Jones Transportation Average.[11]
On December 14, 2016, Alaska Air Group completed its acquisition of Virgin America.[12] The total price for the acquisition was approximately $2.6 billion. Until 2019, Alaska Air Group will continue to operate Alaska Airlines and Virgin America as separate airlines and will continue to honor the loyalty programs of both groups.[13] On March 22, 2017 the company announced that Alaska Air Group will merge Virgin America and Alaska Airlines. The airline will operate under the Alaska Airlines brand and is expected to be fully merged in 2019. [14]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Alaska Air Group shares are mainly held by institutional investors (T. Rowe Price, The Vanguard Group and others[15])
Operations[edit]
Fleet[edit]
As of April 2016, Alaska Airlines' fleet consisted of 153 jet aircraft while Horizon Air's fleet consisted of 52 turboprop aircraft.[8] With the Virgin acquisition and ongoing merger, the combined fleet under Alaska Air Group's management numbers 286 aircraft.[16]
Alaska Air Group has created a new branding identity for its Horizon Air subsidiary and any other independently owned and separately directed affiliate regional airlines it chooses to contract to do regional flying business into markets too limited to be flown only on Alaska Airlines mainline equipment. Among the other airlines now sub-contracted to do additional flying for the Alaska Air Group are; SkyWest, Inc.'s, SkyWest Airlines whose Canadair CRJ-700 aircraft dedicated to providing service for the Alaska Air Group are painted in a very similar manner to Alaska Horizon's. SkyWest's fleet however, are branded Alaska SkyWest to differentiate that airline's aircraft from those of Horizon Air.[citation needed]

Certificate Vignette
Alaska Air Group, Inc., is the holding company for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, Seattle-based carriers that collectively serve more than 70 destinations in the Western U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Alaska Air Group was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1985.Alaska Airlines, Inc., an Alaska corporation founded in 1932, is noted for its award-winning customer service. The airline, which accounts for about 80% of Air Group revenues, provides scheduled air service to 38 cities in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Arizona, and British Columbia, plus Chicago and five destinations in Mexico. Its major hubs are Anchorage, Seattle, Portland, and Los Angeles.Horizon Air Industries, Inc., a Washington corporation organized in 1981, is similarly noted for outstanding customer service. Horizon accounts for about 20% of Air Group revenues and provides air transportation to more than 40 destinations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, California, Arizona, Colorado, British Columbia, and Alberta. Its major hubs are Seattle, Portland, and Boise.
For nearly 70 years, Alaska Airlines and its people have been guided through thick and thin by a shared commitment to integrity, caring, resourcefulness, professionalism and spirit. Especially spirit - an Alaskan spirit, born in the land the airline is named after - a place where "can-do" and "neighbor-helping-neighbor" are facts of life.The result? A long list of aviation milestones, as well as countless stories of people going out of their way to help others - both in the course of business and in the support of organizations that makes our communities better places to live.In the process, Alaska has grown from a small regional airline to one of the most respected in the nation. Carrying more than 12 million customers per year, Alaska�s route system spans more than 40 cities and three countries. The Alaska Airlines fleet of 96 Boeing jets is the youngest among all major airlines. And its reputation for outstanding service consistently earns best U.S. airline recognition from the likes of Travel + Leisure and Cond� Nast Traveler magazines.Storied RootsThe foundation of this success was laid in 1932, when Mac McGee started flying his three-seat Stinson between Anchorage and Bristol Bay, Alaska. Finances were tight, but perseverance ruled the day -- Mac and his team often worked round-the-clock, even though the next paycheck might be weeks away.A merger with Star Air Service in 1934 created the largest airline in Alaska. After several more mergers, the name was changed a couple of times � until they found one that stuck: Alaska Airlines.By the late 1940s, using surplus military aircraft, Alaska had branched into worldwide charter work, including the Berlin Airlift in 1948 and Operation Magic Carpet, the airlift of thousands of Yemenite Jews, to Israel in 1949.In the late 1960s, Alaska strengthened its operating base by merging with Alaska Coastal-Ellis and Cordova airlines, legendary Southeast Alaska carriers owned by aviation pioneers Shell Simmons, Bob Ellis and Mudhole Smith. Alaska�s world now stretched from Fairbanks south to Ketchikan and down to Seattle. And in some of the coldest days of the Cold War, Alaska made headlines with regular charters to the Soviet Union.A New EraWhen Fairbanks businessmen Ron Cosgrave and Bruce Kennedy came on board in 1972, the airline was in a financial fight for its life. They went to work setting goals and bringing people together. They won back the trust of creditors and improved on-time performance. One break that went their way was the construction of the trans-Alaska Pipeline; carrying supplies, equipment and workers gave Alaska a shot in the arm.Bottom line, customer service became key in this new era. And it put the airline on course for what would be a nearly unprecedented record in the industry: 19 straight years of profitability.In 1979, the airline industry was deregulated. For many carriers, this was the end of the road. For Alaska, it was a new beginning. The airline expanded methodically throughout the West Coast and in 1987 joined forces with two carriers similarly committed to outstanding customer service - Horizon Air and Jet America.By the end of the 80s, Alaska had tripled in size. Its fleet had increased five-fold. And the route map included scheduled service to Mexico and Russia.History from company press information.

Alaska Air Group Becomes #116 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component, Replacing Travelers Companies
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 04/28/2017 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

Dividend Spotlight on Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK)


July 13, 2017 Sarah Corning     
	










Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) currently has a 10 year dividend growth rate of -96.07%. This number is calculated using the geometric average which provides the typical value of dividend growth over the specified period using the product of their values. The geometric average is defined as the nth root of the product of n numbers. Solid dividend growth may be one sign of a healthy stock. Investors may be watching different time periods to assess dividend growth rates.
Alaska Air Group, Inc. shares currently have an 8-year dividend growth rate of -86.62%, a 5 year of 54.85%, and a 3 year of 32.00%.
FCFFree Cash Flow or FCF, may be used to gauge the true profitability of a company. FCF measures the amount of cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures, and it may be a useful indicator for assessing financial performance. Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK)‘s FCF growth is presently at 0.393892. 
This is calculated by subtracting FCF from the previous year from FCF this year, divided by FCF from last year. The company has an FCF score of 0.875754. The FCF score is an indicator that is derived by combining free cash flow stability with free cash flow growth. In general, a higher FCF score value would signal high free cash flow growth. 
The current FCF quality score is 3.000911. The free quality score assists with estimating free cash flow stability. FCF quality is calculated as the 12 ltm cash flow per share over the average of the cash flow numbers. With this number, a lower ratio is typically preferred. 
Looking a bit further, the company has an FCF yield of 0.03843, and a 5-year average FCF yield of 0.02603. The first is simply FCF divided by enterprise value, and the second is the five year average FCF divided by the current enterprise value.
SMA CrossTechnical traders and investors may be looking at the simple moving average 50/200 cross on shares of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK). At the time of writing, the SMA 50/200 Cross value is 1.01951. If the value is greater than one, the 50 day moving average is above the 200 day moving average, which may signal positive stock price momentum. A value less than one would indicate that the 50 day moving average is below the 200 day, which may indicate negative share price momentum.
RangeInvestors often keep track of key stock price levels when doing equity research. Two standard levels are the 52-week high and 52-week low. Shares tend to come under increased scrutiny when approaching either of the two marks. 
After a recent check, the current stock price divided by the 52-week high for shares of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK), gives us a value of 0.937.

        Terms and Conditions text
    











Terms and conditions: Seats are limited and may not be available on all flights or all days. If nonstop service is offered during the advertised travel period, the advertised fare applies to the nonstop flights only. Bag fees apply for checked baggage. An additional VAT fee from $2.15 (CAD) per bag for bags checked in Canada may apply. For travel solely within the state of Alaska, customers may check up to three bags free of charge. Additional fees apply to check more than three bags or overweight or oversized items. These fares are nonrefundable and are only available on flights marketed by Alaska Airlines for travel on Alaska Airlines, Virgin America, Horizon Air, SkyWest, or PenAir. A ticket purchased at an Alaska Airlines airport location or through one of our reservation call centers will cost $15.00 more per person than the advertised fare. Applicable fare and tax differences apply to any changes made after ticketing. A $125(USD) change fee per person applies to changes made within 60 days of ticketed travel. The change fee is waived when travel is wholly within the state of Alaska on flights operated by Alaska Airlines. Fares include U.S. government taxes and fees. Canadian and Mexican government taxes and fees that are included in the fares shown are based on the current currency exchange rate and are subject to change. All fares are in U.S. dollars and are subject to change without notice, and other restrictions apply. Some markets may not operate daily service. Some flights may be operated by or in conjunction with Virgin America, Horizon Air, SkyWest, or PenAir.

History[edit]




Headquarters for Alaska Air Group


It was formed in 1985 and acquired Horizon Air and Jet America Airlines the next year. Jet America Airlines was merged into Alaska Airlines in 1987.[citation needed]
Alaska Air Group subsidiaries had 14,710 employees in 2007,[5] 14,143 in 2008[6] and 12,440 in 2009.[7] On December 31, 2011, Alaska Air Group has 12,806 employees (9,640 at Alaska Airlines and 3,166 at Horizon Air), compared to 12,039 (9,013 at Alaska Airlines and 3,202 at Horizon Air) on December 31, 2010.[8][9] Alaska Airlines operates only U.S. built Boeing aircraft with up to 181 seats while Horizon operates only Canadian built Bombardier Aerospace aircraft with up to 76 seats.[10]
In 2011, Alaska Air Group replaced the AMR Corporation in the Dow Jones Transportation Average.[11]
On December 14, 2016, Alaska Air Group completed its acquisition of Virgin America.[12] The total price for the acquisition was approximately $2.6 billion. Until 2019, Alaska Air Group will continue to operate Alaska Airlines and Virgin America as separate airlines and will continue to honor the loyalty programs of both groups.[13] On March 22, 2017 the company announced that Alaska Air Group will merge Virgin America and Alaska Airlines. The airline will operate under the Alaska Airlines brand and is expected to be fully merged in 2019. [14]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Alaska Air Group shares are mainly held by institutional investors (T. Rowe Price, The Vanguard Group and others[15])
Operations[edit]
Fleet[edit]
As of April 2016, Alaska Airlines' fleet consisted of 153 jet aircraft while Horizon Air's fleet consisted of 52 turboprop aircraft.[8] With the Virgin acquisition and ongoing merger, the combined fleet under Alaska Air Group's management numbers 286 aircraft.[16]
Alaska Air Group has created a new branding identity for its Horizon Air subsidiary and any other independently owned and separately directed affiliate regional airlines it chooses to contract to do regional flying business into markets too limited to be flown only on Alaska Airlines mainline equipment. Among the other airlines now sub-contracted to do additional flying for the Alaska Air Group are; SkyWest, Inc.'s, SkyWest Airlines whose Canadair CRJ-700 aircraft dedicated to providing service for the Alaska Air Group are painted in a very similar manner to Alaska Horizon's. SkyWest's fleet however, are branded Alaska SkyWest to differentiate that airline's aircraft from those of Horizon Air.[citation needed]
Route network[edit]
Through its two principal airline subsidiaries, Alaska Air Group services the passenger and cargo markets of the Pacific Northwest with its extensive route network hub through the cities of Seattle and Portland. After the demise of Aloha Airlines and ATA Airlines in 2008, the Alaska Air Group has expanded heavily centering on Hawaii and other non-airline hub secondary mainland cities and airports.[17]
On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced plans to acquire Virgin America, pending approval from US government regulators and Virgin America shareholders.[18]

History[edit]




Headquarters for Alaska Air Group


It was formed in 1985 and acquired Horizon Air and Jet America Airlines the next year. Jet America Airlines was merged into Alaska Airlines in 1987.[citation needed]
Alaska Air Group subsidiaries had 14,710 employees in 2007,[5] 14,143 in 2008[6] and 12,440 in 2009.[7] On December 31, 2011, Alaska Air Group has 12,806 employees (9,640 at Alaska Airlines and 3,166 at Horizon Air), compared to 12,039 (9,013 at Alaska Airlines and 3,202 at Horizon Air) on December 31, 2010.[8][9] Alaska Airlines operates only U.S. built Boeing aircraft with up to 181 seats while Horizon operates only Canadian built Bombardier Aerospace aircraft with up to 76 seats.[10]
In 2011, Alaska Air Group replaced the AMR Corporation in the Dow Jones Transportation Average.[11]
On December 14, 2016, Alaska Air Group completed its acquisition of Virgin America.[12] The total price for the acquisition was approximately $2.6 billion. Until 2019, Alaska Air Group will continue to operate Alaska Airlines and Virgin America as separate airlines and will continue to honor the loyalty programs of both groups.[13] On March 22, 2017 the company announced that Alaska Air Group will merge Virgin America and Alaska Airlines. The airline will operate under the Alaska Airlines brand and is expected to be fully merged in 2019. [14]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Alaska Air Group shares are mainly held by institutional investors (T. Rowe Price, The Vanguard Group and others[15])
Operations[edit]
Fleet[edit]
As of April 2016, Alaska Airlines' fleet consisted of 153 jet aircraft while Horizon Air's fleet consisted of 52 turboprop aircraft.[8] With the Virgin acquisition and ongoing merger, the combined fleet under Alaska Air Group's management numbers 286 aircraft.[16]
Alaska Air Group has created a new branding identity for its Horizon Air subsidiary and any other independently owned and separately directed affiliate regional airlines it chooses to contract to do regional flying business into markets too limited to be flown only on Alaska Airlines mainline equipment. Among the other airlines now sub-contracted to do additional flying for the Alaska Air Group are; SkyWest, Inc.'s, SkyWest Airlines whose Canadair CRJ-700 aircraft dedicated to providing service for the Alaska Air Group are painted in a very similar manner to Alaska Horizon's. SkyWest's fleet however, are branded Alaska SkyWest to differentiate that airline's aircraft from those of Horizon Air.[citation needed]
Route network[edit]
Through its two principal airline subsidiaries, Alaska Air Group services the passenger and cargo markets of the Pacific Northwest with its extensive route network hub through the cities of Seattle and Portland. After the demise of Aloha Airlines and ATA Airlines in 2008, the Alaska Air Group has expanded heavily centering on Hawaii and other non-airline hub secondary mainland cities and airports.[17]
On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced plans to acquire Virgin America, pending approval from US government regulators and Virgin America shareholders.[18]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
