Prior to joining NASA, Strain was the head of the Space Department at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland, where he was integral to the successful development, launch, and operations of the New Horizons Spacecraft to Pluto. Coincidentally, Ball Aerospace was also a key part of this team as the developer of the Ralph camera. While at APL, he was also responsible for the national security business area which made many significant contributions to the Department of Defense and other U.S. agencies. 

Strain has more than 30 years of experience in the aerospace business, including executive positions at Orbital Sciences Corporation, where he led the company’s Satellite and the Electronic Sensors Divisions; Fairchild Space and Defense Company, for which he served as chief financial officer and in various other operational roles; and with Axiom Corporation.
