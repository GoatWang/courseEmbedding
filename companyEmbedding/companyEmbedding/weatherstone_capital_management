Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.

                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 08/12/2002
            

                BBB has determined that Weatherstone Capital Management, Inc meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

About Weatherstone









A Sensible Approach to Investing
1.  Investing is not the same as it was 10 years ago.
2.  Investing 10 years from now will not be the same as it is today.
Weatherstone Capital Management believes that due to the changing nature of the markets, investors  need the tools that both allow a portfolio to adjust to changing market environments as well as position it for long-term growth.
Michael Ball, founder and lead portfolio manager of Weatherstone Capital Management, has used these principles in building investment portfolios for investors for more than a decade. Over time, other financial advisors learned of his unique risk management strategies and expressed a desire to partner with Weatherstone Capital Management in order to utilize the strategies for their own clients portfolios. Since then, we have provided risk managed investment programs to committed financial advisors, and have grown to become a respected partner to advisors and Broker/Dealers across the country.
Over the years our dedicated staff has enhanced many services such as; online statements with performance and tax reporting, additional investment programs to provide a more extensive range of investment strategies for both conservative and aggressive investors, and the ability to combine multiple strategies in a single account in some instances.
As we grow, we will continue our commitment to offer the best risk-managed investment strategies possible and provide the clients and advisors who entrust their money with us, the best possible service.

Investment Programs









We recognize that while investors are happy making money, they are even more unhappy losing money.  Because of this, Weatherstone offers a tactical approach to managing your investments.  This method is different from the strategic asset allocation.  Instead of rebalancing the portfolio on a quarterly or semi-annual basis to a preset asset allocation, Weatherstone will monitor your investments as frequently as daily and adjust the asset allocation as needed.  This approach incorporates a buy and sell discipline with the goal of reducing the severity of market losses while still allowing the portfolios to shift into the markets to participate in the advances.

View our Tactical Programs




A strategic approach to investing is designed to capture the broad market moves, which over a longer time horizon, has delivered strong return potential to investors who adhere to the discipline.  The strategic or “buy-and-hold” approach advocate for a more efficient market where new information is instantly accounted for.  Broad diversification is a key element of the Weatherstone strategic portfolios given that the asset allocation does not change frequently.  This diversification spreads the market risk which helps take emotion out of the equation for investors nervous about changing conditions.

Financial Advisors






Helping you do what you love most


If you are like most financial advisors, you entered the business to help investors create a roadmap to a secure retirement lifestyle.  You understand that your time is best spent with clients working through challenges and listening to their concerns.  What you may find is that too much of your time now is spent in front of the computer doing research on a myriad of investment products at the expense of time with clients and prospects.  Weatherstone is here to help you get back to what you love doing.  Weatherstone Capital Management is a tactical money manager approved to work with a growing number of the Country’s leading independent broker/dealers.
Weatherstone is unique in it’s long history of actual investment results whereas others may try using back-tested hypothetical returns in their offerings.  With multiple bear and bull market cycles included, you and your clients will have a better experience with more predictable outcomes.  In addition, Weatherstone manages several strategy offerings using their in-house investment committee as well as partnering with other money managers to offer your clients a multi-manager solution and the ability to mix and blend strategies all in one account.  This provides diversification between management teams without the headache of multiple custodians or statements to keep track of.

Our goal
1. Keep you in front of clients and prospects by closely monitoring market conditions and assuming investment allocation decisions.
2. Provide ongoing unsurpassed service to your office when you need it.
3. Provide ongoing communication to advisors and clients during all market conditions
4. Provide a more stable income stream that benefits clients through a fee-based approach as opposed to commissions.

Weatherstone assists advisors with the tools, technology and support necessary to manage and grow a successful fee-based practice.  We can provide you with comprehensive online reporting, ongoing market commentary, podcasts, webinars, mobile apps and a proposal system.
