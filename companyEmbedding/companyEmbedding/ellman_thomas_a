Description

									Thermo Scientific Pierce Ellman's Reagent (DTNB) reacts with sulfhydryl groups to yield a colored product, providing a reliable method to measure reduced cysteines and other free sulfhydryls in solution.

Ellman's Reagent (5,5'-dithio-bis-[2-nitrobenzoic acid]) is used to estimate sulfhydryl groups in a sample by comparing to a standard curve of a sulfhydryl-containing compound such as cysteine. Alternatively, sulfhydryl groups can be assayed using the extinction coefficient of TNB (14,150M-1 cm-1 at 412nm). Ellman's Reagent has been used for applications other than sulfhydryl estimation, such as for determining alkylthiols by HPLC using a pre-column derivatization procedure and to study thiols in the active site of several enzymes.

Features of Ellman's Reagent:

• Sulfhydryl assay—reacts quantitatively with free (reduced) sulfhydryl groups (—SH) to yield detectable TNB product
• Colorimetric detection—colored product enables spectrophotometric measurement in cuvettes or microplates (λmax = 412nm; ε = 14,150/M·cm)
• Proven method—well-characterized chemistry provides quantitation of peptide or protein sulfhydryl groups using extinction coefficient calculation or by comparison to a cysteine standard
Reagent Properties
• Alternative names: DTNB, Ellman's Reagent
• Chemical name: 5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)
• Reactive toward: Sulfhydryl groups (—SH)
• Chemical formula: C14H8N2O8S2
• CAS number: 69-78-3
• Molecular weight: 396.35
• Form: Yellow crystalline powder

DTNB reacts with a free sulfhydryl group to yield a mixed disulfide and 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid (TNB). The target of DTNB in this reaction is the conjugate base (R—S-) of a free sulfhydryl group. Therefore, the rate of this reaction is dependent on several factors: (1) the reaction pH, (2) the pKa' of the sulfhydryl and (3) steric and electrostatic effects. TNB is the colored species produced in this reaction and has a high molar extinction coefficient in the visible range. The molar extinction coefficient of TNB was originally reported by Ellman (1959) to be 13,600M-1 cm-1 at 412 nm and pH 8.0. Consequently, this value has been cited frequently in the literature. Later studies have shown, however, that the molar extinction coefficient is more accurately reflected by a value of 14,150M-1 cm-1 at 412 nm. The extinction of TNB is not affected by changes in pH between 7.6 and 8.6. However, the extinction of TNB is different in other solvents.

									For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.

            Pierce™ p-Bromophenacylate Reagent
        
(Thermo Scientific™)

            
        Label, detect and measure peptides and amino acids by HPLC using this carboxylic acid-reactive compound (Amax 260nm; UV); also called p-Bromophenacyl-8.           
    






Amino Acid Standard H
(Thermo Scientific™)


    Thermo Scientific Pierce Amino Acid Standard H is a quantitative mixture of 18 amino acids, supplied at 2.5 µMol/mL each in 0.1N HCl, for use as a high-purity calibration standard for HPLC analysis of protein hydrolysates.Features of Amino Acid Standard H:• Complete mixture—contains eighteen (18) amino acids for assessment of amino acid composition of peptide hydrolysates• Quantitative—contains exact amounts of each amino acid (2.5±0.1 µMol/mL, except cystine at 1.25±0.1 µMol/mL), enabling its use as a quantitation standard• Stable—dissolved in 0.1N hydrochloric acid and stabilized as 1 mL aliquots in sealed glass ampules• Standard H—designed for compositional amino acid analysis by HPLC methods of protein or peptide hydrolysatesThis quantitative solution of eighteen purified amino acids in 0.1N HCl is an ideal reference standard for calibrating amino acid analyzers and assessing the composition of hydrolyzed peptides and proteins (hydrolysates). To permit standardization of microbiological and other assays, the mixture uses only the L-form of each amino acid. The molar concentration of each amino acid is verified by conventional amino acid analysis methods, making the mixture suitable as both a qualitative and quantitative standard. The solution is provided as stable 1 mL aliquots in sealed glass ampules.Specifications:Product Details:When kept frozen, an unopened vial has an indefinite storage life. Once the seal is broken, the reagent has a maximum storage life of six months (store frozen between uses). To use the product, thaw a vial and shake well to ensure a homogeneous solution. Then dilute appropriately with suitable buffers to a concentration compatible with the full-scale sensitivity of your amino acid analyzer.For added safety when opening glass ampules, consider using our Ampule Breakers, which are disposable safety devices that protect the fingers when breaking open a glass ampule.







PITC (Edman's Reagent) (phenylisothiocyanate)
(Thermo Scientific™)


    Thermo Scientific Pierce Phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) is a high-purity reagent for pre-column quantitative derivatization of amino acids by reverse-phase HPLC.Features of Phenylisothiocyanate (PITC):• For pre-column derivatization of amino acids for picomole detection levels in HPLC• Reacts with amine groups of amino acids in 5 to 10 minutes at room temperature to yield products that are detectable by UV absorbance (λmax = 254nm)• Produces phenylthiocarbamyl (PTC) derivatives that can be separated and quantified in 30 minutes using reverse-phase HPLC• Produces stable products with all amino acids, including prolinePhenylisothiocyanate (PITC), also known as Edman's Reagent, enables the sequential degradation of amino acids in a polypeptide chain, yielding primary structural information. PITC reacts readily with amino acids at alkaline pH. Precolumn derivatization results in phenylthiocarbamyl derivatives (PTC-amino acids) that can be separated and quantified using reverse-phase HPLC. This method produces stable products with all amino acids, including proline. PITC is volatile, making it possible to remove excess reagent in vacuo, thereby minimizing the possibility of reagent interference. Detection of picomole quantities of the derivatives can be achieved using a UV detector at 254nm. PITC derivatization followed by reverse-phase chromatography can be used for identification and quantitation of methylated, halogenated, phosphorylated and sulfonated amino acids.Reagent Properties:• Alternative names: PITC, Phenyl Isothiocyanate, Edman's Reagent• Chemical name: Isothiocyanatobenzene• Reactive toward: Primary amines (—NH2)• Chemical formula: C7H5NS• CAS number: 103-72-0• Molecular weight: 135.19• Form: Clear, colorless to pale yellow liquidUnlike Fmoc-chloride, PITC does not yield disubstituted tyrosine or histidine derivatives. PTC-amino acids demonstrate improved stability at pH 5-7.5 as well as increased stability at room temperature over o-phthalaldehyde (OPA)-amino acid adducts. Also, unlike OPA, PITC enables the direct analysis of secondary amino acids.

Ellman Radiosurgical Instruments
ELLMAN, A CYNOSURE COMPANY

See My Price


Description

        Radiosurgery is the use of a high frequency radio signal of 4.0 MHz or 3.8 MHz that produces a pressureless micro-smooth bloodless incision. This is in contrast to lower frequency electrosurgical units that produce more tissue alteration due to their increased lateral heat.
