Business Segments


UGI Corporation is a holding company with businesses focused on providing energy distribution, transportation, marketing and storage services.
Domestic Propane
Our domestic propane distribution business is conducted through AmeriGas Partners. AmeriGas Propane is responsible for managing the Partnership. The Partnership serves approximately 2 million customers in all 50 states from approximately 2,000 propane distribution locations. In addition to distributing propane, the Partnership also sells, installs and services propane appliances, including heating systems, and operates a residential heating, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, and related services business in certain counties of Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland. Typically, the Partnership’s propane distribution locations are in suburban and rural areas where natural gas is not readily available. Our local offices generally consist of a business office and propane storage. As part of its overall transportation and distribution infrastructure, the Partnership operates as an interstate carrier in all states throughout the continental U.S.
The Partnership sells propane primarily to residential, commercial/industrial, motor fuel, agricultural and wholesale customers. The Partnership distributed over 1.2 billion gallons of propane in Fiscal 2015. Approximately 96% of the Partnership’s Fiscal 2015 sales (based on gallons sold) were to retail accounts and approximately 4% were to wholesale and supply customers. Sales to residential customers in Fiscal 2015 represented approximately 39% of retail gallons sold; commercial/industrial customers 36%; motor fuel customers 15%; and agricultural customers 6%. Transport gallons, which are large-scale deliveries to retail customers other than residential, accounted for 4% of Fiscal 2015 retail gallons. No single customer represents, or is anticipated to represent, more than 5% of the Partnership’s consolidated revenues.

UGI France sells LPG in cylinders to approximately 20,000 retail outlets, such as supermarkets, individually owned stores and gas stations.

No single customer represents, or is anticipated to represent, more than 10% of total revenues for UGI France.

Utilities
UGI’s natural gas utility operations (“Gas Utility”) consist of the regulated natural gas distribution businesses of our subsidiary, UGI Utilities, and UGI Utilities' subsidiaries, PNG and CPG. Gas Utility serves approximately 600,000 customers in eastern and central Pennsylvania and several hundred customers in portions of one Maryland county. Gas Utility is regulated by the PUC and, with respect to its several hundred customers in Maryland, the Maryland Public Service Commission.
Gas Utility is authorized to distribute natural gas to approximately 600,000 customers in portions of 46 eastern and central Pennsylvania counties through its distribution system of approximately 12,000 miles of gas mains. Contemporary materials, such as plastic or coated steel, comprise approximately 85% of Gas Utility’s 12,000 miles of gas mains, with bare steel pipe comprising approximately 11% and cast iron pipe comprising approximately 4% of Gas Utility’s gas mains. In accordance with Gas Utility’s agreement with the PUC, Gas Utility will replace the cast iron portion of its gas mains by March of 2027 and the bare steel portion by March of 2043. The service area includes the cities of Allentown, Bethlehem, Easton, Harrisburg, Hazleton, Lancaster, Lebanon, Reading, Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Lock Haven, Pittston, Pottsville, and Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and the boroughs of Honesdale and Milford, Pennsylvania. Located in Gas Utility’s service area are major production centers for basic industries such as specialty metals, aluminum, glass and paper product manufacturing. Gas Utility also distributes natural gas to several hundred customers in portions of one Maryland county.
System throughput (the total volume of gas sold to or transported for customers within Gas Utility’s distribution system) for Fiscal 2013 was approximately 192.1 billion cubic feet (“bcf”). System sales of gas accounted for approximately 29% of system throughput, while gas transported for residential, commercial and industrial customers who bought their gas from others accounted for approximately 71% of system throughput.

Midstream & Marketing
UGI’s Midstream & Marketing business consists of our energy marketing, midstream, and power generation businesses.
UGI’s energy marketing business sells natural gas, liquid fuels and electricity to approximately 17,000 commercial and industrial customers at approximately 41,000 locations. Energy Services serves customers in all or portions of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, New York, Ohio, Maryland, Massachusetts, Virginia, North Carolina and the District of Columbia. Energy Services distributes natural gas through the use of the distribution systems of 36 local gas utilities. It supplies power to customers through the use of the transmission systems of 20 utility systems.
UGI’s Midstream business operates a natural gas liquefaction, storage and vaporization facility in Temple, Pennsylvania (“Temple Facility”), and propane storage and propane-air mixing stations in Pennsylvania. It also operates propane storage, rail transshipment terminals, and propane-air mixing stations in Steelton and Williamsport, Pennsylvania. These assets are used in UGI’s energy peaking business that provides supplemental energy, primarily liquefied natural gas and propane-air mixtures, to gas utilities on interstate pipelines at times of high demand (generally during periods of coldest winter weather). A fourfold expansion of the Temple Facility was completed in 2012. In Fiscal 2013, Energy Services expanded its energy peaking services at the Temple Facility and sold liquefied natural gas to customers for use by trucks, drilling rigs, other motor vehicles and facilities located off the gas grid. Energy Services also manages natural gas pipeline and storage contracts for UGI Utilities, subject to a competitive bid process, as well as storage capacity owned by Energy Services.
Through subsidiaries, UGI’s Midstream business owns and operates underground natural gas storage and related high pressure pipeline facilities which have FERC approval to sell storage services at market-based rates.
