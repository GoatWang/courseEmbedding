			Ms. Spomer has served as Executive Vice President of Veresen Inc. ("Veresen") and as President and Chief Executive Officer of Jordan Cove LNG LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Veresen, since October 2014. Veresen is an energy infrastructure and operations company with a focus on developing North American natural gas infrastructure. Prior to joining Veresen, Ms. Spomer was Senior Vice President, Global Business Development since 2012 for BG Group plc, a multinational energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas and oil. Ms. Spomer joined BG Group in 2002, as Chief Executive Officer of BG LNG Services and, from 2004 to 2011, Ms. Spomer served as Senior Vice President, Business Development - Americas and Global LNG Region. Prior to joining BG Group, Ms. Spomer was employed from 1998 by BP plc, a multinational energy company with integrated operations in the oil and gas industry, most recently as Vice President of Asia Pacific Global LNG. Prior to that, Ms. Spomer was with Amoco Production Company, a global chemical and oil company, before it merged with BP plc, and she worked with other energy companies in various management positions earlier in her career.
 
In light of our business and structure, the Board nominated Ms. Spomer to serve on our Board of Directors for the following reasons. Ms. Spomer has over 26 years of experience in international exploration, development and production of natural gas and oil. She has held senior and executive-level positions throughout her career, both in BG Group and earlier at BP and Amoco. As a multinational manufacturer with significant focus on LNG applications, we will benefit substantially from Ms. Spomer's international background and LNG experience. The Board believes that Ms. Spomer's experience will enhance the knowledge of the Board and provide useful insights to management.
