SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Financial Engines (NASDAQ:FNGN), America’s largest independent 
      registered investment advisor1, today announced the 
      appointment of Lawrence M. Raffone, age 51, as chief executive officer, 
      effective January 1, 2015. Raffone, who currently serves as Financial 
      Engines’ president, will succeed Jeffrey N. Maggioncalda, age 45, who 
      has served in the role since the company’s founding in 1996. 
      Maggioncalda will also step down from the Board of Directors on December 
      31, 2014, but will continue to serve as an advisor to the company under 
      Raffone’s direction during 2015. Raffone will join the Board of 
      Directors on January 1, 2015.
    


      “On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to congratulate Larry 
      on this appointment and thank Jeff for his extraordinary contributions 
      building Financial Engines for the past 18 years. Jeff’s intellect, 
      dedication and passionate leadership has made Financial Engines what it 
      is today – the market leader in providing retirement help for life for 
      millions of American workers,” said Paul Koontz, chairman, Financial 
      Engines Board of Directors. “Larry is an accomplished executive with 
      proven strategic and operational expertise and has been the architect of 
      our distribution strategy that has led to our impressive growth. He has 
      always been a visionary and has revolutionized an industry with our 
      technology and services. As president, Larry has proven that he is the 
      right person to lead Financial Engines into the future.”
    

      “It was a rare opportunity to work with one of my heroes, Bill Sharpe, 
      to build a company that has helped change the lives of millions of 
      people,” said Jeff Maggioncalda, chief executive officer of Financial 
      Engines. “What we have accomplished in the past 18 years – becoming 
      America’s largest independent registered investment advisor managing 
      over $100 billion in assets – is beyond what I expected, and I am 
      extremely proud of the genius in our products, the number of people we 
      have helped, and the extraordinary, diverse team at Financial Engines 
      who has made that happen. After 18 years at Financial Engines, and 
      seeing Larry lead as president for the past 2 years, I have complete 
      confidence that the company is poised for the next stage of growth.”
    

      “It is a privilege to succeed Jeff as CEO of Financial Engines,” said 
      Larry Raffone, president of Financial Engines. “I strongly believe in 
      our purpose to provide our customers with the retirement help they 
      deserve and as CEO will see that we continue to fulfill it for many 
      years to come. Jeff’s vision and energy have helped Financial Engines 
      become the market leader in retirement help, providing real benefits to 
      millions of Americans. I’m 100% confident that we will continue to 
      succeed because we have the best people, the right leaders and a bold 
      strategy for growth in place. We will continue to expand our service 
      offerings to help more people and create value for our stockholders. We 
      are committed to customers, employees and shareholders, all of whom are 
      critical to the long-term success of Financial Engines.”
    

      Raffone was appointed president of Financial Engines in 2012. He joined 
      Financial Engines in 2001 as executive vice president, distribution and 
      institutional services. Prior to joining Financial Engines, Raffone 
      served as the executive vice president of Fidelity Investments’ 
      Institutional Brokerage Group, a division of Fidelity Investments, from 
      January 1988 to January 2001. He received a master’s in business 
      administration from Babson College and a bachelor’s degree in marketing 
      from Bryant University.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
