Vestar Capital Partners Closes on $3.7 Billion Private Equity Fund | Business Wire


























































Vestar Capital Partners Closes on $3.7 Billion Private Equity Fund






January 20, 2006 11:53 AM Eastern Standard Time



				NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 20, 2006--Vestar Capital Partners today announced that it had a final closing in December 2005 on its latest private equity fund, Vestar Capital Partners V, L.P., with total commitments of $3.7 billion.  Approximately 130 institutional investors are participating in Vestar V, including public and corporate pension funds, financial institutions, endowments, foundations and foreign institutions, as well as many individuals and family offices. As with Vestar IV, the general partners of Vestar V collectively will be the largest investor in the fund with a commitment of $150 million. 

 "The strong commitment to Vestar V by our limited partners reaffirms our strategy of investing behind entrepreneurial management teams in building solid businesses," said Dan O'Connell, Vestar Capital Partners chief executive officer. "We are gratified that over 90% of our existing limited partners returned to invest in Vestar V, and welcome a select group of new limited partners representing many prestigious institutions from the U.S., Europe and Asia."  Fundraising for Vestar V commenced in April 2005 and was largely completed by August, when the fund held its first closing at $3 billion. "While meaningfully oversubscribed, we decided to limit commitments to our initial targeted fund size of $3.7 billion, a 50% increase over our predecessor fund, Vestar IV, which we closed in 1999," O'Connell added.  Over the past 18 years, Vestar's prior funds have invested in more than 50 companies and generated an annual rate of return net to limited partners of approximately 25%.  Consistent with previous Vestar funds, Vestar V intends to develop a diversified portfolio of management buyout and growth capital investments. The fund will focus on U.S. and European businesses ranging from $100 million to $3 billion in total enterprise value, and will have the flexibility to commit up to $750 million of capital to a single investment opportunity.  "The critical element for successfully investing this capital, as we've shown in our previous funds, will be forming strong partnerships with management teams, family owners or corporations and working together in a creative and flexible way toward the overriding goal of building long-term franchise value," said Jim Kelley, president of Vestar Capital Partners.  "All of our more than 45 investment professionals in five offices in the U.S. and Europe are focused on the objective of identifying these special partnerships using their knowledge of and experience in their local markets," added Rob Rosner, president of Vestar Europe. In fact, the first Vestar V investment is the recently announced agreement to acquire Switzerland-based Nybron Flooring International, the European market leader in wood flooring products.  As with Vestar III and IV, Monument Group assisted Vestar in fundraising for Vestar V.  About Vestar Capital Partners  Vestar Capital Partners is a leading private equity firm specializing in management buyouts and growth capital investments.

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) - Vestar Capital Partners unveiled a new $3.7 billion fund Friday, the largest pool of money ever raised by the New York-based private-equity firm.  About 130 institutions such as pension funds, endowments and foundations, invested in the Vestar Capital Partners V, L.P. fund. Together, Vestar general partners will be the largest investor group in the fund, with a commitment of $150 million, the firm added.  Lured by big returns that private-equity has generated in recent years, investors have been pouring money into the business. Private-equity funds probably raised more than $100 billion in 2005, easily outpacing the previous record of $86.5 billion set in 2000, according to Thomson Financial data. Warburg Pincus LLC raised $8 billion for a global private-equity fund last year, the biggest pool of money the firm has collected since it was formed in 1966. This wall of money has already begun to spark a new wave of leveraged buyouts and even pushed firms into new industries such as technology. See full story. Vestar's new fund will try to buy U.S. and European businesses ranging from $100 million to $3 billion in total enterprise value and is able to put as much as $750 million into a single deal, the firm said.  Over the past 18 years, Vestar claims it's prior funds have generated an annual rate of return of about 25%.

Dart Container Corporation Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire Solo Cup Company
Combined companies to provide greater value to customers and ensure long-term success in a changing industry
March 21, 2012; Mason, Michigan – Dart Container Corporation, based in Mason, MI, and Solo Cup Company, headquartered in Lake Forest, IL, today announced that they have signed a Definitive Agreement under which Dart Container will acquire Solo in a transaction valued at approximately $1 billion. Both companies are in the consumer and foodservice disposable packaging business. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close by the third quarter of this year.
“Our acquisition of Solo will allow us to provide even greater value to our customers in the future,” said Dart Container CEO Robert C. Dart. “It will enable customers to purchase a wider range of products, made from a greater variety of materials with varying functional and environmental attributes – all from a single vendor. Both companies have an extensive history in the industry and will bring together valuable experience, traditions and complementary, high-quality products.”
“Solo has made great strides over the past several years in improving its operating efficiency, information systems and the caliber of the talent within the organization,” said Robert M. Korzenski, CEO, Solo Cup Company. “Dart’s leadership team has shown a high level of respect for what Solo has accomplished and I believe we are putting the company in the right hands to succeed and grow going forward.”
“Dart Container’s acquisition of Solo will accelerate the progress Solo has made to improve its levels of service and customer support,” said Dart. “We will use our expertise in running a successful, efficient, reliable and service-oriented company to create an organization that blends the best of both Dart and Solo for the benefit of our customers.”
According to Robert Dart, a top priority is bringing together the talents and skills of employees from both organizations to ensure that customers continue to receive exceptionally reliable service.
“These are two companies with strong histories of innovation and quality that have invested in the industry and in their customers,” said Robert L. Hulseman, chairman emeritus, Solo Cup Company. “I am very proud of this company’s contributions to the foodservice packaging industry and extremely pleased that many of Solo’s dedicated employees will have the opportunity to continue making a difference for our customers. This is a positive outcome for everyone involved.”
“We at Vestar have had a rewarding and productive partnership with the Hulseman family and Solo Cup’s management team during the past eight years,” said Kevin Mundt, managing director, Vestar Capital Partners. “Our combined efforts have enabled Solo Cup to become a leader in the foodservice packaging industry and have led to this powerful, strategic transaction with Dart Container, a very positive outcome for Solo, Dart, the Hulseman family, and Vestar.”
Regarding the integration process, Robert Dart pointed out that unlike publicly traded companies, where short-term results often are of paramount importance to investors and other stakeholders, privately held Dart Container is able to make decisions and investments that are long term in nature. He said the company has the time, and will take the time, to integrate Solo in a thoughtful, analytical manner to ensure lasting success.
Solo is majority-owned by the family of its founder, Leo J. Hulseman, and is also a portfolio company of Vestar Capital Partners IV, L.P. Dart Container is a privately owned company founded by William A. Dart. The integrated organization will be a private company known as Dart Container Corporation. Dart expects to continue offering products under the Solo brand – including the iconic red Solo cup.
Michigan-based Dart Container Corporation and Illinois-based Solo Cup Company will continue to operate independently until government approval is secured and the transaction closes.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as lead financial advisor to Solo Cup Company on the transaction. Evercore Partners also advised Solo Cup Company on the transaction. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP acted as legal counsel to Solo. Ernst & Young Corporate Finance Inc. was lead financial advisor to Dart Container Corporation and Vinson & Elkins LLP served as Dart’s legal counsel on the transaction.
