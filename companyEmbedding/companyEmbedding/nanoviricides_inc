A New Era in Targeted Anti-Viral Therapeutics
Imagine coursing through the blood stream, chasing through the body, grabbing and destroying the offending virus particles. NanoViricides, Inc. is striving to bring this imagination to fruition. A nanoviricide®, as defined by the Company, is a nanomachine that is armed to destroy a particular kind of virus. Which virus? That information is programmed into the nanoviricide, akin to the postal address on an envelope.
Biomimetic Technology to "Fool" Viruses
                
A "nanoviricide" is an agent designed by the Company to fool a virus into attaching to this antiviral nanomachine, in the same way that the virus normally attaches to the receptors on a cell surface. Once attached, the flexible nanoviricide glob wraps around the virus and traps it. In the process, the virus also loses its coat proteins that it needs to bind to a cell. The virus is thus neutralized and effectively destroyed. A nanoviricide completes the task of dismantling the virus particle without immune system assistance. This is the putative or designed mechanism of action of a nanoviricide. Thus nanoviricides represent the next great advance in "Immunotherapeutics" (antibodies and vaccines), which are currently well established antiviral strategies.more....

  Corporate Profile

NanoViricides, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on July 25, 2000 as Edot-com.com, Inc. and was organized for the purpose of conducting Internet retail sales. On April 1, 2005, Edot-com.com, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada for the purpose of re-domiciling the Company as a Nevada corporation, Edot-com.com (Nevada). On April 15, 2005, Edot-com.com (Colorado) and Edot-com.com (Nevada) were merged and Edot-com.com, Inc., (ECMM) a Nevada corporation, became the surviving entity. On April 15, 2005, the authorized shares of common stock were increased to 300,000,000 shares at $.001 par value and the Company effected a 3.2 to 1 forward stock split effective May 12, 2005.
On June 1, 2005, Edot-com.com, Inc. acquired NanoViricides, Inc., a privately owned Florida corporation ("NVI"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Share Exchange (the "Exchange"). NVI was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on May 12, 2005 and its sole asset was comprised of a licensing agreement with TheraCour Pharma, Inc., ("TheraCour," an approximately 24.9% shareholder of NVI) for rights to develop and commercialize novel and specifically targeted drugs based on TheraCour's targeting technologies, against a number of human viral diseases. (For financial accounting purposes, the acquisition was a reverse acquisition of the Company by NVI, under the purchase method of accounting, and was treated as a recapitalization with NVI as the acquirer). Upon consummation of the Exchange, ECMM adopted the business plan of NVI.
Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange, ECMM acquired NVI in exchange for an aggregate of 80,000,000 newly issued shares of ECMM common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 100,000,000 shares of ECMM common stock issued and outstanding. As a result of the Exchange, NVI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ECMM. The ECMM shares were issued to the NVI Shareholders on a pro rata basis, on the basis of 4,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock for each share of NVI common stock held by such NVI Shareholder at the time of the Exchange.
On June 28, 2005, NVI was merged into its parent ECMM and the separate corporate existence of NVI ceased. Effective on the same date, Edot-com.com, Inc., changed its name to NanoViricides, Inc. and its stock symbol on the Pink Sheets to "NNVC", respectively. The Company submitted a Form-10SB to the SEC to become a reporting company on November 14, 2006. The Company's filing status became effective in March, 2007. On June 28, 2007, the company became quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol NNVC. The Company is considered a development stage company at this time.
NanoViricides, Inc. (the "Company"), is a nano-biopharmaceutical (nanomedicine) company whose business goals are to discover, develop and commercialize therapeutics to advance the care of patients suffering from life-threatening viral infections. We are a development stage company with several drugs in various stages of early development. The Company's drugs are based on several patents, patent applications, provisional patent applications, and other proprietary intellectual property held by TheraCour Pharma, Inc. ("TheraCour®"), to which the Company has exclusive licenses in perpetuity for the treatment of the following human viral diseases: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS), Influenza including Asian Bird Flu Virus (INF), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), and Rabies. On February 15, 2010, the Company entered into an Additional License Agreement with TheraCour granting the Company the exclusive licenses in perpetuity for technologies developed by TheraCour for the additional virus types of Dengue viruses (DENV), Japanese Encephalitis (JEV), West Nile Virus (WNV), viruses causing viral Conjunctivitis (a disease of the eye) and Ocular Herpes, and Ebola/Marburg viruses.
The Company focuses its research and clinical programs on specific anti-viral therapeutics and is seeking to add to its existing portfolio of products through its internal discovery and clinical development programs and through an in-licensing strategy. To date, the Company has not commercialized any product.
The Company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $22,894,827 at June 30, 2011. For the year ended June 30, 2011 the Company had a net loss of $6,155,084. Such losses are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and until such time, if ever, as the Company is able to attain sales levels sufficient to support its operations.
To date, we have engaged in organizational activities; sourcing compounds and materials; developing novel compounds and nanomaterials, and experimentation with studies on cell cultures and animals. We have generated funding through the issuances of debt, private placement of common stock, and sale of registered securities. We have not generated any revenues and we do not expect to generate revenues in the near future. We may not be successful in developing our drugs and start selling our products when planned, or that we will become profitable in the future. We have incurred net losses in each fiscal period since inception of our operations. The Company currently has no long-term debt.

  Advanced Technologies : ADIF(™) Technologies

We believe that our technologies and capabilities for attacking different viruses are fairly well demonstrated. In addition, we have developed "Accurate-Drug-In-Field(™)" or ADIF(™) technologies that may show efficacy in treating epidemics like H5N1, SARS or Ebola by developing a targeted therapeutic in the field to prevent the spread of the disease.
ADIF technology does not require any knowledge of the molecular biology of the virus, or even its specific identification. An accurate drug, specifically targeted at the virus, can be developed in the field from nanomicelles stockpiled beforehand. This enables a rapid response timeframe as short as 3 weeks for initial drug doses, and potentially less than 3 months for sufficient doses to curb the spread of the virus outside the affected area. Thus ADIF technologies are applicable to novel, or engineered viruses, or emerging infections whether natural or man-made. This technology may have significant applications in the Biodefense area. We believe that this is the only technology that can enable humans to combat novel viruses before they spread disease.
We have already successfully demonstrated the ADIF technology capabilities.

Company Overview
NanoViricides, Inc. is a development stage company with a unique nanomedicine technology. The Company is developing nanotechnology-based biomimetic anti-viral medicines, that we call "nanoviricides®". Virus-specific nanoviricide drug candidates against five commercially important viral diseases, viz. seasonal and potentially-epidemic influenzas and bird flu, HIV/AIDS, cold sores and genital herpes infection, viral eye diseases, as well as dengue viruses, have demonstrated very high levels of effectiveness.

Unique Find-Encapsulate-Destroy Antiviral Strategy
A "nanoviricide" is an antiviral agent designed by the Company to fool a virus into attaching to this agent in the same way that the virus normally attaches to receptors on a cell surface. Once attached, the flexible nanoviricide glob would wrap around the virus and trap it. In the process, the virus could lose its coat proteins that it needs to bind to a cell. The virus is thus neutralized and effectively destroyed. Nanoviricides are designed to complete the task of dismantling the virus particle without immune system assistance.
Thus nanoviricides represent the next great advance in "Immunotherapeutics" (antibodies and vaccines,) the well established antiviral strategies. Viruses have developed smart strategies to derail immune system function. This results in failure of antibodies and vaccines.
The nanoviricide technology attempts to circumvent virus escape that results from natural changes in virus structure. Despite all such changes, the cell receptor to which a virus binds remains the same. Nanoviricides mimic this conserved feature of virus binding to its host cell receptor. If a virus "escapes" a properly designed nanoviricide, it would have a reduced ability to attach to the cell receptor and would have become much less pathogenic in the process.
Strong Nanomedicine Intellectual Property Portfolio
NanoViricides, Inc. product candidates are based on TheraCour® technology invented and developed by company president and founder Anil R. Diwan, PhD. NanoViricides, Inc. holds an exclusive, worldwide license to this technology for its antiviral drugs. The technology is protected by two very broad international patent applications that cover compositions of matter, processes of manufacture, methods of use, and fields of use. Additional patent applications are expected, and the Company intends to patent each drug separately as well.
Independent Researchers Perform Biological Testing
The Company has several collaborations at leading academic , private and federal laboratories. These independent researchers perform nanoviricides testing against various viral targets. The core intellectual property studies are performed by us. This drug development strategy saves on capital needs and provides unbiased data on our drug candidates.
Advancing Rapidly Towards FDA Submissions
 We have filed a pre-IND application for FluCide (NV-INF-1), a novel, first-in-class drug with the FDA. We anticipate moving rapidly after the product development path is defined. 
We are developing a state-of-the-art cGMP manufacturing facility to enable production of human clinical batches of nanoviricide drug substances. A world-class team has been put together to work on the facility design, construction, and validation. 
We continue to advance our other drugs candidates towards the goal of filing a pre-IND application for each of them in order to define the product development path. 
We plan to perform regulatory submissions and file for drug approvals internationally.

Company Overview
NanoViricides, Inc. is a development stage company with a unique nanomedicine technology. The Company is developing nanotechnology-based biomimetic anti-viral medicines, that we call "nanoviricides®". Virus-specific nanoviricide drug candidates against five commercially important viral diseases, viz. seasonal and potentially-epidemic influenzas and bird flu, HIV/AIDS, cold sores and genital herpes infection, viral eye diseases, as well as dengue viruses, have demonstrated very high levels of effectiveness.

Unique Find-Encapsulate-Destroy Antiviral Strategy
A "nanoviricide" is an antiviral agent designed by the Company to fool a virus into attaching to this agent in the same way that the virus normally attaches to receptors on a cell surface. Once attached, the flexible nanoviricide glob would wrap around the virus and trap it. In the process, the virus could lose its coat proteins that it needs to bind to a cell. The virus is thus neutralized and effectively destroyed. Nanoviricides are designed to complete the task of dismantling the virus particle without immune system assistance.
Thus nanoviricides represent the next great advance in "Immunotherapeutics" (antibodies and vaccines,) the well established antiviral strategies. Viruses have developed smart strategies to derail immune system function. This results in failure of antibodies and vaccines.
The nanoviricide technology attempts to circumvent virus escape that results from natural changes in virus structure. Despite all such changes, the cell receptor to which a virus binds remains the same. Nanoviricides mimic this conserved feature of virus binding to its host cell receptor. If a virus "escapes" a properly designed nanoviricide, it would have a reduced ability to attach to the cell receptor and would have become much less pathogenic in the process.
Strong Nanomedicine Intellectual Property Portfolio
NanoViricides, Inc. product candidates are based on TheraCour® technology invented and developed by company president and founder Anil R. Diwan, PhD. NanoViricides, Inc. holds an exclusive, worldwide license to this technology for its antiviral drugs. The technology is protected by two very broad international patent applications that cover compositions of matter, processes of manufacture, methods of use, and fields of use. Additional patent applications are expected, and the Company intends to patent each drug separately as well.
Independent Researchers Perform Biological Testing
The Company has several collaborations at leading academic , private and federal laboratories. These independent researchers perform nanoviricides testing against various viral targets. The core intellectual property studies are performed by us. This drug development strategy saves on capital needs and provides unbiased data on our drug candidates.

Seymour is just a product of the recent Geriatric Crime Wave that has been exploding in epic proportions, both here and in Japan.   http://www.businessinsider.com/the-elderly-are-on-a-crime-spree-2015-5   Unless we clamp down hard on these Geriatric Clowns soon, there will be many more elderly bad hombres waiting in line to replace Seymour and his ilk.
