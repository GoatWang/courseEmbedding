		(HMIS) Series delivers the Iron Triangle: Payload, Performance and 
		Protection – the three absolute must-haves for the military. ProTec is a 
		time-tested suspension designed for tactical-wheeled military vehicles 
		and armored personnel carriers, as well as specialty and off-highway 
		applications. It was launched to meet the demands of the customer for 
		superior force protection, unmatched mobility and unparalleled ride 
		quality.
Meritor Defense’s technologies are specifically engineered for military mission 
		profiles and duty cycles and are proven to perform on all types of 
		terrain. Our enhanced solutions for both the High Mobility Multipurpose

The Automotive Industry in Appalachian North Carolina








Meritor, Inc (Company Profile)
 

Meritor, Inc.






Meritor Inc. is a multi-national Fortune 1000 corporation headquartered in Troy, Michigan that was founded in 1921makes a wide range of products in the vehicle and auto industry.[1] Meritor has 9,000 employees in 18 countries and had sales of 3.7 billion for fiscal year 2013. Their products range from drivetrain, mobility, braking and aftermarket solutions for commercial vehicle and industrial markets. 

 Meritor’s wide range of products are managed in two main segments: “Aftermath and Trailer” and “Truck and Industrial” markets. “Truck and Industrial” make up a significant 76% of their fiscal year sales, while                                                          “Aftermath and Trailer” made up the remaining 24% of sales for Fiscal Year 2013. The “Truck and Industrial” markets are characterized by supplies for drivetrain systems such as axles, drivelines, braking and suspension systems for medium to heavy-duty trucks. This segment is strongly linked to other markets such as defense, construction, mining, bus, and emergency. The “Aftermath and Trailer” industries focus on supplying either new or remanufactured axles, brakes, suspensions and components for all-makes aftermarket customers. In addition, there is a strong focus on providing systems for trailer manufacturing. In terms of the geographic locations, Meritor has a significant international reach. 57% of sales are made in North America with 21% in Europe, 12% in South America and 10% in the Asia Pacific region.[2]













The company has aggressively laid out four key priorities to achieve “sustainable growth.” Their strategies are to drive operational excellence, focus on customer value, reduce product cost, and invest in a high performing team. A tour of the Meritor facility in Fletcher, North Carolina shows these priorities in action. Machinery and robots are extremely important in the manufacturing process. Inside the “Meritor Production System” which is based on the Japanese “Kaizen”system is used. In the past, the assembly lines were human operated, but are now almost entirely automated. New technologies such as “dry cutting” have increased health and safety standards inside the plant and plants generate over 9,000 tons of material that are recycled from wood, plastic, paper and oil.[3]

North Carolina’s history of engagement in the automotive industry has made Meritor one of the strongest players in a sea of many other suppliers and manufacturers. Meritor’s operations in North Carolina are mostly in Forest City, Fletcher, and Laurinburg.[4] Meritor has also expanded many of its operations within North Carolina. Most notably, in July of 2015 it was announced that Meritor will purchase majority assets of Sypris Solutions. This new plant is located in Morganton and was previously owned by competitor Sypris Solutions. This facility is part of Meritor’s greater goal to expand into new industries with a plant that produces trailer axle beams and light vehicle components.[5] Meritor is also investing in other parts of North Carolina such as Scotland county, where is was announced that Meritor would invest 3.5 million dollars, add 57 jobs, and expand operations in axles, bus, and coach.[6]

Meritor® Expands FastSet™ No-Ream King Pin Kit Product Line

TROY, Mich., Jan. 24, 2017  /PRNewswire/ -- Meritor® (NYSE:    MTOR) announced today at Heavy Duty Aftermarket Week 2017 that it has expanded the FastSet™ King Pin Kit product line to now offer 45 no-ream kits that provide fleets with a faster solution for aftermarket king pin replacement. 








"Meritor FastSet is now available for all popular axle applications, including Meritor, Dana, Eaton, Spicer, Mack, Volvo, Chevrolet, GMC, Isuzu and Axle Alliance," said Joe Ghering, product manager, Steering and Suspension, Aftermarket for Meritor. "With fleets looking for ways to increase vehicle uptime, FastSet eliminates the need for reamers, special tools and presses when replacing king pins." 
With the kit, king pin bushings do not need to be reamed after they are installed into the steering knuckle, which saves labor, time and equipment costs. Instead of pressing in the bushings during installation, customers can use the kit to easily install spiral bushings by hand. Additionally, the king pin's special groove pattern design allows grease to permeate high-wear areas.  
FastSet uses only Meritor approved quality components and significantly reduces repair time as well as maintenance costs.  
The Meritor FastSet King Pin Kit is covered by Meritor's standard aftermarket warranty. For more information about the kits and availability, visit Literature on Demand on meritor.com and search for publication numbers SP-1637 and SP-1728. 
Note to editors: Photos of the Meritor FastSet™ King Pin Kit can be found at this link.

Trailer Products - M.T.I.S.




                
            






 Increases Tire Life, Fuel Economy and Safety




This innovative system connects all tires on the trailer to a controlled air supply to fill and maintain tires at the desired pressure setting, even while the vehicle is moving. As air pressure drops below the tire manufacturer's recommended level, MTIS automatically routes air through a control box and through the trailer axles to refill any underinflated tires. By maintaining proper pressure, MTIS helps extend tire life and allows for more even tread wear and maximized recap potential.

Meritor, Inc. (NYSE: MTOR) is an American corporation headquartered in Troy, Michigan, which manufactures automobile components for military suppliers, trucks, and trailers. Meritor is a Fortune 500 company.[1]
In 1997, Rockwell International spun off its automotive business as Meritor. In 2000, ArvinMeritor was formed from the merger of Meritor Automotive, Inc., and Arvin Industries, Inc.[2]
On February 1, 2011, it was announced that the company would revert its name to Meritor, Inc. at the Mid-American Truck Show in late March.[3] The name change was successfully completed and launched on March 30, 2011.

Executive Management[edit]
Charles "Chip" McClure, formal president and COO of Federal Mogul Corp., served as the CEO of Meritor from 2004 to 2013. Under his executive management, Meritor completed the divestiture of the passenger vehicle business segment in January 2011. This officially categorized this global manufacturer/supplier outside of the automotive industry. With its focal point on commercial vehicle system component production, Meritor announced continuous sales loss with total revenue at $63 million in 2011 and $52 million in 2012. August 2013, Ivor J.”Ike” Evans was named as the new interim CEO of Meritor, who has been a member of Board of Directors of Meritor Inc. since 2005. Ivor Evans served as the president and chief operating officer of Union Pacific Railroad from 1998 to 2004, and as the vice chairman of Union Pacific Cooperation from January 2004 to 2005. In July 2015, Jeffrey "Jay" Craig was named CEO of Meritor. [4]
Core Business[edit]
The business of Meritor consists of axles, brake and safety systems, drivelines, suspensions, trailers, aftermarket solutions for defense industries and commercial vehicles including truck, trailer, bus/coach, and off-highway. Meritor engineers diversiform products supplying different OEMs including Daimler, Navistar, and Volvo.[4]
Business Distribution[edit]
North America[edit]
Employing more than 4700 employees, the business facilities in North America contain various distribution locations in Canada, multiple production plants in Mexico, and facilities of administration, production, distribution, sales, and technical centers in the United States.[4]
South America[edit]
The Meritor business in South America, which was established in Brazil, employs more than 1700 employees. There are four manufacturing facilities, one distribution center, two engineering centers, three administrative offices, and one sales office.[4]
Europe[edit]
Meritor has administrative offices distributed in France, Netherlands, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, and United Kingdom,and production facilities in Italy, Sweden, Belgium, United Kingdom, as well as France, and one sales location in Spain.[4]
Asia Pacific[edit]
Meritor launches productions in Australia and Singapore, as well as development joint ventures, distribution centers, and sales locations in China and India. The company employs nearly 1800 employees in Asia Pacific region and has been present in the region for close to 30 years.[4]

Meritor, Inc. (NYSE: MTOR) is an American corporation headquartered in Troy, Michigan, which manufactures automobile components for military suppliers, trucks, and trailers. Meritor is a Fortune 500 company.[1]
In 1997, Rockwell International spun off its automotive business as Meritor. In 2000, ArvinMeritor was formed from the merger of Meritor Automotive, Inc., and Arvin Industries, Inc.[2]
On February 1, 2011, it was announced that the company would revert its name to Meritor, Inc. at the Mid-American Truck Show in late March.[3] The name change was successfully completed and launched on March 30, 2011.

Executive Management[edit]
Charles "Chip" McClure, formal president and COO of Federal Mogul Corp., served as the CEO of Meritor from 2004 to 2013. Under his executive management, Meritor completed the divestiture of the passenger vehicle business segment in January 2011. This officially categorized this global manufacturer/supplier outside of the automotive industry. With its focal point on commercial vehicle system component production, Meritor announced continuous sales loss with total revenue at $63 million in 2011 and $52 million in 2012. August 2013, Ivor J.”Ike” Evans was named as the new interim CEO of Meritor, who has been a member of Board of Directors of Meritor Inc. since 2005. Ivor Evans served as the president and chief operating officer of Union Pacific Railroad from 1998 to 2004, and as the vice chairman of Union Pacific Cooperation from January 2004 to 2005. In July 2015, Jeffrey "Jay" Craig was named CEO of Meritor. [4]
Core Business[edit]
The business of Meritor consists of axles, brake and safety systems, drivelines, suspensions, trailers, aftermarket solutions for defense industries and commercial vehicles including truck, trailer, bus/coach, and off-highway. Meritor engineers diversiform products supplying different OEMs including Daimler, Navistar, and Volvo.[4]
Business Distribution[edit]
North America[edit]
Employing more than 4700 employees, the business facilities in North America contain various distribution locations in Canada, multiple production plants in Mexico, and facilities of administration, production, distribution, sales, and technical centers in the United States.[4]
South America[edit]
The Meritor business in South America, which was established in Brazil, employs more than 1700 employees. There are four manufacturing facilities, one distribution center, two engineering centers, three administrative offices, and one sales office.[4]
Europe[edit]
Meritor has administrative offices distributed in France, Netherlands, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, and United Kingdom,and production facilities in Italy, Sweden, Belgium, United Kingdom, as well as France, and one sales location in Spain.[4]
Asia Pacific[edit]
Meritor launches productions in Australia and Singapore, as well as development joint ventures, distribution centers, and sales locations in China and India. The company employs nearly 1800 employees in Asia Pacific region and has been present in the region for close to 30 years.[4]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
