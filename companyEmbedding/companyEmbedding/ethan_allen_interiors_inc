Ethan Allen store, Ann Arbor, MI


Ethan Allen Global, Inc. is an American furniture chain with almost 300 stores across the United States, Canada[1] and the United Kingdom.[2] It was founded in 1932 by two brothers-in-law, Nathan S. Ancell and Theodore Baumritter.

Operations[edit]
Ethan Allen has 295 Design Centers and Studios, six manufacturing facilities including two sawmills, six wholesale distribution centers, 29 retail service centers, one hotel, and sales of $980 million located across the United States.[3] It is one of the largest furniture companies in the United States.[citation needed]
The company makes customized furniture domestically ( Maiden, NC ), such as upholstered furniture, sofas, and chairs, custom made in a selected fabric. Overall domestic manufacturing of Ethan Allen products stands at 65% with goals to raise this to 70% with the release of the new American Artisan line.[4]
History[edit]
The company was started as a housewares manufacturer in 1932, then bought a bankrupt furniture factory in Beecher Falls, Vermont, in 1936.[5][6] The firm adopted the name "Ethan Allen" for its early-American furniture introduced in 1939. It was named after the Vermont Revolutionary leader.
In 1972, Ethan Allen moved its headquarters from New York City to Danbury, Connecticut. The Ethan Allen International Headquarters Complex includes the Ethan Allen Hotel,[7] corporate headquarters offices, and an interior design center. The firm was sold in 1980 to Interco for $150 million, though Ancell remained an advisor. The company was sold again in 1989 to a management group headed by current Chairman, President, and CEO Farooq Kathwari. In 1993, the company went public to help raise $156.9 million through the sale of common stock.
In 2004, Ethan Allen closed its Boonville, New York, plant, laying off 250. It also closed its Bridgewater, Virginia, plant, also laying off 250.
In 2008, the company announced plans to close a dozen Design Centers. The decision was made to consolidate the Design Centers with others that were currently serving the same market area.[8]
More than seventy percent of its cherry, maple and alder wood pieces are crafted in the United States.[citation needed] Towards the end of 2008, Ethan Allen began selling their products online.[9]
In 2009, the company laid off 238 workers from Beecher Falls, Vermont. 93 workers remained.[10] Later in the year, the plant ceased operation. In 2009, Ethan Allen closed the Eldred, PA manufacturing plant.

Ethan Allen store, Ann Arbor, MI

Operations[edit]
Ethan Allen has 295 Design Centers and Studios, six manufacturing facilities including two sawmills, six wholesale distribution centers, 29 retail service centers, one hotel, and sales of $980 million located across the United States.[3] It is one of the largest furniture companies in the United States.[citation needed]
The company makes customized furniture domestically ( Maiden, NC ), such as upholstered furniture, sofas, and chairs, custom made in a selected fabric. Overall domestic manufacturing of Ethan Allen products stands at 65% with goals to raise this to 70% with the release of the new American Artisan line.[4]
History[edit]
The company was started as a housewares manufacturer in 1932, then bought a bankrupt furniture factory in Beecher Falls, Vermont, in 1936.[5][6] The firm adopted the name "Ethan Allen" for its early-American furniture introduced in 1939. It was named after the Vermont Revolutionary leader.
In 1972, Ethan Allen moved its headquarters from New York City to Danbury, Connecticut. The Ethan Allen International Headquarters Complex includes the Ethan Allen Hotel,[7] corporate headquarters offices, and an interior design center. The firm was sold in 1980 to Interco for $150 million, though Ancell remained an advisor. The company was sold again in 1989 to a management group headed by current Chairman, President, and CEO Farooq Kathwari. In 1993, the company went public to help raise $156.9 million through the sale of common stock.
In 2004, Ethan Allen closed its Boonville, New York, plant, laying off 250. It also closed its Bridgewater, Virginia, plant, also laying off 250.
In 2008, the company announced plans to close a dozen Design Centers. The decision was made to consolidate the Design Centers with others that were currently serving the same market area.[8]
More than seventy percent of its cherry, maple and alder wood pieces are crafted in the United States.[citation needed] Towards the end of 2008, Ethan Allen began selling their products online.[9]
In 2009, the company laid off 238 workers from Beecher Falls, Vermont. 93 workers remained.[10] Later in the year, the plant ceased operation. In 2009, Ethan Allen closed the Eldred, PA manufacturing plant.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Ethan Allen Comments on Business in advance of Investor Meeting and Announces Earnings Release Date for Fiscal 2017 ResultsBack to ETH News

Ethan Allen Comments on Business in advance of Investor Meeting and Announces Earnings Release Date for Fiscal 2017 Results
DANBURY, CT July 17, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. ("Ethan Allen" or the "Company") (NYSE: ETH) commented today, in advance of its Investor Meeting, on its recent and upcoming business objectives as well as its preliminary financial results for the 2017 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, 2017.
"We look forward to discussing our progress and initiatives at the forthcoming Investor Meeting," said Farooq Kathwari, Chairman and CEO of Ethan Allen. "Fiscal 2017 was a 'year of action' where we completed many initiatives and also launched major new initiatives. Topics of the meeting will include the repositioning of our offerings, our expanded marketing, investments in new Design Centers around the country, investments in technology, the launch of the Ethan Allen | Disney magical home program and the recent launch of the 'Ethan Allen design studio' on Amazon."
Mr. Kathwari added, "During our fourth quarter, retail written orders in April decreased 7.1% and then progressively increased by 7.0% in May and 6.9% in June, resulting in a 1.9% increase for the quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. So far in July, written orders have continued a strong positive trend."
Net sales and projected earnings for the fourth quarter, ending June 30, 2017, were impacted by several factors, including very tough comparatives with the prior year quarter when retail net sales increased 7.6%, wholesale net sales increased 9.6%, and adjusted EPS increased 32.6%. Net sales in the prior year quarter also reflected shipments of new product introductions, which also resulted in stronger margins at the wholesale level. Additionally, during the current year fourth quarter, national advertising increased 27.5% over the prior year period, reflecting the Company's continued focus on brand building and driving traffic and sales.
Mr. Kathwari further stated, "While these many initiatives, coupled with a substantial expansion of our advertising, have resulted in increased operating expenses compared to the prior year, they are now substantially completed. We are well positioned for our fiscal 2018 and remain cautiously optimistic."
Based on preliminary financial information, the Company expects to report fiscal year 2017 consolidated net sales of $763.4 million compared to $794.2 in the prior year, wholesale net sales of $453.3 million, and retail net sales of $603.7 million. 
The company expects an adjusted gross margin of 55.6% for the fourth quarter and 55.8% for the full fiscal year, an adjusted operating margin of approximately 9.5% for the fourth quarter and 8.5% for the fiscal year, and adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter in the range of $0.41 to $0.42 and for the full fiscal year in the range of $1.44 to $1.45.
During the fourth quarter, the Company paid $5.3 million in dividends, an increase of 11.6%, and for the full fiscal year paid dividends of $20.0 million, an increase of 20.3%, over the prior year period.  The Company repurchased 250,000 shares for $6.9 million during the fourth quarter and 360,000 shares for $10.2 million for the fiscal year.
The Company will release its fiscal year 2017 financial results after the market closes on Wednesday, July 26, 2017, and will host an analyst conference call to discuss the company's business and financial highlights that afternoon, at 5:00 PM ET. A live webcast may be accessed from the "Events and Presentations" page at http://www.ethanallen.com/investors.

About Us

M. Farooq Kathwari, Chairman, President and CEO Ethan Allen Interiors Inc.

Maybe the reason people have been living with Ethan Allen for generations is because Ethan Allen is so easy to live with. Since 1932, we've specialized in creating icons of livable luxury. Those beautifully designed, beautifully crafted classics that become as much a part of your style as that little black dress or favorite pair of jeans.
Ethan Allen is much more than a retailer. We also design and build most of what we sell. This allows us to bring you styles you can’t find anywhere else, created with an uncompromised level of craftsmanship and at values that will constantly surprise you.
So welcome to an experience like no other. Here at EthanAllen.com, and at every Ethan Allen Design Center worldwide, you’ll discover an extensive array of exclusive and eclectic fashions for the home. Not to mention virtually endless ways to personalize your choices through fabrics, finishes, and trims, along with the priceless help of our professional designers, which of course, is always on the house.
