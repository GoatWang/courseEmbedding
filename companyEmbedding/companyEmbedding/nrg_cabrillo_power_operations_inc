Archive License Search

Use the Archives button (located on the ULS Home page) to link to the Archive License Search. The ULS License Archive Search enables you to search for prior versions of a license
      as well as the current version. Each time a license is acted upon, the current version is captured within ULS creating a "snapshot"
      history of the license and its modifications. Searching these archived versions allows you to see the exact status of a license
      at various points in time. The search interface uses the same display as ULS Advanced License Search and allows you to search
      on many of the same criteria.  Note: The ULS data warehouse stores archived licenses for radio services converted to ULS beginning
      in August 1999 or, if the service was converted to ULS after August 1999, from the date the service was converted. Licenses
      from previous wireless databases are not archived in the license warehouse.

Hearing Aid Compatibility Status Reporting

Under the FCC's rules, providers of digital mobile wireless services and manufacturers of wireless handsets must file annual
      reports on their offering of handsets that are compatible with hearing aids. These reports contain information about the hearing
      aid compatibility status of each handset offered, functionalities of hearing aid-compatible handsets, labeling of hearing
      aid-compatible handsets, and the filing company's consumer outreach efforts.
