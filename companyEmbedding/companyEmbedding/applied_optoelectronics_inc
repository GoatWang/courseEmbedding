Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.'s Best-Selling Product in 2017
AOI is making a mint in the data center right now.











                Anders Bylund
            

                (TMFZahrim)



            
            Jul 18, 2017 at 8:08PM
            
            





Optical-components maker Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI) recently announced preliminary results for the second quarter of 2017, and it was a doozy. From top-line revenues to bottom-line earnings, every metric came in above the top end of management's guidance targets, and AOI's share price rose as much as 10.1% the next day.
At this point, AOI investors have enjoyed market-stomping returns of 253% in 2017 and 600% over the last 52 weeks. These massive gains are based on unrelenting demand for AOI's data-center products, to the point where the company must continue to improve its manufacturing operations in order to exploit the huge customer interest.
Let's take a closer look at the data-center components behind Applied Optoelectronics' success in 2017.

Welcome to the data center
While waiting for the full second-quarter report, let me point out that data center sales accounted for 83% of AOI's sales in the first quarter, up from 77% in the year-ago period. In particular, leading customers Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) added up to 73% of the company's total sales in 2016, as their rapidly growing cloud-computing services require epic numbers of high-speed data-center networks.
Copper-based Ethernet cables are going out of style for these applications, because the data streams moving around modern data centers can overwhelm gigabit cables, and faster Ethernet solutions are limited by data loss over long cable runs. The top-shelf Cat 7 cables required for 10-gigabit Ethernet connections are only rated for up to 100 meters of cable length.





That's where AOI and its sector rivals step in with fiber-optic transceiver modules rated for speeds up to 100 gigabits per second -- with no practical limit on cable lengths in the confines of a data center. AOI's 40-gigabit (40G) and 100G modules for data-center applications are listed at maximum cable runs as long as 10 kilometers.

Optical transceiver modules
About two-thirds of AOI's data-center sales are for 40G optical transceivers; the remainder comes from 100G transceivers. The mix is changing as customers look into next-generation 100G networks, and AOI is already developing 200G and 400G transceivers for future use.
The basic design of these faster solutions is not changing. The popular QSFP package seen above combines a small physical footprint with low power consumption, allowing device builders and data-center operators to cram a lot of bandwidth into small spaces. Instead, the core research is going into developing faster laser diodes. Inside 40G modules there's a bundle of four 10-gigabit diodes; the diode speed steps up to 25G in a 100G module and 56 gigabits per second in the recently introduced 200G module.

Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.'s Best-Selling Product in 2017
AOI is making a mint in the data center right now.











                Anders Bylund
            

                (TMFZahrim)



            
            Jul 18, 2017 at 8:08PM
            
            





Optical-components maker Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI) recently announced preliminary results for the second quarter of 2017, and it was a doozy. From top-line revenues to bottom-line earnings, every metric came in above the top end of management's guidance targets, and AOI's share price rose as much as 10.1% the next day.
At this point, AOI investors have enjoyed market-stomping returns of 253% in 2017 and 600% over the last 52 weeks. These massive gains are based on unrelenting demand for AOI's data-center products, to the point where the company must continue to improve its manufacturing operations in order to exploit the huge customer interest.
Let's take a closer look at the data-center components behind Applied Optoelectronics' success in 2017.

Image source: Getty Images.

Welcome to the data center
While waiting for the full second-quarter report, let me point out that data center sales accounted for 83% of AOI's sales in the first quarter, up from 77% in the year-ago period. In particular, leading customers Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) added up to 73% of the company's total sales in 2016, as their rapidly growing cloud-computing services require epic numbers of high-speed data-center networks.
Copper-based Ethernet cables are going out of style for these applications, because the data streams moving around modern data centers can overwhelm gigabit cables, and faster Ethernet solutions are limited by data loss over long cable runs. The top-shelf Cat 7 cables required for 10-gigabit Ethernet connections are only rated for up to 100 meters of cable length.





That's where AOI and its sector rivals step in with fiber-optic transceiver modules rated for speeds up to 100 gigabits per second -- with no practical limit on cable lengths in the confines of a data center. AOI's 40-gigabit (40G) and 100G modules for data-center applications are listed at maximum cable runs as long as 10 kilometers.

Optical transceiver modules
About two-thirds of AOI's data-center sales are for 40G optical transceivers; the remainder comes from 100G transceivers. The mix is changing as customers look into next-generation 100G networks, and AOI is already developing 200G and 400G transceivers for future use.
The basic design of these faster solutions is not changing. The popular QSFP package seen above combines a small physical footprint with low power consumption, allowing device builders and data-center operators to cram a lot of bandwidth into small spaces. Instead, the core research is going into developing faster laser diodes. Inside 40G modules there's a bundle of four 10-gigabit diodes; the diode speed steps up to 25G in a 100G module and 56 gigabits per second in the recently introduced 200G module.

Bringing the World to Light
We are a leading provider of fiber‑optic networking products. We serve three growing end-markets: Cable Television Broadband (CATV), fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), and internet data centers (Data Center). We design and manufacture a range of optical communications products employing our vertical integration strategy from laser chips, components, subassemblies and modules to complete turn-key equipment. We design, manufacture and integrate our own analog and digital lasers using a proprietary Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) fabrication process, which we believe is unique in our industry. The lasers we manufacture are proven to be reliable over time and highly tolerant of changes in temperature and humidity (delivering millions of hours service), making them well-suited to the CATV and FTTH markets where networking equipment is often installed outdoors.
All three of our end markets are driven by bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network‑connected devices, that included video traffic, cloud computing and online social networking. To address this increased bandwidth demand, CATV and telecommunications service providers are competing directly against each other by providing bundles of voice, video and data services to their subscribers and investing to enhance the capacity, reliability and capability of their networks. The trend of rising bandwidth consumption also impacts the internet data center market, as reflected in the shift to higher speed server connections. As a result of these trends, fiber‑optic networking technology is becoming essential in all three of our target markets, as it is often the only economic way to deliver the desired bandwidth.

CATV - Broadband
Excellent linearity  •  Designed for RF modulation to 1000 MHz
RoHS compliant package  •  Fully GR-468 Telcordia compliant





The CATV market is our largest and most established market, for which we supply a broad array of products including lasers, transmitters and turn-key equipment. In 2012, we were the leading provider of optical components and the second largest provider of subsystems to the CATV industry, according to research firm Ovum Limited, or Ovum. Sales of headend, node and distribution equipment have contributed significantly to our growth in recent years as a result of our ability to meet the needs of CATV equipment vendors who have begun to outsource both the design and manufacture of this equipment. While equipment vendors have relied upon third parties to assemble portions of their products, within the past four years certain of our customers have accelerated the outsourcing of both the design and manufacturing of both headend equipment and node equipment to third parties. The shift is due in part to the sophisticated engineering expertise needed to perform this work. We believe that our extensive high-speed optical, mixed‑signal semiconductor and mechanical engineering capabilities position us well to benefit from these industry dynamics.

FTTH
Downstream/Upstream rates up to 2.5 Gbps  •  Wide operating temperature range
RoHS compliant package  •  Fully GR-468 Telcordia compliant





The FTTH market generally refers to the Passive Optical Networks, or PONs, that telecommunications service providers are deploying. PONs take their name from the use of passive splitters to divide the optical signal provided to each residential user over a shared fiber-optic cable from a service provider’s central office. The equipment in the service provider’s central office is called an optical line terminal, or OLT, and the equipment at the end user is an optical network unit, or ONU. A PON supports significantly greater bandwidth than does the legacy copper wire network, although the connection speed to a user (the “downstream” speed) is higher than the connection speed from the user (the “upstream” speed). In the U.S., Verizon’s FIOS service and AT&T’s uVerse offering are examples of PON deployments, and PONs have been widely deployed in Japan, Korea and selected cities in Europe as well. According to a 2013 Infonetics report, worldwide FTTH subscribers are expected to grow from 57 million in 2012 to 149 million in 2017, representing a CAGR of 21%, with the growth of higher speed FTTH connections among those subscribers being greater than the overall growth of FTTH connectivity.
Over time, the technology used in PONs has evolved to meet the increased bandwidth demand from users. At present, the most commonly deployed PON technology is GPON, or Gigabit PON, which delivers up to 2.5 gigabits per second of data downstream, split among subscribers, and 1.5 gigabits per second upstream. Due to the splitting of the bandwidth among multiple users—often as many as 32—the actual bandwidth delivered to an individual subscriber is far less than the 2.5 gigabits per second supported by the GPON equipment. To deliver more bandwidth to a subscriber, a service provider can reduce the split ratio or change the PON technology. Reducing the number of subscribers supported by a single OLT may be less expensive for modest, incremental upgrades, but may not be the most economical solution to deliver the significant increases in bandwidth needed to support 1 gigabit per second service to the home, as encouraged by the FCC’s Gigabit Challenge.
One approach that does support 1 gigabit per second service to the home connection is WDM-PON, or wavelength division multiplexing PON. Well-proven in other areas of the network for decades, WDM technology enables the transmission of multiple wavelengths of data over a single fiber-optic strand, thus significantly increasing the bandwidth of the physical fiber connection. Due to this significant increase in bandwidth supported with WDM-PON, the cost per bit delivered to a subscriber is lower than that for GPON—at faster connection speeds. In addition to providing more bandwidth, WDM-PON offers a subscriber superior privacy and the service provider better scalability because each subscriber has a dedicated wavelength rather than a shared one.

Telecom
SFP and SFP+ MSA Compliant  •  RoHS compliant





In contrast with transceivers used in data centers and datacom, which are typically designed for shorter reach applications, telecom transceivers are primarily designed for longer reach and often for broader operating temperatures for outdoor installation, and for other telecom-specific applications such as CPRI.
AOI's telecom product portfolio includes SFP and SFP+ MSA-compliant pluggable modules with data rates up to 10G and utilizing TDM, DWDM, and CWDM for use in transport and wireless backhaul in support of modern LTE wireless networks as well as fronthaul applications such as CPRI and OBSAI. AOI also offers pluggable modules and discrete componenets designed for legacy networks and applications including WCDMA and CDMA.

CATV - Broadband
Excellent linearity  •  Designed for RF modulation to 1000 MHz
RoHS compliant package  •  Fully GR-468 Telcordia compliant





The CATV market is our largest and most established market, for which we supply a broad array of products including lasers, transmitters and turn-key equipment. In 2012, we were the leading provider of optical components and the second largest provider of subsystems to the CATV industry, according to research firm Ovum Limited, or Ovum. Sales of headend, node and distribution equipment have contributed significantly to our growth in recent years as a result of our ability to meet the needs of CATV equipment vendors who have begun to outsource both the design and manufacture of this equipment. While equipment vendors have relied upon third parties to assemble portions of their products, within the past four years certain of our customers have accelerated the outsourcing of both the design and manufacturing of both headend equipment and node equipment to third parties. The shift is due in part to the sophisticated engineering expertise needed to perform this work. We believe that our extensive high-speed optical, mixed‑signal semiconductor and mechanical engineering capabilities position us well to benefit from these industry dynamics.

Data Center
Tranceivers  •  Transmitter Optical Sub-Assembly
Sub Assemblies





An internet data center is structured in a layered format, with rows of servers within multiple racks, and each server and rack connecting through a switch. These rack switches then connect to each other, and ultimately to the service provider’s network. The connections between these top-of-rack switches, and to the service provider’s network, are increasingly done with higher‑capacity optical networking technology. Legacy copper cables can carry signals at distances adequate to meet most needs within an enterprise or internet data center at speeds up to about 1 gigabit per second. However, at speeds of 10 gigabits per second and above, the signals sent over copper cables experience increasing attenuation and dispersion over distances common in large internet data center environments, making copper much less effective as a transmission medium. According to a 2013 Infonetics report, 10 gigabit ethernet enterprise port shipments in 2012 were 14.7 million and are projected to grow to 110.6 million in 2017, representing a 49.7% CAGR.
In recent years, a number of leading internet companies such as Amazon.com Inc., Facebook, Inc., Google Inc. and Microsoft Corporation have begun to adopt more open internet data center architectures, using a mix of systems and components from a variety of vendors, and in some cases designing their own equipment. For these companies, compatibility of new networking equipment with legacy infrastructure is not as important, and as a consequence, these companies are more willing to work with non‑traditional equipment vendors. Non‑traditional equipment vendors generally permit companies to source optical modules from any vendor, thus creating an open and growing opportunity for optical device vendors.

FTTH
Downstream/Upstream rates up to 2.5 Gbps  •  Wide operating temperature range
RoHS compliant package  •  Fully GR-468 Telcordia compliant





The FTTH market generally refers to the Passive Optical Networks, or PONs, that telecommunications service providers are deploying. PONs take their name from the use of passive splitters to divide the optical signal provided to each residential user over a shared fiber-optic cable from a service provider’s central office. The equipment in the service provider’s central office is called an optical line terminal, or OLT, and the equipment at the end user is an optical network unit, or ONU. A PON supports significantly greater bandwidth than does the legacy copper wire network, although the connection speed to a user (the “downstream” speed) is higher than the connection speed from the user (the “upstream” speed). In the U.S., Verizon’s FIOS service and AT&T’s uVerse offering are examples of PON deployments, and PONs have been widely deployed in Japan, Korea and selected cities in Europe as well. According to a 2013 Infonetics report, worldwide FTTH subscribers are expected to grow from 57 million in 2012 to 149 million in 2017, representing a CAGR of 21%, with the growth of higher speed FTTH connections among those subscribers being greater than the overall growth of FTTH connectivity.
Over time, the technology used in PONs has evolved to meet the increased bandwidth demand from users. At present, the most commonly deployed PON technology is GPON, or Gigabit PON, which delivers up to 2.5 gigabits per second of data downstream, split among subscribers, and 1.5 gigabits per second upstream. Due to the splitting of the bandwidth among multiple users—often as many as 32—the actual bandwidth delivered to an individual subscriber is far less than the 2.5 gigabits per second supported by the GPON equipment. To deliver more bandwidth to a subscriber, a service provider can reduce the split ratio or change the PON technology. Reducing the number of subscribers supported by a single OLT may be less expensive for modest, incremental upgrades, but may not be the most economical solution to deliver the significant increases in bandwidth needed to support 1 gigabit per second service to the home, as encouraged by the FCC’s Gigabit Challenge.
One approach that does support 1 gigabit per second service to the home connection is WDM-PON, or wavelength division multiplexing PON. Well-proven in other areas of the network for decades, WDM technology enables the transmission of multiple wavelengths of data over a single fiber-optic strand, thus significantly increasing the bandwidth of the physical fiber connection. Due to this significant increase in bandwidth supported with WDM-PON, the cost per bit delivered to a subscriber is lower than that for GPON—at faster connection speeds. In addition to providing more bandwidth, WDM-PON offers a subscriber superior privacy and the service provider better scalability because each subscriber has a dedicated wavelength rather than a shared one.

Telecom
SFP and SFP+ MSA Compliant  •  RoHS compliant





In contrast with transceivers used in data centers and datacom, which are typically designed for shorter reach applications, telecom transceivers are primarily designed for longer reach and often for broader operating temperatures for outdoor installation, and for other telecom-specific applications such as CPRI.
AOI's telecom product portfolio includes SFP and SFP+ MSA-compliant pluggable modules with data rates up to 10G and utilizing TDM, DWDM, and CWDM for use in transport and wireless backhaul in support of modern LTE wireless networks as well as fronthaul applications such as CPRI and OBSAI. AOI also offers pluggable modules and discrete componenets designed for legacy networks and applications including WCDMA and CDMA.

Bogle Investment Management LP

                                    Bogle Investment Management is an employee-owned investment boutique founded and SEC registered in 1999. The firm was established with the goal of adding value for a select group of institutional clients by identifying and exploiting innovative investment ideas across global markets. Today, the firm manages absolute return and small cap long-only investment strategies for some of the world’s most sophisticated investors. As co-investors with our clients, we are mindful of capacity constraints and have a demonstrated record of closing strategies at conservative levels of capital.

Our absolute return strategies aim to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns that are uncorrelated with both traditional and alternative investments.  Our US small cap strategy seeks to outperform the Russell 2000 Index of small cap stocks.

Through proprietary research we identify investor behaviors that cause stock prices to decouple from business fundamentals.  We believe that lasting insights can be gleaned through a deep understanding of the mosaic of motivations, incentives, and human biases that give rise to inefficiencies in global markets.  By combining these fundamentally-based insights in a systematic way and taking risks only when we are confident in our informational advantage, we seek to earn attractive risk-adjusted returns in most market environments.

                                        At Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) customers come first and an integral part of our DNA is creating long-lasting customer partnerships and working with them to identify their needs and provide solutions that support their success.

The concept of solutions being driven to address specific customer challenges has been with Cisco since its inception. Husband and wife Len Bosack and Sandy Lerner, both working for Stanford University, wanted to email each other from their respective offices located in different buildings but were unable to due to technological shortcomings. A technology had to be invented to deal with disparate local area protocols; and as a result of solving their challenge - the multi-protocol router was born.

Since then Cisco has shaped the future of the Internet by creating unprecedented value and opportunity for our customers, employees, investors and ecosystem partners and has become the worldwide leader in networking - transforming how people connect, communicate and collaborate.

Bringing the World to Light
We are a leading provider of fiber‑optic networking products. We serve three growing end-markets: Cable Television Broadband (CATV), fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), and internet data centers (Data Center). We design and manufacture a range of optical communications products employing our vertical integration strategy from laser chips, components, subassemblies and modules to complete turn-key equipment. We design, manufacture and integrate our own analog and digital lasers using a proprietary Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) fabrication process, which we believe is unique in our industry. The lasers we manufacture are proven to be reliable over time and highly tolerant of changes in temperature and humidity (delivering millions of hours service), making them well-suited to the CATV and FTTH markets where networking equipment is often installed outdoors.
All three of our end markets are driven by bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network‑connected devices, that included video traffic, cloud computing and online social networking. To address this increased bandwidth demand, CATV and telecommunications service providers are competing directly against each other by providing bundles of voice, video and data services to their subscribers and investing to enhance the capacity, reliability and capability of their networks. The trend of rising bandwidth consumption also impacts the internet data center market, as reflected in the shift to higher speed server connections. As a result of these trends, fiber‑optic networking technology is becoming essential in all three of our target markets, as it is often the only economic way to deliver the desired bandwidth.

CATV - Broadband
Excellent linearity  •  Designed for RF modulation to 1000 MHz
RoHS compliant package  •  Fully GR-468 Telcordia compliant





The CATV market is our largest and most established market, for which we supply a broad array of products including lasers, transmitters and turn-key equipment. In 2012, we were the leading provider of optical components and the second largest provider of subsystems to the CATV industry, according to research firm Ovum Limited, or Ovum. Sales of headend, node and distribution equipment have contributed significantly to our growth in recent years as a result of our ability to meet the needs of CATV equipment vendors who have begun to outsource both the design and manufacture of this equipment. While equipment vendors have relied upon third parties to assemble portions of their products, within the past four years certain of our customers have accelerated the outsourcing of both the design and manufacturing of both headend equipment and node equipment to third parties. The shift is due in part to the sophisticated engineering expertise needed to perform this work. We believe that our extensive high-speed optical, mixed‑signal semiconductor and mechanical engineering capabilities position us well to benefit from these industry dynamics.

FTTH
Downstream/Upstream rates up to 2.5 Gbps  •  Wide operating temperature range
RoHS compliant package  •  Fully GR-468 Telcordia compliant





The FTTH market generally refers to the Passive Optical Networks, or PONs, that telecommunications service providers are deploying. PONs take their name from the use of passive splitters to divide the optical signal provided to each residential user over a shared fiber-optic cable from a service provider’s central office. The equipment in the service provider’s central office is called an optical line terminal, or OLT, and the equipment at the end user is an optical network unit, or ONU. A PON supports significantly greater bandwidth than does the legacy copper wire network, although the connection speed to a user (the “downstream” speed) is higher than the connection speed from the user (the “upstream” speed). In the U.S., Verizon’s FIOS service and AT&T’s uVerse offering are examples of PON deployments, and PONs have been widely deployed in Japan, Korea and selected cities in Europe as well. According to a 2013 Infonetics report, worldwide FTTH subscribers are expected to grow from 57 million in 2012 to 149 million in 2017, representing a CAGR of 21%, with the growth of higher speed FTTH connections among those subscribers being greater than the overall growth of FTTH connectivity.
Over time, the technology used in PONs has evolved to meet the increased bandwidth demand from users. At present, the most commonly deployed PON technology is GPON, or Gigabit PON, which delivers up to 2.5 gigabits per second of data downstream, split among subscribers, and 1.5 gigabits per second upstream. Due to the splitting of the bandwidth among multiple users—often as many as 32—the actual bandwidth delivered to an individual subscriber is far less than the 2.5 gigabits per second supported by the GPON equipment. To deliver more bandwidth to a subscriber, a service provider can reduce the split ratio or change the PON technology. Reducing the number of subscribers supported by a single OLT may be less expensive for modest, incremental upgrades, but may not be the most economical solution to deliver the significant increases in bandwidth needed to support 1 gigabit per second service to the home, as encouraged by the FCC’s Gigabit Challenge.
One approach that does support 1 gigabit per second service to the home connection is WDM-PON, or wavelength division multiplexing PON. Well-proven in other areas of the network for decades, WDM technology enables the transmission of multiple wavelengths of data over a single fiber-optic strand, thus significantly increasing the bandwidth of the physical fiber connection. Due to this significant increase in bandwidth supported with WDM-PON, the cost per bit delivered to a subscriber is lower than that for GPON—at faster connection speeds. In addition to providing more bandwidth, WDM-PON offers a subscriber superior privacy and the service provider better scalability because each subscriber has a dedicated wavelength rather than a shared one.

Telecom
SFP and SFP+ MSA Compliant  •  RoHS compliant





In contrast with transceivers used in data centers and datacom, which are typically designed for shorter reach applications, telecom transceivers are primarily designed for longer reach and often for broader operating temperatures for outdoor installation, and for other telecom-specific applications such as CPRI.
AOI's telecom product portfolio includes SFP and SFP+ MSA-compliant pluggable modules with data rates up to 10G and utilizing TDM, DWDM, and CWDM for use in transport and wireless backhaul in support of modern LTE wireless networks as well as fronthaul applications such as CPRI and OBSAI. AOI also offers pluggable modules and discrete componenets designed for legacy networks and applications including WCDMA and CDMA.
