How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Frazier Larry D carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Frazier Larry D



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Obituary for Larry D. Frazier
 Edit

Larry aka Papa, Fuzz, Whitey, and Dad, was born on Friday December 27, 1935. When Papa came home from the hospital and Grandpa Arthur Frazier asked what his siblings wanted to call him, his sister Betty popped up and said "Johnny Jump Up" Papa went to be with his savior, dance and sing with his love, Delores Jean (Poorman) Frazier, on July 16, 2017 at Northern Colorado Medical Center in Greeley, CO.
He suffered a short battle with lung and liver cancer surrounded by his adoring family. Larry was born in Colorado General Hospital in Denver, CO to Arthur and Freida Frazier from south of Strasburg, CO. On July 5, 1958 Larry married his sweetheart Delores at the courthouse in Hugo, CO. They were parted by God's master plan when Delores passed away on May 6, 2009.
A few years later, Larry met Betty Weidenkeller who was his love until June 16, 2017 when the Lord took her home also. Larry was preceded in death by his parents and brothers Don and Roland, Sisters Annabelle, Marvis. He is survived by his sons, Martin "Marty" Frazier (Barbara Harrison), Randy Frazier, sisters Norma Nabors of Mesa, AZ, and Betty Ramey of Sterling, CO, two grandsons, Riley Frazier-Kelley (Brittany Hood), Karson Frazier, and granddaughter Kylee Frazier, great grandchildren Hailey Jo and Riley Janae.
He is survived by numerous nieces and nephews and many loving friends. Larry served the United States Army twice once during the Korean War (1960), stationed in Ft. Leonardwood, MO and the second tour at the beginning of Vietnam (1962), stationed in Ft. Carson in Colorado Springs, CO. At his honorable discharge he ranked SP 4 as a firefighter.
He came home to farm for his mother when he lost his father in 1962. He farmed and worked a day job until the Frazier farm was sold in 1991. He worked for Elbert County Roads, Nichols Tillage Tools and Gilson Paving. Larry was a jack of all trades and a master of none. After the farm was sold he went to work for Rip Griffins in Limon, CO as a custodian where he retired in 1997.
Larry was a lifetime American Legion member. He was very patriotic, loved children, thoroughly enjoyed travelling and playing music. Wahoo was a paramount theme in his life and he loved teaching anyone he could to play. Much teasing and competition could be observed watching he and other Frazier family members play at the table.
Larry played football for Simla High School and also in Korea with the Army. Larry had the gift of gab and thought everyone had a story to tell and he wanted to hear it and tell his right back. The Funeral Service will be held Thursday, July 27, 2017 at 2:30pm, with visitation one hour prior, at Two Rivers Fellowship Church, 2424 23rd Avenue in Greeley.
