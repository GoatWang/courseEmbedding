“This award is one way the Lennox Hearth Products team lets us know how much they appreciate our confidence in their products and company.

About







In 1948, Nelson E. Keller founded Gas & Electrical Equipment Company shortly after World War Two. His goal was the establishment of a full service distribution company centrally located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to serve retail dealers and contractors.
From the early days of electrical supplies and water heaters, the company evolved into a full-line distributor of major appliances, electronics and stoves and fireplaces.
Following the retirement of Nelson, his son Edward became President and he has continued to build upon the foundation his father laid. He now oversees a territory that includes Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. Mickie Keller Garcia and Brian Keller, both company Vice-presidents continue the family traditions as third generation members of the organization.
From a small, struggling operation in 1948, Gas & Electrical Equipment Company has become one of the premier wholesalers in the Central United States with dedicated and talented employees being our greatest asset. They are always ready to take the extra step to keep our customers satisfied.
Change is inevitable but our commitment to quality service and to strong supplier, customer and employee relationships has not and will not ever waiver.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 06/20/1930
            

                BBB has determined that Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

OG&E[edit]
OG&E Electric Services serves more than 801,000 customers in Oklahoma and western Arkansas,[3] and a number of wholesale customers throughout the region. OG&E, with nine power plants capable of producing about 6,100 megawatts, generates about 70% of its electricity from low-sulfur Wyoming coal and 30 percent from natural gas.
OG&E also has roughly 170 megawatts of wind power. Under the plan announced on October 29, 2007, President and CEO Peter Delaney announced that wind power could be increased to about 770 MW.[4]
OG&E is the largest electric utility in the state of Oklahoma.[4] The company delivers all of its electricity across an interconnected transmission and distribution system spanning 30,000 square miles (78,000 km2).
OG&E was the first electric company in Oklahoma to offer wind power as a choice to its retail customers in 2003.[5] If one selects "wind power," he gets the same electricity he was getting before, but pays a higher price for it.
In December 2016, OG&E announced that it gave out $7.5 million in "energy efficiency incentives to businesses, schools and government buildings in 2016."[6] A total of 750 organizations benefited from the project. Secondary schools received around $650,000; universities received around $365,000. In one school district, 1 million kWh were cut down through energy-saving projects.[6]
Enogex[edit]
Enogex is engaged in natural gas gathering, processing, transportation, storage and marketing. Enogex operates a natural gas pipeline system with about 8,000 miles (13,000 km) of pipe, six processing plants, and 23 billion cubic feet (650×10^6 m3) of gas storage capacity, principally in Oklahoma. In 2013, it was decided that Enogex would be merged with a portion of CenterPoint Energy's operations in a limited partnership to be called Enable Midstream Partners.[7]
OGE Energy Resources[edit]
OGE Energy Resources conducts the company's energy marketing and related activities. Operating in the national commodities markets for electricity and natural gas, Energy Resources' primary role is to optimize the generation, transmission and pipeline assets of OGE Energy.

OG&E[edit]
OG&E Electric Services serves more than 801,000 customers in Oklahoma and western Arkansas,[3] and a number of wholesale customers throughout the region. OG&E, with nine power plants capable of producing about 6,100 megawatts, generates about 70% of its electricity from low-sulfur Wyoming coal and 30 percent from natural gas.
OG&E also has roughly 170 megawatts of wind power. Under the plan announced on October 29, 2007, President and CEO Peter Delaney announced that wind power could be increased to about 770 MW.[4]
OG&E is the largest electric utility in the state of Oklahoma.[4] The company delivers all of its electricity across an interconnected transmission and distribution system spanning 30,000 square miles (78,000 km2).
OG&E was the first electric company in Oklahoma to offer wind power as a choice to its retail customers in 2003.[5] If one selects "wind power," he gets the same electricity he was getting before, but pays a higher price for it.
In December 2016, OG&E announced that it gave out $7.5 million in "energy efficiency incentives to businesses, schools and government buildings in 2016."[6] A total of 750 organizations benefited from the project. Secondary schools received around $650,000; universities received around $365,000. In one school district, 1 million kWh were cut down through energy-saving projects.[6]
Enogex[edit]
Enogex is engaged in natural gas gathering, processing, transportation, storage and marketing. Enogex operates a natural gas pipeline system with about 8,000 miles (13,000 km) of pipe, six processing plants, and 23 billion cubic feet (650×10^6 m3) of gas storage capacity, principally in Oklahoma. In 2013, it was decided that Enogex would be merged with a portion of CenterPoint Energy's operations in a limited partnership to be called Enable Midstream Partners.[7]
OGE Energy Resources[edit]
OGE Energy Resources conducts the company's energy marketing and related activities. Operating in the national commodities markets for electricity and natural gas, Energy Resources' primary role is to optimize the generation, transmission and pipeline assets of OGE Energy.

OG&E[edit]
OG&E Electric Services serves more than 801,000 customers in Oklahoma and western Arkansas,[3] and a number of wholesale customers throughout the region. OG&E, with nine power plants capable of producing about 6,100 megawatts, generates about 70% of its electricity from low-sulfur Wyoming coal and 30 percent from natural gas.
OG&E also has roughly 170 megawatts of wind power. Under the plan announced on October 29, 2007, President and CEO Peter Delaney announced that wind power could be increased to about 770 MW.[4]
OG&E is the largest electric utility in the state of Oklahoma.[4] The company delivers all of its electricity across an interconnected transmission and distribution system spanning 30,000 square miles (78,000 km2).
OG&E was the first electric company in Oklahoma to offer wind power as a choice to its retail customers in 2003.[5] If one selects "wind power," he gets the same electricity he was getting before, but pays a higher price for it.
In December 2016, OG&E announced that it gave out $7.5 million in "energy efficiency incentives to businesses, schools and government buildings in 2016."[6] A total of 750 organizations benefited from the project. Secondary schools received around $650,000; universities received around $365,000. In one school district, 1 million kWh were cut down through energy-saving projects.[6]
Enogex[edit]
Enogex is engaged in natural gas gathering, processing, transportation, storage and marketing. Enogex operates a natural gas pipeline system with about 8,000 miles (13,000 km) of pipe, six processing plants, and 23 billion cubic feet (650×10^6 m3) of gas storage capacity, principally in Oklahoma. In 2013, it was decided that Enogex would be merged with a portion of CenterPoint Energy's operations in a limited partnership to be called Enable Midstream Partners.[7]
OGE Energy Resources[edit]
OGE Energy Resources conducts the company's energy marketing and related activities. Operating in the national commodities markets for electricity and natural gas, Energy Resources' primary role is to optimize the generation, transmission and pipeline assets of OGE Energy.

Oklahoma Gas & Electric (OG+E) is a regulated electric utility company that serves over 750,000 customers in Oklahoma and western Arkansas.
OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE: OGE), with headquarters in downtown Oklahoma City, is the parent company of Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company, a regulated electric utility, and Enogex Inc., a natural gas pipeline business. OGE Energy and its subsidiaries have about 3,100 employees.

OG&E[edit]
OG&E Electric Services serves more than 801,000 customers in Oklahoma and western Arkansas,[3] and a number of wholesale customers throughout the region. OG&E, with nine power plants capable of producing about 6,100 megawatts, generates about 70% of its electricity from low-sulfur Wyoming coal and 30 percent from natural gas.
OG&E also has roughly 170 megawatts of wind power. Under the plan announced on October 29, 2007, President and CEO Peter Delaney announced that wind power could be increased to about 770 MW.[4]
OG&E is the largest electric utility in the state of Oklahoma.[4] The company delivers all of its electricity across an interconnected transmission and distribution system spanning 30,000 square miles (78,000 km2).
OG&E was the first electric company in Oklahoma to offer wind power as a choice to its retail customers in 2003.[5] If one selects "wind power," he gets the same electricity he was getting before, but pays a higher price for it.
In December 2016, OG&E announced that it gave out $7.5 million in "energy efficiency incentives to businesses, schools and government buildings in 2016."[6] A total of 750 organizations benefited from the project. Secondary schools received around $650,000; universities received around $365,000. In one school district, 1 million kWh were cut down through energy-saving projects.[6]
Enogex[edit]
Enogex is engaged in natural gas gathering, processing, transportation, storage and marketing. Enogex operates a natural gas pipeline system with about 8,000 miles (13,000 km) of pipe, six processing plants, and 23 billion cubic feet (650×10^6 m3) of gas storage capacity, principally in Oklahoma. In 2013, it was decided that Enogex would be merged with a portion of CenterPoint Energy's operations in a limited partnership to be called Enable Midstream Partners.[7]
OGE Energy Resources[edit]
OGE Energy Resources conducts the company's energy marketing and related activities. Operating in the national commodities markets for electricity and natural gas, Energy Resources' primary role is to optimize the generation, transmission and pipeline assets of OGE Energy.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
