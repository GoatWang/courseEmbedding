 Seeking Inflection Points: My new role at Intel

	Posted 	on November 23, 2015 


Starting tomorrow I will be taking on the position of¬†‚ÄúInventor Platform Manager, Strategic Partners‚Äù at Intel‚Äôs New Technology Group (focusing on Makers and Innovators). In this role, I will be working with a broad ecosystem of cloud partners (Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Google etc), developers, makers and hardware¬†accelerators to increase the usability and adoption of Intel‚Äôs maker products such as Intel Edison, Intel Curie, the Arduino 101 (and future devices).
Looking forward to meeting the next generation of makers, couldn‚Äôt be more excited to be in this role within Intel at this time.

 Is Ubertesters A TestFlight Killer?

	Posted 	on February 11, 2014 


I have been using TestFlight as my primary testing service across multiple client mobile projects for both Android and iOS for the last two years.¬†After running across Ubertesters, an Israel-based mobile applications testing startup while at AppWorld in San Francisco last week, TestFlight may longer be my ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù app testing service of choice.¬†
Read on to learn why you may want to make the switch to Ubertesters.com yourself.
Note: I am still in the process of testing Ubertesters myself and will follow up with more edits when I am finished.

 Software is eating the world, and mobile software is eating software

	Posted 	on June 5, 2013 

Mark Andreeson wrote a famous column titled ‚ÄúSoftware is eating the world‚Äù which cautioned strongly that high tech has grown into an unstoppable, job destroying, disruptive machine. His overriding message is simple: If what you are doing can be automated by software, you had better start strapping on a life jacket because you are going in the water and the water is cold.
Of all of that disruptive software, mobile is, by far, the fastest growing segment‚Ä¶mobile is growing 12x faster than the original Internet and that growth is accelerating on an exponential curve. In short, if what you are doing can be done by mobile software, strap on the life jacket because you are going in the water and the water is cold.
Mobile is hard‚Ä¶incredibly hard and not for reasons of complexity, but for reasons of simplicity. Most corporations are incapable of cutting back on features as a result of group think and product management creep‚Ä¶mobile devices are tiny and space is limited so cuts are required.
As a result, many corporations will not survive the mobile shift.
Mobile is about doing fewer things, personalization, limited data entry and timely, smart data which you don‚Äôt even have to go digging for. Mobile knows what you want and gives it to you automatically because searching for data on a tiny screen is painful for end users.
Every enterprise software space will be impacted by mobile‚Ä¶if that software is not altogether supplanted by mobile, users will almost certainly expect lighter weight mobile versions of that same software.
In short: The clue phone is ringing off the hook with regards to mobile.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.‚Ä¶ read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.
