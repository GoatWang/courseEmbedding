Joseph L. Welch
 Joseph L. Welch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for the strategic vision and overall business operation of ITC Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries. Under Mr. Welch’s leadership, ITC and its subsidiaries have been singularly focused on investing in the high-voltage transmission system in order to provide best-in-class service to customers, and pursuing transmission infrastructure improvements that will increase reliability, reduce constraints and lower the total cost of delivered energy. Mr. Welch is a leading voice in energy policy development that will support an evolving energy future and national economic development. Since the beginning of his career in the utility business in 1971, Mr. Welch has held positions of increasing responsibility in the electricity transmission, distribution, rates, load research, marketing, pricing, and regulatory affairs that included the development and implementation of regulatory strategies. He established ITCTransmission as a standalone entity from its parent corporation in 2003 in Michigan, and as the largest fully independent transmission company in America, ITC and its subsidiaries now span across a seven-state region. Mr. Welch has a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Kansas and is a licensed professional engineer in the state of Michigan.
