Tech 50

From Google to GrubHub: This Tech 50 standout builds brands and audiences




In this weeklong series, Crain's is profiling Chicago's top tech talent, the people you might not know yet but should. Other standouts featured this week include Jason Resch of Cleversafe, Jessie "Chuy" Chavez of Google, Lucianne Walkowicz of Adler Planetarium and Rob Chesney of Trunk Club.  Click here for the full 2015 list of Chicago's TECH 50.

Barbara Martin Coppola created quite a buzz when she left Google earlier this year to join local restaurant ordering service GrubHub as chief marketing officer. That's because not many experienced tech executives leave Silicon Valley for Chicago. But it appealed to the 38-year-old, who had spent several years living in Paris and “missed the city life.”“I was in Chicago two years ago on vacation and loved the vibe,” she says. “There is a lot of tech activity here.”Another plus: direct flights to Madrid, her hometown.There was plenty that appealed to her professionally, too. An engineer by training, Coppola worked for Texas Instruments in the U.S. and Japan and for Samsung in South Korea before joining Google in France. She later moved to California, where she worked on Chromecast and YouTube.Most recently, Coppola led marketing for Google Express, the search-engine giant's same-day delivery service. “She led product marketing for really important, high-profile products for the company,” says Jenna Owens, general manager of Google Express. “Creating awareness is hard. She came up with a ton of different, creative ways of getting people to understand what we were doing, be curious and try it online.”Her experience in building brands and audiences—before Google, she helped Samsung reconnect with younger customers—makes her a crucial add to GrubHub, which is looking to capture the 95 percent of restaurants that still take orders on paper. It's also experimenting with making its own deliveries. “We can have a massive impact,” Coppola says of GrubHub. “It's convenient; it works; it's efficient. It improves people's lives. It's extremely interesting from a marketing perspective.”Tool she can't live without: Chromecast. “When I want to watch something on TV—I can check my email and watch TV. It's the reality of how some evenings are spent.”
