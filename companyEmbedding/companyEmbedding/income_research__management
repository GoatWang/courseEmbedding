IR+M was formed as a privately owned investment management firm in 1987, specializing in managing US fixed income portfolios for institutional and private clients. The firm has been led by the same team of seasoned professionals since its inception. Our commitment to independence allows us to stay true to our investment philosophy, continuously improve our methods, bolster our talent, and adapt to the needs of our clients. We strive to deliver exceptional service to our clients and a rewarding experience for our employees. In return, we have enjoyed steady growth, employee dedication, and client satisfaction over many market cycles.

Today, we are still a private, employee-owned company whose core values have remained unchanged despite our growth in both employees and assets under management:

•	Our clients always come first
•	We foster an open office, team environment
•	We care about our colleagues

IR+M was built on the premise that if you foster a culture of collaboration, stay true to a disciplined investment process, remain diligent about security selection, and act in the best interests of your clients, everyone will benefit.

Our CREED
•	Collaboration – Work together to achieve the best possible outcome for our clients and IR+M
•	Respect – Display personal integrity and treat others as you would like to be treated
•	Excellence – Set high standards and consistently deliver your best work
•	Engagement – Bring commitment and accountability to your work
•	Diligence – Perform with thoughtfulness, perseverance, and dedication
