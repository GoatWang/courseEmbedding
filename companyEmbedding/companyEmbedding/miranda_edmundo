At Walmart, it's easy to find your favorite artists and albums, while discovering new ones, too. Shop some of the most popular categories like pop, rock, country, rap/hip-hop, R&B/soul and Christian/gospel. There s also dance and deejay music, Latin, classical, jazz, blues, movie soundtracks, even music DVDs and more. It s a seemingly endless collection of the best hits   from yesterday and today. Choosing your music Browse through the latest releases and preorder albums that are coming soon. You can also check out the list of current best sellers in any category or sort them by customer rating to see what s most popular with other music fans. There are even can t-miss deals that let you get more music for less money by finding older releases from your favorite artists at discount prices. Music for kids And don t forget the youngsters in your life. If you re searching for music for the kids to listen to   whether you re at home or on a road trip   choose from a wide variety of children's tunes. Singalong songs will keep your child occupied for hours while toddlers will be entertained with timeless classics that never fade. You ll enjoy sharing songs like  The Wheels on the Bus,   Mary Had a Little Lamb  and  I m a Little Teapot.  Wanna get moving? Look through the selection of dance recordings and rock to the beat. Celebrate with karaoke If you have a fun event coming up, check out the karaoke music selections, a perfect complement to parties and family gatherings if there ever was one. Try some country music, pop music, relive the music from the 80s and much more. Whatever the musical preference, there s a karaoke party waiting for you. Records and turntables Still got a thing for vinyl? It s OK. We get that. Satisfy that old-school itch and shop for records in a variety of categories or choose a bundled collection from select popular artists, both old and new. Then spin those RPMs just like you used to because some things should never go out of style. If you should need a record player to go with that vinyl, you can combine old and new technologies with a turntable that includes: an AM/FM radioa cassette playera CD player USB and Bluetooth technology An added USB connection let s you convert vinyl to digital media or Bluetooth technology will let you stream music from other, more modern devices   all with precisely the style you're going for. Throw it back with a vintage record player look or grab a unit that mimics the turntables in a trendy club. Mobile music Of course, you can also take the more modern-day approach and listen to your music on any mobile device, including iPads and tablets. Save the storage space around your house or in your car and go digital. A 16-gigabyte device can hold roughly 3,500 songs. That s a lot of music to listen to   conveniently. And if you want to bump it up to 64 gigs, you re looking at 15,000 songs. Now that s an impressive music collection. Give the gift of music Music makes a fantastic gift any time of the year, so consider making a wish list of albums you'd love and encouraging your family and friends to do the same. Or, simply give them an electronic gift card. iTunes e-gifts are incredibly thoughtful and handy and come in a variety of denominations, from $10 to $100. These unique codes are provided via email and are perfect for anyone who likes apps, games, music, movies, television shows, books and more. They can be used in the App Store, or with iTunes, iBooks   even toward an Apple Music membership, if desired. Google Play gift codes also provide access to the latest entertainment   whether it s music, movies, TV, books, magazines, apps or games. Let that special someone enjoy their favorite songs, flicks and more on any sized screen across Android, iOS and the web. There s also a Microsoft Groove Music pass, which provides instant access to millions of songs. Your music, your way With so many options, it has never been easier to listen to your favorite music. And with Walmart's Every Day low prices, there's no reason not to expand your music library and add to your loved one s collection, too. Save Money.
