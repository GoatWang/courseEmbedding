Its products and services include Sports Medicine Joint Repair, Arthroscopic Enabling Technologies, Trauma & Extremities, Other Surgical Businesses, Knee Implants, Hip Implants, Advanced Wound Care, Advanced Wound Bioactives and Advanced Wound Devices.Sports Medicine Joint RepairThe Company's Sports Medicine Joint Repair franchise offers surgeons a range of instruments, technologies and implants necessary to perform minimally invasive surgery of the joints, including the repair of soft tissue injuries and degenerative conditions of the knee, hip and shoulder. Its products include the FAST-FIX family of meniscal repair systems, the ENDOBUTTON family for knee ligament reconstruction, HEALICOIL PK, FOOTPRINT PK and TWINFIX Suture anchors for repairs of the hip and rotator cuff.Arthroscopic Enabling TechnologiesThe Company's Arthroscopic Enabling Technologies franchise offers an array of minimally invasive surgery-enabling systems and devices. The Company offers healthcare providers a range of technologies, such as fluid management equipment for surgical access, high definition cameras, digital image capture, scopes, light sources and monitors to assist with visualization inside the joints, radio frequency wands, electromechanical and mechanical blades, and hand instruments for removing damaged tissue. Its products include the LENS Integrated system, which provides an integrated three-in-one design incorporating the Console, Camera Head and iPad application. Also, WEREWOLF and Quantum 2 COBLATION controllers and a range of high performance COBLATION Technology radio frequency (RF) wands ablate, resect and coagulate soft tissue and enable hemostasis of blood vessels.Trauma & ExtremitiesThe Company's Trauma & Extremities franchise supports healthcare professionals with solutions used by surgeons to stabilize severe fractures, correct bone deformities, treat arthritis and heal soft tissue complications. For extremities and limb restoration, the Company offers the TAYLOR SPATIAL FRAME Circular Fixation System, as well as a range of plates, screws, arthroscopes, instrumentation, resection and suture anchor products for orthopedic surgeons, including foot and ankle, and hand and wrist specialists, and trauma surgeons. For Trauma, the principal internal fixation products include the TRIGEN family of IM nails (TRIGEN META-NAIL System, TRIGEN Humeral Nail System, TRIGEN SURESHOT and TRIGEN INTERTAN), EVOS Plating System and the PERI-LOC Plating System.Other Surgical BusinessesThe Company's Other Surgical Businesses include gynecological instrumentation, as well as various products and technologies to assist in surgical treatment of the ear, nose and throat (ENT). Its primary Gynaecology product is the TRUCLEAR System, a hysteroscopic tissue removal system, providing safe removal of intra-uterine tissue. Within ENT, the Company offers a range of products, including its COBLATION Technology for tissue removal and hemostasis, various articulating instruments and implants for sinus surgery, such as balloon sinuplasty, and RAPIDRHINO Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) Technology, which is featured in both dissolvable and removable nasal and sinus dressings, and epistaxis treatment products.Knee ImplantsThe Company offers a range of products for specialized knee replacement procedures. Knee replacement surgery involves replacing the worn, damaged or diseased portion of a knee with an artificial joint. The Company's knee systems include the LEGION/GENESIS II Total Knee System, a system designed to allow surgeons to address a range of knee procedures from primary to revision and JOURNEY II Family of Active Knees. JOURNEY II delivers function, motion and durability through PHYSIOLOGICAL MATCHING. These systems also feature VERILAST Technology, the Company's advanced bearing surface. The Company's knee systems also utilize VISIONAIRE Patient-Matched Instrumentation. With VISIONAIRE Instrumentation, a patient's magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-rays are used to create customized cutting guides that allow the surgeon to achieve mechanical axis alignment of the new implant.Hip ImplantsThe Company's Hip Implant franchise offers a range of specialist products for reconstruction of the hip joint. It is necessary due to conditions, such as arthritis, causing persistent pain, and/or as a result of hip fracture. Its core systems include the ANTHOLOGY Hip System, SYNERGY Hip System, the SMF Femoral Hip System, POLARSTEM Femoral Hip System, the R3 Acetabular System and the POLARCUP Dual Mobility Hip System. The Company's portfolio includes the REDAPT Revision Femoral System. The need to perform a revision can occur for a range of reasons, including infection, dislocation, or failure of the implants to achieve biologic fixation. REDAPT turns such hip revisions into reproducible surgeries, allowing surgeons to recreate a patient's unique functionality.Advanced Wound CareThe Company offers products for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds, including leg, diabetic and pressure ulcers, burns and post-operative wounds. The Advanced Wound Care franchise consists of several groups of brands, including exudate management, infection management and Cornerstone range of products.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1856 by Thomas James Smith of Kingston upon Hull who went into business as a dispensing chemist.[4] A few months before his death in 1896, Smith was joined by his nephew, Horatio Nelson Smith, and the business became known as T. J. Smith and Nephew.[4]
In 1928 the company acquired the licence to market and produce the Elastoplast range of bandages. By 1977 the company acquired the pump manufacturer Watson-Marlow Pumps, before selling it to Spirax-Sarco Engineering in 1990.[5] In 1986 it went on to acquire Richards Medical Company, a US specialist in orthopaedic products for £201 million.[4]
In 2002 the company acquired Oratec Interventions, a surgical devices business, for $310 million.[6] It went on to buy Midland Medical Technologies, a hip resurfacing business, for £67 million in 2004.[7]
The company acquired Plus Orthopedics, a Swiss orthopedics business, for US$889 million in April 2007[8] and BlueSky, a US wound care business, for $110 million in May 2007.[9]
In September 2007 Biomet Inc., DePuy Orthopaedics Inc. (part of Johnson & Johnson), Smith & Nephew PLC and Zimmer Holdings Inc. entered into settlement agreements, under which they agree to pay $300 million in total, adopt industry overhauls and undertake corporate monitoring to avoid criminal charges of conspiracy.[10]
The company acquired Healthpoint Biotherapeutics, a specialist in the bioactives area of advanced wound management, for $782 million in December 2012.[11]
In February 2014, Smith & Nephew announced the purchase of ArthroCare for US$1.7 billion in cash. This was seen as a move to broaden the company's sports medicine range for minimally invasive surgery moves the company into the Ear, Nose & Throat market.[12]

Its U.S. subsidiary Smith & Nephew Inc. paid a $16.8 million criminal fine.[15] The company admitted to having bribed government-employed doctors in Greece to use its medical equipment over the past decade.[16] The company has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and has agreed to retain a compliance monitor for 18 months.[17]

Smith & Nephew profit rises; on track for targets
LONDON--Smith & Nephew PLC (SN.LN) said Thursday it is on track to achieve its 2017 growth target as it reported a 17% rise in half year pretax profit. The medical technology company's pretax profit during the half year to July 1 rose to $383 million from $327 million a year earlier. Revenue was little changed over the period at $2.34 billion compared with $2.33 billion.

Smith & Nephew revenue unchanged
LONDON--Smith & Nephew PLC (SN.LN) reported Friday a flat revenue of $1.14 billion, impacted by its Gynaecology business disposal and currency headwinds, but backed its full-year guidance. The company's revenue, however, was strongly supported by the emerging markets, which returned to double digit growth, it said.

LONDON--Smith & Nephew PLC (SN.LN) said Thursday it is on track to achieve its 2017 growth target as it reported a 17% rise in half year pretax profit. The medical technology company's pretax profit during the half year to July 1 rose to $383 million from $327 million a year earlier. Revenue was little changed over the period at $2.34 billion compared with $2.33 billion. "In particular, we have returned the emerging markets to double-digit growth and driven strong returns from disruptive innovations in areas such as knee implants and negative pressure wound therapy," Chief Executive Olivier Bohuon said. "We are taking good momentum into the second half and I am confident that we are on track to deliver our full-year revenue and trading margin guidance, which is unchanged. We continue to expect underlying revenue growth of 3%-4% and a 20-70 basis points improvement in trading profit margin for the full year," Mr. Bohuon said. -Write to Razak Musah Baba at razak.baba@wsj.com; Twitter: @Raztweet

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1856 by Thomas James Smith of Kingston upon Hull who went into business as a dispensing chemist.[4] A few months before his death in 1896, Smith was joined by his nephew, Horatio Nelson Smith, and the business became known as T. J. Smith and Nephew.[4]
In 1928 the company acquired the licence to market and produce the Elastoplast range of bandages. By 1977 the company acquired the pump manufacturer Watson-Marlow Pumps, before selling it to Spirax-Sarco Engineering in 1990.[5] In 1986 it went on to acquire Richards Medical Company, a US specialist in orthopaedic products for £201 million.[4]
In 2002 the company acquired Oratec Interventions, a surgical devices business, for $310 million.[6] It went on to buy Midland Medical Technologies, a hip resurfacing business, for £67 million in 2004.[7]
The company acquired Plus Orthopedics, a Swiss orthopedics business, for US$889 million in April 2007[8] and BlueSky, a US wound care business, for $110 million in May 2007.[9]
In September 2007 Biomet Inc., DePuy Orthopaedics Inc. (part of Johnson & Johnson), Smith & Nephew PLC and Zimmer Holdings Inc. entered into settlement agreements, under which they agree to pay $300 million in total, adopt industry overhauls and undertake corporate monitoring to avoid criminal charges of conspiracy.[10]
The company acquired Healthpoint Biotherapeutics, a specialist in the bioactives area of advanced wound management, for $782 million in December 2012.[11]
In February 2014, Smith & Nephew announced the purchase of ArthroCare for US$1.7 billion in cash. This was seen as a move to broaden the company's sports medicine range for minimally invasive surgery moves the company into the Ear, Nose & Throat market.[12]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1856 by Thomas James Smith of Kingston upon Hull who went into business as a dispensing chemist.[4] A few months before his death in 1896, Smith was joined by his nephew, Horatio Nelson Smith, and the business became known as T. J. Smith and Nephew.[4]
In 1928 the company acquired the licence to market and produce the Elastoplast range of bandages. By 1977 the company acquired the pump manufacturer Watson-Marlow Pumps, before selling it to Spirax-Sarco Engineering in 1990.[5] In 1986 it went on to acquire Richards Medical Company, a US specialist in orthopaedic products for £201 million.[4]
In 2002 the company acquired Oratec Interventions, a surgical devices business, for $310 million.[6] It went on to buy Midland Medical Technologies, a hip resurfacing business, for £67 million in 2004.[7]
The company acquired Plus Orthopedics, a Swiss orthopedics business, for US$889 million in April 2007[8] and BlueSky, a US wound care business, for $110 million in May 2007.[9]
In September 2007 Biomet Inc., DePuy Orthopaedics Inc. (part of Johnson & Johnson), Smith & Nephew PLC and Zimmer Holdings Inc. entered into settlement agreements, under which they agree to pay $300 million in total, adopt industry overhauls and undertake corporate monitoring to avoid criminal charges of conspiracy.[10]
The company acquired Healthpoint Biotherapeutics, a specialist in the bioactives area of advanced wound management, for $782 million in December 2012.[11]
In February 2014, Smith & Nephew announced the purchase of ArthroCare for US$1.7 billion in cash. This was seen as a move to broaden the company's sports medicine range for minimally invasive surgery moves the company into the Ear, Nose & Throat market.[12]

Its U.S. subsidiary Smith & Nephew Inc. paid a $16.8 million criminal fine.[15] The company admitted to having bribed government-employed doctors in Greece to use its medical equipment over the past decade.[16] The company has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and has agreed to retain a compliance monitor for 18 months.[17]

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1856 by Thomas James Smith of Kingston upon Hull who went into business as a dispensing chemist.[4] A few months before his death in 1896, Smith was joined by his nephew, Horatio Nelson Smith, and the business became known as T. J. Smith and Nephew.[4]

By 1977 the company acquired the pump manufacturer Watson-Marlow Pumps, before selling it to Spirax-Sarco Engineering in 1990.[5] In 1986 it went on to acquire Richards Medical Company, a US specialist in orthopaedic products for £201 million.[4]
In 2002 the company acquired Oratec Interventions, a surgical devices business, for $310 million.[6] It went on to buy Midland Medical Technologies, a hip resurfacing business, for £67 million in 2004.[7]
The company acquired Plus Orthopedics, a Swiss orthopedics business, for US$889 million in April 2007[8] and BlueSky, a US wound care business, for $110 million in May 2007.[9]

Smith & Nephew acquires first-line cartilage repair product

Jan 12, 2016, 08:00 ET
		  		  														
						 from   Smith & Nephew 











 
















































 

 




















 


LONDON, Jan. 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Smith & Nephew plc (NYSE:   SNN; LSE: SN), the global medical technology business, announces the acquisition of BST-CarGel®, a first-line cartilage repair product used along with microfracture and other bone marrow stimulation techniques for the initial treatment of most sizes of focal cartilage tears. Through this transaction, an affiliate of Smith & Nephew plc will acquire ownership of all product and intellectual property assets related to BST-CarGel from Piramal Healthcare (Canada) Limited, based in Montreal, Canada, an affiliate of the Piramal Enterprises Limited.
Approved for use in a number of countries around the world, including Australia, Canada and most of Europe, BST-CarGel is a biopolymer-based solution that is mixed with a patient's blood and implanted into the joint following a microfracture procedure. BST-CarGel can be delivered arthroscopically and can be used to treat damaged cartilage in synovial joints such as the knee, hip, ankle and shoulder. Once implanted, it acts as a scaffold, adhering to the cartilage surface to stabilize the blood clot while new cartilage is regenerated.  
An international, Level 1, randomized clinical trial involving 80 patients with grade III and IV femoral cartilage lesions demonstrated that microfracture with BST-CarGel yielded statistically significant improvements in both quantity and quality of repair tissue when compared to microfracture alone at one and five years post-op.i BST-CarGel also resulted in fewer structural failures after five years – offering added consistency to microfracture cases. ii     
"BST-CarGel augments our existing joint repair portfolio with a new option that is differentiated with strong clinical evidence and targets an area of significant patient need and surgeon demand," explains Scott Schaffner, Vice President, Sports Medicine for Smith & Nephew. "We are committed to seeking and investing in next-generation technologies to widen access across our global customer base." 
Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 
Editor's Note:
Microfracture is a surgical option for treating small areas of damaged articular cartilage. During the procedure, the cartilage area is prepared by removing loose or damaged tissue. A surgical tool is then used to create a series of small, microfracture holes to access the bone's vascular layer. When blood cells from the vascular layer travel through these holes to the bone's surface, they can stimulate new cartilage growth. Microfracture surgery is not recommended for patients with widespread cartilage damage such as arthritis.
