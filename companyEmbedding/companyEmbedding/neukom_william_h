Early life and education[edit]
Neukom was born in 1942, seven years before his brother, Daniel Neukom, who is a history teacher at Sacramento Country Day School.[4] He was raised in the Bay Area community of San Mateo, California. He was living in the Bay Area when the Giants moved to San Francisco in 1958. He graduated from San Mateo High School in 1960.
He received an undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College in 1964.[5]
After receiving his undergraduate degree from Dartmouth, Neukom returned to the Bay Area where he received a law degree from Stanford Law School in 1967.[6]
Legal career and Microsoft[edit]
After completing his law degree, Neukom served as a clerk for Judge Theodore S. Turner of the King County Superior Court in Seattle in the years 1967–68.[7]
By 1977, he had joined the Seattle law firm Shidler, McBroom, Gates & Lucas (later Preston Gates & Ellis). Neukom's relationship with Microsoft began in 1978 when managing partner Bill Gates Sr. asked him to advise his son's fledgling software business.[5] Neukom started doing legal work for Microsoft when the company had just 12 employees. He would continue to be Microsoft's lead legal counsel for nearly 25 years.[8]
Neukom joined Microsoft as an employee in 1985 and thereafter built its corporate law department from an initial staff of five to more than 600 attorneys and support personnel.[9] He became an Executive Vice President at Microsoft. He spent 17 years as Microsoft's general counsel and chief legal officer, managing the company's legal, governmental affairs and philanthropic activities.[9]

He was actively involved in legally defending Microsoft's intellectual property in several countries, most notably in Apple v. Microsoft.[7] He also was involved in defending Microsoft from a series of complex antitrust suits (i.e. United States v. Microsoft).[7] Neukom presided over Microsoft's defeat by the U.S. Department of Justice in a case that was referred to as the "trial of the century." [11]While at Microsoft, Neukom also directed the company's community affairs program, which initiated corporate giving programs including the Microsoft Giving Campaign, the Microsoft Matching Gifts Program, and the Microsoft Volunteer Program. In 2002 Neukom retired from Microsoft as Executive Vice President, Law & Corporate Affairs.[7]
After Microsoft, Neukom returned to Preston Gates & Ellis as a partner in the firm's business law practice.[9] In January 2004 he was named chair of that firm. In 2007 Preston Gates & Ellis merged with Kirkpatrick and Lockhart of Pittsburgh to form the large law firm now named K&L Gates.[9] Neukom no longer is affiliated with the firm.
Neukom served as president of the American Bar Association for a one year term from August 2007 to August 2008.[12]
San Francisco Giants[edit]
Neukom had been an investor in the Giants since 1995 and on May 16, 2008 was named the new Managing General Partner for the Giants.[10] He succeeded Peter Magowan, who retired at the end of the 2008 season at the age of 66.[13] Neukom and other investors purchased a portion of Peter Magowan's ownership interest in the team. Neukom became the lead active investor of the team following the reduction of Magowan's ownership interest, the death of Harmon Burns (a leading investor who died in 2006) and the death of Sue Burns, who died in 2009.
On September 14, 2011, Bill Neukom announced he was retiring as the Managing General Partner and CEO of the San Francisco Giants effective January 1, 2012, and he would be succeeded by Giants executive Larry Baer.[14] The San Jose Mercury reported anonymous sources saying that Neukom was forced out due to differences in the ownership group on how to divide up the additional money earned after the Giants won the 2010 World Series.[15] The Mercury also reported Giants shareholder Charles Bartlett Johnson purchased additional interests in the team, becoming the largest individual shareholder at 25%.[16]
Philanthropic work[edit]
Between 1996 and 2007, Neukom was a member of the Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College and he served as chair of the board from 2004 to 2007. Three of his children have attended Dartmouth. He is the founding donor of The Neukom Institute for Computational Science at Dartmouth College, which aims to advance computing resources and applications in multiple aspects of the Dartmouth curriculum.[9][17]
In 2006 Neukom committed to a gift of $20 million for the planned construction of a new academic building at Stanford University's law school.[6] The structure, named the William H. Neukom Building and opened in 2011, is 65,000 square feet and is situated on the existing law school complex.[18]
World Justice Project[edit]
Neukom is the Founder, President, and CEO of the World Justice Project. The World Justice Project works internationally to strengthen the Rule of Law, aiming to promote the development of communities of opportunity and equity.[12]

Early life and education[edit]
Neukom was born in 1942, seven years before his brother, Daniel Neukom, who is a history teacher at Sacramento Country Day School.[4] He was raised in the Bay Area community of San Mateo, California. He was living in the Bay Area when the Giants moved to San Francisco in 1958. He graduated from San Mateo High School in 1960.
He received an undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College in 1964.[5]
After receiving his undergraduate degree from Dartmouth, Neukom returned to the Bay Area where he received a law degree from Stanford Law School in 1967.[6]
Legal career and Microsoft[edit]
After completing his law degree, Neukom served as a clerk for Judge Theodore S. Turner of the King County Superior Court in Seattle in the years 1967–68.[7]
By 1977, he had joined the Seattle law firm Shidler, McBroom, Gates & Lucas (later Preston Gates & Ellis). Neukom's relationship with Microsoft began in 1978 when managing partner Bill Gates Sr. asked him to advise his son's fledgling software business.[5] Neukom started doing legal work for Microsoft when the company had just 12 employees. He would continue to be Microsoft's lead legal counsel for nearly 25 years.[8]
Neukom joined Microsoft as an employee in 1985 and thereafter built its corporate law department from an initial staff of five to more than 600 attorneys and support personnel.[9] He became an Executive Vice President at Microsoft. He spent 17 years as Microsoft's general counsel and chief legal officer, managing the company's legal, governmental affairs and philanthropic activities.[9]

He was actively involved in legally defending Microsoft's intellectual property in several countries, most notably in Apple v. Microsoft.[7] He also was involved in defending Microsoft from a series of complex antitrust suits (i.e. United States v. Microsoft).[7] Neukom presided over Microsoft's defeat by the U.S. Department of Justice in a case that was referred to as the "trial of the century." [11]While at Microsoft, Neukom also directed the company's community affairs program, which initiated corporate giving programs including the Microsoft Giving Campaign, the Microsoft Matching Gifts Program, and the Microsoft Volunteer Program. In 2002 Neukom retired from Microsoft as Executive Vice President, Law & Corporate Affairs.[7]
After Microsoft, Neukom returned to Preston Gates & Ellis as a partner in the firm's business law practice.[9] In January 2004 he was named chair of that firm. In 2007 Preston Gates & Ellis merged with Kirkpatrick and Lockhart of Pittsburgh to form the large law firm now named K&L Gates.[9] Neukom no longer is affiliated with the firm.
Neukom served as president of the American Bar Association for a one year term from August 2007 to August 2008.[12]
San Francisco Giants[edit]
Neukom had been an investor in the Giants since 1995 and on May 16, 2008 was named the new Managing General Partner for the Giants.[10] He succeeded Peter Magowan, who retired at the end of the 2008 season at the age of 66.[13] Neukom and other investors purchased a portion of Peter Magowan's ownership interest in the team. Neukom became the lead active investor of the team following the reduction of Magowan's ownership interest, the death of Harmon Burns (a leading investor who died in 2006) and the death of Sue Burns, who died in 2009.
On September 14, 2011, Bill Neukom announced he was retiring as the Managing General Partner and CEO of the San Francisco Giants effective January 1, 2012, and he would be succeeded by Giants executive Larry Baer.[14] The San Jose Mercury reported anonymous sources saying that Neukom was forced out due to differences in the ownership group on how to divide up the additional money earned after the Giants won the 2010 World Series.[15] The Mercury also reported Giants shareholder Charles Bartlett Johnson purchased additional interests in the team, becoming the largest individual shareholder at 25%.[16]
Philanthropic work[edit]
Between 1996 and 2007, Neukom was a member of the Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College and he served as chair of the board from 2004 to 2007. Three of his children have attended Dartmouth. He is the founding donor of The Neukom Institute for Computational Science at Dartmouth College, which aims to advance computing resources and applications in multiple aspects of the Dartmouth curriculum.[9][17]
In 2006 Neukom committed to a gift of $20 million for the planned construction of a new academic building at Stanford University's law school.[6] The structure, named the William H. Neukom Building and opened in 2011, is 65,000 square feet and is situated on the existing law school complex.[18]
World Justice Project[edit]
Neukom is the Founder, President, and CEO of the World Justice Project. The World Justice Project works internationally to strengthen the Rule of Law, aiming to promote the development of communities of opportunity and equity.[12]

William H. Neukom Building at Stanford Law School2012 Design Award Winner: Palo Alto, CAProject Overview The William H. Neukom Building at Stanford Law School creates a focal point along the principal circulation route linking the campus’s residential and academic precincts. The building’s appearance, designed to maintain continuity with the university’s master plan, features architectural precast concrete panels for its cladding. The panels helped achieve the project’s goals of minimizing the energy footprint with their thermal mass and of maximizing the building’s aesthetic uniformity by combining limestone-clad and exposed-aggregate precast concrete panels. The energy-performance goal for the building was to exceed the California Title 24 Energy Code by a minimum of 30%. This was achieved with a variety of techniques, including passive architectural strategies, such as the use of precast concrete panels, high-efficiency mechanical systems, and water-reducing products. The final design is calculated to reduce energy consumption by 32% and outperform the average comparable building in energy usage by 76%. Precast SolutionThe 153 precast panels feature pieces of French limestone, with some measuring 8 × 27 ft (2.4 × 8.2 m). In the field, the precaster developed a system of hand-setting the limestone pieces over the precast concrete panel joints, creating the running-bond design. This provided continuity and also hid the joints.To continue the limestone appearance on the interior, stone-clad precast concrete panels were installed on both the exterior and interior sides along the window system, with limestone hand set at the intersections. This approach created a seamless transition that is waterproof and eliminated thermal bridging.

William H. Neukom
































William H. Neukom, a member of the Dartmouth Class of 1964, became a partner in Bill Gates' father's Seattle law firm in 1979, and was asked to represent the then 12-person company, Microsoft, that had just moved to Washington state.
After six years as outside counsel, Mr. Neukom joined Microsoft in 1985, and went on to build one of the most respected corporate law departments in the country, from an initial staff of five to more than 600 attorneys and support personnel. Eventually, he became the executive vice president of law and corporate affairs at Microsoft, and spent a total of 24 years at Microsoft, 17 of them as Microsoft's general counsel and chief legal officer, managing the companies legal, governmental affairs and philanthropic activities. He rejoined Preston Gates & Ellis as a partner in 2002; the firm recently merged to create Kirkpatrick & Lockhart Preston Gates Ellis LLP.
He was a Dartmouth Trustee from 1996 to 2007, and chair of the Board of Trustees from 2004-2007, at which time he pledged the initial gift to create the Neukom Institute for Computational Science at Dartmouth. The commitment, made in honor of his family, is the largest gift in Dartmouth’s history for an academic program. Part of Neukom’s gift is a challenge to other supporters of the college to raise additional endowment funds that will ultimately provide the funding needed to launch a full range of Institute activities. Mr. Neukom was elected President of the American Bar Association from 2007-2008, during which he initiated the World Justice Project.
Mr. Neukom says "I learned how to try to think critically and write clearly while at Dartmouth, thanks to attentive faculty and bright classmates, and I fell in love with its 'sense of place' in that welcoming and beautiful part of upper New England." Three of Neukom's children have attended Dartmouth.  Reflecting on his philanthropy, Neukom adds, "The college provided me a priceless liberal arts education, and as I continued to learn about the remarkable academic experience it provides for its diverse student body and faculty, I wanted to do something significant for Dartmouth. Investing some Microsoft equity in computational science seemed natural and appropriate."

Mission

























In an age in which all forms of knowledge and experience can find their way to the computer, "computation," whether it be the actual manipulation of digital encodings or a framing for discussion, is central to many of the investigations and innovations that range across the humanities, arts, and sciences. In this way, computation becomes a nexus for much of epistemology and thus, a cause of and opportunity for collaboration. The mission of the Neukom Institute for Computational Science at Dartmouth College is to support this broad view of computational investigation across campus, and to catalyze creative thought throughout the Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, and Business, for undergraduates, graduate students and faculty.

William H. Neukom — Inside Philanthropy






























































































Tech Philanthropists























































January 07, 2016

William H. Neukom

January 07, 2016/


Tate Williams



NET WORTH: $850 million 
SOURCE OF WEALTH: Microsoft Corporation, former lead attorney and head of community affairs 
FUNDING AREAS: Computer Science, Higher Education, Social Justice 
OVERVIEW: There aren’t many corporate lawyers with the enormous wealth of William “Bill” Neukom, or the level of philanthropy he and his family have taken on. But getting on board with a tiny company called Microsoft back in the late 1970s, and sticking with them through 25 years and a public offering will do the trick. Neukom’s tenure landed him a somewhat legendary reputation in both the legal community and the tech world, as well as a stint as the CEO of the San Francisco Giants.
The bowtie-clad, white-haired attorney is fairly left-leaning, and not big on accumulating wealth. He’s giving much of his fortune away to a combination of higher education, science and human rights issues, both through his own donating and through a family foundation he runs with his children.
BACKGROUND: Bill Neukom was an upstart lawyer living in Seattle in the late 1970s, and with only a small amount of experience first as a clerk and then with a small firm that supported liberal causes, his boss at a new firm had a job for him. He wanted him to act as counsel for his son’s small computer programming company. 
The son was Bill Gates, Jr., and his company had only 12 employees and just moved from Albuquerque to Seattle. With little fanfare, Neukom took the job. It was the start of a 25-year tenure during which he would become head of the legal department and later community affairs for Microsoft Corporation. During that time he would build up a staff of hundreds of attorneys, advise the company as it became the tech force it is today, and grow wealthy after the company went public in 1986.  
In 2002, he left to become a partner at his old firm, now K&L Gates. He also served as president of the American Bar Association, trustee at his alma mater Dartmouth College, and has been a longtime investor and one-time CEO of the San Francisco Giants. 
He currently devotes most of his energy toward philanthropic pursuits, including an organization he founded called the World Justice Project. 
PHILOSOPHY: Neukom has always been highly devoted to his educational background, citing the experiences he had at Dartmouth and Stanford as key to his success, but also to a life of well-rounded intellectual pursuits. He also believes strongly in service and justice, and believes attorneys have a responsibility to use their unique skills to better their communities. He considers his accumulation of wealth to be mostly circumstantial. From the New York Times: 

'I believe I was overcompensated for my work,' said Neukom, whose political outlook puts him somewhat at odds with many of his fellow [Giants] owners, several of whom are Republicans. 'I was in a fortunate position, but my worth to the company is not equal to the amount of money I received. I don’t see it as money I earned. I see myself as the steward of the money, and that is why I give much of it away.'
'Some people who worked for Microsoft don’t see it the way I do,' he added. 'But I believe it’s my job to give the money back and to other causes. But I’m no saint and I have guilty pleasures, and the Giants are one of them.'

ISSUES: 
HIGHER EDUCATION: Neukom is perhaps most active in philanthropy as an alumni donor. He recently made a donation of $10 million to Dartmouth College’s computer science program, to create a cluster of study around the use of big data for applications across academic fields. In 2004, he gave $22 million to establish a computer science institute at the school in his name. He’s also given large amounts as a donor to Stanford, where he earned his law degree. Neukom gave $20 million as the lead investment for a new law school building, also in his name. Aside from newsmaking gifts, Neukom and his family foundation donate sizable chunks of money in general support to both universities. 
The Neukom Family Foundation has also given to the University of Puget Sound, the Ashesi University Foundation, and Columbia University, for example. 
SCIENCE: As mentioned above, Neukom has been a big supporter of Dartmouth’s computer science education and research. It’s motivated mainly by the belief that a liberal arts education and faculty should use computation and data, and that large data sets show the potential to make transformative changes in other academic fields, such as neuroscience, but also social and behavioral sciences. 
JUSTICE: The primary conduit for this funding is the World Justice Project, an organization that is devoted to promoting the “rule of law” throughout the world, including study of government accountability, open government, regulatory enforcement, and basic human rights. Neukom founded the organization, which has offices in D.C. And Seattle, and he’s still the CEO and a main funder.  
But the Neukom Family Foundation also supports groups like the Rural Development Institute, the Plymouth Housing Group, the National Womens Law Center, and the National Center for Children and Families. The foundation also gives to some environmental causes, primarily on the West Coast.

Bill Neukom, Lawyer Biography





In 1979, William H. "Bill" Neukom was a young attorney in the Seattle-based law firm of attorney Bill Gates, then known as Shilder, McBroom, Gates & Lucas. The son of the law firm's managing partner had been dabbling in new technologies and had created Microsoft Corporation in 1975. The company needed a regular lawyer and Gates thought to give the retainer to Neukom.
The retainer mushroomed and in 1985, Neukom left the law firm and became a full-time staff officer at Microsoft, general counsel.
Born in San Mateo, California in 1942, the 6'4" Neukom received his BA from Dartmouth College in 1964. He graduated from the Stanford Law School in 1967. He joined Shilder McBroom Gates in 1977. His one attempt at politics: a failed bid in a Democratic primary for attorney general in Washington State.
When he retired from Microsoft in 2001, he said:

"Twenty-two years ago, ... my law partner Bill Gates asked me to do a little legal work for his son's fledgling software company."

Under Neukom's bow-tie leadership, the legal department of Microsoft grew to 200 attorneys. Neukom managed exciting cutting-edge legal disputes such as intellectual property disputes with Apple and antitrust complaints brought by be United States Department of Justice.
Neukom had another passion which soon attracted his full attention and his substantial wealth acquired by the dramatic increase in value of his initial Microsoft shares. Microsoft had grown from a $1 million start-up to a corporation worth $28-billion by the time of his departure. Neukom's shares were then estimated to be worth $107-million.
Neukom returned to Preston Gates & Ellis in Seattle (since 2007, K&L Gates) as a partner, rainmaker and mentor to younger firm lawyers.
He donated $20 million to the Stanford Law School and used another, undisclosed amount to purchase a share in the San Francisco Giants. In 2008, he became managing general partner of the Giants.
In 2007, he was elected president of the American Bar Association. One of his pet projects is the World Justice Project for which, as of July 2010, he was president and chief executive officer. The project, based in Washington, D.C., purports to measure a country's adherence to the rule of law.
