MUNSTER | Kevin Mowbray, vice president for sales and marketing
of Lee Enterprises, has been appointed publisher of The Times.
An Illinois native and journalism graduate of Western Illinois
University, Mowbray, 42, replaces William Monopoli, who has left
the company.
The Times is operated by Lee Enterprises of Davenport, Iowa.

The appointment was announced Friday by James Hopson, Lee's vice
president of publishing.
"We are delighted Kevin Mowbray will be publisher of The Times,"
Hopson said.
"He is a very efficient leader with an outstanding record of
success. He will give the organization vigorous, energizing
leadership and will be an active and visible contributor in the
community as well."
Mowbray said he's excited to be at The Times.
"It's an outstanding newspaper that serves readers and
advertisers in Northwest Indiana," he said. "We've got a terrific
organization here, and I want to take the newspaper to the next
level."
Serving the need of the area is a challenge because of its
diversity, he said.

"Because we have a zoned product, we have the opportunity to get
that done," Mowbray said.
Mary Junck, Lee's chairman and chief executive officer, said
Mowbray will continue to serve as a vice president of the
Davenport, Iowa, newspaper company, which bought The Times in
2002.
"Lee's revenue growth is recognized as among the best in the
industry, and Kevin has been an architect for much of our success"
Junck said Friday.

"He and his talented team have helped our publishers and sales
managers put innovative programs into place to keep our focus on
continuing to grow revenue creatively and rapidly.
"In his new role as publisher of one of our largest newspapers,
Kevin will remain a key resource for our sales and marketing
initiatives, as well as an essential member of Lee's top
management," she said.
Mowbray was a veteran of eight newspaper operations at Lee
before becoming a vice president in 2002. Under his leadership, The
Bismarck (North Dakota) Tribune received Lee's top award,
Enterprise of the Year, in 2001.
In 1986, Mowbray began his career as an advertising sales
representative for Lee in his hometown of Kewanee, Ill. After
advancing in sales positions at Lee papers in Helena, Butte and
Billings, Mont., Mowbray moved to Chicago as Lee's national sales
manager for corporate sales and marketing.
He joined the Lincoln Journal Star as advertising manager in
1995 and spent three years at the Nebraska publication before
becoming general manager at the Missoulian in Missoula, Mont. He
became publisher in Bismarck two years later.
Mowbray and his wife Linda have three daughters and a son.
Members of his extended family live in the Chicago suburbs. He and
his family will move to the region soon, Mowbray said.

Lee Enterprises executives gave an upbeat assessment Wednesday about the company's financial performance, noting growth in digital revenues, industry-exceeding operating margins and aggressive repayment of debt.Davenport-based Lee, the parent company of the Quad-City Times, held its annual meeting, where shareholders approved new terms for some of its directors, as well as a handful of other proposals in a session lasting about 20 minutes."We are confident that we have the right strategies and tactics in place to provide a bright future for Lee and for its shareholders," Mary Junck, the company's executive chairman, told a group that included shareholders and company employees.
Company officials said there's a sharp focus on locally controllable revenue, where Kevin Mowbray, Lee's president and chief executive officer, said there is the most upside.In addition, there was optimism about subscription revenue. The company also said that digital revenue is on a strong trajectory, and that it now accounts for 24 percent of advertising revenue.
"We’re very focused in accelerating digital revenues. We’ve made significant investments in new digital products; added more digital elite experts; and have become more sophisticated in growing digital audience," Mowbray said.
Lee reported earlier this month that total operating revenue fell in the first quarter of 2017. But Junck said the company believes its growth initiatives "will improve revenue performance in the remainder of 2017, and in fact we're currently seeing an uptick in the revenue trend."Lee executives also emphasized they continue to devote "substantially all" of the company's available cash to debt reduction. As of December, the principal amount of debt stood at $599 million, down from $704 million the previous December. The company said repayment of debt has resulted in $8.7 million in reduced interest payments over the past 12 months.Lee owns 46 daily newspapers and has a joint interest in two others, along with digital products and nearly 300 specialty publications in 21 states.
