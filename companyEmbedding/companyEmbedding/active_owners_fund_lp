HedgeZ Fund Profile
































Active Owners
Fund, LP

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        AOF is a concentrated, long/short equity fund investing in North American small cap opportunities. AOF applies a private equity approach to address the inefficiencies in the large pool of fundamentally sound, undervalued, small public, "buy-out" quality companies. The investment process combines a disciplined, deep value based investment philosophy which leverages secular themes and ground-level due diligence. 
AOF selectively partners with management teams, operating executives, and primary capital providers to create value by creating institutional interest in the Firm's portfolio companies. 
AOF mitigates market risk though consistent hedging and creates incremental alpha through tactical shorting

Active Owners Fund's investment style is as that of an active value investor.  Value because the Fund will typically invest in companies that are considered to be trading for less than their intrinsic value and active because the Fund will seek to act as a friendly catalyst to drive value creation.  The principals believe their shared perspective to be very similar to that of private equity investors.  Like such investors, AOF takes an ownership mentality and will look to invest in those companies in which the principals believe their skill sets and relationships will help to create value.  If a company does all the right things, but its intrinsic value continues to go unrecognized by the market, then AOF will generally seek to work with management and its shareholders to initiate some form of catalyst event.
The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek superior risk-adjusted returns through a combination of long positions and short positions primarily in equity securities issued by North American-domiciled companies that trade on North American exchanges. The Fund will generally be comprised of a concentrated portfolio of long positions and a less concentrated portfolio of short positions. The Fund will also short indices that will assist the Investment Manager in achieving its overall net exposure targets.  
The Fund targets net exposure less than 50% and does not expect to be net short. The Fund will generally seek to limit its total long exposure to no more than 120% of committed capital. 
The Fund typically holds approximately 10-25 long and 5-15 short positions. The Investment Manager will generally seek to limit each long position (at market) to 15% of its portfolio and each short position (at market) to 4% of its portfolio. 
The Fund's portfolio is generally comprised of companies with market capitalizations between $100 million to $1 billion.

Ben Terk Benedicte Gravrand, Opalesque Geneva for New Managers: The Active Owners Fund (AOF) is a deep value, event driven, long/short fund investing in North American small cap opportunities. The fund was launched in January 2011 and returned -4.9% that year, 24% in 2012, 28.5% in 2013, and it is up 6.9% YTD (to end February). One of the portfolio managers talks to Opalesque about the fund strategy and opportunities in the small cap market. 

The founders and portfolio managers of the AOF, at AOF Management LLC, which has offices in Los Angeles and New York, are Joe Pretlow, who has invested in small caps for 20 years and who previously ran JPC, a private equity investment firm, and Ben Terk, who was a partner at Rho Capital for 10 years, where he led numerous minority investments and played an active role on several boards. They set up the firm in November 2009.

 "First and foremost, we are small cap deep value investors seeking event driven opportunities," Ben Terk tells Opalesque during a recent interview. "However, once we develop sufficient conviction around our portfolio companies, we will regularly seek to raise the institutional profile of our companies with other like-minded public or private investors.  As result, we have had a number of our portfolio companies taken private."

NASDAQ 100 Index – Daily
Near Term Trend: BullishFriday’s Close: 5,921.52 (+ 0.01%)UPDATE: Last week, I suggested buying if NDX tests 5,710 with a target of 6,100 and stops below 5678.The NDX continued the recent upside move for the duration of last week – blowing off any concerns about valuations or “top-ticking” the market. Technically, the upside now projects up to 6136 – perhaps after a pullback.Buy any dips in the NDX down to 5,750 with stops on any daily close below 5,709 and with an upside target of 6,136.

Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes
of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.
