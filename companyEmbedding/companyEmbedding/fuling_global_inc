ALLENTOWN, Pa., June 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Fuling Global Inc. (NASDAQ:    FORK) ("Fuling Global" or the "Company"), an environmentally-friendly specialized producer and distributor of plastic serviceware, with precision manufacturing facilities in both the U.S. and China, today announced the official opening of a new manufacturing facility in Wenling, China (the "New Facility") as part of the Company's previously announced capacity expansion plan. 








As previously disclosed, the New Facility sits on a 33.27-acre parcel of land which the Company acquired in April 2016 from the Township of Wenling and has been under construction since June 2016. The 600,000 square foot state-of-the-art plastic serviceware factory will allow the Company to expand annual production capacity by more than 30% in 2017. The Phase II expansion is expected to start in the first half of 2018 and will add another 400,000 square feet to the New Facility. 
Mr. Xinfu Hu, Chief Executive Officer of Fuling Global commented, "Today marks an important milestone for Fuling Global as we launch the commercial production of our fourth factory in China. Capacity expansion is an integral part of our long-term growth plan as we couldn't produce enough to meet growing demand for our products in recent quarters due to capacity constraints. With the completed Phase I and the planned Phase II expansion, the New Facility will allow us to more than double our annual production capacity in the next three years, preparing us for future growth and transformation in years to come."

The new state-of-the-art factory allows us to potentially more than double our current production capacity, setting the stage for accelerated growth in second half of year and beyond."  First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights    For the Three Months Ended March 31,     ($ millions, except per share data)    2017    2016    % Change     Revenues    $26.3    $20.6    28.0%     Gross profit    $5.1    $5.2    -2.3%     Gross margin    19.3%    25.3%    -6.0 percentage points     Operating income    $1.5    $1.1    36.3%     Operating margin    5.6%    5.3%    0.3 percentage points     Net income attributable to Fuling Global    $1.4    $0.7    86.8%     Diluted earnings per share    $0.09    $0.05    86.5%  Net income attributable to Fuling Global increased by 86.8% to $1.4 million, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017 from $0.7 million, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share, for the same period of last year. The increases in net income and earnings per share were primarily due to decreased selling, general and administrative expenses and increased subsidy income in 2017.Total sales volume increased by 27.8% to 9,748 tons for the first quarter of 2017 from 7,629 tons for the same period of last year. The increase in sales volume was across the board in all product categories. Blended average selling price ("ASP") was essentially unchanged at $2.70 per kilogram as ASPs for straws and others increased while ASPs for cutlery and cups and plates decreased.Revenues increased by 28.0% to $26.3 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $20.6 million for the same period of last year, driven by increase in overall sales volume.Gross profit decreased by 2.3% to $5.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $5.2 million for the same period of last year. Gross margin decreased by 6.0 percentage points to 19.3% from 25.3% for the same period of last year. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a rebound in oil prices that led to rising raw material prices. It usually takes at the minimum one quarter and sometimes two to implement product price increases, depending on market conditions.First Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsRevenuesFor the first quarter of 2017, total revenues increased by $5.8 million, or 28.0%, to $26.3 million from $20.6 million for the same period of last year.

The increase was mainly due to increased sale volume as well as higher unit price of raw material as oil prices increased year-over-year. Gross profit decreased by $0.1 million, or 2.3%, to $5.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $5.2 million for the same period of last year. Gross margin was 19.3% the first quarter of 2017, compared to 25.3% for the same period of last year.Read MoreOperating incomeSelling expenses decreased by $0.5 million, or 27.6%, to $1.2 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $1.6 million for the same period of last year. As a percentage of sales, selling expenses were 4.5% in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 7.9% in the same period of last year. General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million, or 5.8%, to $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $2.1 million for the same period of last year. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 7.4% in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 10.0% in the same period of last year. Research and development expenses increased by $0.1 million, or 13.9%, to $0.5 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $0.4 million for the same period of last year. We expect R&D expense to stay at current levels as we continued to conduct research and development activities, especially seeking to increase the use of environmentally-friendly materials, develop degradable and biodegradable materials and reduce reliance on fossil-based raw materials. As a result, total operating expenses decreased by $0.5 million, or 12.5%, to $3.6 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $4.1 million for the same period of last year.Operating income increased by $0.4 million, or 36.3%, to $1.5 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $1.1 million for the same period of last year. Operating margin was 5.6% for the first quarter of 2017, compared to 5.3% for the same period of last year. The increase in operating margin was due to decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales and partially offset by decrease in gross margin.Income before income taxesTotal other income, which includes interest income and expenses, subsidy income and other non-operating income and expenses, was $0.2 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to total other expense of $0.1 million for the same period of last year. The increase in total other income was mainly due to a $0.3 million increase in subsidy income in the first quarter of 2017.  Income before income taxes increased by $0.7 million, or 67.1%, to $1.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $1.0 million for the same period of last year. The increase was primarily due to lower operating expenses and higher subsidy income received from local government.Provision for income taxes was $0.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, essentially unchanged from the same period of last year.Net incomeNet income increased by $0.7 million, or 98.4%, to $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $0.7 million for the same period of last year. After deduction of non-controlling interest, net income attributable to Fuling Global increased by $0.7 million, or 86.8%, to $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $0.7 million for the same period of last year.Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.09 for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $0.05 for the same period of last year.

After deducting the estimated underwriting fee and offering expenses payable by
us, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $17.7 million from this
offering, or approximately $20.5 million if the over-subscription option is
exercised in full. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows
(as to such uses in China, after we complete the remittance process described
below), and we have listed the specific uses of proceeds below. If and to the
extent the over-subscription option is exercised, we intend to use any such
proceeds for our working capital needs and to replace other sources of funding
mentioned below where projects require more capital to complete than we
anticipate raising in this offering.

Approximately two-thirds of the net proceeds from this offering will be remitted
to China before we are able to use those funds to expand our business. We are
permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to Taizhou Fuling,
through capital contributions or parent/subsidiary loans, subject to approvals
from or registrations with relevant PRC government authorities. We plan to use
the capital contribution to fund Taizhou Fuling. We expect that a properly
submitted application will be approved in the ordinary course of business;
however, we cannot guarantee such an approval will occur or be timely. If our
application for a capital contribution is denied, we will use the
parent/subsidiary loan method of funding Taizhou Fuling.

As mentioned, we currently anticipate financing our subsidiaries by means of
capital contributions. We currently anticipate using a portion of the net
proceeds from this offering (total net proceeds of approximately $18 million) to
increase the registered capital of Taizhou Fuling (after which time Taizhou
Fuling may apply such funds to building a new facility in Wenling and research
and development). The increase in registered capital will require prior approval
from (i) MOFCOM to increase Taizhou Fuling’s registered capital, (ii) SAIC to
alter Taizhou Fuling’s business certificate to reflect the increase in
registered capital and (iii) SAFE to allow Taizhou Fuling’s bank to convert U.S.
dollars into RMB in order to fund such increased registered capital, or each of
the foregoing agencies’ respective local counterparts. This approval process
typically takes 30 to 90 days in total, and sometimes longer, from the time
MOFCOM or its local branches receive all the required application documents to
begin the process.

We plan to remit money to China using the capital contribution method. The
approval from MOFCOM is the key approval in the capital contribution process,
and we believe all other approvals are ministerial if MOFCOM approves such
increase in registered capital. We have not yet initiated this process but
intend to start the process immediately upon completion of the offering. We do
not foresee any problem receiving necessary government approvals for a capital
contribution; however, if our application is rejected, we would remit money to
China through a parent/subsidiary loan instead. If we were to provide funding to
Taizhou Fuling through parent/subsidiary loans (rather than the capital
contribution method), the total amount of such parent/subsidiary loans may not
exceed $8.89 million, which is the difference between Taizhou Fuling’s total
investment amount as approved by the foreign investment authorities (currently
$20 million), and Taizhou Fuling’s registered capital (currently $11.11
million). To the extent we are unable to receive all of the proceeds of this
offering through a parent/subsidiary loan, we would anticipate using such excess
in our U.S. operations, but may, at any time, reallocate those of other funds
via intercompany loans and contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. By contrast,
if we fund Taizhou Fuling through a capital contribution, the amount of our
contribution is subject to increasing our registered capital, as described
above, and applying to change the approved investment amount is not required.
Such parent/subsidiary loans must also be registered with the SAFE, which
registration usually takes no more than 20 working days after application to
complete. The cost for obtaining such approvals and completing such registration
is minimal.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to complete these government
registrations or obtain the relevant approvals on a timely basis, if at all. The
procedure to remit funds may take several months after completion of this
offering, and we will be unable to use the funds in China until remittance is
completed. We have not yet initiated the process of remitting money to China
using either method but will begin to do so promptly upon completion of this
offering.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations. These investments
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of an investment in our Ordinary Shares. It is possible that we may become a
passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income taxpayers, which
could result in negative tax consequences to you.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect of the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. The occurrence of
unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in application of
the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described in this
prospectus.


The largest producers of foodservice disposables in the United States are
significantly larger than our company. A recent report by Freedonia estimates
that three companies control approximately 29% of the foodservice disposable
market in the United States, and the top ten companies accounted for
approximately 50% of the market in 2012. Because the entire foodservice
disposable market in the United States consists of packaging, serviceware and
napkins, and other foodservice disposables — while we only compete in the
serviceware segment — we occupy a relatively small competitive position in the
market as a whole.

Concentration in the foodservice disposables industry varies widely within
specific market segments, with some segments dominated by a small number of
producers. For example, Dart Container is the leading supplier of plastic
foodservice beverage cups, followed by Pactiv and Berry Plastics. By contrast,
the market for cutlery is more fragmented, with a growing portion of the market
supplied by contract manufacturers in China. Among U.S.-based suppliers of
foodservice disposable cutlery are Berry Plastics, D&W Fine Pack, Dart Container
(including Solo Cup), Georgia-Pacific, Maryland Plastics, Pactiv, and Waddington
Group. Most of these firms offer a number of different cutlery lines and are
diversified into the production of straws and other foodservice disposables. In
April 2012, D&W Fine Pack expanded its cutlery and straw offerings through its
acquisition of Jet Plastica Industries. Prior to the acquisition, Jet Plastica
claimed to be the largest manufacturer of straws in the U.S. Other suppliers of
foodservice straws include Cell-O-Core, Earth Straws, New WinCup, Pactiv (via
Spirit Foodservice), Rockline Industries, Royer, StalkMarket Products, and Stone
Straw (Wentworth Technologies).

Our primary competitors are the following companies. We have set forth our
assessment of our companies’ relative strengths and challenges. This table
represents our belief about our competitive position and is based on our
observations, rather than objective data except the ranking. The ranking is
provided by the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Light
Industrial Products and Arts and Crafts regarding China’s plastic kitchenware
and serviceware companies for exports. Our assessment may not be shared by
others, including such competitors, but it does represent management’s
assessment of our industry position. Moreover, the below statements of industry
are based on our current knowledge in our industry; to the extent there are
developments we have not learned about (for instance, if a competitor has
licensing agreements with a founder, rather than obtaining a patent in its own
name or if a competitor is in the midst of building an overseas manufacturing
facility that has not yet been announced), the below information may be
incomplete.

Nevertheless, we have been one of China’s largest exporters of disposable
serviceware. The China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Light
Industrial Products and Arts and Crafts has recognized Taizhou Fuling as Number
3 out of 7,382 plastic kitchenware and serviceware companies for exports from
China in 2014, Number 2 out of 4,610 such companies in 2013, Number 1 out of
4,365 such companies in 2012, and Number 2 out of 3,871 such companies in 2011.
In addition, we were rated one of top 10 enterprises of plastic industry (daily
plastic) in China light industries in 2013 by China National Light Industry
Council and China Plastic Processing Industry Association, based on our (1)
revenue, (2) profit, (3) profit tax rate, and (4) business growth rate.

We have invested heavily ($6,283,237 since 2012 to 2014) in research and
development to increase our future competitive position, seeking to increase our
use of environmentally-friendly materials, develop degradable and biodegradable
materials, and reduce reliance on fossil raw materials. In addition, we have
developed advanced robotics to produce our products more efficiently and at
lower cost to be more competitive in the face of rising wages and higher quality
demands.


Company Description
We are a specialized production and distribution company for
environmentally-friendly plastic serviceware with primary customers from the
United States and European countries. We mainly conduct our operations in China
and United States through our wholly owned subsidiary, Taizhou Fuling


 Plastics
Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries in both countries.

Our plastic serviceware products are made from environmentally-friendly
material. Our products include disposable cutlery, drinking straws, cups and
plates and other plastics products. Our largest customer base is in the United
States. Our production facilities include three factories in Zhejiang Province,
China and one factory in Pennsylvania, U.S., and we have obtained ISO9001
quality management system, ISO14001 environmental management system, HACCP, FDA
food facility registration and GMP certifications. These certifications are
crucial for businesses like ours that serve some of the most sophisticated
purchasers of foodservice disposables in the world.

Our primary raw materials in production of our products are PP, GPPS and HIPS,
which are extracted from crude oil. Thus, our cost of raw material is highly
impacted by fluctuations in the price of oil. Cost of revenues mainly includes
costs of raw materials, costs of direct labor, utilities, depreciation expenses
and other overhead.

Our largest product category is disposable cutlery. It includes forks, knives,
spoons, general, specialized and multipurpose utensils (for instance, the
spork), both in single- and multi-utensil packages. It accounted for 60% and 54%
of our revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and for the year ended
December 31, 2014, respectively, and we believe it will continue to be a key
area for growth in the coming years. Our other product categories are (i)
drinking straws, (ii) cups and plates and (iii) other plastics products. (i)
Drinking straws, (ii) cups and plates and (iii) other plastics products
accounted for 12%, 24% and 4% of the total sales respectively for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. (i) Drinking straws, (ii) cups and plates and (iii) other
plastics products accounted for 16%, 27% and 3% of the total sales respectively
in 2014.

Direct Link, one of our subsidiaries was incorporated in the United States in
2011 and is engaged in the distribution of our products in the U.S. In May 2014,
Fuling Plastic USA, Inc. (“Fuling USA”) was incorporated in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Taizhou Fuling. Fuling USA is
establishing the Company’s first production factory in the U.S. and will
principally engage in the production of plastic drinking straw items. We have
not established any subsidiaries in Europe and we rely on the sales forces
located in China to export our products to European countries.

As of October 19, 2015, our products are sold in 22 countries. Our customers now
include McDonald’s, Subway, Wendy’s, Burger King, KFC (China only), Walmart,
McKesson and Woolworths.

In 2014, we supplied four of the five largest fast food restaurant chains in the
United States, based on U.S. systemwide sales amount as published by QSR
Magazine. These top five chains, in order, were 1. McDonald’s, 2. Subway, 3.
Starbucks, 4. Wendy’s and 5. Burger King.

We estimate we supplied the following percentages of these customers’ products
in the United States in 2014. These percentages are management’s best estimates,
based on orders from such customers and understanding of other supplier
relationships.
