History[edit]
Pond's Cream was invented in the United States as a patent medicine by pharmacist Theron T. Pond (1800–1852) of Utica, New York, in 1846. Mr. Pond extracted a healing tea from witch hazel [Hamamelis spp.] which he discovered could heal small cuts and other ailments. The product was named "Golden Treasure." After Theron died, it would be known as "Pond's Extract." [1]
In 1849, the T. T. Pond Company was formed with Pond and other investors. Soon after, he sold his portion of the company because of failing health. He died in 1852. In 1914, the company was incorporated under the name Pond's Extract Company.[2]
The company then moved to Connecticut establishing its manufacturing center there. Later it moved its sales office to New York City.
In 1886, Pond's began to advertise nationally. They advertised under the name of Pond's Healing until 1910.
By the twentieth century, the company's main emphasis was selling cosmetics products. The "Pond's Vanishing Cream" and the "Pond's Cold Cream" were created, marking the entrance of Pond's products into the facial care industry. Today Pond's is sold around the world. Its largest markets are in Spain and in Asia, including India, Japan and Thailand.
1910s[edit]




1917 advertisement


By 1910, Pond's was a well established brand among Americans. Concentrating mostly on their vanishing cream, the Pond's company began an ad campaign that would become notorious because of the celebrities involved in it. "Pond's Healing" took a back seat to "Pond's Vanishing Cream", as "Pond's Healing" and "Pond's Cold Cream" would be announced in small print under the "Pond's Vanishing Cream" advertisements.
By 1914, mentions of "Pond's Healing" were taken off the ads, and the Pond's company began to advertise "Pond's Vanishing Cream" and "Pond's Cold Cream" together, making sure to explain each cream's different purposes on the new ads. One particular ad line read "Every normal skin needs these two creams".
As a result of the new campaign, "Pond's Vanishing Cream" had a 60% increase in sales during 1915, and "Pond's Cold Cream" had a 27% increase.[citation needed]
1920s[edit]
By 1922, sales of the products had gone down, as many believed that such an easily available product could not perform as well as other, "designer" products. Because of this, the Pond's Company then targeted royalty, politicians and people of high class stature to become advertisers for the company. In addition, these ads were printed in magazines such as Vogue and others, to give customers a feeling that they really were getting a quality product for a fair price.
In 1923, Queen Marie of Romania visited the United States, and she enjoyed the product so much that in 1925 she wrote to the Pond's Company requesting more supplies. Her letter was, in turn, used for advertisement, and Her Majesty joined the list of celebrities who had previously sponsored the products.
Around the time of Queen Marie's visit to the United States, the Pond's Company began to place samples of their products at their magazine ads, and the characters of "Peter" and "Polly Ponds" were created, as part of their campaign to entice normal people into buying their cream again. The marketing strategies proved successful, as sales of the Pond's facial creams went up again.
"Peter" and "Polly Ponds" disappeared from the company's ad campaigns after 1925.
1930s[edit]
During the Depression Era of the 1930s, the company's business slowed down somewhat. However, the Pond's company expanded slowly, adding Face Powder and Angel Face products.
First merger[edit]
Pond's Company was merged in 1955 with the Chesebrough Manufacturing Company, which had a good percentage of brands in the facial care field. With this merger, "Pond's Creams" became sisters with the Cutex nail polish brand and the Matchabelli perfumes.[1]
With the Chesebrough Manufacturing Company in command, "Pond's Creams" became available at many supermarkets across the United States. The creams' bottles consisted of small, glass bottles with a round cap. The bottles were recognizable by their distinctive colors, usually in green, blue or white. The bottle design is still in use by the Pond's brand.
Second merger[edit]
In 1987, the Chesebrough Manufacturing Company popularly known as "Chesebrough-Ponds", was acquired by Anglo-Dutch company Unilever, giving "Pond's Creams" a more international reach.[1] Subsequently, 14% of the company was privately traded to Bhosle Group of Industries for an undisclosed amount of money.

POND, PETER, army officer, fur trader, explorer, map maker, and writer; b. 18 Jan. 1739/40 in Milford, Conn., eldest son of Peter Pond and Mary Hubbard; m. Susanna Newell, probably in 1762, and they had at least two children; d. 1807 in Milford.

This remarkable, eccentric, and violent man was born, according to his own account, into a family well known for five generations as “all waryers [warriors] Ither by Sea or Land.” Despite objections from his parents, in April 1756 he enlisted as a private in the seventh company of the 1st Connecticut Regiment under Captain David Baldwin. In June the company sailed from Milford to New York harbour and then up the Hudson River to the Half Moon (north of Albany), where the regiment gathered for a descent on the French at Fort Carillon (near Ticonderoga, N.Y.). Winter intervened, the regiment was dispersed, and Pond returned to his parents. In 1758 an army was required for James Abercromby*’s assault on Carillon; Pond rejoined the Connecticut troops and took part in the operation. On 17 April 1759 he again enlisted, this time as a sergeant, giving his occupation as shoemaker. He joined the Suffolk County Regiment at Long Island, N.Y., for an army raised “to go a ganst Niagaray [Fort Niagara, near Youngstown, N.Y.]” under John Prideaux. At Oswego, Colonel John Johnstone of the New York Regiment singled out Pond to be with him in the journey to the Niagara region. After serving until exhaustion as orderly sergeant to Prideaux, Pond was with Sir William Johnson*, who commanded the army after Prideaux’s death, at the capture of the fort. “I Got But One Slite wound Dureing the Seage,” he recalled.
From Niagara, Pond returned with his regiment to Oswego and helped build a camp there in preparation for an assault on Montreal. After passing the winter of 1759–60 at Milford, where a number of French prisoners were billeted, in 1760 he received an officer’s commission and for the fourth time entered the army. He went first to Albany, and then to Oswego to join Amherst*’s forces which were assembled for the taking of Montreal, the sole remaining French stronghold. He was present at the town’s surrender on 8 Sept. 1760.
After the conquest Pond “thought thane was no bisnes left for me” in Canada. In 1761 he therefore turned his attention to seafaring, with the intention of making it a profession. He sailed to the West Indies, presumably from a New England port. On his return to Milford he found his father had gone to Detroit (Mich.) on a trading voyage and his mother had died of a fever. Pond gave up seafaring, took charge of the numerous young family, and stayed in Milford for three years. It was, he later wrote, the longest time between the ages of 16 and 60 that he stayed in one place.


Having decided to enter the fur trade in the Detroit region, Pond left Milford, likely in 1765, and for six years carried on business in the west. In this period, having been abused and threatened by another trader, he killed his opponent in a duel, returned from Detroit, and proclaimed the event to authorities but was not prosecuted. Documents show that in 1771 he was in partnership with Felix Graham, a merchant trading from New York to Michilimackinac (Mackinaw City, Mich.). He made another voyage to the West Indies, apparently in 1772. On his return he accepted an invitation to renew his partnership with Graham. In 1773 Graham took a large cargo from New York to Michilimackinac by way of the Great Lakes. Pond, who “wanted Sum Small artikels in the Indan way to Cumpleat my asortment,” went up to Montreal. He arranged with Isaac Todd and James McGill to have these items shipped in their canoes and set out with them by the Ottawa River route for Michilimackinac. At that post he bought canoes and supplies, engaged men, and loaded bales. Altogether he had 12 canoes, “my small fleat,” and 4,600 pounds of goods valued at more than £1,200. In September 1773 he crossed Lake Michigan to Green Bay. He visited the Menominees on the north side of the bay, the Winnebagos on “Peuans Lake” (Lake Winnebago, Wis.), and may have traded with the Foxes. He ascended the Fox River to a place where that tribe interred its dead and then portaged to the Wisconsin River, “a Gentel Glideing Stream” and part of the Mississippi drainage system. Near the end of September he arrived at the Sauk village on the north side of the Wisconsin. In his narrative he recorded cultural traits of that tribe: “Thay are . . . Les Inclined to tricks and Bad mannars then thane Nighbers . . . Sum of thane Huts are Sixtey feet Long and Contanes Saverl fammalyes . . . the women Rase Grat Crop of Corn Been Pumkens – Potatoes Millans . . . Thay are Not Verey Gellas of thare women.” He then descended the river some 50 miles to a village of Foxes, “a Differant Sort of People Who was Bread at Detroit under the french Government and Clarge; till thay By Chrisanissing Grew so Bad thay [the French] ware Oblige to Go to war a Ganst them,” and who now lived in “Sad Sarkamstanis.” They had recently been infected by an epidemic, and Pond remained only one day, managing to do a little trading before continuing downstream to the Mississippi. There, at Prairie du Chien, he found many French traders, and Indians purchasing supplies for the winter hunt. He stayed ten days, while he dispatched nine clerks to various tributaries of the Wisconsin and Mississippi for trade. In October 1773 he left for the St Peters River (Minnesota River, Minn.) with two other traders. On the river about 14 miles from its mouth, he found a log house which he supposed to be that of Jonathan Carver, where the explorer had wintered in 1766–67. Pond later wrote that he thought little of Carver and could have completed his whole tour in six weeks.


Pond passed the winter of 1773–74 on the high banks of the St Peters River and conducted business with the Indians in gentle competition with a French trader. When the ice broke and the water level receded, Pond’s party descended the river to Prairie du Chien. He collected pelts from various tribes gathered there, against keen trade from New Orleans, the Illinois, and Michilimackinac. “All my Outfits had Dun well,” he wrote, “I had a grate Share for my Part a[s] I furnish Much the Largest Cargo on the River.” This statement suggests that Pond was relying heavily on bulk imports and that he had a good source of supply.
In July 1774 he was back at Michilimackinac where he found his partner Graham with a large cargo. Pond had done so well that he proposed to buy Graham out. He paid him for the 1773 cargo “and well on toward the One he had Brot me.” Pond’s first venture had ended. He had learned the trade, mastered the art of getting along with fellow traders and at the same time out-trading them when necessary, become familiar with wilderness travel and survival, and emerged a successful capitalist. He entered into partnership with another merchant, Thomas Williams, an arrangement that would last until 1777.


Trade from Michilimackinac to the Mississippi was severely threatened when war between the Ojibwas and Sioux broke out again. A Lake Superior trader brought news of the fighting to the fort about the first of August 1774. The commandant, Arent Schuyler DePeyster*, gathered Pond and the other traders together, had six large wampum belts made (three for each nation), and sent Pond to the Sioux and other agents to the Ojibwas. Chiefs of the opposing sides were to assemble at Michilimackinac in the spring of 1775 for a council. Pond went to Prairie du Chien and found the Sioux there not involved in the fighting. He took the occasion to go up the St Peters River to trade with a band of Yankton Sioux who had never met whites and of whose customs he left an important ethnological account. After wintering at his post on the St Peters, he assembled 11 Sioux chiefs and explained the wampum belts; he then headed for Michilimackinac with them. The group was joined at Prairie du Chien by Indians of various tribes who were waiting there. At Michilimackinac, DePeyster chaired a grand council which was followed by a decade of peace between the warring parties [see Joseph-Louis Ainsse].





	After this venture Pond never returned to the upper Mississippi, deciding instead to pursue trade in the northwest via Grand Portage (near Grand Portage, Minn.). He was at the time a partner in the firm of Pond and Graves, which seems to have been a subsidiary of Pond and Williams. Traders from Montreal and from the Hudson’s Bay Company had recently begun moving into the Saskatchewan valley seeking better quality pelts. Doubtless knowing of these prospects, Pond joined Alexander Henry* on 18 Aug. 1775 near the Cree village at the mouth of the Winnipeg River. Three weeks later they were overtaken by Joseph and Thomas Frobisher and Charles Paterson; the whole party, consisting of 30 canoes and 130 men, reached the mouth of the Saskatchewan on 1 October. They ascended the river to the HBC’s Cumberland House (Sask.), where they were greeted with civility but as unwanted guests by Matthew Cocking*. The canoes separated, and Pond went south through Little Lake Winnipeg (Lake Winnipegosis, Man.) and travelled up Mossy River to winter at his Fort Dauphin, which he locates on the northwest corner of Dauphin Lake itself. Unless an agreement to cooperate had been undertaken, Pond would have been in opposition to John Cole* at Peter Pangman’s Fort Dauphin. (Pond was not trading with the “common concern” of Henry, Pangman, Paterson, Jean-Baptiste Cadot, and James Finlay.) At Dauphin Lake there was plenty of buffalo meat available, and he was in a position to intercept Indians bound for Cumberland House.



In 1776 Pond went to Michilimackinac and arranged to have the next season’s goods brought to Grand Portage. He had realized the necessity of keeping his supply base as far forward as possible. In so doing he assisted the process whereby Grand Portage, and later Fort William (Thunder Bay, Ont.), supplanted Michilimackinac as the western supply depot of the northwest fur trade. He evidently wintered for the next two years, 1776–77 and 1777–78, at the junction of the Sturgeon River (Sask.) and the North Saskatchewan, a short distance downriver from the place where HBC employee Robert Longmoor would soon challenge the pedlars’ hold on trade. Apparently on 17 April 1777, Pond had entered partnership with trader George McBeath, who was also associated with Simon McTavish. It was McBeath who looked after the Montreal to Grand Portage section of the enterprise with Pond.
The success of Thomas Frobisher in 1777 at Lac Île-à-la-Crosse, on the edge of the Athabasca watershed, led others to push forward in that direction. In the spring of 1778 several traders, chiefly representing the two houses of Benjamin and Joseph Frobisher and McTavish and Company, put into common stock their spare goods at Pine Island Lake (Cumberland Lake, Sask.). They gave management of the enterprise to Pond, who had four canoes for the expedition. He was instructed to enter the English River (the upper Churchill), follow Thomas Frobisher’s route, and if possible go into the Athabasca region, a country little known to the pedlars except by Indian report. This joint concern, says Harold Adams Innis*, “was probably the direct forerunner of the North West Company.”
Pond wintered on the Athabasca River, about 40 miles from the lake, in 1778–79. There he saw a “vast concourse” of Crees and Chipewyans, who went down each year to Prince of Wales’s Fort (Churchill, Man.) via lengthy, difficult routes. According to Alexander Mackenzie, who was in the Athabasca country himself a decade after, these tribes were pleased to see traders who would “relieve them from such long, toilsome, and dangerous journies; and were immediately reconciled to give an advanced price for the articles necessary to their comfort and convenience.” Pond was thus able to obtain more furs than his canoes could carry. Accordingly he stockpiled the remainder in winter huts.
In the spring of 1779 Pond came heavily laden out of Athabasca at the completion of what was in effect a trading expedition of two summers’ duration. On 2 July he arrived at Cumberland House “with three Canoes from the Northward very much distressed for want of food having bad Success on his Journey down his Canoes being broke upon the fall’s.” From the master, William Walker*, who treated him civilly for previous kindnesses, he acquired tobacco, powder, and meat. Pond told Walker that he had gone far enough north to trade with “the Northward Indians” among whom Samuel Hearne* had been with Matonabbee*. During trading, he said, he had made 140 packs of 90 pounds each but had been obliged to leave most of them behind. Since one pack contained about 60 pelts, the whole would have constituted some 8,400 made beaver. Historian Edwin Ernest Rich states that in 1779 Pond brought out more than 80,000 fine beaver skins. This would have been about 60 tons of furs – an extraordinary load for three canoes, given that the average canot du nord had a carrying capacity of a ton and a half. Pond told Walker freely of his discoveries and informed him of Portage La Loche. About 12 miles in length and so steep that it had taken the party eight days to complete it, this portage ran between Lac La Loche, in the Hudson Bay watershed, and the Pelican (Clearwater) River, in the Athabasca drainage.
Pond continued east to Grand Portage, and returned to Athabasca directly to bring out the furs he had left behind. The licence issued to him in Montreal in 1780 for four canoes to be sent up to Grand Portage must therefore have been given in his absence. He spent the winter of 1780–81 at Michilimackinac, arriving on 26 November with seven engagés in a bateau from Lake Superior and remaining at least until 10 May. He entered a partnership with McBeath and Booty Graves and returned west to winter in 1781–82 with Jean-Étienne Waddens* at Lac la Ronge (Sask.). The two men represented different and yet interrelated trading interests. Pond’s was the larger and was built around the more sizeable Montreal houses, such as those of the Frobishers and Simon McTavish; Waddens was acting for an association of smaller houses, such as those of Forrest Oakes* and John Ross. The two groups were in some way affiliated, and in 1779 it had been intended that Waddens should replace Pond in trading with the Indians of Athabasca. However, rivalry between the two sets of interests was not resolved, and in a compromise arrangement the men were to trade side by side at Lac la Ronge in 1781–82. They were reported to be of distinctly different character, and ill will developed between them doubtless also because of economic competition. In February they fought, but details are not known. At the beginning of March Waddens was shot and mortally wounded, perhaps by Pond or his clerk. Waddens’s widow pressed charges but historians disagree as to whether or not Pond stood trial. Relying, no doubt, on a remark by Alexander Mackenzie, Innis claims that “it may be assumed” Pond was tried and acquitted in Montreal during the winter of 1784–85. The only documentation located, however, is a deposition by Waddens’s clerk, and Arthur Silver Morton* maintains that the absence of any record of a trial indicates Pond was merely examined; he suggests that the case was not taken to court because the murder had occurred in a region beyond the jurisdiction of Quebec’s legal system.
Pond wintered on Lac Île-à-la-Crosse in 1782–83 and then proceeded to Athabasca, probably in the spring. The years between 1776 and 1783 had seen a growing tendency of fur-trade interests to coalesce and a series of agreements, usually annual, eventually produced the first declared North West Company, formed in 1783–84 and intended to last for five years. Pond seems to have had one of the 16 shares in the 1779 company, and in his absence he was allotted one share in the 1783–84 organization.
Pond probably explored waters downriver of Lake Athabasca, but how far is not known. He learned from Indians the approximate location of Great Slave and Great Bear lakes and perhaps of the Peace and Mackenzie rivers. Especially in 1783–84 he came into contact with many Indians from the country north of Lake Athabasca, and he secured for the Nor’Westers a trade that the HBC was unable to divert. In 1784 Pond came out to Grand Portage and to Montreal, where in February 1785 he became a charter member of the Beaver Club.
During the winter of 1784–85 Pond drew his celebrated map, showing the rivers and lakes from the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay westward to the Rocky Mountains and northward to the Arctic. It indicates a large river flowing from Lake Athabasca to Slave (Great Slave) Lake and thence to the Arctic Ocean, called by Pond “Supposed, the Ice Sea.” One copy of the map was prepared for submission to the United States Congress. In April 1785 another was given to the lieutenant governor of Quebec, Henry Hamilton*, as was a memorial signed by Pond and probably written by the Frobishers which asked Hamilton to support a scheme for discoveries of the northwestern reaches of North America under Pond’s leadership. Anxious to assist Pond and prevent him from aiding the United States or another country, Hamilton urged the British government, but unsuccessfully, to help him and the Nor’Westers.
Feeling that he deserved more than the one share he had been assigned by the NWC agreement of 1783–84, Pond had at first refused it and considered joining with John Ross and Peter Pangman instead. Ultimately, however, he accepted the share, and in 1785 he returned to Athabasca via Grand Portage. John Ross also went there, to compete with him. In the summers of 1786 and 1787 Pond made excursions from his post, extending trade towards the Peace River and organizing his base and provisions. In the winter of 1786–87 competition became severe, and Ross was “shot in a scuffle with Mr. Pond’s men,” according to one report. The news of Ross’s death resulted in a decision by the leaders of the rival interests to unite and bring an end to the murderous competition. Two of Pond’s men were arrested and brought to Quebec for trial, but they were acquitted. Evidence suggests the killer was one Péché (Peshe), who afterwards traded from Slave River among the Chipewyans. HBC surveyor Peter Fidler* wrote in his journal of 1791 that “Mr. Ross was shot by one Peshe, a Canadian, by order of Pond.”
In the spring of 1788 Pond left the northwest never to return. From the time of the murder of Waddens in 1782 he had been a marked man, and his time in the west limited. This situation was re-emphasized with Ross’s murder five years later, despite Pond’s apparent remoteness from the episode. The second death led to his withdrawal or forced retirement from the fur trade. Alexander Mackenzie profited from Pond’s pioneering enterprises and geographical ideas, building a career and reputation on business activities suggested by Pond’s theories and activities.
Pond continued to produce maps of the northwest. One, dated 6 Dec. 1787, he presented to Lord Dorchester [Guy Carleton] at Quebec. Dorchester sent it to London in November 1790, but a simplified copy had already been published in the Gentleman’s Magazine of March 1790. Pond made yet another version, intended for the empress of Russia. These maps show that he had become aware of Captain James Cook*’s discoveries. What is now called Cook Inlet, Alaska, was thought by the captain to be a river flowing from the east, and Pond’s 1787 maps strongly suggest that it drains from a gigantic Great Slave Lake. In 1789 Alexander Mackenzie explored the river leading out of that lake and found it flowed to the Arctic, as Pond’s first maps had indicated. Pond’s willingness to change on the basis of Cook’s unsubstantiated discovery dramatically hurt his credibility as a map maker, but he was not alone in making the error.
Pond was not included in the 1790 reorganization of the NWC, having sold his share that year to William McGillivray* for £800. Dorchester had knowledge that Pond quit the province of Quebec owing to his dissatisfaction with the NWC. His intention, Dorchester said, was to seek employment in his native United States. That same year Pond visited President Ezra Stiles of Yale College, who made a copy of his map. In November 1791 he was offered an unspecified share in a projected “Company for the N.W.” in opposition to the NWC by John Howard, Jacob Jordan*, and Samuel Birnie, to be supported by Jordan’s backers, Brickwood, Pattle and Company of London. Pond’s response to this proposal is not known. On 9 Jan. 1792 “Captain” Peter Pond and William Steedman were instructed by the American secretary of War to go to Niagara and Detroit to seek from warring Indians a request for peace [see Michikinakoua]. Whether Pond went has not been discovered. The latter years of his life were spent in the United States, most probably at Milford, and he passed the time reading the travels of the Baron de Lahontan [Louis-Armand de Lom* d’Arce] and Jonathan Carver. He died impoverished in 1807. Peter Pond National Historic Site, at the junction of the Sturgeon River and the North Saskatchewan, and Peter Pond Lake (Sask.) have been named after him.


Pond’s contemporaries generally regarded him with a mixture of admiration and suspicion: admiration for his energetic activities; suspicion for his association with murders and for his American background. East India Company hydrographer Alexander Dalrymple doubted his loyalty to the crown. Alexander Henry, who used Pond’s discoveries for his own benefit and without acknowledgement, called him a “trader of celebrity.” Dr John Mervin Nooth*, who met him in Quebec, thought him “a very singular person.” Judge Isaac Ogden favoured him as “a Gentleman of Observation and Science.” Trader Roderick McKenzie* said Pond “thought himself a philosopher, and was odd in his manners.” Alexander Mackenzie obviously was jealous of Pond’s pre-eminence and of his discoveries, actual and suggested. Explorer David Thompson* wrote of Pond: “He was a person of industrious habits, a good common education, but of a violent temper and unprincipled character.” This unfavourable attitude forms a common thread in the works of later writers, including Charles Lindsey* and E. E. Rich. Even Innis, his biographer, calls his achievements “in many ways remarkable but . . . not of a sensational character.”

Pond was an unusual man, more energetic, more aggressive, and more capable of organizing than most traders. Lured by profits from northern furs, he pushed farther north and west than any other trader in the 1770s and 1780s. He was the first white man to cross Portage La Loche (also known as Methye Portage) to the Athabasca River and Lake Athabasca. The discovery linked the Mackenzie watershed with the rivers flowing to Hudson Bay. In this achievement Pond succeeded where others, especially Thomas Frobisher, had failed. The first white trader to push into the Athabasca country, he induced rivals in competition to his lucrative commerce, and his activities led to the first organization named the North West Company. They also opened what Mackenzie called the “new eldorado” of the NWC, around which the company’s prospects for the 1790s and afterwards revolved. Pond’s use of supplies, including pemmican, and his good organization were keys to his success: they enabled him to travel farther and to trade better than his predecessors. They also set the pattern for NWC exploitation of the Athabasca country. His reputation for violence, however, invited the suspicion of other traders both inside and outside the concern and eventually forced his withdrawal from the company.
Pond was the first to outline the general features of the Mackenzie River system. His findings fired Mackenzie with the possibilities of discovery in the north and led him to follow the course of the great river to its frozen mouth in 1789. Pond’s maps and suggested course of the waters of Athabasca are enduring testaments to him as a pioneer in the last great fur-bearing area of North America.

  [Pond’s narrative was probably written some time after he reached the age of 60. Many years later Sophia M. Mooney, the wife of Nathan Gillette Pond, discovered it in the home of former Connecticut governor Charles Hobby Pond. The account stops in 1775, and she reported that some pages had been torn off at the end. Whether or not much is missing is debatable. The manuscript is now in Yale Univ. Library, Beinecke Rare Book and ms Library (New Haven, Conn.); two photocopies are in the manuscript collection of the UTL-TF. A transcription by Mrs Pond, first published in the Conn. Magazine (New Haven), 10 (1906): 239–59, subsequently reappeared in Wis., State Hist. Soc., Coll., 18 (1908): 314–54, and in the first edition of Five fur traders of the northwest . . . , ed.

Peter Pan (peanut butter)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Peter Pan is a brand of peanut butter produced by ConAgra Foods and named after the J.M. Barrie character. The product was introduced by Swift & Company (originally through their "Derby Foods" subsidiary) in 1920 under the name "E. K. Pond". The product was renamed in 1928. Originally packaged in a tin can with a turn key and reclosable lid, the product's packaging was changed to glass jars because of metal shortages during World War II. In 1988, Peter Pan was the first brand of peanut butter to be sold in plastic jars.[1][2]
Peter Pan Peanut Butter is currently sold in 13 varieties:

Original Creamy
Original Crunchy
Honey Roast Creamy
Honey Roast Crunchy
Reduced-Fat Creamy
Reduced-Fat Crunchy
Whipped Creamy
Plus Creamy (with added vitamins and minerals)
Natural Creamy
Natural Crunchy
Natural Honey Roast Creamy
Simply Ground Original
Simply Ground Honey Roast

The product was the main ingredient in Frankford Candy & Chocolate Company's now-discontinued product, Peter Pan Peanut Butter Cups.
Past spokesmen for Peter Pan have included actor Sterling Holloway,[3] actor Mark Linn-Baker,[4] comedian Alan Sues,[5] and game-show host Art James.[6]
In late August 2007, it was announced that Disney's version of the Peter Pan character would become the mascot for Peter Pan Peanut Butter, alongside many other characters from Disney's 1953 animated film version to appear in their new advertising campaign, possibly in 2009. This would not be the first time: in the mid-1950s, when Peter Pan cosponsored ABC's Disneyland TV series, Tinker Bell often appeared in their ads during the program.
In earlier versions of the product, Peter Pan was clearly pictured as a woman in a Peter Pan costume, rather than as a boy.[7] This would have fit very nicely into the then-usual tradition of having the character played by an actress in J.M. Barrie's play or the musical made from it, were it not for the fact that the model used for the peanut butter label appeared very feminine, with long hair and a green skirt, unlike the actresses who had played Peter onstage. All of them had had their hair cropped short for the role and wore green pants rather than a long green skirt.

The "Say When!!" Incident[edit]
During a 1964 episode of the NBC game show Say When!!, host Art James performed a commercial for Peter Pan Peanut Butter during which he unintentionally broke the glass jar he used as a prop. Before air time, James did a series of run-throughs, dropping a table knife into the near-empty Peter Pan jar, each time without incident. But when he did the actual commercial live on the air, the knife broke out the bottom of the jar and fell through onto his podium. Amid scattered laughter from the audience, James continued the spot as the bottom part of the jar came "unglued" from the peanut butter. At the end of the commercial James finally lost his composure and stated that "It's great peanut butter; the jar is something else".[8] The incident has been replayed on many TV blooper specials through the years.
Recall[edit]




Recalled jar of Peter Pan with "2111" product code


In February 2007, Peter Pan and some Great Value (Walmart's store brand) peanut butters were linked to 425 cases of salmonellosis across the United States. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials believe this is the first Salmonella outbreak involving peanut butter to occur in the United States.
The recall involved both Peter Pan and some Great Value peanut butter with a product code starting with the digits "2111."[9] The recall included all ConAgra-produced peanut butter sold in the United States since October 2004.[10] Peter Pan products returned to stores in late August 2007.[11]
During the January 2009 peanut butter recall, the Peanut Corporation of America recalled 21 lots of peanut butter from their plant in Blakely, Ga. over the possibility of Salmonella contamination.[12] Although this initially caused concern among consumers, Peter Pan has confirmed that no ingredients used to make its peanut butter have come from any location operated by Peanut Corporation of America.[13]

Chances are; if you are reading this website it’s because you are not able to find a stubborn leak or perhaps you want to extend the life of your pond, fountain or pool. Actually pinpointing a leak is an extremely difficult task. As pond liners wear and concrete begins cracking many customers experience multiple leaks while others experience leaks only under certain conditions. What is worse is draining out a pond and fixing a leak only to discover another leak a month later. Well, we have the most cost effective and time saving solution for you. How nice would it be to fix your pond leak right the first time.

						The Industry's ONLY one coat pond sealer with a 10 year warranty! Fix/Repair Pond and Fountain Leaks ONCE with Pond Pro. Are you having difficulty finding that leak? Do your water levels keep dropping? Have you tried other products only to find out you still have the same issue?  Well not anymore; PondPro will solve your leak Guaranteed.  With a 25 year history of success, Pond Pro fixes; pond leaks, fountain leaks, reflecting pools and swimming pool leaks the first time. The product’s success is in its formulation which is based on a Urethane/Polyether chemistry that achieves high elongation and adhesion in total water immersion environments. So what does that mean?  Pond Pro has a unique drying process based on a catalyst you mix with the product. During the curing process the catalyst will force to the surface what would otherwise be trapped air; achieving what is called a chemical cross link that allows Pond Pro to chemically bond to the surface it is applied on. Pond Pro is 100% compatible with any existing EPDM pond liner as well as the other surfaces outlined below. Safe for both fish and plant life as well as frogs, turtles, tadpoles etc. PondPro is compatable with the following surfaces:

Concrete
Vinyl
Fiberglass
Acrylic
EPDM Ponds
Concrete Ponds
Pools
Reflecting Fountains
Concrete Storage Tanks
And many other applications call our office if you have a unique application

Pond Pro is a very stable and durable pond and pool sealant that will give you years of enjoyment and backed by the only 10 year warranty in the industry!
So what if you have previously applied another product over your pond?  Well we have a solution for that as well.  In the event there is another coatings over your original pond or surface you simply need to first apply a coat of the ProFlex Primer that can be purchased on our Order Form. Porous concrete cinder block must be troweled or stuccoed first in order for the Pond Pro to adhere. Reflecting pools are another outstanding use for Pond Pro. PondPro can be colored to any color you desire. You can customize the color by adding no more than three ounces per gallon of an universal colorant (Glycol Colorant for light colors and for medium to heavy colors use a solvent based colorant available at most paint stores). Colorant needs to be added BEFORE the catalyst is added.



To give you an idea of just how durable of a product Pond Pro 2000 is, take a look at a few of its characteristics:

Fix/Repair Pond Leaks with Pond Pro!
PondPro has been the choice of thousands of customers throughout the years. Unlike other pond sealants Pond Pro is guaranteed not to crack, peel or flake. Since it waterproofs immediately upon application you will never need to worry about watching out for the weather and worse spending money on another product; after getting delete an unexpected rain. No other pond coating can make that claim. Do it right the first time and save money with our one-coat system.
The success of Pond Pro comes from the fact that PondPro is a Silylated Hybrid Polymer combining ethylene and propylene with a diene monomer. It has excellent resistance to oxidation and UV degradation. Another important distinction is its ability to tolerate both low as well as high temperatures from -62° to over 300°F. Now of course, your pond will never be exposed to those temperatures but the point we are making is that the product has passed laboratory testing under very harsh standards and has maintained its original characteristics.

Manual Application Instructions for PondPro 2000





Surface preparation
Your pond surface needs to be clean, dry and structurally sound. We suggest not using any detergents in your pond. A soft bristle brush and water is all that is needed. You want the surface to be clean of any dirt that will be picked up with the nap of the roller or in the paintbrush used during the application process. Avoid cleaners and detergents since any remaining residue may harm your fish or plants. Only if your pond does not have plants or fish should you consider using a cleaning solution. On an epdm liner that has not been coated with other coatings it is simply a one coat application of PondPro2000. For ponds that have been coated with a 3rd party coating you will need to apply first the ProFlex primer followed by the PondPro. Any loose caulking needs to first be removed and replaced with the Rubex caulk on our order form. This Rubex caulk has been field tested to be compatible with the Pond Pro and will not void the warranty.  Any oil or wax must be completely removed with solvent (mineral spirits). Remove loose coatings with a scraper and wire brush. Whatever coatings still have good adhesion may remain and coated with the ProFlex Primer. NOTE: ProFlex must not be tacky when applying PondPro. Should you press down on the ProFlex and determine it is still tacky you need to wait before applying the PondPro. Generally this condition occurs 24 hours after the ProFlex has been applied. You also need to apply the ProFlex on a day with rain is not expected as it cannot rain on the ProFlex. Should it rain on the ProFlex you will need to sand the primer and recoat. Rusty or pitted metal should be wire brushed to remove loose oxide. Tightly adhering corrosion may be directly coated with PondPro 2000®.
Coverage:

PondPro 2000® coverage on a smooth surface is 50 sq. ft. per individual gallon. Each unit of PondPro 2000® comes with its own pre-measured bottle of catalyst, the activator that starts the curing process. Normal application rate is a 20 mil thickness which equates to about five individual pieces of paper. Please wait a full 48 hours before filling the pond; assuming it has not rained during that time. If it did rain on the newly coated PondPro simply add those additional hours to the original 48 hours once the rain has evaporated. Any unmixed material that you do not need can be stored for up to three years. If you need assistance calculating the coverage you can give our office a call toll free at:855-788-5836

How to Mix PondPro 2000



For PondPro 2000®

you may notice once you open the container there is adequate space to add the bottle of catalyst and mix the material in the same can. You will need a drill, and a gallon mixer attachment for this. Each bottle of catalyst is contained in the gallon box. When mixing you want to be sure that the drill is creating a vortex and that the material is mixed for a good 3-4 minutes. During the mixing you also want to bring the drill up and down and also in a circular motion so that the material is all distributed uniformly.

The Application Process

The most effective method of application is by a combination of brush, roller or squeegee. After mixing, pour out the material in a figure "S" pattern on the large flat surfaces of your pond by first distributing the material with a squeegee. When you notice the squeegee is not bringing any more material back on the rubber of the squeegee you then go back over the area with a 3/8 inch roller to level. For smaller ponds and verticals a paintbrush is the appropriate distribution method.




The Curing Process
One of the unique benefits of PondPro 2000® vs. other pond sealers on the market is that it cures by adding a unique catalyst to the quart or gallon can. Once the catalyst is mixed you have approximately 60-80 minutes to apply depending on temperature.  The higher the temperature the less pot life.  If you want to take your time you can mix half of the catalyst and half of the PondPro.  During the curing process there is very unique cross-linking process that occurs when the PondPro literally chemically bonds itself to the surface leaving no air trapped within the pond substrate and the PondPro. This is why the PondPro is the only pond product you will ever need to purchase in order to fix your leak right the first time.
Please allow a full 48 hours of temperatures of 32 degrees or above before you fill you pond with water. If the temperature goes below 32 degrees just add that lost time to your overall cure time. PondPro 2000® can tolerate extreme temperatures as low as forty degrees below zero and waterproofs immediately after it has been applied. So regardless of the area of the country you are in there is never a need to worry about the product cracking. Sunlight UV and humidity will have no effect on the product.
How to Mix ProFlex Primer
Note ProFlex is only required when another 3rd party coating was applied over the original pond substrate. Proflex Primer is a two component, ready to apply, flexible epoxy primer with a one to one volume mix ratio. ProFlex should not be tacky when applying PondPro. Should you press down on the ProFlex and determine it is still tacky please allow the ProFlex to dry a little longer.  Generally this condition occurs 24 hours after the ProFlex has been applied. You also want to apply the ProFlex on a day when rain is not expected as it cannot rain on the ProFlex. The day which you apply the ProFlex primer needs to be above 50 degrees. Lower temperatures at night will slow the cure but will not affect the product. Do not apply ProFlex if you anticipate freezing temperatures BEFORE you are able to apply the PondPro 2000

                        Product description: Pond Pro 2000 - Fix Fish Pond and Fountain leaks

Background
PondPro is a very durable two component Hybrid Polymer based on a Urethane/Polyether chemistry allowing for chemical cross-linking during the drying process. This unique process allows PondPro to literally chemically bond itself to the surface it is being applied on, resulting in a superior bond and at the same time a 100% expansion rate. The industry’s best solution for all non-porous concrete fountains, pools as well as fishponds liners and reflecting pools. These are demanding areas where the unique properties of Pond Pro have a distinct advantage over other products. PondPro 2000 is safe for fish and plant life as well as chlorinated water. This polymer (when cross-linked) is an excellent moisture barrier and resistant to oxidation and UV degradation. However, it's most important property is its ability to tolerate both low as well as high temperatures from  -62° to over 350° F as well as temperature swings through the day and night.
How does PondPro 2000 compare to other products?



 Water resistance 
PondPro 2000 is superior to epoxies, urethanes, acrylics, polyesters and alkyds at equal film thicknesses and is not affected by continuous immersion.


 UV resistance 
PondPro 2000 is equal or better than acrylics, polyesters or urethanes and much better than alkyds and epoxies.


 Temperature tolerance 
PondPro 2000 is better than all other coating polymers except silicones. EPDM can withstand live steam as well as cryogenic temperatures.


 Flexibility
PondPro 2000 is better than all other coating polymers except silicones. EPDM can withstand live steam as well as cryogenic temperatures.


 Chemical Resistance 
PondPro 2000 has very good resistance to strong alkali's, concentrated salt solutions, many acids, and alcohols.


Surface tolerance
PondPro 2000 will not bond to a surface that is damp with moisture. PondPro2000 also can be applied directly to metal surfaces that have tightly adhering corrosion without a primer.




Where can PondPro 2000 be used to its best advantage?
The unique combination of properties which PondPro 2000 possesses can be best utilized when they are applied to the exterior surfaces of stationary structures. Examples are:



Ponds and fountains
Concrete fishponds, fountains and reflecting pools are another good application for EPDM. Underwater applications such as these are very demanding and the unique characteristics of Pond Pro have the distinct over other products.


Air conditioning drip pans
Excellent moisture barrier and rust inhibitor.


Concrete tanks
The excellent waterproofing properties of EPDM will reduce or prevent spalling of concrete in cold climates.


Corrosive/humid 
Exposed structural steel on the interior of industrial buildings with humid or corrosive environments can be coated with minimal surface preparation. Plating operations, smelters, concrete casting


Impoundments
Liquid EPDM coatings are a good choice for exterior spill containment structures because of their excellent weathering and broad chemical resistance properties

Testimonial
It's amazing to see the difference when comparing these ponds before using the products to after. Many of my clients want an "all-natural" alternative to treating water with chemicals, and this is a great option. This treatment method also nicely compliments wetland plant community restoration, since it doesn't harm desirable emergent and transitional native plants. Once Healthy Pond popularity catches on, I can't see why everyone wouldn't want to treat their pond with this effective, all natural, and cost competitive product!"
Joe WaltonRestoration Biologist

Use our Pond Treatment Wizard if you need help determining the right treatment for your pond.
