 Transportation
We ship coal to our customers by rail, truck or barge. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the majority of our coal sales tonnage was shipped by rail. The majority of our coal is transported to customers by either the CSX Railroad or the Norfolk Southern Railroad in eastern Kentucky and by the Ohio Central Railroad or the Wheeling & Lake Erie Railroad in Ohio. In addition, in southeastern Ohio, we use our own trucking operations to transport coal to our customers where rail is not available. We use third-party trucking to transport coal to our customers in Utah. Shipments from our new Pennyrile mine in western Kentucky are transported to our customers via barge on the Green River as our Pennyrile property is adjacent to this waterway.  In addition, coal from certain of our other mines is located within economical trucking distance to the Big Sandy River and/or the Ohio River and can be transported by barge. It is customary for customers to pay the transportation costs to their location. We believe that we have good relationships with rail carriers and truck companies due, in part, to our modern coal-loading facilities at our loadouts and the working relationships and experience of our transportation and distribution employees.Coal used for domestic consumption is generally sold free-on-board at the mine, and the purchaser normally bears the transportation costs. Export coal, however, is usually sold at the loading port, and coal producers are responsible for shipment to the export coal-loading facility, with the buyer paying the ocean freight. Most electric generators arrange long-term shipping contracts with rail or barge companies to assure stable delivered costs. Transportation can be a large component of a purchasers total cost. Although the purchaser pays the freight, transportation costs still are important to coal mining companies because the purchaser may choose a supplier largely based on cost of transportation. Railroads account for a significant portion of transportation of U.S. coal shipments, while truck movements account for a much smaller portion. Trucks and overland conveyors haul coal over shorter distances, while barges, Great Lake carriers and ocean vessels move coal to export markets and domestic markets requiring shipment over the Great Lakes. Most coal mines are served by a single rail company, but much of the Powder River Basin is served by two competing rail carriers, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad. Rail competition in this major coal-producing region is important because rail costs constitute a significant portion of the delivered cost of Powder River Basin coal in eastern markets.

 Demand
Coal is primarily consumed by utilities to generate electricity. It is also used by steel companies to make steel products and by a variety of industrial users to heat and power foundries, cement plants, paper mills, chemical plants and other manufacturing and processing facilities. In general, coal is characterized by end use as either steam coal or metallurgical coal. Steam coal is used by electricity generators and by industrial facilities to produce steam, electricity or both. Metallurgical coal is refined into coke, which is used in the production of steel. Steam coal is used by electric utilities throughout the United States to generate power for industrial, commercial and residential consumption. For the year ended December 31, 2012, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed that the United States relied on coal for approximately 37% of its power generation, compared to approximately 30% for natural gas. Over the past ten years, EIA data shows that coal averaged approximately 46% as the source of power generation in the United States, compared to an average of approximately 22% for natural gas. We believe the decreased use of coal for power generation in the United States during 2012 was driven by historically low prices for natural gas, which caused utilities to switch from coal to cheaper natural gas for power generation. Our assumption indicates as natural gas prices return to more normal levels, the use of steam coal for power generation will increase from 2012 levels. However, we suspect that the use of steam coal for power generation in the United States will likely not return to historical levels due to government regulations of coal-fired power generation plants. Coal has historically been the lowest cost fossil fuel used for base-load electric power generation, being less expensive than natural gas or fuel oil. Coal-fueled generation is also competitive with nuclear power generation on a total cost per megawatt-hour basis. Thus, our belief is steam coal will remain a significant source of power generation in the United States in the future. In addition, the EIA reports that coal will remain the primary source of power generation world-wide as developing countries across the globe are projected to increase power generation in the future. As a result, our expectation is that steam coal exports from the United States to developing countries will increase in the future as world-wide power generation is forecast to grow through the year 2035. For metallurgical coal, we believe recent economic weakness in Europe and Asia has caused a decrease in the production of steel, which has had a negative effect on the world-wide demand and price of metallurgical coal used in the steel making process. We feel that when economic conditions improve in these areas, steel production will increase and world-wide demand for metallurgical coal will also increase.

	Rhino Resource Partners produces a full range of mid to high Btu and low to medium sulfur steam coal for electric utilities across the United States. We also produce metallurgical coal, a key ingredient used by steel producers worldwide. Our available coal qualities span a broad range, which allows us to create a mix that matches a wide variety of customer specifications.Customers value our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship. We are committed to keeping our employees well-trained and our safety record impeccable.We have a geographically diverse asset base with coal reserves located in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western Bituminous region. As of December 31, 2015, we controlled an estimated 363.6 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves and an estimated 436.8 million tons of non-reserve coal deposits. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold approximately 3.5 million tons of coal. Rhino Resource Partners controls significant coal deposits in various coal basins in the U.S. Our principal business strategy is to safely, efficiently and profitably produce and sell both steam and metallurgical coal from our diverse asset base. In addition, we intend to potentially diversify our operations through strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of long-term, cash generating natural resource assets. Our plan for executing this strategy includes the following key components:Maintain safe coal mining operations and environmental stewardship. Diversify our portfolio of natural resource assets. Grow operating cash flow by optimizing our coal production. Control the costs of our operations and optimize operational flexibility. Reduce exposure to commodity price risk through committed sales. Manage financial and legacy liabilities to maintain financial flexibility.

In the first quarter of 2017, we fully contracted our met and thermal forecasted production for the year. We expect the improved market situation will continue to provide positive financial results for the remainder of 2017. We continue to explore additional met coal sales to international customers, which could lead to additional financial upside for Rhino. We will expand our met production to meet the increased demand as additional contracts are finalized in the second quarter of 2017. Met coal test shipments to various international customers during the first quarter of 2017 were positive and we remain optimistic a long-term sales agreement can be reached which will further improve our financial results for the remainder of 2017.We continue to explore different financing alternatives for our existing credit facility and we believe a financing solution will be finalized in the next few months. The continued support of our sponsor, Royal Energy Resources, Inc. (  OTCQB :  ROYE ) ("Royal"), as well as our strong financial partner, Yorktown Partners LLC, provide us with a strong foundation for growth. We continue to keep our debt at historically low levels while we have invested capital dollars during the first quarter to expand our met coal production capabilities in our Central Appalachia operations. We believe our low debt level, strong balance sheet and additional met coal production capabilities position Rhino to be a significant competitor in the world-wide coal markets.We continually focus on safety as we have increased our year-over-year coal production capabilities to meet our committed sales during 2017. Our commitment to safety was recently evident as our Sands Hill operation in Ohio received recognition for the prevention of accidents in the workplace and celebrated over 500,000 hours of injury-free operations from June 2012 through December 2016. We are very proud of the employees that received this recognition and their commitment to a safe working environment.The continued resurgence in coal prices, particularly met coal prices, allowed us to execute favorable sales contracts for 2017 that provide us with substantial upside opportunity if we can continue to control our costs. We invested additional capital at our Central Appalachia mining complexes in the first quarter to increase production and all of our complexes in Central Appalachia are currently operating as we have strong contracted sales positons for our steam and met coal production for 2017. Our additional production capacity for 2017 in Central Appalachia allows us to take advantage of the resurgent met coal market and obtain additional coal sales that could provide us financial upside for the remainder of the year. Read MorePennyrile improved their operational capabilities which led to productivity improvements. Pennyrile was a positive cash flow producer for Rhino during the first quarter of 2017 and we are confident this trend will continue throughout 2017 as we are fully contracted and the mining cost has improved from historical periods.In Northern Appalachia, we shipped on our base-load sales contract at our Hopedale operation during the first quarter of 2017 and we continue to seek additional sales contracts for Hopedale to bring it to full production capacity for the remainder of 2017. Our Sands Hill operation in Northern Appalachia continued to produce positive results in the first quarter as we continue to control costs as we prepare this operation to cease coal production toward the end of the second quarter of 2017. The Sands Hill operations continued limestone sales exceeding the forecast and this helped bolster the financial results for this operation.At Rhino Western, we have a fully contracted sales position for the first half of 2017 at our Castle Valley operation as well as a base level of sales for the last six months of 2017. We continue to explore additional sales opportunities for our remaining open positions in the back half of 2017and we expect this operation to be a positive cash flow contributor for 2017.Overall, we are encouraged by the rally in prices in the coal markets and we believe upside exists for Rhino for the remainder of 2017 as we continue to focus on cost and cash generation to bring added value to our unitholders."Coal Operations UpdatePennyrilePennyrile's long-term sales contracts have committed sales of 1.3 million tons for full-year 2017, which represents Rhino's total capacity at current production levels. Sales volume was 341,000 tons, versus 316,000 in the prior year and 286,000 in the prior quarter. For the first quarter, coal revenues per ton increased to $49.32 compared to $46.98 in the prior year and $47.57 in the prior quarter due to higher contracted sales prices. Cost of operations per ton was $41.55 versus $40.16 in the prior year and $40.14 in the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to the increase in production period-over-period. Central AppalachiaCoal revenues were $23.3 million, versus $5.6 million in the prior year and $16.0 million in the prior quarter. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the increase in coal prices and demand for met coal tons sold from this region. Coal revenues per ton in the quarter was $72.00 versus $56.00 in the prior year and $60.14 in the prior quarter. Metallurgical coal revenue per ton in the quarter was $84.82 versus $81.61 in the prior year and $63.97 in the prior quarter. Steam coal revenue in the quarter was $52.31 per ton versus $51.02 in the prior year and $50.98 in the prior quarter. Sales volume was 324,000 tons in the quarter versus 100,000 in the prior year and 266,000 tons in the prior quarter.  Cost of operations per ton in the quarter was $56.82 versus $68.36 in the prior year. The decrease in cost per ton period-over-period was due to an increase in tons sold that was primarily due to the increase in met coal demand compared to the prior year.  Central Appalachia sales are fully contracted through 2017 at current production levels.  Rhino WesternCoal revenues per ton in the quarter was $38.19 versus $38.08 in the prior year and $38.61 in the prior quarter. Coal revenues per ton increased year-over-year due to higher contracted prices for coal from our Castle Valley operation. Sales volume was 191,000 tons versus 252,000 tons in the prior year and 247,000 tons in the prior quarter. The decrease in coal sales in the first quarter of 2017 was the result of losing approximately two weeks of production due to maintenance issues at our Castle Valley operation. The maintenance issues have been corrected and production has resumed to previous levels. The Partnership expects Castle Valley to ship additional tons in the second quarter of 2017 to make up for the lower tons sold in the first quarter. Cost of operations per ton was $35.26 versus $32.48 in the prior year and $32.96 in the prior quarter. The increase in the cost of operations per ton was the result of the fixed operating costs being allocated to lower sales at our Castle Valley operation due to the maintenance issues discussed above.  Northern AppalachiaSales volume was 118,000 tons, versus 123,000 tons in the prior year and 103,000 tons in the prior quarter. Sales were lower period-over-period due to decreased sales volumes from our Sands Hills operation which is ceasing coal production during the second quarter of 2017 due to weak demand for coal from the Northern Appalachia region. The decrease at our Sands Hill operation was partially offset by an increase in sales from our Hopedale operation. For the first quarter, coal revenues per ton decreased $17.19 to $37.10 due to lower prices at our Hopedale and Sands Hill operations compared to the prior year.  Cost of operations increased by $3.3 million to $6.2 million from $2.9 million in the prior year and $5.9 in the prior quarter. The prior year's cost of operations was impacted by a prior service cost benefit of $3.9 million resulting from the cancellation of the postretirement benefit plan at our Hopedale operation. Capital ExpendituresMaintenance capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $1.8 million. Expansion capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $4.8 million. Sales CommitmentsThe table below displays Rhino's committed coal sales for the periods indicated.                  Q2 to Q4 2017   Year 2018       Avg Price   Tons   Avg Price   Tons   Northern Appalachia/Illinois Basin   $ 45.79   1,315,000   $ 47.08   150,000   Rhino Western   $ 38.42   506,208   $ -   -   Central Appalachia   $ 71.11   1,078,900   $ 58.02   551,000   Total   $ 53.93   2,900,108   $ 55.68   701,000                                                  Evaluating Financial ResultsRhino management uses a variety of financial measurements to analyze the Partnership's performance, including (1) Adjusted EBITDA, (2) coal revenues per ton and (3) cost of operations per ton.Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before deducting interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, depletion and amortization, while also excluding certain non-cash and/or non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management primarily as a measure of the operating performance of the Partnership's segments. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies calculate Adjusted EBITDA identically, the Partnership's calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. (Refer to "Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA" included later in this release for reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures).Coal Revenues Per Ton. Coal revenues per ton sold represents coal revenues divided by tons of coal sold. Coal revenues per ton is a key indicator of Rhino's effectiveness in obtaining favorable prices for the Partnership's product.Cost of Operations Per Ton. Cost of operations per ton sold represents the cost of operations (exclusive of depreciation, depletion and amortization) divided by tons of coal sold. Rhino management uses this measurement as a key indicator of the efficiency of operations.Overview of Financial ResultsResults for the three months ended March 31, 2017 included:Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $4.8 million and net loss from continuing operations of $2.0 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $5.5 million and a net loss from continuing operations of $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations decreased period over period primarily due to the prior service benefit of $3.9 million resulting from the cancellation of the postretirement benefit plan at our Hopedale operation during the 2016 period. Including net income from discontinued operations of approximately $0.9 million, total net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $1.2 million while Adjusted EBITDA was $6.6 million. We did not incur a gain or loss from discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2017. Basic and diluted net loss per common unit from continuing operations of $0.22 compared to basic and diluted net loss per common unit from continuing operations of $0.58 for the first quarter of 2016.  Coal sales were 1.0 million tons, which was an increase of 23.2% compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to increased sales from Central Appalachia operations. Total revenues and coal revenues of $53.6 million and $51.8 million, respectively, compared to $39.3 million and $36.7 million, respectively, for the same period of 2016. Coal revenues per ton of $53.19 compared to $46.42 for the first quarter of 2016, an increase of 14.6%.  Cost of operations from continuing operations of $44.9 million compared to $29.5 million for the same period of 2016 as production was increased in the Central Appalachia region to meet the increase demand for met coal during the first quarter of 2017. Cost of operations per ton from continuing operations of $46.16 compared to $37.33 for the first quarter of 2016, an increase of 23.7%.  Total coal revenues increased approximately 41.2% period-over-period primarily due to the increase in production in Central Appalachia resulting from recent increases in coal prices and demand for met coal. Coal revenues per ton increased primarily due to a higher mix of higher priced tons sold from Central Appalachia compared to the same period of 2016. Total cost of production increased by 52.4% during the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to an increase of $11.6 million in total cost of operations in Central Appalachia, which was also the result of increased production in Central Appalachia due to increase in demand for met coal from this region. The increase in the cost of operations on a per ton basis was primarily due to the prior service cost benefit recognized in the Northern Appalachia operations for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the current period. Segment InformationThe Partnership produces and markets coal from surface and underground mines in Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio and Utah. For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Partnership had four reportable business segments: Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia, Rhino Western and Illinois Basin. Additionally, the Partnership has an Other category that includes its ancillary businesses.                        (In millions, except per ton data and %)   First Quarter 2017     First Quarter 2016     % Change* 1Q17 / 1Q16     Central Appalachia                         Coal revenues   $ 23.3     $ 5.6     315.4 %   Total revenues   $ 23.3     $ 5.6     315.4 %   Coal revenues per ton*   $ 72.00     $ 56.00     28.6 %   Cost of operations   $ 18.4     $ 6.8     168.8 %   Cost of operations per ton*   $ 56.82     $ 68.36     (16.9 %)   Tons produced     0.331       0.084     292.7 %   Tons sold     0.324       0.100     223.3 %   Northern Appalachia                         Coal revenues   $ 4.4     $ 6.7     (34.1 %)   Total revenues   $ 6.1     $ 9.2     (33.1 %)   Coal revenues per ton*   $ 37.10     $ 54.29     (31.7 %)   Cost of operations   $ 6.2     $ 2.9     117.7 %   Cost of operations per ton*   $ 52.53     $ 23.28     125.7 %   Tons produced     0.120       0.111     7.8 %   Tons sold     0.118       0.123     (3.5 %)   Rhino Western                         Coal revenues   $ 7.3     $ 9.6     (24.0 %)   Total revenues   $ 7.3     $ 9.6     (24.0 %)   Coal revenues per ton*   $ 38.19     $ 38.08     0.3 %   Cost of operations   $ 6.7     $ 8.2     (17.6 %)   Cost of operations per ton*   $ 35.26     $ 32.48     8.6 %   Tons produced     0.187       0.238     (21.5 %)   Tons sold     0.191       0.252     (24.2 %)   Illinois Basin                         Coal revenues   $ 16.8     $ 14.8     13.3 %   Total revenues   $ 16.8     $ 14.8     13.0 %   Coal revenues per ton   $ 49.32     $ 46.98     5.0 %   Cost of operations   $ 14.2     $ 12.7     11.7 %   Cost of operations per ton   $ 41.55     $ 40.16     3.5 %   Tons produced     0.344       0.327     5.1 %   Tons sold     0.341       0.316     7.9 %   Other**                         Coal revenues     n/a       n/a     n/a     Total revenues   $ 0.1     $ 0.1     (94.3 %)   Coal revenues per ton     n/a       n/a     n/a     Cost of operations   $ (0.6 )   $ (1.1 )   (48.0 %)   Cost of operations per ton     n/a       n/a     n/a     Total                         Coal revenues   $ 51.8     $ 36.7     41.2 %   Total revenues   $ 53.6     $ 39.3     36.2 %   Coal revenues per ton*   $ 53.19     $ 46.42     14.6 %   Cost of operations   $ 44.9     $ 29.5     52.4 %   Cost of operations per ton*   $ 46.16     $ 37.33     23.7 %   Tons produced     0.982       0.760     29.0 %   Tons sold     0.974       0.791     23.2 %                            * Percentages, totals and per ton amounts are calculated based on actual amounts and not the rounded amounts presented in this table.** The activities performed by Rhino's ancillary businesses do not directly relate to coal production.

Therefore, actual results and developments could materially differ from Rhino's historical experience, present expectations and what is expressed, implied or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: Rhino's inability to obtain additional financing necessary to fund its capital expenditures, meet working capital needs and maintain and grow its operations and its related ability to continue as a going concern or its inability to obtain alternative financing upon the expiration of its amended and restated senior secured credit facility; Rhino's future levels of indebtedness, liquidity and compliance with debt covenants; volatility and recent declines in the price of Rhino's common units; sustained depressed levels of or decline in coal prices, which depend upon several factors such as the supply of domestic and foreign coal, the demand for domestic and foreign coal, governmental regulations, price and availability of alternative fuels for electricity generation and prevailing economic conditions; declines in demand for electricity and coal; current and future environmental laws and regulations, which could materially increase operating costs or limit Rhino's ability to produce and sell coal; extensive government regulation of mine operations, especially with respect to mine safety and health, which imposes significant actual and potential costs; difficulties in obtaining and/or renewing permits necessary for operations; the availability and prices of competing electricity generation fuels; a variety of operating risks, such as unfavorable geologic conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, mining and processing equipment unavailability, failures and unexpected maintenance problems and accidents, including fire and explosions from methane; poor mining conditions resulting from the effects of prior mining; the availability and costs of key supplies and commodities such as steel, diesel fuel and explosives; fluctuations in transportation costs or disruptions in transportation services, which could increase competition or impair Rhino's ability to supply coal; a shortage of skilled labor, increased labor costs or work stoppages; Rhino's ability to secure or acquire new or replacement high-quality coal reserves that are economically recoverable; material inaccuracies in Rhino's estimates of coal reserves and non-reserve coal deposits; existing and future laws and regulations regulating the emission of sulfur dioxide and other compounds, which could affect coal consumers and reduce demand for coal; federal and state laws restricting the emissions of greenhouse gases; Rhino's ability to acquire or failure to maintain, obtain or renew surety bonds used to secure obligations to reclaim mined property; Rhino's dependence on a few customers and its ability to find and retain customers under favorable supply contracts; changes in consumption patterns by utilities away from the use of coal, such as changes resulting from low natural gas prices; changes in governmental regulation of the electric utility industry; defects in title in properties that Rhino owns or losses of any of its leasehold interests; Rhino's ability to retain and attract senior management and other key personnel; material inaccuracy of assumptions underlying reclamation and mine closure obligations; and weakness in global economic conditions.Other factors that could cause Rhino's actual results to differ from its projected results are described in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Rhino undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law.        RHINO RESOURCE PARTNERS LP     UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION     AS OF MARCH 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016     (in thousands)         March 31,     December 31,         2017     2016     ASSETS                   CURRENT ASSETS:                     Cash and cash equivalents   $ 36     $ 47       Accounts receivable, net of allowance     19,644       13,893       Inventories     8,928       8,050       Prepaid expenses and other     9,803       9,563         Total current assets     38,411       31,553     Net property, plant & equipment, incl coal properties, mine development and construction costs     182,983       182,307     Investment in unconsolidated affiliates     5,117       5,121     Intangible purchase option     21,750       21,750     Note receivable -

 Central Appalachia
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we operated two mining complexes located in Central Appalachia consisting of one active underground mine and three surface mines. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the mines at our Tug River and Rob Fork mining complexes produced an aggregate of approximately 0.4 million tons of steam coal and an estimated 0.3 million tons of metallurgical coal.  As of December 31, 2016, we controlled an estimated 70.7 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves and an estimated 46.8 million tons of non-reserve coal deposits in Central Appalachia.  
 
Tug River Mining Complex: Our Tug River mining complex consists of property in Kentucky and West Virginia that borders the Tug River. As of December 31, 2016, the Tug River mining complex included an estimated 21.4 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves. Our Tug River mining complex produces coal from two company-operated surface mines, which includes one high-wall mining unit. Coal production from these operations is delivered to the Tug Fork preparation plant for processing and then transported by truck to the Jamboree rail loadout for blending and shipping. The Jamboree loadout is located on the Norfolk Southern Railroad and is a modern unit train loadout with batch weighing equipment.  
 
Rob Fork Mining Complex: Our Rob Fork mining complex is located in eastern Kentucky and, as of December 31, 2016, included an estimated 7.2 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves. Our Rob Fork mining complex produces coal from one company-operated surface mine and one company-operated underground mine. The Rob Fork mining complex is located on the CSX Railroad and consists of a modern preparation plant utilizing heavy media circuitry that is capable of cleaning coarse and fine coal size fractions and a unit train loadout with batch weighing equipment. The mining complex has significant blending capabilities allowing the blending of raw coals with washed coals to meet a wide variety of customers needs.
