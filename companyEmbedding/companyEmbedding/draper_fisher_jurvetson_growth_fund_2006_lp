About | DFJ Venture Capital




























FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS WE’VE CELEBRATED IDEA MAKERS WHO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF POSSIBILITY











Welcome to DFJ
At DFJ, we work with big thinkers to bring their bold ideas to life. We like to think you can experience the DFJ difference by just walking through our front door. No fancy art here – instead you'll find rockets, satellites, robots, and 3D printers – the fruits of great entrepreneurial achievement. We invest in technology companies serving the needs of consumers and enterprises, as well as companies creating disruptive technologies such as commercial space exploration, robotics, and sustainable transportation. Some of our investments include Baidu (Nasdaq: BIDU), Box (NYSE: BOX), Cylance, Nervana (Intel), Planet, Skype, SolarCity (Nasdaq: SCTY), SpaceX, Tesla Motors (Nasdaq: TSLA), Twilio (NYSE: TWLO), Twitter (NYSE: TWTR), Tumblr (Yahoo!), Unity, Yammer (Microsoft), and Zoox.
We back early stage and growth stage companies

DFJ began in 1985 with a focus on early-stage companies. A decade ago, we added our Growth team dedicated to late-stage investing. Today, we have two teams investing two funds. Our Venture team works with founders in the early phases of company building. Our Growth team partners with companies entering hyper-growth mode. DFJ has backed 24 companies that have each achieved more than $1 billion in realized value through an initial public offering or acquisition.
DFJ supports bold thinkers who 
build enduring companies – 
24 DFJ investments have exited 
at greater than $1 billion each.
We are committed to building successful businesses
Entrepreneurs with the most ambitious visions come to us to nurture and launch companies that change the world. We work with entrepreneurs like Aaron Levie, Robin Li, Elon Musk, and Lyndon Rive to answer the central question in any market disruption: How big would this opportunity be if we put the right team together with the right resources? Our team helps clear the path for great new businesses to thrive and we work side by side with the entrepreneur and his or her team to help with recruiting, business development, partnering – whatever it takes. We genuinely understand what it takes for a company to succeed.
