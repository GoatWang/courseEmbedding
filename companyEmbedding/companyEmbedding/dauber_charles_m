Good day, and welcome to the American Electric Technologies to Report First Quarter 2015 Results and Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.
This press conference contains forward-looking statements, as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, concerning anticipated future demand for our products and other future plans and objectives. While the Company believes that such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumption, there can be no assurance but such future revenues, profits, plans and objectives will be achieved on the scheduled or in the amounts indicated. Investors are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.
Actual events or results may differ from the Company’s expectations, and are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those listed in Item 1A of the Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2015. The Company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements, even if experience or future events make it clear that any of the projected results expressed or implied herein will not be realized.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Charles M. Dauber, President and CEO American Electric Technologies. Please go ahead, sir.
Charles Dauber
Thank you, Kevin. Good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome you all to American Electric Technologies' first quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today is our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Andy Puhala.
For our call today, I'm going to start with a review of our first quarter results and then I'll Andy walk you through some more financial details before I come back with some additional comments on our business. We'll then move to a question-and-answer session coordinated by the moderator.
I'll start by saying that I am pleased to report that the Company reported consolidated revenues in the quarter of 15.3 million up 12% from 13.7 million in Q4 although down slightly compared with Q1 last year. Gross margins improved by $2.3 million in the quarter to 15% up from 0% in the fourth quarter but down slightly versus the 15.4% in Q1 of last year.
Consolidated income from continuing operations was 0.3 million for Q1 which was a $2.6 million improvement over Q4 but was down versus the 0.5 million in Q1 last year. The revenue increased, gross margin increased and the consolidated income improvement were all directly related to the successful resolution of the operational execution, new product introduction issues the Company faced in both Q3 and Q4 of last year. As we said in our Q4 earnings call, the company expected to be through those issues by the end of the year which we were and that for Q1 we would be returning to more traditional gross margin levels which we have.
I'm proud of the team for the hard work and improving our operational execution from the resulting financial progress for the Company. I'll now the call over to Andy for some deeper financial discussion before I come back and provide more thoughts on our markets, on our business so far in 2015.
Andy Puhala
Thanks Charles. As Charles mentioned, our consolidated revenues for the quarter were 15.3 million up 12% from Q4. Gross margins improved by 2.3 million to 15% and our consolidated income from continuing operations was 0.3 million for Q1, a 2.6 million improvement since last quarter which demonstrated the execution issues in our U.S. business are being addressed.

Turning to our JV's the net equity income from our foreign joint ventures after expenses was essentially breakeven for the quarter. Our BOMAY joint venture in China had revenues of 8.8 million for the quarter up from 5.9 million in Q4 but down 10.8 million versus Q1 of last year. BOMAY is an unconsolidated investment in our 40% share of BOMAY's net equity income was 191,000 in the quarter. Due to Chinese macroeconomic issues we expect BOMAY to remain profitable but don't expect it to return to 2014 levels during the current year.
Our joint venture MIEFE in Singapore lost $184,000 on 1.7 million of revenue in Q1. Our share of the loss was about $75,000 in the quarter. The Southeast Asia oil and gas market will be down in 2015 based on the drop in oil prices but we are working closely with our joint venture partners Sonepar to integrate MIEFE sales organization to build backlog and improve performance for the Company into the second half of 2015.
Net income attributable to common shareholders was 0.2 million for the first quarter or $0.02 per common share compared to a loss of 2.1 million or $0.25 per common share in the fourth quarter of last year, but it was down from 0.5 million of profits and $0.09 of earnings per common share in Q1 of 2014.
Moving to the balance sheet and the cash flows we ended Q1 with 2.6 million of cash on hand and 4 million of total debt which was unchanged from the end of last year. Our working capital needs increased during the quarter a result of higher revenue levels in large projects with long production cycles as well as timing on some payment milestones. Net cash used in operating activities during the quarter was approximately $0.5 million.
As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate receiving our normal BOMAY dividend of approximately $800,000 to $1 million this quarter along with the smaller dividend from our Singapore joint venture MIEFE.
Turning to our backlog, we ended the quarter with backlog of 18.6 million down from the near record backlog in Q4, were 40% higher than the backlog at this same time last year. Particularly given the low oil price environment we believe this year-over-year backlog increase shows the strong progress we've made in our sales and manufacturing capabilities and product offering since this time last year. Charles will provide some additional color on the territory and sector details for our backlog a little bit later in the call.
I'll conclude my remarks with the comment on our segment reporting. You may have noticed that we no longer show our TP&S and E&I segments in the tables of our press release. Due to the sale of our American access technologies business and the reorganization of our business under our Chief Operating Officer, we have determined that our business now consisted a single segment and we'll not report multiple operating segments in the future earnings releases or in our public filings a related benefit of this change is we think this presentation of a single segment will improve the clarity and to ease of use of our financial statements for more information on our segment reporting please see this quarter's 10-Q we will file on or before May 15. 
With that I'll turn it back over to Charles for some additional commentary and outlook on the business.
Charles Dauber
Thanks, Andy. I'd like to now share with you all more information about our market sectors and our business. As I discussed earlier, we feel the Company has successfully turned the corner with the operational execution issues we faced in the second half of last year. I believe that at this time the Company is best positioned for growth than we've been at any time in our history. With the products, the capacity and the team that really take our Company to the next level of revenues and profits.

With that said, the energy market that we participate in has continuingly experienced challenges related to drop in oil prices and I want to walk you through our market sectors and give you more color about our business.
Let's start with our oil and gas market sector. In Q1, our oil and gas related business continues to be the primary revenue driver representing 75% or 11.5 million of revenue, up significantly from the 8.9 million in Q4 but down from the 13.6 million in Q1 last year. Gross margins for the oil and gas business were 14% in Q1, up from the negative 1% in Q4 but down slightly from the 15% in Q1 last year. As I've highlighted in previous calls and as is described in the Investor Relation's presentations available on our Web site, the Company operates in three distinct parts of the oil and gas sector, upstream which is the finding and the getting the oil or gas out of the ground, which includes land and offshore drilling and offshore production, midstream, oil and gas which includes pipeline and gas processing and downstream oil and gas which includes refining petrochem and L&G type applications.
Another way to look at our oil and gas business is to separate our oil-related projects from our natural gas-related projects now a drilling rig power system doesn't necessarily care it’s drilling for oil or gas. But the owner of the rig certainly cares. We essentially have six distinct subsectors within the oil and natural gas markets that we participate in upstream, midstream and downstream oil-related and upstream, midstream and downstream natural gas-related projects. When I look at our business in the oil and gas market sector, I see that the vast majority of our recent projects are related to midstream and downstream natural gas or related to downstream oil, none of which are directly tied to the oil prices.
In the quarter the Company did receive notice that two oil-related projects on our backlog were being canceled by our customers. One was an upstream oil drilling rig power system from oil drilling focused customer and the other was a midstream oil punch line power system project where the customer cancelled two of the three PDC systems they had ordered from us. As a result, we've reduced backlog accordingly by $2.5 million. As we grow the Company, our backlog continues to be lumpy our oil and gas-related backlog for the quarter was 17.5 million down 7.5 million from the end of Q4 but up $10 million from the 7 million in Q1 of last year.
Among our new oil and gas sector bookings, was a multimillion dollar PDC project with a midstream focused engineering company for a cryogenic natural gas plants. So during this low oil price environment, we continue to focus on the natural gas-related midstream and downstream opportunities and the downstream oil projects like refineries that are not yet tied to the price of a barrel of oil. And at the same time, we're also focusing on upgrade and services work in the oil and gas sector.
This week in Houston was the oil, I am sorry right the offshore technology conference, which is the largest oil and gas conference in the world. I was pleasantly surprised with the attendance of the conference although the mood was slightly subdued, there were actually numerous companies with projects that they described as funded even at current oil price levels that they were actively looking for solutions for. The clear driver for the show was how to reduce operating expenses and make these oil-related projects profitable at lower oil price levels.
At the show, we announced a strategic partnership with a private company called FlexGen Power Systems to bring energy storage technology to the drilling industry. This FlexGen hybrid generator product uses electrical storage to smooth out the power requirement spikes on a diesel or natural gas generator, essentially how a hybrid vehicle operates. For their original military applications and for the drilling applications, this product is able to achieve a 30% reduction in fuel consumption for the operator, which is a significant part of the operating cost of a drilling rig. Our agreement with FlexGen is for M&I business to sell, to manufacture, install and service the FlexGen units in our oil and gas markets globally. This initiative fits very well into our strategy of bringing innovative solutions into the energy markets and we've already had customer interest in this product. I'll update you on our upcoming call as things progress with this partnership.

One of our other key growth initiatives this year is our M&I Electric Brazil subsidiary. M&I Electric Brazil had revenues of over $600,000 for the quarter which was essentially flat versus Q4. As ever since our last earnings call, Brazil's made significant sales progress that I want to share with you. We are now on the approved suppliers list for over 25 companies in Brazil. We've received orders from many of our old customers from our former joint venture and several new customers as the old joint venture did not do business well. We also correct that we are now on Petrobras approved suppliers list and we're receiving orders directly from Petrobras for the first time. Although the Brazil, in macroeconomic environment is challenging, we remain positive in our outlook for the rest of 2015 and I look forward with sharing with you more updates from Brazil and our upcoming earnings call.
So to summarize this part of the call, our balanced approach to the oil and natural gas markets gives us counter cyclicality and even with the oil prices decline we remain positive about our opportunities in the midstream and downstream parts of this market to at least, the end of 2015. We believe the company is well positioned compared with our single sector oriented competitors to weather this oil priced drought driven storm facing the upstream market.
I'll now turn towards our power generation distribution market sector which was 17% of our quarterly revenues of $2.6 million. Gross margins for the power gen business was 22% for the quarter, up from 1% in Q4 and up from 20% in Q1 last year. Although power gen backlog is significantly down and remain highly lumpy, we are quite positive about the significant increase in bidding opportunities. Coming from both current and new potential break in customers, this comes from both engine generator related power generation opportunities as well as in increasing amount of based load combined cycle power plants. And look forward to reporting on power generation progress in our upcoming call.
Moving into our non energy related Marine and Industrial Sector, revenues were $1.2 million for the quarter compared with $1.5 million in Q4 and $1.6 million in Q1 last year. Our marine sector business is starting to see a slight increase in opportunities but the real story here is the growth in our industrial business which is coming from our growing penetration, a top tier engineering procurement in construction firm, which I started talking about, last quarter. In Q1 we booked a multimillion dollar PDC project order for a chemical company to a first tier EPC firm, which was our first order ever with [indiscernible] chemical company in with that, the top tier engineering firm, all of this phased on the investment in Sales and Marketing and products that we began in 2013 and continued in 2014.
We expect to continue to see further growth from this sector beyond those types of projects this year. Before we proceed with the Q&A session, I'd like to conclude this prepared portion of my comments by again thanking our employees for hard work, thanking our customers and shareholders for their support. Company is positive as we move forward in second half of 2015, and look forward to continuing to execute on our strategy. This concludes the prepared portion of my comments and I'll turn the call over to Kevin for the Q&A section of the call.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Greg Ayers. Your line is now open.
Greg Ayers
Thanks and good morning. Charles, I was wondering if you could just please repeat what you said earlier about the majority of projects right now are I think it was and I didn’t I was [indiscernible] are mid and downstream gas or downstream oil, is that correct?

Charles Dauber
Yes, so, and you've seen this before right, so you remember we do the upstream which is the drilling lane and offshore, drilling and offshore production and then we do the pipelines, now that's the midstream in the gas processing, as midstream and the downstream as refining Petrochem and L&G. So if I look at our business, the majority of that business is coming from the midstream and downstream markets, for both oil and gas, but primarily it's midstream and downstream natural gas, and it's all the way downstream which is refining type stuff of oil. So we're not seeing as much drilling business as we had in the last year, because of oil prices.
Greg Ayers
Okay. And could you just repeat it again, so I can get this clear. There are two PDC projects cancelled, those are midstream oil pipeline power systems, is that correct?
Charles Dauber
We had an order for three PDC's from this one customer and they cancelled two of the three PDC is in that particular order.
Greg Ayers
And that was $2.5 million with the backlog
Charles Dauber
It was that reduction in backlog, that 2.5 million reduction in backlog, let say two-thirds of that was from those two projects and the remainder was from a we've received in order about a year ago for two drilling rigs and we delivered one and they can [indiscernible] for another drilling like power system. So, again those are both that's an upstream and midstream oil related project as we what saw the cancellations in, nothing related in natural gas, nothing related to downstream
Greg Ayers
Got it and there is the PDC some sales and that was kind of primary issue from 2014, the actual manufacturing flow of the PDCs, slower than you would wanted, would you say yes to the statement that the manufacturing which is in the slowdowns for PDCs are behind you at this time.
Charles Dauber
So, the answer is yes. We believe those issues are behind us, there was actually two issues from last quarter if you remember one was the introduction of variety of new products, which was some switch gear in the PDCs and the other was just scaling up our volumes that would be able to handle this large amounts of projects and fair low and we believe, we've solved both are the new product introduction issues, including the PDCs and the ability to handle multiple large PDC projects in fair low. So we feel really good about that going forward.
Greg Ayers
Understood and part of what you've been driving for all the last couple of years has been to increase these companies ability to execute larger ticket projects, more or larger ticket projects at larger size to through the growth at the whole scope of the company's revenue based, would you say that -- are you seeing those larger projects come on to bid for you and are you seeing success in bidding on those largest sizes -- if you look at what you've been working on say in the first quarter versus a year ago or two years ago.
Charles Dauber
So, I'll just take at the easy answer, which is if you actually go to our shop or you're going to see as multiple 80 foot long gigantic PDC is all going on at the same time, we've never had that in our entire history as the company, which is never happened, right? So those PDC is maybe anywhere between $1 million and $4 million size projects for the company traditionally have been operating at the 1 million to 2 million size. I think so, doubling size of the average selling price of these PDCs has happened that's already done. So, what the next phase is the one that actually get even more interesting, which is as we increase the capabilities of our sales team and focused on these larger projects, we're starting to bid projects that are now $5 million, $7 million, $10 million project, which maybe multiple PDCs from the same customer project, or maybe so big, that can actually do it in one PDC, they have to break up in the multiple smaller assignments and so we've starting bidding those recently, none of those were get the closed, one where the other but we're on the approve suppliers list and we're bidding them and as customer is coming to the plant and see all these giant buildings going on in parallel they feel very, very confident our ability to pull this project that so, we feel confident about that continued growth with the sales team in placed and the operational capability including the oil price as well.

Operator
[Operator Instructions] You will go next to Bill Dezellem. Your line is now open.
Bill Dezellem
The backlog, I've recognized it is somewhat be but I'm curious to you view at as having seasonality in of some sort and it's -- what's the Q1 seasonality 
Charles Dauber
Bill, I don't know if I have a strong view of the seasonality of the backlog. We've looked -- we didn't going back and look at backlog over the last year but I think our markets are changing quickly enough but I'm not sure I can sort of make an interpretation of historical thing, oil was at different position for backlog last year we had with two large offshore drilling projects. There is not anymore large offer for drilling projects coming through this quarter or next quarter. So, it's -- I don't think that is actually a seasonality thing, I think, we've more based on where we are with our markets and where our sales team as in customer penetration versus any seasonality thing, that being said there is probably some just market seasonality where I'd -- thing will probably cool offer with the summer time, [indiscernible] on the vacation but, then attends to take backup but I don't know by of hard trend for you on that -- I can really sort of step back and look that, sorry.
Bill Dezellem
No, go ahead.
Charles Dauber
I do think at the lumpiness of the business is going to still be an issue for us. If you think about the question that Craig just ask, which is just we're going after this larger projects the timing of the orders and just things -- up and down but -- we need to go continue to book business and we're in -- we need to continue to book more
Bill Dezellem
And actually on that note, can you give any broad with characterization -- are you feeling better about your market today not your positioning within but just the market space are not as good as given the energy prices.
Charles Dauber
You mean versus our last call. 
Bill Dezellem
Yes.
Charles Dauber
I just walked through our sectors by -- but I think I feel like better about the thrilling market just based on OTC yesterday. I don’t expect that's going to be a big source of growth rise this year but now we are forecasting that to be a down this year and I still think, we see opportunities in the -- sure this is and I think may be tiny-tiny-tiny of it better than I did a month or two ago but still significantly downwards a last year. Midstream is probably flat from where it was in -- I think downstream is probably consistent and I felt good about the midstream and downstream parts of the market, wealth is solidified or at least the last couple of weeks in other $50 range and unattractive in last week or two but I think as price is tend to stabilized people are able to move forward with projects slightly better.
In general, I'm not bullish on oil related projects for the short term, I'm still bullish on the natural gas related midstream downstream and oil related downstream project. Power Gen. I think the market is consistent so I feel good about that and I talked about the Marine and Industrial markets I think, are probably flat, so more of my optimisms coming from a markets for holding and our ability to succeed in those markets versus any market growth particular a dynamite.
Bill Dezellem
I think that's great, I'll take you to my next question which is the execution issues that you have in the second half of last year. Did any of those linger or bleed into the first quarter. 
Charles Dauber
I would say the big project that we have that we talked about on last call are shift in Q4 and so the -- we had essentially three problem children project that I had mentioned we need to make sure, we got all that on time, we need to made to make sure it had good quality for breaking customers and we fit the bullet in Q3 and Q4 to make sure those pipelines. So, if I look at the gross margins for our business in Q3 they are almost backup to the traditional gross margin levels and I think this is project issues are behind us. That's not to say, we are not going to have continued improvement or it can cause reduction inefficiency that are gone forever. Right. But, yes I think those acquisition is usually behind us.

Bill Dezellem
Great and finally you made some comments about Brazil, which are you going a bit more detail as seems as though the opportunity may be appearing larger there over the next couple of years and what you would have thought? 
Charles Dauber
But the part that's interesting about Brazil is the macroeconomic is very, it's involving, it's challenging, there is a bunch of stuff going around in brazil between the government and Petrobras and the customers and so it's almost like the environment is turning around but in the mean time our sales team and our operations team in Brazil are quietly going about getting orders, breaking in to customers, working on project, getting paid for those project so we're still amount in Brazil where -- us going from zero to multimillion dollar year the share makes a difference gross limit that's a nice driver for our top line growth. So, I can't tell the size of the Brazil market right now, I can tell you the team we've got but together and the progress we making on the sale side which is obviously the front end to continuing the grow the business is making very good progress, so we are very pleased with that.
So, I think they are doing the right things, I think that growth is also going to be lumpy --not lumpy it's more, I think they are going to grow when the move to the plateau and then we'll grow and so I think it's a start up, right? They are just, as they break into these accounts and getting the new project and few things that will continue to grow the share.
Bill Dezellem
And your comment that you have your first business with Petrobras, Clearly, the Petrobras’ size relative to your size would imply that-- that they could do a lot of business to be relative to your revenue and rate. Talk with us little bit about how you foresee that relationship developing? 
Charles Dauber
We've done work indirectly for Petrobras for years because we work for the drilling contractors that doing work for Petrobras that we weren’t unknown to them. But this isn't on the approved suppliers list for Petrobras and it built direct relationships with them. They have an awful lot of work to do, they are excited about our history, what we bring to the table, they know about our quality and there's we see lots of opportunities. This is remember -- this is the Brazil entity right now is focusing on, what we called E&I services which is electrical services, deals services, motors, generator repair; all the things that mainly to do their fleets operating. I'm not even talking about the future product opportunities which are still to be determined based on the Brazil local contempt rules and how they end up with the capital planning on the next six or twelve months. As of which we think there is very interesting opportunities for the services part of our business which are nice projects that we can continue to grow and execute those on continued growing and getting pace from that.
Operator
We'll take our next question from George Cowman. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning gentlemen, thanks for taking my calls. Great color on Brazil; couple of questions, you had mentioned on your last call that you're on your way to Indonesia. Could you give us a little bit more color on that smaller joint venture there? What the growth prospects are? And also talk a little bit about the situation in BOMAY, China. I think you mentioned also that -- that was expanding and last but not least the recently announced joint venture. What type of revenue opportunities you see in that field, and could that be expanded also internationally?
Charles Dauber
Let me go through a couple of things. So, if I tell I was going to Indonesia, that was a mistake. I actually went to Hong Kong but that meeting in Hong Kong was for our joint venture in Singapore. So that's probably why I got confused, whatever I said in the last call. So the Singapore joint venture which is called MIEFE. As I said in the last call, I was on my way for a board meeting. As Andy mentioned and this is held in his portion of the call, the South East Asia market is heavy-heavy oil related, that's a shipyard and things like that. That business is down, right now. If you remember the opportunity that we have us with our new -- the acquirer of our previous joint venture partner, there's a company called Sonepar and that very-very-very large electrical distributor.

So our plan with Sonepar is to beef up the sales resources in the joint venture and to leverage the Sonepar reach across the entire Asia Pacific region and go get those revenues of that joint venture up and where we need to be independent again of the price of the barrel of oil. So it's extending the reach beyond Singapore and Indonesia into the rest of the region and being able to deliver growth which is what that crude drilling use to [indiscernible] despite showing some profitability. So I would just say stay tuned on the Singaporean opportunity. I think we mentioned they were about a $1.7 million in revenue and slightly below breakeven. They got to get more business in there and there fixed costs covered. So that's the Singapore, Indonesia and sorts turned out that meeting at Hong Kong.
On to China, so China macroeconomic issues are going to be a big story for BOMAY for this year. So our BOMAY joint venture in Xian operationally doing well. They know how to make money, but when the Chinese government is not investing money in new oil and gas infrastructure in China, that is a significant potential impact on BOMAY. And turns out BOMAY's business is split between the business that actually stays in China when they shift drilling rigs to CNPC, some stay in China and a bunch go outside of China to leverage China's selling stuff to, Right? And so, I believe this year we'll see the majority of the opportunities for BOMAY come from other markets whether that's the Middle East or South America or other places that they're selling to. But in general, China is down and BOMAY will be down this year versus last year and the year before.
The last question you asked was about -- I think about FlexGen. Yes, so FlexGen is not a joint venture, it's just a strategic partnership. In this partnership we're going to basically take their products that they originally developed for military application and bring them into oil and gas market. So their experts in the technology or experts in the market and the manufacturing and the sales on the service and the packaging and other things that require to make these successful in offshore drilling rig, where you've salt water issues or in the desserts, although [indiscernible] have some experience in the desserts, because they have a lot of products to believe in FTNS stand with the military, so, but all role is basically taking this technology in bringing [indiscernible] oil and gas market. I think it's too early to sort to have a sense on revenues and profits and things like.
This George just fits really well into our focus, right? So think about it, we're not just a supplier of generic electrical equipment in the energy industry. We're doing very optimized thing, that really take advantage of our technology and expertise in these applications. And that's the sense of what we're doing here. So, it's very cool technology, it's almost like the way a hybrid vehicle works, you step on gas, you accelerate, now that's where the gas consumption happens, same thing in the drilling rig, they start tripping the rig or they start doing more drilling, that has a big power requirement, this technology can smooth out that power requirement and we significantly want to reduce [indiscernible] out of fuel that's used, which is a huge cost savings for the operator and that's where the drilling market, specially for oil is all about right now. You liked this because it helps operators save money and it makes an upgrade or as a new build and makes the drilling contractors have a more marketable leg. They can take this rig with the technology on it to their perspective investments and say we will help lower you cost and that's a very powerful statement [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst

So this market, would this be considered as retrofitting existing rigs or build into -- as a new feature into the new more efficient drilling rigs that are coming to monitor?
Charles Dauber
It's both, and so our particular existing rigs and want to reduce operating expenses, it's offered as an upgrade and we'll come in and we'll sell it, we won't stall it, we'll connect it [indiscernible]. If you're building new rig then you can actually tie that to our AC VFD systems and we'll deliver in entire integrated solution with the our product and FlexGen integrated together, all try to manage under our drill system automation, which is a very good start, people are very, very interested and we think there is a good opportunity.
Unidentified Analyst
Are these guys looking at Houston too or somewhere else.
Charles Dauber
They have multiple facilities one of them Houston is headquarters for this purpose in Houston, yes. It's a private company.
Andy Puhala
And they have been [indiscernible].
Charles Dauber
Several years the technology originally was deployed in the military. If you understand how the military fuel works, Saudi and Afghanistan. We may pay $3 for a gallon of diesel but for the military they've got a literally get that gallon of diesel feel to run the generators in these remote areas, whether fields or wherever, they've shift into -- it's about $100 and there is a huge cost of life many, many, many people of actually died, I think the number is 1,700 people have died delivering fuel to these army and military forces in the last several years. So this is where that technology comes from as reducing the fuel expense and reducing the risk, the soldiers, so they can focus and nothing into focus on. We're now taking at the oil and gas market.
Unidentified Analyst
Then maybe one last thing on the Brazil, $600,000 revenue this quarter, can you give us like a number, you've mentioned earlier could be several million, what are you guys capable of -- how many books you've on the ground in your Brazil subsidiary?
Andy Puhala
We're about some between 40 and 50 people in Brazil, it's the numbers, it's not an exact -- I don't have an exact amount of headcount. So, you have the team can support projects, it's interesting because we have both of factory, I called shop based organizations, so we get motors and generators and transformer something. And we've a different work on customer project offshore on drilling rigs and another floating production and storage upload applications. We can handle more and we obviously have the verdict skill about further, when we had that the original joint venture and we're doing those large projects, we're at $8 million a year revenue size, we had 100 people working on construction projects at any one time, we can go, get those people back when we get the business and 
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, do you have your own shop there to manufacture or are there alternate in Houston in shift over there 
Andy Puhala
So, we have two shops in Brazil that are service shops. One in Rio and one Macaé, those shops have some manufacturing capability but if it something sophisticated we're going to build it in Houston and shift -- and that has more to do with local contact requirements and where does Brazil we want buy from U.S. import duties et cetera. But the focus for that group right now is shop services and field services, including construction and then overtime adding more products to the next 
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. So the Brazilian real currency fluctuations are not really affecting that much even though a lower real is more advantageous for you
Andy Puhala
It's a mix.
Charles Dauber
It affects us but lot of our revenues of real that nominated and we have a large account based, real as nominator. So, it's bit of natural hedge looking into that business but certainly to the extent that -- our investments are there and transactions between the U.S. and Brazil that they don’t impact.

Unidentified Analyst
Last question on the acquisition front, any ideas, any looking going on about maybe doing one or the other acquisition to add to the revenue side
Charles Dauber
When I'd say and that is we've talked about this for several years as we're always on to look out for acquisitions. We think that there is that now we've got the sales team in place and we've got the production capacity in place, we've got the management team in place and we think we're able to handle larger acquisition, we're very conscious of value in our market and so we -- last year we saw couple of things and we didn't like the valuations and so we didn't pursue them. I think as oil prices stay where they are and we'll start to see some interesting things pop up and so we're interested, we're malleable but we're very, very focused on making sure we get the right strategic accretive acquisition for our shareholders. So, I think that's a way I think about it.
Operator
And it appears, we have no further questions at this time.
Charles Dauber
Okay. I thank everybody for participating in the call and we'll talk to you all again soon. Thank you.

The company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements, even if experience or future events make it clear that any of the projected results expressed or implied herein will not be realized.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Charles Dauber, President and Chief Executive Officer of AETI. Please go ahead, sir.
Charles M. Dauber
Thank you Debbie, good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome you all to the American Electric Technologies' third quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today is our interim CFO, Mark Vise.
For our call today, I'm going to start with a review of our third quarter results and Mark will walk you through some additional financial details and later in the call I'll come back and provide more thoughts on our markets and our business thus far in 2015, and the outlook for the remainder of the year. We’ll then move to a question-and-answer session coordinated by the moderator. 
AETI’s consolidated revenues in Q3 were 13.8 million up 12% versus Q2 but were down slightly from the 14.3 million in Q3 of last year. Gross profit margin for the quarter increased to 19% compared to 17% in the second quarter of the year and was up significantly compared to the 3% gross profit margin on the third quarter of last year. If you’ll remember our gross margins in the second half of 2014, were negatively impacted by project cost over runs related to a significant increase in large PDC projects and several simultaneous new product introductions all of which were substantially completed by the end of Q4 2014.
As a result of the increased revenues and increased gross margins, the company reported its third consecutive quarter of profitability in Q3 with net income from continuing operations of 200,000 which was down from the 547,000 in Q2 but up from a $2 million loss last year in Q3. I’m pleased that in this current oil and gas market environment that we are able to continue to maintain profitability and we’ll discuss further details as I continue through our results. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark for some additional financial discussion. 
Mark Vise
Alright thank you Charles. Continuing where Charles left off, fully diluted earnings per share for the period were $0.01 per common share compared to $0.06 in Q2 of this year and a loss $0.26 in Q3 of 2014. Our EBITDA non-GAAP measure for the quarter was 418,000 down from 736,000 in the second quarter but significantly better than the negative 1.8 million in the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase being driven by high gross margins from -- or higher gross margin from increased efficiencies at our Beaumont plant that Charles mentioned earlier. 

Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended Q3 with a strong cash position of 9.2 million and 5.3 million of total debt. Our working capital remained decreased during the quarter, a result of lower revenue levels and the timing of certain payments from milestone payments from our customers. As a result of the reduced working capital requirements and strong collection activity, the net cash generated from operating activities during the quarter was approximately 1.1 million and for the first nine months was 3.8 million. We believe our existing cash position, working capital, and credit facility combined with operating earnings will be sufficient to meet working capital needs for the next 12 months. With that I will turn it back over to Charles for some additional commentary and outlook on the business. 
Charles M. Dauber
Thanks Mark. I’d like to now share with you more about our market sectors in our business. I'll start with our oil and gas market sector. As I have highlighted in previous calls, the company operates in three distinct parts of the oil and gas sector. Upstream which is the finding getting the oil or the gas out of the ground including land and offshore drilling and offshore production, midstream oil and gas which includes oil and gas pipelines and gas processing plants, and downstream which includes refining petrochemical and LNG type projects. 
Revenue in this sector was 11.5 million in Q3 up 8.4% versus Q2 and up 25% versus Q3 last year. Our sector gross margins for the quarter were 18%, up an additional 1% from the 17% in Q2, further reinforcing at the operational execution issues we experienced in the second half of last year are behind us. As you all know in the first three quarters of 2015 the land and offshore drilling market experienced significant decrease in activity primarily related to the continued drop in oil prices that began in late 2014. 
We did start seeing land drilling project opportunity again in the second quarter and booked and shipped land drilling projects in Q3 for non-continental U.S. deployments. The company has seen good success in the midstream and downstream related of the oil & gas sectors so far in the year, and has been able to sustain revenues and margins through Q3. With that said we definitely saw a slowdown in the midstream part of this sector in Q3 as pipeline and natural gas processing plant orders slipped out of Q3 into Q4 causing a reduction in our quarter-ending backlog. 
In addition we had a $4 million cancellation of a previously booked large oil related land production project that negatively impacted our back log for this sector as well. Based on the project cancellation and the delayed midstream orders our oil & gas related backlog for the quarter was $5.1 million, down from $14.4 million at the end of Q2.
Moving to our international operations, which are primarily oil & gas related, M&I Electric, Brazil, if you remember is focused on providing electrical services primarily to the Brazilian land and offshore oil & gas markets, which still need services even with the drop in oil prices. This focus means that although the Brazilian macroeconomic environment remains challenging we remain positive in our outlook for continued growth for M&I Electric, Brazil into 2016. 
M&I Electric, Brazil generated $8,001,000 of revenue in the quarter, down 16% from Q2, partially due to exchange rate fluctuation and partially due to delays in several service projects. Gross margins for M&I Electric, Brazil in the quarter were down to $165,000 which resulted in M&I Electric, Brazil essentially breaking even for the quarter, which was decline versus their profitability in Q2. We remain positive about the Brazil long-term outlook as the team continues to increase penetration of Brazilian non-drilling customers, and continue to progress with projects directly with Petrobras in their land-based downstream operations. 

Turning to our international joint ventures, equity income from the two joint ventures, net of JV-related expenses, was about $122,000 for the quarter. Our BOMAY joint venture in China had a good quarter with revenues of $13.5 million, which was flat compared to Q2 but up significantly from the $10 million in Q3 last year. We recognize our 40% share of BOMAY’s profit as net equity income, which was $3,002,000 in the quarter, up from the $264,000 in Q2 and up slightly from $285,000 in Q3 last year. As you're aware the Chinese economy remains down and we expect to see BOMAY remain flat at this level into 2016. And on the side we also don’t expect a recent devaluation of the Chinese currency to have a material impact on our financial results. 
Our joint venture MIEFE in Singapore returned to a loss in Q3 and $1.3 million of revenue. Our share of that loss was $77,000 in the quarter. As we indicated in last quarter’s call the Southeast Asia oil & gas market was also down this year based on the drop in oil prices. MIEFE is seeing an increase in opportunities for the downstream and other non-oil & gas sectors being brought in from the new salesmen that we hired earlier in the year. Although the short term outlook for MIEFE is challenging, we're working closely with our joint venture partner Sonepar to manage costs and are working on additional plans to improve performance with the company heading into 2016. 
Taking a step back as we head into 2016, the company as a whole still sees opportunities throughout the oil & gas sector. In the upstream portion of oil & gas we have seen increased opportunities for international projects in places such as the Middle East and South America that we are pursuing strongly. But in general we remain bearish for the market for new land drilling rig projects for the continental U.S. through the end of 2016. 
I believe the biggest opportunity for growth in the upstream market will come from the services for existing deployed rigs, we can help our customers reduce costs and keep capital spending low for land and offshore drilling rigs during this market downturn. We've also started seeing upgrade opportunities as well for the upstream part of the market, primarily for international offshore rigs. We're also hopeful that our partnership with FlexGen to deploy energy storage systems that reduce operating costs by reducing fuel expenses for drillers can bear fruit in 2016.
We see opportunities in the midstream market for natural gas transportation and gas processing, but believe that market will be flat to slightly down as we head into 2016. We do see continued growth opportunities in the downstream part of the oil & gas industry, which includes the refineries, petrochemical facilities, and LNG plants and we've positioned the company’s sales teams appropriately. As part of our focus on building market share in the mid-stream, downstream and also the power gen factor, we recently announced our new IntelliSafe Medium Voltage Arc-resistant switchgear product line at the 2015 Petroleum and Chemical Industry Committee Conference that’s known as PCIC in Houston. 
IntelliSafe is the world’s safest arc-resistant switchgear product and enables customers to maximize protection against arc flash hazards and improved power reliability. IntelliSafe addresses key challenges with existing solutions on the market and meets or exceeds all industry specifications including the process industry practice stacks known as the tip stacks. IntelliSafe is also designed what is called the industrial internet of things where customer get complete visibility as to not only the power going through the systems with the status of all aspects of the system itself. This information comes from sensor spring throughout the equipment which then transmit data back to the operator for predictive analysis enabling higher uptime and increased operational visibility. 

Since the end of the quarter and the announcement of the product, we booked a large PDC project for a large midstream company for IntelliSafe and with more opportunities in our sales prospect list we are working with customers to close. The other major thing we did to accelerate our sales efforts was to bring on Mark Haubert as our new Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Mark has over 25 years of sales leadership in the energy industry and has successfully lead sales and marketing teams at energy services companies focusing on the same midstream and downstream markets we focus on. His specialty is improving sales processes, creating strategic account penetration programs, and building true partnerships with customers. We are excited to have Mark on Board and I look forward to sharing more about our continued sales progress in the market in future calls. 
I'll now turn to our power generation distribution market sector which had revenues in Q3 of 700,000. As I have mentioned before, this sector has been quite lumpy for us which is demonstrated by the 2.8 million in backlog and that we booked in Q3. There is order for natural gas turbine power generation projects with a major turbine OEM customer and are expected to ship in the latter part of this year and on into 2016. We have really seen an increase in opportunities for natural gas based power generation projects and a positive on growth in this sector in 2016. And in fact since the end of the quarter we booked an additional $2.5 million in power generation related orders for 2016 delivery. 
Moving into our non energy related marine and industrial sector, Q3 revenues were 1.6 million flat with Q2 but down from 4 million in Q3 last year will be the large chemical plant project that was not oil related -- oil and gas related project. Backlog for this sector was up 0.6 million to 1 million. Just like the refining and petrochemical markets we believe 2016 will continue to see opportunities in the non oil and gas chemical markets throughout the year especially as the company further penetrates the large EPC customers we have been targeting who focus on these large chemical projects. If I add the backlog of all those sectors together, total backlog for the company exiting the quarter was 8.8 million down from the 16.5 million in the second quarter. 
Reflective of this reduced backlog, the company has implemented several strategic initiatives to manage through this market environment. We’ve already focused on improving our operations to increase margin and to make sure we can continue to adhere to tight project schedules so we can increase customer satisfaction. We believe we’ve adjusted our pricing to aggressively maintain appropriate business levels where we are well positioned to win orders in this tough market. 
In addition to its focus on operational improvements and strategic sales and marketing, we are also focused on aggressively managing cost and cash. We are taking actions including spending cuts and several reductions in force and we’ll continue to evaluate our cost structure and make further adjustments as required. We’ve improved our working capital position to active management of our balance sheet to maximize our financial position and we feel confident about our cash position going forward. 
To summarize my comments first I am pleased the company made money in Q1, Q2, and Q3 given this challenging market environment and I’d like to express my thanks to the members of the team that made that happen. Second, the company is uniquely positioned to be the premier turnkey supplier for power delivery projects for our customers. And we can offer our custom design power distribution and conversion systems, power distribution centers, automation systems and E&I services to the market. 

The launch of IntelliSafe is actually really important for the company. It gives us a critical product with a competitive advantage that when combined with our custom turnkey power delivery solution set enables us to take market share from our larger competitors in the market. Third, the operational infrastructure we deployed last year is now place to further improve productivity and gross margins going forward. As evidenced by our increased gross margin percentage in Q3 even in the face of a very competitive market with pricing pressures. 
Despite the challenges certain segments of our market are experiencing, we still expect demand for our products to increase over the long-term and believe we've positioned the company well for market success in the future. Before we proceed with the Q&A session, I’d like to conclude the prepared portion of my comments by thanking our employees for their hard work and our customers and our shareholders for their support. This concludes the prepared portion of my call and I’ll now turn the call over to Debbie for the Q&A section. Debbie?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We’ll take our first caller.
Greg Ayers
Hi Charles, this is Greg Ayers at Singular Research. Good morning.
Charles M. Dauber
Hi, Greg.
Greg Ayers
So looking at the overall business levels, it’s clear this slow down has kind of been a big hit to -- the energy sector slowdown, just continues to be a big hit to the revenue line. You had the one large land deal, $4 million deal pulled out of backlog that was cancelled. As you look at your backlog now, and that was obviously a very large item, as you look at your backlog right now, is there any single backlog item that would be that material within the existing backlog carried over into Q4 that we would have to worry about getting cancelled or is it more granular than that?
Charles M. Dauber
No. So I think there's two things. One is, there's no single project in backlog that’s a same size, right, as the first blush. But second is, that was like the last big real related backlog thing that we had, and so everything else that’s in backlog is all natural gas, infrastructure, power gen. We've got some marine stuff in backlog, some chemical things, nothing else oil related, frankly. 
Greg Ayers
Really, that’s how bad the oil market is, oh boy. 
Charles M. Dauber
But you have to remember -– but Greg, you have to remember that the drilling, the land-drilling projects, those are normally shorter-cycle projects. So in Q2 we booked some orders that shipped in Q3 for some land drilling rigs. 
Greg Ayers
Yes, right.
Charles M. Dauber
So there is some -– there's some of those things but nothing on the magnitude that this project was.
Greg Ayers
Understood, understood. Part of your strategy has been, and that was part of the Beaumont expansion again, to position you to be able to compete for larger size contracts which there was to open up you up to new markets by being able to build larger size projects for the theoretically larger customers or customers with bigger demands. Do you see the bidding availability to bid on those larger size contracts still in place at this time or has that market kind of gone away for now?
Charles M. Dauber
No, I think that market is still there. The -– if I think about what we're bidding now, the projects we're bidding for the midstream market, those range from $1.5 million to $3 million. So those are nice sized projects for us. Those maybe single-PDC projects, some of them are multiple-PDCs. But just on a single project the midstream stuff is not at that $4 million level. Where we've seen the larger projects, I’ll call the $4 million plus, is in the downstream part of the market, so that’s the refining or the chemical parts of the market and in the power generation parts of the market, and that’s what the team has been seeing in terms of larger projects recently. We had, last year we had, in 2014 we had two large offshore oil drilling projects and those were $5 million a piece, plus the oil market declined, those weren’t replaced by other large offshore drilling projects at the time. Alright so that’s why you are not seeing a bunch of large oil related projects at this point in the backlog. 

Greg Ayers
Understood, I think early in the call you said that you booked and shipped land drilling projects in Q3 that were shipped to international markets?
Charles M. Dauber
Actually what I said was non continental United States or I think that one went to Alaska. 
Greg Ayers
Okay, understood.
Charles M. Dauber
Most of what the bidding opportunities we’re seeing for land drilling are international oriented, nothing in the United States, continental U.S.
Greg Ayers
Okay, I am curious, I am trying to understand why the international markets would have better opportunities for land drilling than the U.S. when it’s a global product with a global price, is that a fair question?
Charles M. Dauber
Yeah, yeah, I think my personal opinion is that in the lot of the international markets they have to keep drilling, right. There is no question, the tax environment of those countries is dependent on drilling and so whether oil is at 8 or 40 [ph] they still got to keep drilling to keep tax revenues coming into their markets, that’s number one. So, those markets -- a lot of the international markets were not as quick to upgrade their rigs so what they are doing now is they are basically trying to figure out how do they get access to these projects that they’ve got in place like the Middle East or South America as cost effectively as possible. And so that’s why I think that we’re seeing some increased opportunities there. When those opportunities will close and continue to close I can't tell, right. But we’re certainly seeing increased international opportunities in the last quarter or so. 
Greg Ayers
Good, good. Before I forget, can I ask to repeat the number you gave for the marine sectors revenue for the quarter?
Charles M. Dauber
If you remember the three sectors is oil and gas, that’s power gen and distribution, and then what we call the marine and industrial market for the industrial part meaning the non-oil and gas influx deal or water waste level or chemical. So that marine and industrial sector revenues in Q3 were 1.6 million. 
Greg Ayers
Got it, understood. Looking at Brazil you mentioned its down a little bit from the second quarter, partly the currency you know on that story and then you said some delays, is your Brazilian business and I guess I have asked this question on previous quarters but I guess I have to continue asking because the situation in Brazil continues to be in the headlines, the government -- the stability of the government has been called into question with not to keep the present leadership and such and Petrobras has been a kind of a domestic disaster. Are the problems that they are seeing domestically with Petrobras and then the politics affecting the volume of business that you could bid on or you still feel yourself as though you are kind of immune to it because you are providing a maintenance type level product that they are going to buy anyway?
Charles M. Dauber
So I guess I would say that there is really three things that are going on in Brazil that are impacting business. The stability of the government which actually is tied to Petrobras in terms of the car wash scandal but the other big thing from Brazil is the price of oil, right and Brazil in the pre-sub [ph] that was a big driver for their big spending plans over the last four or five years. So the Brazil, the strategy for Brazil market is that look we are doing this fundamental maintenance services and electrical services and they still need that whether it’s the drilling rigs that are still there, it’s the land projects. Petrobras on the refinery side we are doing Petrobas there so we’ve got enough business to basically continue with our growth path for the services part of the business. But what's happened is that the upswing in terms of these larger new projects that still is not happening and we have very little visibility into when we would start seeing things like new capital projects being deployed in Brazil. So we can start doing things like the construction projects that are joint venture down there. We are used to doing these sort of capabilities in house to handle, right. So I think we got the maintenance, we feel like that business continues to make progress in the market. Right, but the sort of the upswing in the growth, the strong upswing that’s going to be challenging until the government and Petrobras figures itself out.

Greg Ayers
So between the government and the price of oil.
Charles M. Dauber
And the price of oil.
Greg Ayers
The capital spending side of the Brazilian business will be dormant but the maintenance side continues?
Charles M. Dauber
That’s right. So we still expect growth based on just, frankly, our penetration in the market. We've been as an entity in the market for I think four quarters now, right. So the business is – has broke even this quarter but let’s say in general doing what they’re supposed to be doing which is generating incremental revenue for the company, for AETI Corporate generating good gross margins because it’s all services there, which helps the company. And positioning ourselves with these companies for the longer run, where the capital projects come back but we're chunking away in the mean time.
Greg Ayers
Understood, understood. If I could ask about the BOMAY business in China, its -– the first quarter this year was obviously very -– first two quarters were very down versus last year, but the business has been spread out more evenly quarter-to-quarter compared to last year, could you give any kind of idea to the outlook we should have for the fourth quarter and then again, I’m kind of asking about next year, knowing that they haven’t set their budget yet?
Charles M. Dauber
Sure. Yes, I think in the last quarter, I forgot it was the first quarter earnings or the second quarter earnings, what we said is that if we felt like the BOMAY business was going to be relatively consistent throughout the year, right. And we said of sort of their historical dynamic, where they had a strong first half and then really dropped off in the second half. We were expecting more consistent revenue and profitability throughout the year and at least they showed that in Q3, right? And so we’ll continue to stand by that view point for the rest of 2015. 2016, initial indications that the China market is still going to be down, the oil prices are still going to be down, we don’t have a view of is BOMAY going to be flat next year, down next year. A lot of what the Chinese are doing is looking at different projects; they’re also doing work internationally, right? So the Chinese are still active. Just the domestic business that they’re in is actually flat right now. So I think that’s about as good a visibility they will have until they get their plans submitted, which will be in the Q1 timeframe.
Greg Ayers
I think you said last quarter that there's been some sort of -- BOMAY has work outside the country?
Charles M. Dauber
Yes. Our -- so when you see -– so remember this is all state-owned enterprises, right? And so when you see that, let’s say, China does a deal to get oil from some country, right, many times that deal includes China buying oil from somebody, but in order to get that oil China says we've got to buy our drilling rigs from Chinese drilling rigs and send them to whatever that, let’s say, country in Africa, happen to be. Those drilling rigs are BOMCO drilling rigs, which is our partner, and those drilling rigs include power and control systems from BOMAY this joint venture, right. So that business is part domestic internal China consumption and part China exports into various markets around the world.
Greg Ayers
Understood, understood. With the Singapore joint venture, anything new to really talk about there? Again, it’s just been a project to get that business to really to beginning to grow. Is there anything new to report?
Charles M. Dauber
Yes. Well I think that two things I would say is the market for them is definitely challenging, its oil related so there's a bunch of cost cutting that’s going on right now to make sure that they’ve got the right size for the business levels. The other thing that I would say is that the sales manager that we hired, I think it was two quarters ago, actually started to bring – starting to bring in business that’s not offshore drilling related, which is the primary focus that we brought him on for. So he is seeing opportunities in the downstream market. He is bringing in opportunities for the chemical side markets and the power gen. So actually he is starting to take off and we're starting to see orders and hoping to start closing those orders to at least augment the existing offshore drilling related business in Singapore. So that will be the only, that would be the only sort of measurable progress I can show internally which is, he’s making some progress. We've seen a nice pipeline of opportunities, now we've got to go help him close them. 

Greg Ayers
Good, good. Okay, I’ll let someone else go. Thanks for your answers. 
Charles M. Dauber
Okay, Greg. Thanks.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We’ll take our next caller.
Matthew Dhane
Hi, this is Matt Dhane from Tieton Capital Management. 
Charles M. Dauber
Hi, Matt. So, I was curious looking at downstream I know you highlighted that Charles as having some nice opportunities, is there any way you can help me understand how significant those opportunities could be potentially for UTIs over the next 12 months or so, is there things that feel like they are getting close and that could be significant meaningful charges for the company here?
Charles M. Dauber
Let me try to put some words around this. So, the trick for the downstream market is one, is firstly it got to be a market which we believe that there is. This is the downstream company taking advantage of the low oil price which obviously refer to the upstream guy but is a good thing for the downstream guys. And this also includes the LNG market which is taking the natural gas and liquefying it and building these big LNG plants. And finally it includes the petrochemical side of the equation which is turning the high availability low cost natural gas into whatever the chemical things. But they turn to two tiers or whatever the other thing is alright. So we think that the markets there we’ve had to go in the last year really penetrate the EPC firms, the engineering, procurement, and construction firms which are the main way that the owners of these projects actually construct the projects and buy. And so our penetration of these firms is actually in full swing and I get excited that we have 24 people from a large engineering firm all come to Beaumont with higher bust to bring them out and that’s opening the doors for a number of good projects for us as we head into 2016.
So we think at this point we have got good sales coverage, we got this new product and these opportunities are there. So there was a big, the Shaneer [ph] LNG project for example and there is some big LNG projects where they may have already placed the order for the main parts of the project. But we still see opportunities for the smaller parts of that project and those could be $5 million worth of business for us. Alright, so we see on these projects these are more $5 million, $7 million, $10 million size opportunities. When these customers come to Beaumont they can see we are good supplier and we just have to make sure when the approve suppliers left them bidding for them. So we actually are relatively positive about that as we head into 2016 based on the work we have been doing thus far in 2015. 
Matthew Dhane
And the engineering project construction firms, how many new firms have you gained relationship and potentially want some, potentially smaller pieces of business except for the -- that came back over the last 12 months and present real opportunities going forward?
Charles M. Dauber
There is probably five big sort of the giant EPC firms that you could go and come up with a list on. And we got orders from one where we have expected orders from another one and we are successfully targeting two more and I think the other, the fifth one we are still working on how do we go get into it. But I'd tell you the progress that we have made in this any one of these particular guys has enough projects for us for several quarters of work just for that one engineering firm. So the progress we are making is very good, I am very pleased with it. And we do have to go and execute it, right we just got to go execute it. 
Matthew Dhane
And so usually it tests you with a small and minor project sort of -– really understand if you are able to execute before they step up to the point and become a more serious customer basically?

Charles M. Dauber
Yes, and the first project we got from one of these guys was $3 million so it’s not a super small project. That’s a reasonable size project for us but the goal is if you can get the 3 million then you are in line for the 10 million. 
Matthew Dhane
Okay and so they do really have a very structured process for they work -- the chain to bigger projects with time basically, they are not going to jump into $10 million to $20 million project gates by any means?
Charles M. Dauber
I don’t think that they would that, I think they have a more rational approach to new suppliers. And when they come to the plant they see all the projects, they see the customers. We just basically look, I am sorry we haven't called on you guys either ever or for the last 20 years. But we have been working with these other companies so we can get up that courage to get the first order quickly. And so if that’s a $3 million or 5 million that’s great, we are happy with that. And then we want to continue pushing on them for getting those larger projects that the company is now structured to go get.
Matthew Dhane
Great, thank you Charles. 
Charles M. Dauber
Okay, thanks Matt.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
