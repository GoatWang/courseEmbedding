										I was recommend to this shop by a local tire shop for good used tires. He sells the used tires and you have to take them back to the shop to have them installed.I know I shouldn't buy used tires, but in this economy I have to save money where I can.When I arrived at his shop he seamed friendly and helpful.  We found two tires that would fit my car and I paid him.  Upon further inspection once outside in the light, I could see that the inside of the tires were damaged.Since he had no other tires for my car, I asked for my money back.  He would only return part of the money.  He said I owed him for his time.This hole transaction took a total of 10 mins.  Bascially he robbed me of my money !!  BUYER B-WARE !!

Reed Camshafts








Reed cams has been the serious engine builders camshaft and valve train parts source for over 35 years. John Reed knew that winning required a combination of technology and skill that uses experience and expertise to create the successful “heart” of a racing engine- the camshaft. The camshaft is the engines center that makes all the parts work together. John believed , as we do, that without the right camshaft you will never be in the winners circle. Before the big contingency and endorsement money entered racing, names like Earnheart, Petty, Allison, and Wallace used Reed cams to win races time and time again. We welcome you to take advantage of Reed cams decades of racing championships. It seems that in this new era of the high performance industry, it has become very difficult to get individual technical assistance from a supplier with a staff that actually builds race engines. Not at Reed! When you talk to us, we put our experience and expertise into everything we recommend. The technical support team at Reed has decades of combined race engine building experience, and with that, they will gladly take the time to help with your performance questions and supply you with the right parts the first time! This service has always been free of charge, as a thank you to our customers, for your loyalty to Reed cams.     We are proud of the fact that Reed cams are still being produced in house by our experienced staff of machinist and engineers. Many big name cam suppliers don’t even grind the cams they sell, they are outsourced to other vendors who put in the lowest bid. In this new era of the performance industry, flooded by low cost and even lower quality parts, we at Reed believe the bitterness of the bad quality will long outlast the sweetness of the a good price. Every Reed cam is inspected for machine finish and lobe taper before it goes out to our customers.      Our products are the finest quality available to the industry and made in the U.S.A. NO IMPORTED PARTS HERE! We only use what we have found to be the finest quality components offered. Our Roller cams feature the new everwear gear in all applications that are available. This core is offered to our customers at no additional cost. The everwear gear has been proven to provide superior wear resistance in the most brutal of conditions and is compatible with a standard distributor gear that will outlast a bronze gear many times over. Additionally the heat treating process penetrates deeper into the core of the cam for a more uniform hardness providing a wider range of available lobe designs and lobe separations that can be used safely. Our flat tappet Cams are ground on the premium proferall ++ material cores, providing a less brittle cam than the p-55 cores with compatible wear resistance. Reed small block Chevy solids & XLH hydraulics come on a premium proferall ++ machined core, which have wider, machined lobes for increased strength. Our flat tappet lifters are also premium quality, casted and made entirely in the U.S.A. Ask our competitors where their lifters are sourced from, and see if they will be honest with you. Many lifters claim they are made in USA but the castings are imported. We refuse to select a supplier by the price of their products, we only use what we have found to be the finest quality. You can Trust Reed Performance Products to be your High Performance solution source for years to come, and you will be supporting a “Made in America” company.Contact Southeast Performance for your specific application.

Publisher's Description▼▲
John Dominic Crossan, the eminent historical Jesus scholar, and Jonathan L. Reed, an expert in biblical archaeology, reveal through archaeology and textual scholarship that Paul, like Jesus, focused on championing the Kingdom of God––a realm of justice and equality––against the dominant, worldly powers of the Roman empire.  Many theories exist about who Paul was, what he believed, and what role he played in the origins of Christianity. Using archaeological and textual evidence, and taking advantage of recent major discoveries in Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Syria, Crossan and Reed show that Paul was a fallible but dedicated successor to Jesus, carrying on Jesus's mission of inaugurating the Kingdom of God on earth in opposition to the reign of Rome. Against the concrete backdrop of first–century Grego–Roman and Jewish life, In Search of Paul reveals the work of Paul as never before, showing how and why the liberating messages and practices of equality, caring for the poor, and a just society under God's rules, not Rome's, were so appealing. Readers interested in Paul as a historical figure and his place in the development of Christianity  •Readers interested in archaeology and anthropology

TRACK LISTING

The Judge’s Song
My name is John Wellington Wells
When I was lad
I am the very model of a Modern Major General
Am I alone and unobserved
The Law is the true embodiment
When I went to the bar
Nightmare Song
If you go in you’re sure to win
If you give me your attention
Whene’re I spoke sarcastic joke
As someday it may happen
Tit Willow
My boy, you can take it from me
I have a song to sing, O
I’ve jibe and joke
Oh! A Private Buffoon
In enterprise of martial kind
To help the unhappy commoners
Let all your doubts take wing
When you find you’re a broken down critter

Ten Days That Shook The World.





















			First Edition of John Reed's Ten Days That Shook The World		



 



Ten Days That Shook The World.
Reed, John .

$400.00




Item Number: 33052

New York: Boni & Liveright, 1919.  First edition of this classic work regarding the 1917 Revolution. Octavo, original green cloth. In very good condition with light rubbing to the extremities, bookplate.

An American journalist and revolutionary writer, John Reed became a close friend of Lenin and was an eyewitness to the 1917 revolution in Russia. Ten Days That Shook the World is Reed's extraordinary record of that event. Writing in the first flush of revolutionary enthusiasm, he gives a gripping account of the events in Petrograd in November 1917, when Lenin and the Bolsheviks finally seized power. Containing verbatim reports both of speeches by leaders and of the chance comments of bystanders, and set against an idealized backdrop of soldiers, sailors, peasants, and the proletariat uniting to throw off oppression, Reed's account is the product of passionate involvement and remains an unsurpassed classic of reporting.
