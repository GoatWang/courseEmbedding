Voyager Therapeutics Inc.


Company Overview
Voyager Therapeutics, named Best Places to Work- Small Business,  by Boston Business Journal 2016!! Voyager’s mission is to develop and deliver life-changing therapies to people around the world affected by severe neurological diseases. This begins with a commitment to discovery, research, development and manufacturing, and extends to our engagement with patients, healthcare providers, caregivers and advocacy organizations.Researchers are investigating gene therapy as a way to treat disease at its source by delivering new instructions, or genes, into cells affected by Parkinson’s disease. One approach that has emerged as highly promising over the last decade is to use an adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a vector that is naturally able to transfer genes into cells and not known to cause illness. The vector is like an envelope that carries a message (or in this case, a gene) to specific brain cells. Once the gene has been transferred inside the cell, it is then read by the cell. The brain cells then use their normal machinery to produce the gene product, with the goal of restoring typical function. It is believed that this kind of therapy could potentially be delivered in a single dose and be a long-lasting, or even lifelong treatment. AAV vectors have previously been safely used in clinical trials for investigational gene therapy products. Voyager is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 

Company History
Product Pipeline Gene TherapyProduct Pipeline Developing life-changing gene therapies for fatal and debilitating diseases of the central nervous system Voyager’s product pipeline includes programs for Parkinson’s disease, a monogenic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Friedreich’s ataxia, Huntington’s disease, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and severe, chronic pain. For each of these diseases, there is a dire need for new therapies. Depending on the disease, our gene therapies will use either gene replacement or gene knockdown techniques. By significantly increasing or decreasing production of relevant proteins at targeted sites within the central nervous system, the goal is to address the underlying biology of the disease and make a meaningful difference for patients. Parkinson's DiseaseMonogenic ALSFriedreich's AtaxiaHuntington's DiseaseSpinal Muscular AtrophyFrontotemporal Dementia / Alzheimer's DiseaseSevere, Chronic Pain

                                                 3-Hold     3     




Style Scores:



F Value | F Growth | B Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
