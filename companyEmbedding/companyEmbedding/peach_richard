				Replacing our windows was a pleasant experience. The work was done efficiently and

the crew had all the necessary rebate paperwork ready for us. It was a good

experience. Thank you, thank you, thank you…
			






Liz K.

				Thank you very much for everything. Diane and I really appreciate all the help and

support. Everyone there is top notch, and true professionals.

				On March 18th, new replacement windows were installed in my home by Peach

Building Products. I needed to let you know how pleased I was with your

installation crew. They were prompt, courteous and cleaned up well. I am very

pleased with my experience! The new windows are of excellent quality at a great

price! Adding your custom shutters totally transformed our family room to feel rich

and inviting, and now my neighbors are trying to copy us.
			






Kathy E.

				I chose Peach Building Products to replace all of the windows in my home. It was the

best choice I could have made. Their professional service and quality windows were the

best I found while shopping around. I trusted my instinct and I was right! Their design

team talked me into a Transom window above our picture window, and I cannot

beleive what a difference it makes. It’s like a new home. The only problem is now we

never want to leave the room. Thanks Peach.

			






Richard and Diane S.

				I want to thank you and compliment you on the fine installation you did for us. The

doors look better than I ever could have imagined they would. You did a terrific job

and thank you for keeping everything so tidy.
			






Tim J.

				Extremely attentive, excellent experience…

Peach Building Product’s has been an excellent company to work with and as

customer of theirs, I am very satisfied and thrilled about the outcome of the work

they did for me. The workmanship was of fantastic quality, the technicians were

very kind and polite throughout the entirety of the service, and overall I have no

complaints about the results of their work. I would absolutely use their services

again in the future if needed be and have recommended them to many friends of

mine who were in need of replacement household items such as windows and

doors. These guys do a great job and charge an affordable rate for their services, and

you will not be disappointed with the outcome!
			






Darren L.

				Peach Building Products did a wonderful job putting in my patio cover. They are

very good at what they do and resolved issues with ease. I’ve already recommended

them! The people were just really good and professional — they explained how

everything would happen ahead of time. They were prompt and finished the project

when they said they would. I have no complaints!
			






Toni O.


						Cottonwood Heights, UT
					


 
 




				We bought our new replacement vinyl windows from you and decided to upgrade to

the triple pane glass. WOW, what a difference it makes in the sound! Now when the

trucks come flying down the highway I don’t have to listen to them or turn up the TV,

but now I don’t have an excuse when my wife asks me to do her honey do’s so I’m only

giving you 4 out of 5 stars…ha

      
			






John K.


						Cottonwood Heights, UT
					


 
 




				You guys are fantastic to work with. Your installers and staff are amazing and always

very professional. I have always had a great experience when I work with all of you.

Thanks for always doing a great job and always being so helpful.

5.0 out of 5 starsLittle Richard has been at my junctures of life...ByKaren Kohr-Blinnon February 23, 2014This man exploded in my music awarenesses in 1955.  His delivery, voice, lyrics, beat, and uplifting tempo was my start of a support of the birth of Rock and Roll....  He was copied by white artists and one in particular was supported in the subterfuge of being the only artist of a song that made the fake a Hall of Fame member.  I was anti the song by the fake and loved the song by Little Richard... he left music shortly afterward... but in time things racially motivated began to be of notice and he came back to music.  Today I understand more of the hell he went through....Desert Storm and Desert Shield was the environment that my only son was sent to for his duty assignment, and the stress of his being in harm's way was high on the scale... a song "Voices that Care" was created and recorded for sale, I got the tape cassette, and Little Richard's voice saying "He's not just a soldier, he's somebody's son" brought me to tears... he touched my heart as tho he were standing in front of me.  I am so grateful for that reach and that help to be strong at a single Mom's aloneness... like no other aloneness...My youngest, my daughter moved to Nashville, Tennessee and fell in love, they set up housekeeping and to my delight she became pregnant with my first grandchild...  I live 2500 miles away and her time flew for me but not for her lol... One evening she and her partner were going in to eat at a Nashville finery and they saw Little Richard exiting the same restaurant.  He saw them, and her tummy announcing to the world "baby inside" and he, Little Richard, smiled and gave her the thumbs up on the baby...... My idol of the beginnings of our wonderful Rock n Roll the beginnings of so many artists and it keeps on giving.....Now that he and I are in this late time of life, I am forgiving of those who tried to diminish this wonderful man and his talent that has been copied and treated as the fake had invented the moves... etc.  I am so grateful for Little Richard's (btw my son is Richard, coincidence not intentional) music and the fun of dancing to his creations..This is a real fun CD..... by a real funny comic too!  have you seen him on the Tonight show?  I have !!!!!!!!!!!!Karen Kohr Blinn

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsThe One to Buy!ByA customeron December 2, 1999Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseThis is the best collection of Little Richard's work that I've ever heard.  I find myself playing this CD over and over, and it always sounds fresh.  Great work by the sax players and most of the piano playing by Little  Richard Wayne Penniman.  Wonderful liner notes tell us that "Tutti  Frutti" was originally "Tutti Frutti Good Booty", but soon  was "cleaned up", as well as comments about Little Richard's  antics in several films, and positions on the charts for all his songs.  All our favorites are here from LR's fabulous two-year period (1955-1957).  This is the one to buy!0Comment|

Little Richard's influence on rock n' roll and so many artists that came after him, from the Beatles to Elvis, to Prince can never be overstated.  John & Paul idolized him, as can be evidenced whenever you hear them scream ("AAAA!", for example, in 'Hard Days Night' or "AAAAA!", during 'Revolution') in the early recordings. This cd puts it all into context.0Comment|

            AllMusic Review
                            by Matt Collar



                    One of the definitive Little Richard anthologies, Specialty Records' 25-track Georgia Peach brings together all of Richard's hits in chronological order, along with several lesser-known, if no less top-notch, singles. These are the recordings Richard built his career upon and they showcase his most stripped-down, rockin', rhythm & blues-oriented sound. Although he had already recorded for RCA in the early '50s (anthologized on Bear Family Records' superb The Formative Years: 1951-53), it was his sides for Specialty Records, recorded between 1955 and 1959, that codified his distinctive, revelatory approach to rock & roll; roiling barroom piano, unhinged falsetto vocals and lyrics full of cheeky innuendo just this side of dirty. Included here are such classic recordings as "Tutti Frutti," "Good Golly Miss Molly," Slippin' and Slidin'," "Long Tall Sally," "Jenny, Jenny, Jenny," and more. Also included are such lesser appreciated, but no less incendiary cuts as "Heebie Jeebies," "She's Got It," and "Rip It Up," among others. If you are looking for a collection that brings together a cross-section of Richard's most definitive early career sides, then look no further than Georgia Peach.

One of the definitive Little Richard anthologies, Specialty Records' 25-track Georgia Peach brings together all of Richard's hits in chronological order, along with several lesser-known, if no less top-notch, singles. These are the recordings Richard built his career upon and they showcase his most stripped-down, rockin', rhythm & blues-oriented sound. Although he had already recorded for RCA in the early '50s (anthologized on Bear Family Records' superb The Formative Years: 1951-53), it was his sides for Specialty Records, recorded between 1955 and 1959, that codified his distinctive, revelatory approach to rock & roll; roiling barroom piano, unhinged falsetto vocals and lyrics full of cheeky innuendo just this side of dirty. Included here are such classic recordings as "Tutti Frutti," "Good Golly Miss Molly," Slippin' and Slidin'," "Long Tall Sally," "Jenny, Jenny, Jenny," and more. Also included are such lesser appreciated, but no less incendiary cuts as "Heebie Jeebies," "She's Got It," and "Rip It Up," among others. If you are looking for a collection that brings together a cross-section of Richard's most definitive early career sides, then look no further than Georgia Peach. ~ Matt Collar
