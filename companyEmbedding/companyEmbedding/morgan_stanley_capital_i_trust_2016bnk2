                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

--$36,278,582ad RRI Interest.


                                        








a) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.


                                        








b) Notional amount and interest-only.


                                        








c) The class E-1 and E-2 certificates may be exchanged for a related 
      amount of class E certificates, and the class E certificates may be 
      exchanged for a ratable portion of class E-1 and E-2 certificates. Class 
      E-1 is senior to class E-2. Likewise, class F, G and H, and 
      corresponding exchangeable classes, are structured in a similar fashion. 
      Additionally, a holder of class E-1, E-2, F-1 and F-2 certificates may 
      exchange such classes of certificates (on an aggregate basis) for a 
      related amount of class EF certificates, and a holder of class EF 
      certificates may exchange that class EF for a ratable portion of each 
      class of the class E-1, E-2, F-1 and F-2 certificates. A holder of class 
      E-1, E-2, F-1, F-2, G-1 and G-2 certificates may exchange such classes 
      of certificates (on an aggregate basis) for a related amount of class 
      EFG certificates, and a holder of class EFG certificates may exchange 
      that class EFG for a ratable portion of each class of the class E-1, 
      E-2, F-1, F-2, G-1 and G-2 certificates.


                                        








d) Vertical credit risk retention interest representing 5.0% of pool 
      balance (as of the closing date).


                                        








The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Oct. 31, 2016.


                                        








The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 40 loans secured by 43 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $725,571,637 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Morgan 
      Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC, Wells Fargo Bank, National 
      Association, and Bank of America, National Association.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








Lower Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are lower than 
      those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and 
      Fitch loan-to-value (LTV) of 1.28x and 106.4%, respectively, are better 
      than the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 
      1.19x and 105.8%, respectively.


                                        








Low Mortgage Coupons: The pool's weighted average mortgage coupon is 
      3.93%, well below historical averages and below the YTD 2016 average of 
      4.62%. Fitch accounted for increased refinance risk in a higher interest 
      rate environment by reviewing an interest rate sensitivity that assumes 
      an interest rate floor of 5.0% for the term risk for most property 
      types, 4.5% for multifamily properties, and 6.0% for hotel properties, 
      in conjunction with Fitch's stressed refinance rates, which were 9.68% 
      on a weighted average basis.


                                        








Concentrated Pool by Loan Size: The top 10 loans comprise 60.0% of the 
      pool, which is greater than the 2015 and YTD 2016 averages of 49.3% and 
      54.7%, respectively. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 483, 
      which is above the YTD 2016 average of 421.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9.0% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to MSC 2016-BNK2 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.


                                        








DUE DILIGENCE USAGE


                                        








Fitch was provided with due diligence information from Deloitte & 
      Touche, LLP. The due diligence focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on our analysis/conclusions. A copy 
      of the ABS Cue Diligence Form 15-E received by Fitch in connection with 
      this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary.

A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under 'Related Research' below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions,' dated May 31, 2016.

Copyright (c) 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

      amount of class E certificates, and the class E certificates may be 
      exchanged for a ratable portion of class E-1 and E-2 certificates. Class 
      E-1 is senior to class E-2. Likewise, class F, G and H, and 
      corresponding exchangeable classes, are structured in a similar fashion. 
      Additionally, a holder of class E-1, E-2, F-1 and F-2 certificates may 
      exchange such classes of certificates (on an aggregate basis) for a 
      related amount of class EF certificates, and a holder of class EF

      class of the class E-1, E-2, F-1 and F-2 certificates. A holder of class 
      E-1, E-2, F-1, F-2, G-1 and G-2 certificates may exchange such classes

      EFG certificates, and a holder of class EFG certificates may exchange 
      that class EFG for a ratable portion of each class of the class E-1, 
      E-2, F-1, F-2, G-1 and G-2 certificates.
    

      d) Vertical credit risk retention interest representing 5.0% of pool 
      balance (as of the closing date).
    

      The ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as of Nov. 
      22, 2016.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 40 loans secured by 43 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $725,571,637 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Morgan 
      Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC, Wells Fargo Bank, National 
      Association, and Bank of America, National Association.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Lower Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are lower than 
      those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and 
      Fitch loan-to-value (LTV) of 1.28x and 106.4%, respectively, are better 
      than the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 
      1.19x and 105.8%, respectively.
    

      Low Mortgage Coupons: The pool's weighted average mortgage coupon is 
      3.93%, well below historical averages and below the YTD 2016 average of 
      4.62%. Fitch accounted for increased refinance risk in a higher interest 
      rate environment by reviewing an interest rate sensitivity that assumes 
      an interest rate floor of 5.0% for the term risk for most property 
      types, 4.5% for multifamily properties, and 6.0% for hotel properties, 
      in conjunction with Fitch's stressed refinance rates, which were 9.68% 
      on a weighted average basis.
    

      Concentrated Pool by Loan Size: The top 10 loans comprise 60.0% of the 
      pool, which is greater than the 2015 and YTD 2016 averages of 49.3% and 
      54.7%, respectively. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 483, 
      which is above the YTD 2016 average of 421.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9.0% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to MSC 2016-BNK2 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with due diligence information from Deloitte & 
      Touche, LLP. The due diligence focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on our analysis/conclusions. A copy 
      of the ABS Cue Diligence Form 15-E received by Fitch in connection with 
      this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under 'Related Research' below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions,' dated May 31, 2016.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001

�
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the premises and the mutual agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:
�
Section
1.����������Agreement to Purchase. The Mortgage Loan Seller agrees to sell, assign, transfer, set over and otherwise convey
to the Purchaser, without recourse, representation or warranty, other than as set forth herein, and the Purchaser agrees to purchase
from the Mortgage Loan Seller, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Mortgage Loans. The purchase and sale
of the Mortgage Loans shall take place on November 22, 2016 or such other date as shall be mutually acceptable to the parties hereto
(the �Closing Date�). As of the Cut-off Date, the Mortgage Loans (with respect to the 101 Hudson Street Mortgage
Loan, including only the portion thereof to be sold by the Mortgage Loan Seller to the Purchaser) will have an aggregate principal
balance, after application of all payments of principal due on the Mortgage Loans, if any, on or before such date, whether or not
received, of $265,239,099, subject to a variance of plus or minus 5%. The purchase price for the Mortgage Loans shall be an amount
set forth on the cross receipt between the Mortgage Loan Seller and the Purchaser dated the Closing Date (which price reflects
no deduction for any transaction expenses for which the Mortgage Loan Seller is responsible). The Purchaser shall pay and/or direct
to be paid such
�

-2-
�
�
purchase price to the Mortgage Loan Seller on the Closing Date by wire transfer in immediately available funds
or by such other method as shall be mutually acceptable to the parties hereto.
�
Section
2.����������Conveyance of the Mortgage Loans. (a) Effective as of the Closing Date, subject only to receipt of the purchase
price referred to in Section�1 hereof and the other conditions to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s obligations set
forth herein, the Mortgage Loan Seller does hereby sell, assign, transfer, set over and otherwise convey to the Purchaser, without
recourse, representation or warranty, other than as set forth herein, all of the right, title and interest of the Mortgage Loan
Seller in, to and under the Mortgage Loans and all documents included in the related Mortgage Files and Servicing Files, with the
understanding that a servicing rights purchase and sale agreement or comparable agreement may be executed by the Mortgage Loan
Seller and the Master Servicer. Such assignment includes all scheduled payments of principal and interest under and proceeds of
the Mortgage Loans received after their respective Cut-off Dates (other than scheduled payments of interest and principal due on
or before their respective Cut-off Dates, which shall belong and be promptly remitted to the Mortgage Loan Seller) together with
all documents delivered or caused to be delivered hereunder with respect to such Mortgage Loans by the Mortgage Loan Seller (including
all documents included in the related Mortgage Files and Servicing Files and any other documents required to be delivered by the
Mortgage Loan Seller under Sections�2.01(b) and (c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement). The Purchaser shall be entitled
to receive all scheduled payments of principal and interest due on the Mortgage Loans after their respective Cut-off Dates, and
all other recoveries of principal and interest collected thereon after their respective Cut-off Dates (other than scheduled payments
of principal and interest due on the Mortgage Loans on or before their respective Cut-off Dates and collected after such respective
Cut-off Dates or, in the case of Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans (if any), due on or prior to the related date of substitution
and collected after such date, in each case, which shall belong to the Mortgage Loan Seller).
�
After the Mortgage Loan Seller�s
transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, as provided herein, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall not take any action inconsistent
with the Purchaser�s ownership of the Mortgage Loans. Except for actions that are the express responsibility of another party
hereunder or under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and further except for actions that the Mortgage Loan Seller is expressly
permitted to complete subsequent to the Closing Date, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall, on or before the Closing Date, take all actions
required under applicable law to effectuate the transfer of the Mortgage Loans by the Mortgage Loan Seller to the Purchaser.
�
(b)����������The
conveyance of the Mortgage Loans and the related rights and property accomplished hereby is intended by the parties hereto to constitute
a sale by the Mortgage Loan Seller of all the Mortgage Loan Seller�s right, title and interest in and to such Mortgage Loans
and such other related rights and property by the Mortgage Loan Seller to the Purchaser. Furthermore, it is not intended that such
conveyance be a pledge of security for a loan. If such conveyance is determined to be a pledge of security for a loan, however,
then: (i)�this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law; (ii)�the Mortgage Loan Seller shall
be deemed to have granted to the Purchaser, and in any event, the Mortgage Loan Seller hereby grants to the Purchaser, a first
priority security interest in all of the Mortgage Loan Seller�s right, title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter
acquired, in and to (1)�the Mortgage Loans, (2)�all documents included in the related Mortgage Files and Servicing Files,
�

-3-
�
�
(3)�all scheduled payments of principal and interest due on the Mortgage Loans after their respective Cut-off Dates, and (4)�all
other recoveries of principal and interest collected thereon after their respective Cut-off Dates (other than scheduled payments
of principal and interest due on the Mortgage Loans on or before their respective Cut-off Dates and collected after such respective
Cut-off Dates or, in the case of Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans (if any), due on or prior to the related date of substitution
and collected after such date); (iii)�the assignment by the Purchaser to the Trustee of its interests in the Mortgage Loans
as contemplated by Section�16 hereof shall be deemed to be an assignment of any security interest created hereunder;
(iv)�the possession by the Purchaser (or the Custodian) of the Mortgage Notes with respect to the Mortgage Loans subject hereto
from time to time and such other items of property as constitute instruments, money, negotiable documents or chattel paper shall
be deemed to be �possession by the secured party� or possession by a purchaser or person designated by such secured
party for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under applicable law; and (v)�notifications to, and acknowledgments,
receipts or confirmations from, Persons holding such property, shall be deemed to be notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts
or confirmations from, securities intermediaries, bailees or agents (as applicable) of the Purchaser for the purpose of perfecting
such security interest under applicable law. The Mortgage Loan Seller and the Purchaser shall, to the extent consistent with this
Agreement, take such actions as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that, if this Agreement were deemed to create a security
interest in the Mortgage Loans, such security interest would be a perfected security interest of first priority under applicable
law and will be maintained as such throughout the term of this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
�
(c)����������In
connection with the Mortgage Loan Seller�s assignment pursuant to Section�2(a) above, the Mortgage Loan Seller,
at its expense, shall deliver to and deposit with, or cause to be delivered to and deposited with, the Custodian, (x) on or before

later date as may be provided under Sections�2.01(b) or (c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement with respect to any item),

(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (other than amounts from reserve accounts and originals of letters of credit, which
shall be transferred to the Master Servicer) for each Mortgage Loan, and shall take such other actions and pay such costs with
respect to the Mortgage Loans as may be required under Sections�2.01(b) and (c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
�

the Master Servicer to draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the Trust in accordance with the applicable terms thereof and/or
of the related Mortgage Loan documents, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall deliver copies of the appropriate transfer or assignment
documents to the Custodian promptly following receipt of written notification thereof. If not otherwise paid by the related Mortgagor,
the Mortgage Loan Seller shall pay any transfer fee required in order to transfer the beneficiary�s interest from such Mortgage
Loan Seller to Master Servicer on behalf of the Trust as required hereunder and shall cooperate with the reasonable requests of
the Master Servicer in connection with effectuating a draw under any such letter of credit prior to the date such letter of credit
is reissued to the Master Servicer on behalf of the Trust.
�
With respect to letters of credit delivered
in accordance with subclause�(B) of clause�(xii) of the definition of �Mortgage File�, within sixty�(60)
days or such shorter period as is required by the terms of such letter of credit or other applicable Mortgage Loan documents, the

Seller shall cause all of its records to reflect such transfer as a sale (as opposed to a secured loan) and to reflect that the
Mortgage Loans are no longer property of the Mortgage Loan Seller. In no event shall the Mortgage Loan Seller take any action that
is inconsistent with the Trust�s ownership of each Mortgage Loan following the Closing Date.
�
(h)����������The
Mortgage Loan Schedule, as it may be amended from time to time, shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Pooling and

to the Purchaser or the Trustee, as the case may be, an amended Mortgage Loan Schedule; provided that this sentence shall
not be construed to relieve the Mortgage Loan Seller of any liability for any related Breach or to shorten the period available

forth in Section 5.
�
Section

with any examination of the Mortgage Files for, and any other documents and records relating to, the Mortgage Loans, that may be
undertaken by or on behalf of the Purchaser on or before the Closing Date. The fact that the Purchaser has conducted or has failed
to conduct any partial or complete examination of any of the Mortgage Files for, and/or any of such other documents and records
relating to, the Mortgage Loans, shall not affect the Purchaser�s right to pursue any remedy available in equity or at law

as expressly set forth in Section�5.

without regard to the rule of Treasury Regulations Section�1.860G-2(f)(2) that causes a defective Mortgage Loan to be treated
as a qualified mortgage, the earlier of (x) the discovery by the Mortgage Loan Seller or any party to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement of such Material Defect and (y) receipt of notice of the Material Defect from any party to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement (such ninety (90) day period, the �Initial Cure Period�), (A) cure (or, with respect to the 101 Hudson
Street Whole Loan, coordinate with Bank of America, National Association, in its capacity as mortgage loan seller, to cure) such
Material Defect in all material respects, at the Mortgage Loan Seller�s own expense, including reimbursement of any related
reasonable additional expenses of the Trust reasonably incurred by any party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (B) repurchase
the affected Mortgage Loan or REO Loan (or, with respect to the 101 Hudson Street Mortgage Loan, repurchase the related promissory
notes sold by the Mortgage Loan Seller) (excluding any related Companion Loan, if applicable), at the applicable Purchase Price

therewith and in conformity with this Agreement and Section 2.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;
�

-10-
�
�
provided, however,
that except with respect to a Material Defect resulting solely from the failure by the Mortgage Loan Seller to deliver to the Trustee
or Custodian the actual policy of lender�s title insurance required pursuant to clause (viii) of the definition of Mortgage
File by a date not later than eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date, if such Material Defect is capable of being cured
but is not cured within the Initial Cure Period, and the Mortgage Loan Seller has commenced and is diligently proceeding with the
cure of such Material Defect within the Initial Cure Period, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall have an additional ninety (90) days
commencing immediately upon the expiration of the Initial Cure Period (such additional ninety (90) day period, the �Extended
Cure Period�) to complete such cure (or, failing such cure, to repurchase the related Mortgage Loan or REO Loan (excluding
any related Companion Loan, if applicable) or substitute a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan (other than with respect to the Whole
Loans, for which no substitution will be permitted)); provided, further, that with respect to such Extended Cure
Period the Mortgage Loan Seller has delivered an officer�s certificate to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the
Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor and (with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan
with respect to the Directing Certificateholder or the Holder of the majority of the Controlling Class, prior to the occurrence
of a Consultation Termination Event) the Directing Certificateholder, setting forth the reason such Material Defect is not capable
of being cured within the Initial Cure Period and what actions the Mortgage Loan Seller is pursuing in connection with the cure
thereof and stating that the Mortgage Loan Seller anticipates that such Material Defect will be cured within the Extended Cure
Period; and provided, further, that, if any such Material Defect is not cured after the Initial Cure Period and any
such Extended Cure Period solely due to the failure of the Mortgage Loan Seller to have received the recorded document, then the
Mortgage Loan Seller shall be entitled to continue to defer its cure, repurchase and/or substitution obligations in respect of
such Material Defect until eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date so long as the Mortgage Loan Seller certifies to the Trustee,
the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Certificate Administrator no less than every ninety (90) days, beginning at the
end of such Initial Cure Period, that the Material Defect is still in effect solely because of its failure to have received the
recorded document and that the Mortgage Loan Seller is diligently pursuing the cure of such Material Defect (specifying the actions
being taken). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Defect or Breach that causes any Mortgage Loan not to be a �qualified mortgage�
(within the meaning of Section�860G(a)(3) of the Code, but without regard to the rule of Treasury Regulations Section�1.860G
2(f)(2) that causes a defective Mortgage Loan to be treated as a qualified mortgage) shall be deemed to materially and adversely
affect the interests of Certificateholders therein, and (subject to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s right to cure such Defect
or Breach during the Initial Cure Period) such Mortgage Loan shall be repurchased or substituted for without regard to the Extended
Cure Period described in the preceding sentence. If the affected Mortgage Loan is to be repurchased, the funds in the amount of
the Purchase Price remitted by the Mortgage Loan Seller are to be remitted by wire transfer to the Master Servicer for deposit
into the Collection Account. Any such repurchase or substitution of a Mortgage Loan shall be on a whole loan, servicing released
basis.
�
If the Mortgage Loan Seller, in connection
with a Material Defect (or an allegation of a Material Defect) pertaining to a Mortgage Loan agrees to a Loss of Value Payment,
pursuant to any agreement or a settlement between the Mortgage Loan Seller and the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust (and,
with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan with respect to the Directing Certificateholder or the Holder of
the majority of
�

-11-
�
�
the Controlling Class, with the consent of the Directing Certificateholder if no Control Termination Event has
occurred and is continuing) with respect to such Mortgage Loan, the amount of such Loss of Value Payment shall be remitted by wire
transfer to the Special Servicer for deposit into the Loss of Value Reserve Fund. The Loss of Value Payment shall include the portion
of any Liquidation Fees payable to the Special Servicer in respect of such Loss of Value Payment and the portion of fees of the
Asset Representations Reviewer payable pursuant to Section 4(k) above attributable to the Asset Review of such Mortgage
Loan and not previously paid by the Mortgage Loan Seller. If such Loss of Value Payment is made, the Loss of Value Payment shall
serve as the sole remedy available to the Certificateholders and the Trustee on their behalf regarding any such Material Defect
in lieu of any obligation of the Mortgage Loan Seller to otherwise cure such Material Defect or repurchase or substitute for the
affected Mortgage Loan based on such Material Defect under any circumstances. This paragraph is intended to apply only to a mutual
agreement or settlement between the Mortgage Loan Seller and the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust. The following terms shall
apply to any Loss of Value Payment: (i) prior to any agreement or settlement between the Mortgage Loan Seller and the Special Servicer
nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Mortgage Loan Seller, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable,
from exercising any of its rights related to a Material Defect in the manner and timing set forth in this Agreement (excluding
this paragraph) or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (including any right to cure, repurchase or substitute for such Mortgage
Loan), (ii) such Loss of Value Payment shall not be greater than the Purchase Price of the affected Mortgage Loan; and (iii) a
Material Defect as a result of a Mortgage Loan not constituting a �qualified mortgage� within the meaning of Section�860G(a)(3)
of the Code (but without regard to the rule of Treasury Regulations Section�1.860G-2(f)(2) that causes a defective Mortgage
Loan to be treated as a �qualified mortgage�) may not be cured by a Loss of Value Payment.
�
The Mortgage Loan Seller�s obligation
to cure any Material Defect, repurchase or substitute for any affected Mortgage Loan or pay the Loss of Value Payment or other
required payment pursuant to this Section�5 shall constitute the sole remedy available to the Purchaser in connection
with a Material Defect; provided, however, that no limitation of remedy is implied with respect to the Mortgage Loan
Seller�s breach of its obligation to cure, repurchase or substitute in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
It is acknowledged and agreed that the representations and warranties are being made for risk allocation purposes.
�
With respect to the 101 Hudson Street
Mortgage Loan, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall have no obligation with respect to the promissory notes sold by Bank of America,
National Association to the Purchaser that constitute part of the 101 Hudson Street Mortgage Loan, and failure by Bank of America,
National Association to cure or repurchase such promissory notes shall result in no obligation of or liability to the Mortgage
Loan Seller. Any such obligation of Bank of America, National Association shall be independent from any obligation of the Mortgage
Loan Seller hereunder.
�
The remedies provided for in this subsection
with respect to any Material Defect with respect to any Mortgage Loan shall also apply to the related REO Property.
�
If any Breach that constitutes a Material
Defect pertains to a representation or warranty that the related Mortgage Loan documents or any particular Mortgage Loan document
requires the related Mortgagor to bear the costs and expenses associated with any particular
�

-12-
�
�
action or matter under such Mortgage
Loan document(s), then the Mortgage Loan Seller shall cure such Breach within the applicable cure period (as the same may be extended)
by reimbursing the Trust (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) for (i) the reasonable amount of any such costs and
expenses incurred by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Trust that are
incurred as a result of such Breach and have not been reimbursed by the related Mortgagor and (ii) the amount of any fees payable
pursuant to Section 4(k) above to the extent not previously paid by the Mortgage Loan Seller to the Asset Representations
Reviewer attributable to the Asset Review of such Mortgage Loan; provided that in the event any such costs and expenses
exceed $10,000, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall have the option to either repurchase or substitute for the related Mortgage Loan
as provided above or pay such costs and expenses; provided, further that if the Breach relates to the 101 Hudson
Street Mortgage Loan, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association shall be responsible for 73.79% of all such costs and expenses unless
such Breach relates solely to the promissory notes sold by the Mortgage Loan Seller. Except as provided in the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall remit the amount of such costs and expenses to the Special Servicer for disbursement
to the applicable Persons and upon its making such remittance, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall be deemed to have cured such Breach
in all respects. To the extent any fees or expenses that are the subject of a cure by the Mortgage Loan Seller are subsequently
obtained from the related Mortgagor, the portion of the cure payment made by the Mortgage Loan Seller equal to such fees or expenses
obtained from the related Mortgagor shall promptly be returned to the Mortgage Loan Seller.
�
Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, a delay in either the discovery of a Material Defect or in providing
notice of such Material Defect shall relieve the Mortgage Loan Seller of its obligation to repurchase or substitute for the related
Mortgage Loan under this Agreement if (i) the Mortgage Loan Seller did not otherwise discover or have knowledge of such Material
Defect, (ii) such delay is a result of the failure by the Purchaser or any other party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to
provide prompt notice as required by the terms of this Agreement or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement after such party has actual
knowledge of such Material Defect (it being understood that knowledge shall not be deemed to exist by reason of the Custodial Exception
Report or possession of the Mortgage File), (iii) such Material Defect does not relate to the applicable Mortgage Loan not being
a �qualified mortgage� within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3), but without regard to the rule of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) that causes a defective obligation to be treated as a qualified mortgage, and (iv) such delay precludes
the Mortgage Loan Seller from curing such Material Defect. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, if a Mortgage
Loan is not secured by a Mortgaged Property that is, in whole or in part, a hotel, restaurant (operated by a borrower), healthcare
facility, nursing home, assisted living facility, self-storage facility, theater or fitness center (operated by a Mortgagor), then
the failure to deliver copies of the UCC financing statements with respect to such Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 2 hereof
shall not be a Material Defect.
�
If there is a Material Defect with
respect to one or more Mortgaged Properties securing a Mortgage Loan, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall not be obligated to repurchase
the Mortgage Loan if (i) the affected Mortgaged Property may be released pursuant to the terms of any partial release provisions
in the related Mortgage Loan documents (and such Mortgaged Property is, in fact, released), (ii) the remaining Mortgaged Property(ies)
satisfy the
�

-13-
�
�
requirements, if any, set forth in the Mortgage Loan documents and the Mortgage Loan Seller provides an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that such release would not cause an Adverse REMIC Event and (iii) each applicable Rating Agency has provided
a Rating Agency Confirmation.

(b)����������Whenever
one or more Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans are substituted for a Defective Loan by the Responsible Repurchase Party as contemplated
by this Section�5, upon direction by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, the Responsible Repurchase
Party shall deliver to the Custodian the related Mortgage File and a certification to the effect that such Qualified Substitute
Mortgage Loan satisfies or such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans satisfy, as the case may be, all of the requirements of the
definition of �Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan� in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. No mortgage loan may be
substituted for a Defective Loan as contemplated by this Section�5 if the Mortgage Loan to be replaced was itself a
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, in which case, absent a cure of the relevant Material Defect, the affected Mortgage Loan will
be required to be repurchased as contemplated hereby. Periodic Payments due with respect to each Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loan (if any) after the related date of substitution, and Periodic Payments due with respect to each corresponding Deleted Mortgage
Loan (if any) after its respective Cut-off Date and on or prior to the related date of substitution, shall be part of the Trust
Fund. Periodic Payments due with respect to each Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan (if any) on or prior to the related date of
substitution, and Periodic Payments due with respect to each corresponding Defective Loan that is purchased or repurchased, as
the case may be, or replaced with one or more Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans (any such Mortgage Loan, a �Deleted
Mortgage Loan�) (if any) after the related date of substitution, shall not be part of the Trust Fund and are to be remitted
by the Master Servicer to the Responsible Repurchase Party promptly following receipt.
�
If any Mortgage Loan is to be repurchased
or replaced as contemplated by this Section�5, upon direction by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable,
the Mortgage Loan Seller shall amend the Mortgage Loan Schedule to reflect the removal of any Deleted Mortgage Loan and, if applicable,
the substitution of the related Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan(s) and deliver or cause the delivery of such amended Mortgage
Loan Schedule to the parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Upon any substitution of one or more Qualified Substitute
Mortgage Loans for a Deleted Mortgage Loan, such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan(s) shall become part of the Trust Fund and
be subject to the terms of this Agreement in all respects.
�
If any Mortgage Loan that is part of
a Crossed Mortgage Loan Group is required to be repurchased or substituted, the provisions of Section�2.03(h), Section�2.03(i)
and Section�2.03(j) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall apply.

Responsible Repurchase Party shall be entitled, and the Purchaser shall cause the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to entitle the
Responsible Repurchase Party, upon the date when the full amount of the Purchase Price or Substitution Shortfall Amount (as the
case may be) for any Mortgage Loan repurchased or replaced as contemplated by this Section�5 has been deposited in
the account designated therefor by the Trustee as the assignee of the Purchaser (or the Master Servicer on behalf of the Trustee)
and, if applicable, receipt by the Trustee as the assignee of the Purchaser (or the Custodian) of the Mortgage File for each

Mortgage File and any other items required to be delivered by the Mortgage Loan Seller under Sections�2.01(b) and (c) of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement for the Deleted Mortgage Loan to the Responsible Repurchase Party or its designee, (ii)�the
execution and delivery of such instruments of release, transfer and/or assignment, in each case without recourse, as shall be prepared
by the Responsible Repurchase Party and are reasonably necessary to vest in the Responsible Repurchase Party or its designee the
ownership of such Deleted Mortgage Loan, and (iii)�the execution and delivery of notice to the affected Mortgagor of the retransfer
of such Deleted Mortgage Loan. In connection with any such repurchase or substitution by the Responsible Repurchase Party, the
Purchaser shall also cause the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to require each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer
to deliver to the Responsible Repurchase Party or its designee, and the Responsible Repurchase Party or its designee shall be entitled
to delivery from the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer of, any portion of the related Servicing File, together with any
Escrow Payments, reserve funds and any other items required to be delivered by the Mortgage Loan Seller under Sections�2.01(b)

EXHIBIT C
�
MORTGAGE LOAN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
�
For purposes of this Exhibit
C, the phrase �the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge� and other words and phrases of like import
shall mean, except where otherwise expressly set forth below, the actual state of knowledge of the Mortgage Loan Seller, its officers
and employees responsible for the underwriting, origination, servicing or sale of the Mortgage Loans regarding the matters expressly
set forth below in each case without having conducted any independent inquiry into such matters and without any obligation to have
done so (except (i)�having sent to the servicers servicing the Mortgage Loans on behalf of the Mortgage Loan Seller, if any,
specific inquiries regarding the matters referred to and (ii)�as expressly set forth herein). All information contained
in documents which are part of or required to be part of a Mortgage File, as specified in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (to
the extent such documents exist) shall be deemed within the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge.
�
The Mortgage Loan Seller hereby represents
and warrants that, as of the date herein below specified or, if no such date is specified, as of the date hereof, except with respect
to the Exceptions described on Schedule�C to this Agreement.
�
1.�����������Intentionally
Omitted.
�
2.�����������Whole
Loan; Ownership of Mortgage Loans. Each Mortgage Loan is a whole loan and not a participation interest in a mortgage loan.
At the time of the sale, transfer and assignment to the Depositor, no Mortgage Note or Mortgage was subject to any assignment (other
than assignments to the Mortgage Loan Seller), participation or pledge, and the Mortgage Loan Seller had good title to, and was
the sole owner of, each Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, charges, pledges, encumbrances, participations, any
other ownership interests and other interests on, in or to such Mortgage Loan other than any servicing rights appointment, subservicing
or similar agreement. The Mortgage Loan Seller has full right and authority to sell, assign and transfer each Mortgage Loan, and
the assignment to the Depositor constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment of such Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and
all liens, pledges, charges or security interests of any nature encumbering such Mortgage Loan.
�
3.�����������Loan
Document Status. Each related Mortgage Note, Mortgage, Assignment of Leases (if a separate instrument), guaranty and other
agreement executed by or on behalf of the related Mortgagor, guarantor or other obligor in connection with such Mortgage Loan is
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the related Mortgagor, guarantor or other obligor (subject to any non-recourse provisions
contained in any of the foregoing agreements and any applicable state anti-deficiency or market value limit deficiency legislation),
as applicable, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by (i)�bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors�
rights generally and (ii)�general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law and except that certain provisions in such Mortgage Loan documents (including, without limitation, provisions
requiring the payment of default interest, late fees or Prepayment Premium/Yield
�

Exh. C-1
�
�
Maintenance Charge) may be further limited or
rendered unenforceable by applicable law, but (subject to the limitations set forth above) such limitations or unenforceability
will not render such Mortgage Loan documents invalid as a whole or materially interfere with the Mortgagee�s realization
of the principal benefits and/or security provided thereby (clauses�(i) and (ii)�collectively, the �Standard
Qualifications�).
�
Except as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, there is no valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right of rescission available to the related Mortgagor with
respect to any of the related Mortgage Notes, Mortgages or other Mortgage Loan documents, including, without limitation, any such
valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right based on intentional fraud by Mortgage Loan Seller in connection with the origination
of the Mortgage Loan, that would deny the Mortgagee the principal benefits intended to be provided by the Mortgage Note, Mortgage
or other Mortgage Loan documents.
�
4.�����������Mortgage
Provisions. The Mortgage Loan documents for each Mortgage Loan, together with applicable state law, contain provisions that
render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the practical realization against the Mortgaged Property of the
principal benefits of the security intended to be provided thereby, including realization by judicial or, if applicable, non-judicial
foreclosure subject to the limitations set forth in the Standard Qualifications.
�
5.�����������Intentionally
Omitted.
�
6.�����������Mortgage
Status; Waivers and Modifications. Since origination and except by written instruments set forth in the related Mortgage File
or as otherwise provided in the related Mortgage Loan documents (a)�the material terms of such Mortgage, Mortgage Note, Mortgage
Loan guaranty and related Mortgage Loan documents have not been waived, impaired, modified, altered, satisfied, canceled, subordinated
or rescinded in any respect which materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such mortgage; (b)�no
related Mortgaged Property or any portion thereof has been released from the lien of the related Mortgage in any manner which materially
interferes with the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the use or operation of the remaining portion of such
Mortgaged Property; and (c)�neither Mortgagor nor guarantor has been released from its material obligations under the Mortgage
Loan. With respect to each Mortgage Loan, except as contained in a written document included in the Mortgage File, there have been
no modifications, amendments or waivers, that could be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on such Mortgage Loan
consented to by the Mortgage Loan Seller on or after the Cut-off Date.
�
7.�����������Lien;
Valid Assignment. Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each endorsement or assignment of Mortgage and assignment of Assignment
of Leases from the Mortgage Loan Seller or its Affiliate is in recordable form (but for the insertion of the name of the assignee
and any related recording information which is not yet available to the Mortgage Loan Seller) and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding endorsement or assignment from the Mortgage Loan Seller, or its Affiliate, as applicable. Each related Mortgage and Assignment
of Leases is freely assignable without the consent of the related Mortgagor. Each related Mortgage is a legal, valid and enforceable
first lien on the related Mortgagor�s fee (or if identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, leasehold) interest in the Mortgaged
Property in the principal amount
�

Exh. C-2
�
�
of such Mortgage Loan or allocated loan amount (subject only to Permitted Encumbrances (as defined
below) and the exceptions to paragraph 8 below (each such exception, a �Title Exception�)), except as
the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications. Such Mortgaged Property (subject to Permitted Encumbrances
and Title Exceptions) as of origination and, to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, as of the Cut-off Date, is free and
clear of any recorded mechanics� or materialmen�s liens and other recorded encumbrances that would be prior to or equal
with the lien of the related mortgage, except those which are bonded over, escrowed for or insured against by the applicable Title
Policy (as described below), and as of origination and, to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, as of the Cut-off Date,
no rights exist which under law could give rise to any such lien or encumbrance that would be prior to or equal with the lien of
the related Mortgage, except those which are bonded over, escrowed for or insured against by the applicable Title Policy. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, no representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal
property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements is required to effect such perfection.
�
8.�����������Permitted
Liens; Title Insurance. Each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan is covered by an American Land Title Association loan
title insurance policy or a comparable form of loan title insurance policy approved for use in the applicable jurisdiction (or,
if such policy is yet to be issued, by a pro�forma policy, a preliminary title policy or a �marked up�
commitment, in each case with escrow instructions and binding on the title insurer) (the �Title Policy�) in
the original principal amount of such Mortgage Loan (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan secured by multiple properties, an amount
equal to at least the allocated loan amount with respect to the Title Policy for each such property) after all advances of principal
(including any advances held in escrow or reserves), that insures for the benefit of the owner of the indebtedness secured by the
Mortgage, the first priority lien of the Mortgage, which lien is subject only to (a)�the lien of current real property taxes,
water charges, sewer rents and assessments not yet due and payable; (b)�covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of
way, easements and other matters of public record specifically identified in the Title Policy; (c)�the exceptions (general
and specific) and exclusions set forth in such Title Policy; (d)�other matters to which like properties are commonly subject;
(e)�the rights of tenants (as tenants only) under leases (including subleases) pertaining to the related Mortgaged Property;
(f)�if the related Mortgage Loan constitutes a Cross-Collateralized Mortgage Loan, the lien of the Mortgage for another Mortgage
Loan contained in the same Cross-Collateralized Group, and (g)�condominium declarations of record and identified in such Title
Policy, provided that none of clauses�(a) through (g), individually or in the aggregate, materially and
adversely interferes with the value or principal use of the Mortgaged Property, the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage,
or the current ability of the related Mortgaged Property to generate net cash flow sufficient to service the related Mortgage Loan
or the Mortgagor�s ability to pay its obligations when they become due (collectively, the �Permitted Encumbrances�).
For purposes of clause�(a) of the immediately preceding sentence, any such taxes, assessments and other charges shall
not be considered due and payable until the date on which interest and/or penalties would be payable thereon. Except as contemplated
by clause�(f) of the second preceding sentence none of the Permitted Encumbrances are mortgage liens that are senior
to or coordinate and co-equal with the lien of the related Mortgage. Such Title Policy (or, if it has yet to be issued, the coverage
to be provided thereby) is in full force and effect, all premiums thereon have been paid and no claims have been made by the Mortgage
Loan Seller thereunder and no claims have been paid
�

Exh. C-3
�
�
thereunder. Neither the Mortgage Loan Seller, nor to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s
knowledge, any other holder of the Mortgage Loan, has done, by act or omission, anything that would materially impair the coverage
under such Title Policy. Each Title Policy contains no exclusion for, or affirmatively insures (except for any Mortgaged Property
located in a jurisdiction where such affirmative insurance is not available in which case such exclusion may exist), (a)�that
the Mortgaged Property shown on the survey is the same as the property legally described in the Mortgage and (b)�to the extent
that the Mortgaged Property consists of two or more adjoining parcels, such parcels are contiguous.
�
9.����������Junior
Liens. It being understood that B notes secured by the same Mortgage as a Mortgage Loan are not subordinate mortgages or junior
liens, except for any Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan, as of the Cut-off
Date there are no subordinate mortgages or junior mortgage liens encumbering the related Mortgaged Property other than Permitted
Encumbrances, mechanics� or materialmen�s liens (which are the subject of the representation in paragraph (7) above),
and equipment and other personal property financing. The Mortgage Loan Seller has no knowledge of any mezzanine debt secured directly
by interests in the related Mortgagor other than as set forth on Exhibit C-32-1.
�
10.��������Assignment
of Leases and Rents. There exists as part of the related Mortgage File an Assignment of Leases (either as a separate instrument
or incorporated into the related Mortgage). Subject to the Permitted Encumbrances and Title Exceptions, each related Assignment
of Leases creates a valid first-priority collateral assignment of, or a valid first-priority lien or security interest in, rents
and certain rights under the related lease or leases, subject only to a license granted to the related Mortgagor to exercise certain
rights and to perform certain obligations of the lessor under such lease or leases, including the right to operate the related
leased property, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications. The related Mortgage or related
Assignment of Leases, subject to applicable law and the Standard Qualifications, provides that, upon an event of default under
the Mortgage Loan, a receiver may be appointed for the collection of rents or for the related Mortgagee to enter into possession
to collect the rents or for rents to be paid directly to the Mortgagee.
�
11.��������Financing
Statements. Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each Mortgage Loan or related security agreement establishes a valid security
interest in, and a UCC-1 financing statement has been filed and/or recorded (or, in the case of fixtures, the Mortgage constitutes
a fixture filing) in all places necessary at the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan (or, if not filed and/or recorded,
has submitted or caused to be submitted in proper form for filing and/or recording) to perfect a valid security interest in, the
personal property (creation and perfection of which is governed by the UCC) owned by Mortgagor and necessary to operate such Mortgaged
Property in its current use other than (1)�non-material personal property, (2)�personal property subject to purchase
money security interests and (3)�personal property that is leased equipment. Each UCC-1 financing statement, if any, filed
with respect to personal property constituting a part of the related Mortgaged Property and each UCC-3 assignment, if any, filed
with respect to such financing statement was in suitable form for filing in the filing office in which such financing statement
was filed. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest
in rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions
�

Exh. C-4
�
�
other than the filing of
Uniform Commercial Code financing statements is required to effect such perfection.
�
12.��������Condition
of Property. The Mortgage Loan Seller or the originator of the Mortgage Loan inspected or caused to be inspected each related
Mortgaged Property within six months of origination of the Mortgage Loan and within twelve months of the Cut-off Date.
�
An engineering report or property condition
assessment was prepared in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan no more than twelve months prior to the Cut-off
Date. To the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, based solely upon due diligence customarily performed in connection with the
origination of comparable mortgage loans, as of the Closing Date, each related Mortgaged Property was free and clear of any material
damage (other than (i) deferred maintenance for which escrows were established at origination and (ii) any damage fully covered
by insurance) that would affect materially and adversely the use or value of such Mortgaged Property as security for the Mortgage
Loan.
�
13.��������Taxes
and Assessments. As of the date of origination and, to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, as of the Cut-off Date,
all taxes, governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges (including, without limitation, water and sewage
charges) due with respect to the Mortgaged Property (excluding any related personal property) securing a Mortgage Loan that is
or could become a lien on the related Mortgaged Property that became due and owing prior to the Cut-off Date with respect to each
related Mortgaged Property have been paid, or, if the appropriate amount of such taxes or charges is being appealed or is otherwise
in dispute, the unpaid taxes or charges are covered by an escrow of funds or other security sufficient to pay such tax or charge
and reasonably estimated interest and penalties, if any, thereon. For purposes of this representation and warranty, any such taxes,
assessments and other charges shall not be considered due and payable until the date on which interest and/or penalties would be
payable thereon.
�
14.��������Condemnation.
As of the date of origination and to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there is no proceeding
pending and, to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge as of the date of origination and as of the Cut-off Date, there is no
proceeding threatened for the total or partial condemnation of such Mortgaged Property that would have a material adverse effect
on the value, use or operation of the Mortgaged Property.
�
15.��������Actions
Concerning Mortgage Loan. To the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, based on evaluation of the Title Policy (as defined
in paragraph 8), an engineering report or property condition assessment as described in paragraph 12, applicable
local law compliance materials as described in paragraph 26, the Sponsor Diligence (as defined in paragraph 42),
and the ESA (as defined in paragraph 43), as of origination there was no pending or filed action, suit or proceeding, arbitration
or governmental investigation involving any Mortgagor, guarantor, or Mortgagor�s interest in the Mortgaged Property, an adverse
outcome of which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect (a)�such Mortgagor�s title to the Mortgaged
Property, (b)�the validity or enforceability of the Mortgage, (c)�such Mortgagor�s ability to perform under the
related Mortgage Loan, (d)�such guarantor�s ability to perform under the related guaranty, (e)�the principal benefit
of the security intended to be
�

Exh. C-5
�
�
provided by the Mortgage Loan documents, or (f)�the current principal use of the Mortgaged
Property.
�
16.��������Escrow
Deposits. All escrow deposits and escrow payments currently required to be escrowed with Mortgagee pursuant to each Mortgage
Loan (including capital improvements and environmental remediation reserves) are in the possession, or under the control, of the
Mortgage Loan Seller or its servicer, and there are no delinquencies (subject to any applicable grace or cure periods) in connection
therewith, and all such escrows and deposits (or the right thereto) that are required under the related Mortgage Loan documents
are being conveyed by the Mortgage Loan Seller to the Depositor or its servicer.
�
17.��������No
Holdbacks. The principal amount of the Mortgage Loan stated on the Mortgage Loan Schedule has been fully disbursed as of the
Closing Date and there is no requirement for future advances thereunder (except in those cases where the full amount of the Mortgage
Loan has been disbursed but a portion thereof is being held in escrow or reserve accounts pending the satisfaction of certain conditions
relating to leasing, repairs, occupancy, performance or other matters with respect to the related Mortgaged Property, the Mortgagor
or other considerations determined by the Mortgage Loan Seller to merit such holdback).
�
18.��������Insurance.
Each related Mortgaged Property is, and is required pursuant to the related Mortgage to be, insured by a property insurance policy
providing coverage for loss in accordance with coverage found under a �special cause of loss form� or �all risk
form� that includes replacement cost valuation issued by an insurer meeting the requirements of the related Mortgage Loan
documents and having a claims-paying or financial strength rating of at least �A-:VIII� from A.M.�Best Company
or �A3� (or the equivalent) from Moody�s Investors Service, Inc. or �A-� from S&P Global Ratings
(collectively the �Insurance Rating Requirements�), in an amount (subject to customary deductibles) not less
than the lesser of (1)�the original principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (2)�the full insurable value on a replacement
cost basis of the improvements, furniture, furnishings, fixtures and equipment owned by Mortgagor included in the Mortgaged Property
(with no deduction for physical depreciation), but, in any event, not less than the amount necessary or containing such endorsements
as are necessary to avoid the operation of any coinsurance provisions with respect to the related Mortgaged Property.
�
Each related Mortgaged Property is
also covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan documents, by business interruption or rental loss
insurance which (subject to a customary deductible) covers a period of not less than 12 months (or with respect to each Mortgage
Loan on a single asset with a principal balance of $50 million or more, 18 months).
�
If any material part of the improvements,
exclusive of a parking lot, located on a Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency as having special flood hazards, the related Mortgagor is required to maintain insurance in an amount equal to
the lesser of (A) the maximum amount available under the National Flood Insurance Program, (B) the outstanding principal amount
of the Mortgage Loan or (C) the insurable value of the Mortgaged Property.
�

Exh. C-6
�
�
If the Mortgaged Property is located
within 25 miles of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina or North Carolina,
the related Mortgagor is required to maintain coverage for windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or �named storms�
issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements or endorsement covering damage from windstorm and/or windstorm related
perils and/or named storms, in an amount not less than the lesser of (1) the original principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and
(2) the full insurable value on a replacement cost basis of the improvements, furniture, furnishings, fixtures and equipment owned
by the Mortgagor and included in the Mortgaged Property (with no deduction for physical depreciation), but, in any event, not less
than the amount necessary or containing such endorsements as are necessary to avoid the operation of any coinsurance provisions
with respect to the related Mortgaged Property by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements.
�
The Mortgaged Property is covered,
and required to be covered pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan documents, by a commercial general liability insurance policy
issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements including coverage for property damage, contractual damage and personal
injury (including bodily injury and death) in amounts as are generally required by the Mortgage Loan Seller for similar commercial
and multifamily loans intended for securitization, and in any event not less than $1 million per occurrence and $2 million in the
aggregate.
�
An architectural or engineering consultant
has performed an analysis of each of the Mortgaged Properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4 in order to evaluate the seismic
condition of such property, for the sole purpose of assessing the probable maximum loss or scenario expected loss (�PML�)
for the Mortgaged Property in the event of an earthquake. In such instance, the PML was based on a 475-year return period, an exposure
period of 50 years and a 10% probability of exceedance. If the resulting report concluded that the PML would exceed 20% of the
amount of the replacement costs of the improvements, earthquake insurance on such Mortgaged Property was obtained by an insurer
rated at least �A:VIII� by A.M.�Best Company or �A3� (or the equivalent) from Moody�s Investors
Service,�Inc. or �A-� by S&P Global Ratings in an amount not less than 100% of the PML.
�
The Mortgage Loan documents require
insurance proceeds (or an amount equal to such insurance proceeds) in respect of a property loss to be applied either (a)�to
the repair or restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property, with respect to all property losses in excess of 5%
of the then-outstanding principal amount of the related Mortgage Loan, the Mortgagee (or a trustee appointed by it) having the
right to hold and disburse such proceeds as the repair or restoration progresses, or (b)�to the payment of the outstanding
principal balance of such Mortgage Loan together with any accrued interest thereon.
�
All premiums on all insurance policies
referred to in this section that are required by the Mortgage Loan documents to be paid as of the Cut-off Date have been paid,
and such insurance policies name the Mortgagee under the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns as a loss payee under a mortgagee
endorsement clause or, in the case of the general liability insurance policy, as named or additional insured. Such insurance policies
will inure to the benefit of the trustee. Each related Mortgage Loan obligates the related Mortgagor to maintain all such insurance
and, at such Mortgagor�s failure to do so, authorizes the Mortgagee to maintain such
�

Exh. C-7
�
�
insurance at the Mortgagor�s cost
and expense and to charge such Mortgagor for related premiums. All such insurance policies (other than commercial liability policies)
require at least 10�days� prior notice to the Mortgagee of termination or cancellation arising because of nonpayment
of a premium and at least 30�days� prior notice to the Mortgagee of termination or cancellation (or such lesser period,
not less than 10�days, as may be required by applicable law) arising for any reason other than non-payment of a premium and
no such notice has been received by the Mortgage Loan Seller.
�
19.��������Access;
Utilities; Separate Tax Parcels. Based solely on evaluation of the Title Policy (as defined in paragraph 8) and survey,
if any, an engineering report or property condition assessment as described in paragraph 12, applicable local law compliance
materials as described in paragraph 26, the Sponsor Diligence (as defined in paragraph 42), and the ESA (as defined
in paragraph 43), each Mortgaged Property (a)�is located on or adjacent to a public road and has direct legal access
to such road, or has permanent access from a recorded easement or right of way permitting ingress and egress to/from a public road,
(b)�is served by or has access rights to public or private water and sewer (or well and septic) and other utilities necessary
for the current use of the Mortgaged Property, all of which are adequate for the current use of the Mortgaged Property, and (c)�constitutes
one or more separate tax parcels which do not include any property which is not part of the Mortgaged Property or is subject to
an endorsement under the related Title Policy insuring the Mortgaged Property, or in certain cases, an application has been made
or is required to be made to the applicable governing authority for creation of separate tax parcels (or the Mortgage Loan documents
so require such application in the future), in which case the Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor to escrow an amount sufficient
to pay taxes for the existing tax parcel of which the Mortgaged Property is a part until the separate tax parcels are created.
�
20.��������No
Encroachments. To the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge based solely on surveys obtained in connection with origination
and the Title Policy obtained in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan, and except for encroachments that do not
materially and adversely affect the current marketability or principal use of the Mortgaged Property: (a)�all material improvements
that were included for the purpose of determining the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property at the time of the origination
of such Mortgage Loan are within the boundaries of the related Mortgaged Property, except for encroachments that are insured against
by the applicable Title Policy; (b)�no material improvements on adjoining parcels encroach onto the related Mortgaged Property
except for encroachments that are insured against by the applicable Title Policy; and (c)�no material improvements encroach
upon any easements except for encroachments that are insured against by the applicable Title Policy.
�
21.��������No
Contingent Interest or Equity Participation. No Mortgage Loan has a shared appreciation feature, any other contingent interest
feature or a negative amortization feature (except that an ARD Loan may provide for the accrual of the portion of interest in excess
of the rate in effect prior to the Anticipated Repayment Date) or an equity participation by the Mortgage Loan Seller.
�
22.��������REMIC.
The Mortgage Loan is a �qualified mortgage� within the meaning of Section�860G(a)(3) of the Code (but determined
without regard to the rule in
�

Exh. C-8
�
�
Treasury Regulations Section�1.860G-2(f)(2) that treats certain defective mortgage loans as
qualified mortgages), and, accordingly, (A)�the issue price of the Mortgage Loan to the related Mortgagor at origination did
not exceed the non-contingent principal amount of the Mortgage Loan and (B)�either: (a)�such Mortgage Loan is secured
by an interest in real property (including buildings and structural components thereof, but excluding personal property) having
a fair market value (i)�at the date the Mortgage Loan was originated at least equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price of
the Mortgage Loan (together with any related Pari Passu Companion Loans) on such date or (ii)�at the Closing Date at least
equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price of the Mortgage Loan (together with any related Pari Passu Companion Loans) on such date,
provided that for purposes hereof, the fair market value of the real property interest must first be reduced by (A)�the
amount of any lien on the real property interest that is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (B)�a proportionate amount of any
lien that is in parity with the Mortgage Loan; or (b)�substantially all of the proceeds of such Mortgage Loan were used to
acquire, improve or protect the real property which served as the only security for such Mortgage Loan (other than a recourse feature
or other third-party credit enhancement within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section�1.860G-2(a)(1)(ii)). If the Mortgage
Loan was �significantly modified� prior to the Closing Date so as to result in a taxable exchange under Section�1001
of the Code, it either (x)�was modified as a result of the default or reasonably foreseeable default of such Mortgage Loan
or (y)�satisfies the provisions of either sub-clause�(B)(a)(i) above (substituting the date of the last such modification
for the date the Mortgage Loan was originated) or sub-clause�(B)(a)(ii), including the proviso thereto. Any Prepayment
Premium and Yield Maintenance Charges applicable to the Mortgage Loan constitute �customary prepayment penalties� within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section�1.860G-1(b)(2). All terms used in this paragraph shall have the same meanings
as set forth in the related Treasury Regulations.
�
23.��������Compliance
with Usury Laws. The mortgage rate (exclusive of any default interest, late charges, Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment
Premium) of such Mortgage Loan complied as of the date of origination with, or was exempt from, applicable state or federal laws,
regulations and other requirements pertaining to usury.

24.��������Authorized
to do Business. To the extent required under applicable law, as of the Cut-off Date or as of the date that such entity held
the Mortgage Note, each holder of the Mortgage Note was authorized to transact and do business in the jurisdiction in which each
related Mortgaged Property is located, or the failure to be so authorized does not materially and adversely affect the enforceability
of such Mortgage Loan by the Trust.

25.��������Trustee
under Deed of Trust. With respect to each Mortgage which is a deed of trust, as of the date of origination and, to the Mortgage
Loan Seller�s knowledge, as of the Closing Date, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, currently

26.��������Local
Law Compliance. To the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, based upon any of a letter from any governmental authorities,
a legal opinion, an architect�s letter, a zoning consultant�s report, an endorsement to the related Title Policy, a
survey, or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Mortgage
Loan Seller for similar commercial and multifamily mortgage loans intended for securitization, the improvements located on or forming
part of each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan are in material compliance with applicable laws, zoning ordinances, rules,
covenants, and restrictions (collectively �Zoning Regulations�) governing the occupancy, use, and operation
of such Mortgaged Property or constitute a legal non-conforming use or structure and any non-conformity with zoning laws constitutes
a legal non-conforming use or structure which does not materially and adversely affect the use, operation or value of such Mortgaged
Property. In the event of casualty or destruction, (a)�the Mortgaged Property may be restored or repaired to the full extent
necessary to maintain the use of the structure immediately prior to such casualty or destruction, (b)�law and ordinance insurance
coverage has been obtained for the Mortgaged Property in amounts customarily required by the Mortgage Loan Seller for similar commercial
and multifamily loans intended for securitization, (c)�title insurance policy coverage has been obtained with respect to any
non-conforming use or structure, or (d) the inability to restore the Mortgaged Property to the full extent of the use or structure
immediately prior to the casualty would not materially and adversely affect the use or operation of such Mortgaged Property.
�
27.��������Licenses
and Permits. Each Mortgagor covenants in the Mortgage Loan documents that it shall keep all material licenses, permits, franchises,
certificates of occupancy and applicable governmental approvals necessary for the operation of the Mortgaged Property in full force
and effect, and to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge based upon any of a letter from any government authorities, zoning
consultant�s report or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted
by the Mortgage Loan Seller for similar commercial and multifamily mortgage loans intended for securitization; all such material
licenses, permits, franchises, certificates of occupancy and applicable governmental approvals are in effect or the failure to
obtain or maintain such material licenses, permits, franchises or certificates of occupancy and applicable governmental approvals
does not materially and adversely affect the use and/or operation of the Mortgaged Property as it was used and operated as of the
date of origination of the Mortgage Loan or the rights of a holder of the related Mortgage Loan. The Mortgage Loan requires the
related Mortgagor to be qualified to do business in the jurisdiction in which the related Mortgaged Property is located and requires
the Mortgagor to comply in all material respects with all applicable regulations, zoning and building laws.
�
28.��������Recourse
Obligations. The Mortgage Loan documents for each Mortgage Loan (a)�provide that such Mortgage Loan becomes full recourse
to the Mortgagor and guarantor (which is a natural person or persons, or an entity or entities distinct from the Mortgagor
(but may be affiliated with the Mortgagor) that collectively, as of the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loan, have
assets other than equity in the related Mortgaged Property that are not de�minimis) in any of the following events
(or negotiated provisions of substantially similar effect): (i)�if any petition for bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or
liquidation pursuant to federal bankruptcy law, or any similar federal or state law, shall be filed by, consented to, or acquiesced
in by, the Mortgagor; (ii)�Mortgagor or guarantor shall have solicited or caused to be
�

Exh. C-10
�
�
solicited petitioning creditors to
cause an involuntary bankruptcy filing with respect to the Mortgagor or (iii)�transfers of either the Mortgaged Property or
controlling equity interests in Mortgagor made in violation of the Mortgage Loan documents; and (b)�contains provisions for
recourse against the Mortgagor and guarantor (which is a natural person or persons, or an entity or entities distinct from the
Mortgagor (but may be affiliated with the Mortgagor) that collectively, as of the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loan,
have assets other than equity in the related Mortgaged Property that are not de�minimis), for losses and damages resulting
from the following (or negotiated provisions of substantially similar effect): (i)�Mortgagor�s misappropriation of rents
after an event of default, security deposits, insurance proceeds, or condemnation awards; (ii)�Mortgagor�s fraud or
intentional material misrepresentation; (iii)� breaches of the environmental covenants in the Mortgage Loan documents; or
(iv)�Mortgagor�s commission of intentional material physical waste at the Mortgaged Property.
�
29.��������Mortgage
Releases. The terms of the related Mortgage or related Mortgage Loan documents do not provide for release of any material portion
of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage except (a)�a partial release, accompanied by principal repayment,
or partial defeasance (as described in paragraph 34) of not less than a specified percentage at least equal to 110% of the
related allocated loan amount of such portion of the Mortgaged Property, (b)�upon payment in full of such Mortgage Loan, (c)�upon
a Defeasance (defined in paragraph 34 below), (d)�releases of out-parcels that are unimproved or other portions of
the Mortgaged Property which will not have a material adverse effect on the underwritten value of the Mortgaged Property and which
were not afforded any material value in the appraisal obtained at the origination of the Mortgage Loan and are not necessary for
physical access to the Mortgaged Property or compliance with zoning requirements, or (e)�as required pursuant to an order
of condemnation. With respect to any partial release under the preceding clauses�(a) or (d), either: (x)�such
release of collateral (i)�would not constitute a �significant modification� of the subject Mortgage Loan within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section�1.860G-2(b)(2) and (ii)�would not cause the subject Mortgage Loan to fail
to be a �qualified mortgage� within the meaning of Section�860G(a)(3)(A) of the Code; or (y)�the Mortgagee
or servicer can, in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan documents, condition such release of collateral on the related Mortgagor�s
delivery of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect specified in the immediately preceding clause�(x). For purposes
of the preceding clause�(x), if the fair market value of the real property constituting such Mortgaged Property (reduced
by (1) the amount of any lien on the real property that is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (2) a proportionate amount of any lien
on the real property that is in parity with the Mortgage Loan) after the release is not equal to at least 80% of the principal
balance of the Mortgage Loan (together with any related Pari Passu Companion Loans) outstanding after the release, the Mortgagor
is required to make a payment of principal in an amount not less than the amount required by the REMIC Provisions.
�
In the case of any Mortgage Loan, in
the event of a taking of any portion of a Mortgaged Property by a State or any political subdivision or authority thereof, whether
by legal proceeding or by agreement, the Mortgagor can be required to pay down the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan (together
with any related Pari Passu Companion Loans) in an amount not less than the amount required by the REMIC Provisions and, to such
extent, the award from any such taking may not be required to be applied to the restoration of the Mortgaged Property or released
to the Mortgagor, if, immediately after the release of such portion of the Mortgaged
�

Exh. C-11
�
�
Property from the lien of the Mortgage (but
taking into account the planned restoration) the fair market value of the real property constituting the remaining Mortgaged Property
(reduced by (1) the amount of any lien on the real property that is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (2) a proportionate amount
of any lien on the real property that is in parity with the Mortgage Loan) is not equal to at least 80% of the remaining principal
balance of the Mortgage Loan (together with any related Pari Passu Companion Loans).
�
No such Mortgage Loan that is secured
by more than one Mortgaged Property or that is cross-collateralized with another Mortgage Loan permits the release of cross-collateralization
of the related Mortgaged Properties or a portion thereof, including due to a partial condemnation, other than in compliance with
the REMIC Provisions.
�
30.��������Financial
Reporting and Rent Rolls. Each Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor to provide the owner or holder of the Mortgage Loan with
(a)�quarterly (other than for single-tenant properties) and annual operating statements, (b)�quarterly (other than for
single-tenant properties) rent rolls for properties that have any individual lease which accounts for more than 5% of the in-place
base rent, and (c)�annual financial statements.
�
31.��������Acts
of Terrorism Exclusion. With respect to each Mortgage Loan over $20�million, and to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge
with respect to each Mortgage Loan of $20�million or less, as of origination the related special-form all-risk insurance policy
and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) do not specifically exclude Acts
of Terrorism, as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization
Act of 2007 and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (collectively referred to as �TRIA�),
from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy. With respect to each Mortgage
Loan, the related Mortgage Loan documents do not expressly waive or prohibit the Mortgagee from requiring coverage for Acts of
Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, or damages related thereto, except to the extent that any right to require such coverage may be
limited by commercial availability on commercially reasonable terms, or as otherwise indicated on Schedule�C; provided,
that if TRIA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then, provided that terrorism insurance is commercially
available, the Mortgagor under each Mortgage Loan is required to carry terrorism insurance, but in such event the Mortgagor shall
not be required to spend on terrorism insurance coverage more than two times the amount of the insurance premium that is payable
in respect of the property and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under the related Mortgage Loan documents (without
giving effect to the cost of terrorism and earthquake components of such casualty and business interruption/rental loss insurance)
at the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan, and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds such amount, the Mortgagor
is required to purchase the maximum amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to such amount.
�
32.��������Due
on Sale or Encumbrance. Subject to specific exceptions set forth below, each Mortgage Loan contains a �due-on-sale�
or other such provision for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan if, without the
consent of the holder of the Mortgage (which consent, in some cases, may not be unreasonably withheld) and/or complying with the
requirements of the related Mortgage Loan documents (which provide for transfers without the consent of the Mortgagee which are
customarily acceptable to the
�

Exh. C-12

�
Mortgage Loan Seller, including, but not limited to, transfers of worn-out or obsolete furnishings,
fixtures, or equipment promptly replaced with property of equivalent value and functionality and transfers by leases entered into
in accordance with the Mortgage Loan documents), (a)�the related Mortgaged Property, or any equity interest of greater than
50% in the related Mortgagor, is directly or indirectly pledged, transferred or sold, other than as related to (i)�family

in the related Mortgage Loan documents, (iii)�transfers of less than, or other than, a controlling interest in a Mortgagor,
(iv)�transfers to another holder of direct or indirect equity in the Mortgagor, a specific Person designated in the related
Mortgage Loan documents or a Person satisfying specific criteria identified in the related Mortgage Loan documents, (v)�transfers
of common stock in publicly traded companies or (vi)�a substitution or release of collateral within the parameters of paragraphs
29 and 34 herein, or (vii)�by reason of any mezzanine debt that existed at the origination of the related Mortgage
Loan as set forth on Exhibit C-32-1, or future permitted mezzanine debt, in any event as set forth on Exhibit C-32-2
or (b)�the related Mortgaged Property is encumbered with a subordinate lien or security interest against the related Mortgaged
Property, other than (i)�any Companion Loan of any Mortgage Loan or any subordinate debt that existed at origination and is
permitted under the related Mortgage Loan documents, (ii)�purchase money security interests (iii)�any Mortgage Loan that
is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan, as set forth on Exhibit C-32-3 or (iv)�Permitted
Encumbrances. The Mortgage or other Mortgage Loan documents provide that to the extent any Rating Agency fees are incurred in connection
with the review of and consent to any transfer or encumbrance, the Mortgagor is responsible for such payment along with all other
reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Mortgagee relative to such transfer or encumbrance.
�
33.��������Single-Purpose
Entity. Each Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor to be a Single-Purpose Entity for at least as long as the Mortgage Loan is
outstanding. Each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-off Date Balance of $30�million or more has a counsel�s opinion regarding
non-consolidation of the Mortgagor. For this purpose, a �Single-Purpose Entity� shall mean an entity, other
than an individual, whose organizational documents and the related Mortgage Loan documents (or if the Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off
Date Balance equal to $10�million or less, its organizational documents or the related Mortgage Loan documents) provide substantially
to the effect that it was formed or organized solely for the purpose of owning and operating one or more of the Mortgaged Properties
and prohibit it from engaging in any business unrelated to such Mortgaged Property or Properties, and whose organizational documents
further provide, or which entity represented in the related Mortgage Loan documents, substantially to the effect that it does not
have any assets other than those related to its interest in and operation of such Mortgaged Property or Properties, or any indebtedness
other than as permitted by the related Mortgage(s) or the other related Mortgage Loan documents, that it has its own books and
records and accounts separate and apart from those of any other person (other than a Mortgagor for a Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized
and cross-defaulted with the related Mortgage Loan), and that it holds itself out as a legal entity, separate and apart from any
other person or entity.
�
34.��������Defeasance.
With respect to any Mortgage Loan that, pursuant to the Mortgage Loan documents, can be defeased (a �Defeasance�),
(i)�the Mortgage Loan documents provide for defeasance as a unilateral right of the Mortgagor, subject to satisfaction of
conditions specified in the Mortgage Loan documents; (ii)�the Mortgage Loan cannot be defeased within
�

Exh. C-13
�
�
two years after the
Closing Date; (iii)�the Mortgagor is permitted to pledge only United States �government securities� within the

payments under the Mortgage Loan when due, including the entire remaining principal balance on the maturity date (or on or after
the first date on which payment may be made without payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium) or, if the Mortgage
Loan is an ARD Loan, the entire principal balance outstanding on the Anticipated Repayment Date (or on or after the first date
on which payment may be made without payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium), and if the Mortgage Loan permits
partial releases of real property in connection with partial defeasance, the revenues from the collateral will be sufficient to
pay all such scheduled payments calculated on a principal amount equal to a specified percentage at least equal to 110% of the
allocated loan amount for the real property to be released; (iv)�the defeasance collateral is not permitted to be subject
to prepayment, call, or early redemption; (v)�the Mortgagor is required to provide a certification from an independent certified
public accountant that the collateral is sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the Mortgage Note as set forth in clause�(iii)
above; (vi)�the defeased note and the defeasance collateral are required to be assumed by a Single-Purpose Entity; (vii)�the
Mortgagor is required to provide an opinion of counsel that the Trustee has a perfected security interest in such collateral prior
to any other claim or interest; and (viii)�the Mortgagor is required to pay all rating agency fees associated with defeasance
(if rating confirmation is a specific condition precedent thereto) and all other reasonable expenses associated with defeasance,
including, but not limited to, accountant�s fees and opinions of counsel.
�
35.��������Fixed
Interest Rates. Each Mortgage Loan bears interest at a rate that remains fixed throughout the remaining term of such Mortgage
Loan, except in the case of ARD Loans and situations where default interest is imposed.
�
36.��������Ground
Leases. For purposes of this Exhibit C, a �Ground Lease� shall mean a lease creating a leasehold
estate in real property where the fee owner as the ground lessor conveys for a term or terms of years its entire interest in the
land and buildings and other improvements, if any, comprising the premises demised under such lease to the ground lessee (who may,
in certain circumstances, own the building and improvements on the land), subject to the reversionary interest of the ground lessor
as fee owner.
�
With respect to any Mortgage Loan where
the Mortgage Loan is secured by a Ground Leasehold estate in whole or in part, and the related Mortgage does not also encumber
the related lessor�s fee interest in such Mortgaged Property, based upon the terms of the Ground Lease and any estoppel or
other agreement received from the ground lessor in favor of Mortgage Loan Seller, its successors and assigns (collectively, the
�Ground Lease and Related Documents�), Mortgage Loan Seller represents and warrants that:
�
(A)�������The
Ground Lease or a memorandum regarding such Ground Lease has been duly recorded or submitted for recordation in a form that is
acceptable for recording in the applicable jurisdiction. The Ground Lease and Related Documents permit the interest of the lessee
to be encumbered by the related Mortgage and do not restrict the use of the related Mortgaged Property by such lessee, its successors
or assigns in a manner that would materially adversely affect the security provided by the related Mortgage. No
�

Exh. C-14
�
�
material change
in the terms of the Ground Lease had occurred since its recordation, except by any written instruments which are included in the
related Mortgage File;
�
(B)�������The
lessor under such Ground Lease has agreed in a writing included in the related Mortgage File (or in such Ground Lease and Related
Documents) that the Ground Lease may not be amended, modified, canceled or terminated by agreement of lessor and lessee without
the prior written consent of the Mortgagee and that any such action without such consent is not binding on the Mortgagee, its successors
or assigns, provided that Mortgagee has provided lessor with notice of its lien in accordance with the terms of the Ground Lease;
�
(C)�������The
Ground Lease has an original term (or an original term plus one or more optional renewal terms, which, under all circumstances,
may be exercised, and will be enforceable, by either Mortgagor or the Mortgagee) that extends not less than 20�years beyond
the stated maturity of the related Mortgage Loan, or 10�years past the stated maturity if such Mortgage Loan fully amortizes
by the stated maturity (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan that accrues on an actual 360 basis, substantially amortizes);
�
(D)�������The
Ground Lease either (i)�is not subject to any interests, estates, liens or encumbrances superior to, or of equal priority
with, the Mortgage, except for the related fee interest of the ground lessor and the Permitted Encumbrances and Title Exceptions;
or (ii)�is the subject of a subordination, non-disturbance or attornment agreement or similar agreement to which the Mortgagee
on the lessor�s fee interest is subject;
�
(E)�������Subject
to the notice requirements of the Ground Lease and Related Documents, the Ground Lease does not place commercially unreasonable
restrictions on the identity of the Mortgagee and the Ground Lease is assignable to the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors
and assigns without the consent of the lessor thereunder (or, if such consent is required it either has been obtained or cannot
be unreasonably withheld, provided that such Ground Lease has not been terminated and all amounts due thereunder have been paid),
and in the event it is so assigned, it is further assignable by the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns
without the consent of the lessor (or, if such consent is required it either has been obtained or cannot be unreasonably withheld,
provided that such Ground Lease has not been terminated and all amounts due thereunder have been paid);
�
(F)�������The
Mortgage Loan Seller has not received any written notice of material default under or notice of termination of such Ground Lease.
To the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, there is no material default under such Ground Lease and no condition that, but
for the passage of time or giving of notice, would result in a material default under the terms of such Ground Lease and to the
Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, such Ground Lease is in full force and effect as of the Closing Date;
�
(G)�������The
Ground Lease and Related Documents require the lessor to give to the Mortgagee written notice of any default, provides that no
notice of default or termination is effective against the Mortgagee unless such notice is given to the Mortgagee;
�

Exh. C-15
�
�
(H)�������A
Mortgagee is permitted a reasonable opportunity (including, where necessary, sufficient time to gain possession of the interest
of the lessee under the Ground Lease through legal proceedings) to cure any default under the Ground Lease which is curable after
the Mortgagee�s receipt of notice of any default before the lessor may terminate the Ground Lease;
�
(I)��������The
Ground Lease does not impose any restrictions on subletting that would be viewed as commercially unreasonable by the Mortgage Loan
Seller in connection with the origination of similar commercial or multifamily loans intended for securitization;
�
(J)��������Under
the terms of the Ground Lease and Related Documents, any related insurance proceeds or the portion of the condemnation award allocable
to the ground lessee�s interest (other than in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking as addressed in subpart
(K)) will be applied either to the repair or to restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property with (so long
as such proceeds are in excess of the threshold amount specified in the related Mortgage Loan documents) the Mortgagee or a trustee
appointed by it having the right to hold and disburse such proceeds as repair or restoration progresses, or to the payment of the
outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest;
�
(K)�������In
the case of a total or substantially total taking or loss, under the terms of the Ground Lease and Related Documents, any related
insurance proceeds, or portion of the condemnation award allocable to ground lessee�s interest in respect of a total or substantially
total loss or taking of the related Mortgaged Property to the extent not applied to restoration, will be applied first to the payment
of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest; and
�
(L)�������Provided
that the Mortgagee cures any defaults which are susceptible to being cured, the ground lessor has agreed to enter into a new lease
with Mortgagee upon termination of the Ground Lease for any reason, including rejection of the Ground Lease in a bankruptcy proceeding.
�
37.�������Servicing.
The servicing and collection practices used by the Mortgage Loan Seller with respect to the Mortgage Loan have been, in all respects
legal and have met with customary industry standards for servicing of commercial loans for conduit loan programs.
�
38.�������Origination
and Underwriting. The origination practices of the Mortgage Loan Seller (or the related originator if the Mortgage Loan Seller
was not the originator) with respect to each Mortgage Loan have been, in all material respects, legal and as of the date of its
origination, such Mortgage Loan and the origination thereof complied in all material respects with, or was exempt from, all requirements
of federal, state or local law relating to the origination of such Mortgage Loan; provided that such representation and
warranty does not address or otherwise cover any matters with respect to federal, state or local law otherwise covered in this
Exhibit�C.

40.�������No
Material Default; Payment Record. No Mortgage Loan has been more than 30�days delinquent, without giving effect to any
grace or cure period, in making required payments in the prior 12�months (or since origination if such Mortgage Loan has been
originated within the past 12�months), and as of Cut-off Date, no Mortgage Loan is delinquent (beyond any applicable grace
or cure period) in making required payments. To the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, there is (a)�no material default,
breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under the related Mortgage Loan, or (b)�no event (other than payments
due but not yet delinquent) which, with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would
constitute a material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, which default, breach, violation or event of acceleration
in the case of either clause (a) or clause (b), materially and adversely affects the value of the Mortgage Loan or
the value, use or operation of the related Mortgaged Property; provided, however, that this representation and warranty
does not cover any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration that specifically pertains to or arises out of an exception
scheduled to any other representation and warranty made by the Mortgage Loan Seller in this Exhibit�C. No person other
than the holder of such Mortgage Loan may declare any event of default under the Mortgage Loan or accelerate any indebtedness under
the Mortgage Loan documents.
�
41.�������Bankruptcy.
As of the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loan and to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge as of the Cut-off
Date, neither the Mortgaged Property (other than any tenants of such Mortgaged Property), nor any portion thereof, is the subject
of, and no Mortgagor, guarantor or tenant occupying a single-tenant property is a debtor in state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar proceeding.

42.�������Organization
of Mortgagor. With respect to each Mortgage Loan, in reliance on certified copies of the organizational documents of the Mortgagor
delivered by the Mortgagor in connection with the origination of such Mortgage Loan, the Mortgagor is an entity organized under
the laws of a state of the United States of America, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Except with respect
to any Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan, no Mortgage Loan has a Mortgagor
that is an Affiliate of another Mortgagor. An �Affiliate� for purposes of this paragraph (42) means, a Mortgagor that
is under direct or indirect common ownership and control with another Mortgagor.

43.�������Environmental
Conditions. A Phase I environmental site assessment (or update of a previous Phase I and or Phase II environmental site assessment)
and, with respect to certain Mortgage Loans, a Phase II environmental site assessment (collectively, an �ESA�)
meeting ASTM requirements conducted by a reputable environmental consultant in connection with such Mortgage Loan within 12�months
prior to its origination date (or an update of a previous ESA was prepared), and such ESA (i)�did not identify the existence
of recognized environmental conditions (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor, hereinafter �Environmental
Condition�) at the related Mortgaged Property or the need for further investigation, or (ii)�if the existence of
an Environmental Condition or need for further investigation was indicated in any such ESA, then at least one of the following
statements is true: (A)�an amount reasonably estimated by a reputable environmental consultant to be sufficient to cover the
estimated cost to cure any material noncompliance with applicable Environmental Laws or the Environmental Condition has been escrowed
by the related Mortgagor and is held or
�

Exh. C-17
�
�
controlled by the related Mortgagee; (B)�if the only Environmental Condition relates
to the presence of asbestos-containing materials, radon in indoor air, lead based paint or lead in drinking water, the only recommended
action in the ESA is the institution of such a plan, an operations or maintenance plan has been required to be instituted by the
related Mortgagor that can reasonably be expected to mitigate the identified risk; (C)�the Environmental Condition identified
in the related environmental report was remediated or abated in all material respects prior to the date hereof, and, if and as
appropriate, a no further action or closure letter was obtained from the applicable governmental regulatory authority (or the environmental
issue affecting the related Mortgaged Property was otherwise listed by such governmental authority as �closed� or a
reputable environmental consultant has concluded that no further action is required); (D)�an environmental policy or a lender�s
pollution legal liability insurance policy meeting the requirements set forth below that covers liability for the identified circumstance
or condition was obtained from an insurer rated no less than �A-� (or the equivalent) by Moody�s Investors Service,
Inc., S&P Global Ratings and/or Fitch Ratings, Inc.; (E)�a party not related to the Mortgagor was identified as the responsible
party for such condition or circumstance and such responsible party has financial resources reasonably estimated to be adequate
to address the situation; or (F)�a party related to the Mortgagor having financial resources reasonably estimated to be adequate
to address the situation is required to take action. To the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, except as set forth in the
ESA, there is no Environmental Condition (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor) at the related Mortgaged Property.

45.�������Appraisal.
The Mortgage File contains an appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property with an appraisal date within 6�months of the Mortgage
Loan origination date, and within 12�months of the Cut-off Date. The appraisal is signed by an appraiser that (i)�was
engaged directly by the originator of the Mortgage Loan or the Mortgage Loan Seller, or a correspondent or agent of the originator
of the Mortgage Loan or the Mortgage Loan Seller, and (ii)�to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, had no interest,
direct or indirect, in the Mortgaged Property or the Mortgagor or in any loan made on the security thereof, and whose compensation
is not affected by the approval or disapproval of the Mortgage Loan. Each appraiser has represented in such appraisal or in a supplemental
letter that the appraisal satisfies the requirements of the �Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice�
as adopted by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation.

Fremaux Town Center (Loan No. 10)
Parent company (CBL & Associates Properties, Inc.) of guarantor was cited by unnamed sources in a May 24, 2016 article in the Wall Street Journal as being the subject of an SEC and FBI investigation for falsifying information on financial statements to banks in connection with certain nonrecourse loans originated in 2011 and 2012. The unnamed sources indicated that former employees have alleged that the related company inflated its rental income and property occupancy rates in financial reporting. The company has denied the allegations. An August 16, 2016 newspaper report cites a letter from the SEC indicating that it has concluded its investigation and, based on available information, was not recommending an enforcement action against CBL. As a
result of the initial report, however, at least one shareholder action has been filed against the company, and several have been threatened. These lawsuits remain unresolved and are in their initial stages.��

West Covina Parkway Plaza (Loan No. 14)
Part Fee/ Part Leasehold; Fee Not Subordinated. The ground lease expiration is April 26.2055 (loan maturity is October 11, 2026).��The leasehold is comprised of an 89-foot strip of parking area, and small corners (482 square feet total) of two one-story buildings. The mortgaged property is comprised of five buildings totaling 87,329 square feet. The ground lessor is Los Angeles County, CA, and the underlying fee is a buffer area to the Walnut Creek flood control channel that runs adjacent to the mortgaged property. Los Angeles County, CA was willing to provide a limited ground lessor estoppel only. Variations (references are to related subparagraphs of the representation):��(i) The ground lease expressly prohibits subleasing without the ground lessor�s approval, and the leasehold area includes corner portions of structures which have been leased without the ground lessor�s prior
consent; however, (A) the incursion of the structures into the leasehold area are minimal, (B) the ground lessor has indicated no known ground lease defaults in its estoppel, (C) the property has been operated since its construction in 1990 in its current configuration, and (D) the loan documents provide for personal liability to the borrower and guarantors for losses related to such condition�s creating a ground lease default. (k) Neither the ground lease nor estoppel provide that available casualty or condemnation proceeds will first be applied to the debt. (l) While the lender has the right to enter into a new ground lease with ground lessor in the event the ground lease is terminated, no express right exists to enter into a new lease with the ground lessor in the event of a rejection of the ground lease in bankruptcy. The loan documents provide for a ground rent reserve, and, in addition to the losses carve-out detailed above, provide that the loan is springing recourse
to the borrower and guarantors if the ground lease is terminated without the lender�s consent. The guarantors� aggregate stated net worth as of April 1, 2016 is approximately $155 million.

Leasehold/ Fee Not Subordinated. Entirety of mortgaged property is leasehold. Ground lessor is DeRenne Properties, LLC, and latest expiration is May 31, 2100 (loan matures September 11, 2026). Variations (references are to related subparagraphs of the representation):��(g) The ground lessor is required to give the lender notice of ground lessee default, but failure to provide such notice does not preclude ground lessor from pursuing remedies; provided, however, that the ground lease cannot be terminated without the ground lessor�s giving written notice to the lender and reasonable time to obtain possession or foreclose. If the ground lease is terminated without the lender�s having received notice of such termination, the ground lease affords the lender a���new lease� option provided lender cures the underlying default. (h) There is no notice and cure period under the ground
lease for payment defaults. The loan documents require the borrower to provide ongoing proof of ground rent payment to lender. (k) The ground lease provides that, in the event of total casualty, ground lessee has right to rebuild without rent abatement or it may terminate the lease. If it terminates, the ground lessee has obligation to scrape debris before remaining proceeds may be applied to pay existing mortgage debt.��In the event of a total taking, the ground lessor is first entitled to an amount equal to outstanding rent, and then to an amount equal to the value of its fee interest, before leasehold mortgagees are paid from available takings proceeds. (l) The lender has a right to a new lease only if the lender did not receive prior notice of any related termination, and lender cures the underlying default.

The Phase I environmental site assessment obtained at loan origination identified a recognized environmental condition associated with two underground storage tanks (UST�s) containing fuel oil that were installed on about 1991. The environmental consultant estimated that remediation costs, if necessary, would range from $750,000 to $1 million. The Phase I ESA recommended a Phase II subsurface assessment.��The lender waived a Phase II ESA based on the guarantor�s stated net worth and a borrower-owned Storage Tank Third Party Liability, Corrective Action and Clean-Up Costs Policy issued by AIG Specialty Insurance Company (a member company of American International Group Inc.) in the amount of $1 million, with a one year term (with an optional extended reporting period of an additional year for the same annual premium) and having a $50,000 deductible. The policy covers five other locations and eight other storage tanks at affiliate-owned
properties. The policy premium for the one year term was pre-paid at closing. The lender is also an additional insured under a Commercial Pollution Legal Liability Policy issued by Commerce and Industry Insurance Company (also a member of American International Group, Inc.) with limits of $20 million per occurrence and $40 million in the aggregate, with a term expiring November 15, 2018 and having a deductible of up to $100,000 per occurrence.��The policy is a blanket policy covering multiple locations, including the identified UST�s at the mortgaged property. The premium has been pre-paid through November 15, 2017. American International Group Inc. has an S & P rating of �A-�.
