Richard "Scott" Johnson
Sunday, May 17, 2015, R. Scott Johnson left this earth too soon. Scott was a loving son, brother, twin, grandson, nephew, cousin, teammate, loyal friend and amazing person. Scott was born on May 22, 1994 with his twin sister Liza. He was the son of Richard D. and Jennifer W. Johnson of Charleston, West Virginia. In addition to his parents, Scott is survived by his twin sister Liza Johnson; his older brother Joseph H. Spano Jr. of Charleston; his maternal grandmother Jane D. Withers of White Sulpher Springs, WV and Sanibel Island, FL; his paternal grandmother Mary E. Johnson of London, WV; and numerous aunts, uncles, cousins and loyal friends. He was preceded in death by his maternal grandfather Dr. H. Scott Withers formally of White Sulpher Springs, WV and Sanibel Island, FL; his paternal grandfather Hobert L. Johnson formally of London, WV.
Scott was a 2012 graduate of George Washington High School. He was a member of the high school football team and area hockey league. Scott attended Concord University preceding his untimely departure. 
Scott was a loving son and a sincerely amazing person. He positively impacted every single person that was around him. His sense of humor lit up the room and he made each and every person laugh that was fortunate enough to know and love him. Scott's giant heart and caring nature inspired us all. He literally never had an enemy in this world. He was an avid outdoorsman and would rather be fishing than doing anything else. He loved history and read many different books on war. Scott was also an outstanding artist and left many drawings and doodles behind for us all to enjoy.
A visitation and celebration of life will be held from 5 to 8 p.m., Wednesday, May 20, at Snodgrass Funeral Home, 4122 MacCorkle Ave. S.W., South Charleston, WV 25309.
A memorial service and funeral will be held at 12 p.m., Thursday, May 21, at St. Matthews Episcopal Church, 36 Norwood Rd., Charleston, WV 25314. A reception will be held immediately after the service in the outside garden at St. Matthews.
In lieu of flowers the family suggests donations be made in memory of Scott to the Kanawha Charleston Human Association, 1248 Greenbrier Street Charleston, West Virginia 25311.
Snodgrass Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements. Condolences may be made to the family at www.snodgrassfuneral.com and selecting the obituary.

We want to offer our heart felt condolences to Scott's family and friends. Scott was a great friend to our son Elliott through good times and bad. He was loyal, funny, polite and sometimes shy. He was a guest at our home many, many times throughout the years and we enjoyed having him. No get together with Elliott's friends will be the same without Scott's smile. He will be sadly missed but forever remembered.

Richard "Scott" Johnson
Sunday, May 17, 2015, R. Scott Johnson left this earth too soon. Scott was a loving son, brother, twin, grandson, nephew, cousin, teammate, loyal friend and amazing person. Scott was born on May 22, 1994 with his twin sister Liza. He was the son of Richard D. and Jennifer W. Johnson of Charleston, West Virginia. In addition to his parents, Scott is survived by his twin sister Liza Johnson; his older brother Joseph H. Spano Jr. of Charleston; his maternal grandmother Jane D. Withers of White Sulpher Springs, WV and Sanibel Island, FL; his paternal grandmother Mary E. Johnson of London, WV; and numerous aunts, uncles, cousins and loyal friends. He was preceded in death by his maternal grandfather Dr. H. Scott Withers formally of White Sulpher Springs, WV and Sanibel Island, FL; his paternal grandfather Hobert L. Johnson formally of London, WV.
Scott was a 2012 graduate of George Washington High School. He was a member of the high school football team and area hockey league. Scott attended Concord University preceding his untimely departure. 
Scott was a loving son and a sincerely amazing person. He positively impacted every single person that was around him. His sense of humor lit up the room and he made each and every person laugh that was fortunate enough to know and love him. Scott's giant heart and caring nature inspired us all. He literally never had an enemy in this world. He was an avid outdoorsman and would rather be fishing than doing anything else. He loved history and read many different books on war. Scott was also an outstanding artist and left many drawings and doodles behind for us all to enjoy.
A visitation and celebration of life will be held from 5 to 8 p.m., Wednesday, May 20, at Snodgrass Funeral Home, 4122 MacCorkle Ave. S.W., South Charleston, WV 25309.
A memorial service and funeral will be held at 12 p.m., Thursday, May 21, at St. Matthews Episcopal Church, 36 Norwood Rd., Charleston, WV 25314. A reception will be held immediately after the service in the outside garden at St. Matthews.
In lieu of flowers the family suggests donations be made in memory of Scott to the Kanawha Charleston Human Association, 1248 Greenbrier Street Charleston, West Virginia 25311.
Snodgrass Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements. Condolences may be made to the family at www.snodgrassfuneral.com and selecting the obituary.

We want to offer our heart felt condolences to Scott's family and friends. Scott was a great friend to our son Elliott through good times and bad. He was loyal, funny, polite and sometimes shy. He was a guest at our home many, many times throughout the years and we enjoyed having him. No get together with Elliott's friends will be the same without Scott's smile. He will be sadly missed but forever remembered.
