Chelsea Victoria Clinton (born February 27, 1980) is the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She was a special correspondent for NBC News from 2011 to 2014 and now works with the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Since 2011, she has taken on a prominent role at the foundation and has a seat on its board.[1]
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, during her father's first term as governor. She attended public schools there until he was elected President and the family moved to the White House, where she began attending the private Sidwell Friends School. She received an undergraduate degree at Stanford University and later earned master's degrees from University College, Oxford and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, and a Doctor of Philosophy in international relations from the University of Oxford in 2014. Clinton married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in 2010. They have a daughter and a son.
Clinton has worked for NBC, McKinsey & Company, Avenue Capital Group, and New York University and serves on several boards, including those of the School of American Ballet, Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, Common Sense Media, Weill Cornell Medical College and IAC/InterActiveCorp. In 2007 and 2008, Clinton campaigned extensively on American college campuses for her mother's unsuccessful Democratic presidential nomination bid and introduced her at both the 2008 and 2016 Democratic National Conventions.

Early years
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 27, 1980. Chelsea's name was inspired by a visit to the Chelsea neighborhood of London during a Christmas 1978 vacation. Hillary said that upon hearing the 1969 Judy Collins recording of the Joni Mitchell song, "Chelsea Morning", Bill remarked, "If we ever have a daughter, her name should be Chelsea."[2][3][4]
When Chelsea was two years old, she accompanied her parents as they campaigned throughout Arkansas for her father's gubernatorial race.[2] She learned to read and write at a very young age. Chelsea claims that she started reading the newspaper by the age of three and also wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan when she was only five years old.[5] In the letter, which was photocopied and preserved by her father, she asked President Reagan not to visit a military cemetery in West Germany, where Nazi soldiers were buried.[5] Chelsea attended Forest Park Elementary School, Booker Arts and Science Magnet Elementary School and Horace Mann Junior High School, both Little Rock public schools.[6] She skipped the third grade.[7]
White House years




White House portrait of the Clintons (unknown date)


On January 20, 1993, the day of her father's first inauguration, Chelsea moved into the White House with her parents and was given the Secret Service codename "Energy".[8] The Clintons wanted their daughter to have a normal childhood, and they hoped to shield her from the media spotlight.[9]
Hillary Clinton followed the advice of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on raising children in the White House, and asked the press to limit coverage of Chelsea to her participation in public events such as state visits.[3] Margaret Truman, daughter of former president Harry S. Truman, supported the Clintons, and in March 1993 wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times about the damage that could be done if the press made Chelsea a subject of intense coverage.[10]
Journalists debated the issue of allowing Clinton to retain her privacy. Most media outlets concluded that she should be off-limits due to her age, although Rush Limbaugh[9] and Saturday Night Live both broadcast material mocking her appearance.[11] During this phase of her life, her father said, "We really work hard on making sure that Chelsea doesn't let other people define her sense of her own self-worth ... It's tough when you are an adolescent ... but I think she'll be ok."[12]
The Clintons' decision to remove Chelsea from public schooling and send her to Sidwell Friends School, a private school in Washington, D.C., drew criticism.[9] While several children of sitting presidents have attended Sidwell, the most recent prior child, Amy Carter, had gone to D.C. public schools. In a 1993 CBS This Morning town meeting, Bill defended the choice, stating that Chelsea did not like "getting a lot of publicity" and would have "more control over her destiny" at Sidwell. Bill explained that they made their decision in an effort to protect Chelsea's privacy; they did not "reject the public schools."[13] Sidwell's students and staff remained silent regarding Chelsea, declining to discuss her publicly.[9] A veteran of Model United Nations,[14] Clinton was a 1997 National Merit Scholarship semifinalist.[15] She graduated from Sidwell Friends in 1997; her father spoke at the graduation ceremony.[16]
Following Chelsea's high school graduation, media speculation regarding her choice of college resulted in heavy press coverage. She ultimately chose to attend Stanford University. During her father's eight years in office, there were 32 stories in The New York Times and 87 network news stories about Chelsea. Of all presidential children preceding her, she received the most television coverage.[17]

Although her father is a Southern Baptist, Clinton was raised in her mother's Methodist faith.[18] She attended Foundry United Methodist Church on 16th Street, NW in Washington and met with other teens on Sunday mornings to examine questions of faith, philosophy, and issues of concern to her age group. Her parents joined her at the youth group's parent-teen round tables. An adult group leader thought Clinton to be "a terrific kid" and observed that she was treated as an equal in the group. Away from church, her social activities included visits to a Planet Hollywood restaurant with friends and sleep-overs in and out of the White House. President Clinton sometimes joined her and her sleep-over friends for breakfast.[9]
At age four, Clinton had begun taking dance classes in Arkansas,[19] and she continued her dance training at the Washington School of Ballet for several years. In her book, It Takes a Village, Hillary wrote that Bill was disappointed when Chelsea quit softball and soccer to concentrate on ballet, but he was nonetheless supportive, regularly attending her performances.[9] She was cast in the role of the Favorite Aunt[20] in the 1993 Washington Ballet production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker.[9][21]
In early 1999, the Clintons learned of an article being planned by People that examined the First Family's relationships in the wake of scandals and the impending vote on President Clinton's impeachment. The Secret Service told the magazine that they had concerns that the story could compromise Chelsea's security. People decided to run the story anyway, and Bill and Hillary issued a statement expressing their regret and sadness. Carol Wallace, People managing editor, affirmed the magazine's sensitivity to the Clintons' concerns, but felt 19-year-old Chelsea was "an eyewitness to family drama and historical events" and thus "a valid journalistic subject". The article, entitled "Grace Under Fire", was published in February 1999 with a cover photo of Chelsea and Hillary.[22]
During the last year of her father's presidency, Chelsea assumed some White House hostess responsibilities when her mother was campaigning for the U.S. Senate, traveling with her father on several overseas trips and attending state dinners with him.[23]
Education and academic life
Stanford University
Clinton entered Stanford University in the fall of 1997 and majored in history.[24][25]
The week before she arrived on campus, her mother published an open letter in her syndicated column asking journalists to leave her daughter alone. Chelsea arrived at Stanford in a motorcade with her parents, Secret Service agents, and almost 250 journalists. For her security, bullet-proof glass was installed in her dorm windows and surveillance cameras were placed in hallways. Secret Service agents in plain clothes lived in her dorm.[26] With the exception of an occasional tabloid story written about her, Chelsea's four years at Stanford remained out of public view.[27]
Clinton obtained a B.A. degree in history, with highest honors, at Stanford in 2001.[24][27] The topic of her 167-page senior thesis was the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, advised by Jack Rakove.[27][28] At the time of Chelsea's graduation, President Clinton issued a statement saying, "Hillary and I are grateful for the friendships and great learning experiences Chelsea had at Stanford, and we are very proud of her on this special day."[29]
University of Oxford
In July 2001, President Clinton revealed that Chelsea would be pursuing a master's degree at University College of the University of Oxford later that year – the same college where he studied politics between 1968 and 1970 on a Rhodes Scholarship;[30] Chelsea did not apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. Lord Butler of Brockwell, the Master of University College, said: "Her record at Stanford shows that she is a very well-qualified and able student. The college is also pleased to extend its link with the Clinton family." Upon the recommendation of British and American advisers, the university implemented security measures,[31] and fellow students were asked not to discuss her with the press.[32]
Arriving at Oxford just after the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American students who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told Talk magazine:

Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find that I want to be around Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.[32]

Clinton was criticized for those remarks in the London press and by the newspaper Oxford Student, which angered the university by directly attacking her in an editorial. However, people who met Clinton at that time described her as charming, poised and unaffected, and she seemed to be adjusting successfully to life abroad. During her time at Oxford, Chelsea adopted a more sophisticated look, reportedly assisted by a family friend, Donatella Versace, whose couture shows she attended in early 2002. Geordie Greig, the editor of Tatler, ranked her number five on the magazine's 2002 "Top 10 Girls" list.[32]
In 2003, Clinton completed an MPhil degree in international relations at Oxford.[33] Her 132-page thesis was titled The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria: A Response to Global Threats, a Part of a Global Future, supervised by Jennifer Welsh and Ngaire Woods.[34] Following her graduation, she returned to the United States.[24]
In 2011, Clinton transferred back to University College, Oxford, from the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University to complete her DPhil degree in International Relations.[35] She stated this was to be under her preferred doctoral advisor, Ngaire Woods.[36] She finished her dissertation from New York City where she resides[37] and was awarded the degree in May 2014.[38] Her 712-page dissertation was titled The Global Fund: An Experiment in Global Governance.[39][40]
Columbia University and New York University
In the spring of 2010, Clinton completed a M.P.H. degree at the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University[41][42] and she began teaching graduate classes there in 2012.[43]
Starting in 2010, Clinton began serving as Assistant Vice-Provost for the Global Network University of New York University, working on international recruitment strategies.[37] She is the co-founder of the Of Many Institute for Multifaith Leadership at NYU and serves as its co-chair.[44] By 2010, she was also pursuing PhD coursework at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service, but later transferred back to Oxford in 2011 to complete her dissertation.[36][45]
In 2012, Clinton received an award from the Temple of Understanding for her "work in advancing a new model of integrating interfaith and cross-cultural education into campus life," together with Imam Khalid Latif and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna.[46]
Professional life
In 2003, Clinton joined the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in New York City,[24] and she went to work for Avenue Capital Group in late 2006. She served as co-chair for a fund-raising week for the Clinton Foundation, and subsequently became Vice Chair for the foundation.[38] She serves on the board of the School of American Ballet[24] and on IAC's board of directors.[47][48]
In November 2011, NBC announced that they had hired Clinton as a special correspondent. One of her roles was reporting feature stories about "Making a Difference" for NBC Nightly News and Rock Center with Brian Williams. It was a three-month contract and allowed her to concurrently continue working for the Clinton Foundation and pursue her education.[49][50] Clinton's first appearance was on the December 12, 2011, episode of Rock Center.[51] Although she received some negative critical reviews for her work, Clinton's contract with NBC was renewed in February 2012.[52][53] Rock Center ended in May 2013, and she left the network in August 2014.[54][55] Clinton reportedly earned an annual salary of $600,000 for her work at NBC.[56]
In September 2015, Clinton made her authorial debut with It's Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired and Get Going!, which was published by Philomel Books. The 400-page book is aimed at middle school students (ages 10 to 14) and introduces them to a range of social issues, encouraging them to take action to make the world a better place.[57] The Today Show gave Clinton a full segment in which to discuss the book with her former colleagues at NBC.[58] The book received mixed reviews from critics, who lauded Clinton for her effort but "lament[ed] its didactic tone".[57][59][60]
In May 2017 Clinton published her sophomore authorial work, a children's book entitled, She Persisted. Upon its release, the book became a bestseller.[61]
Chelsea Clinton's estimated net worth is USD $15,000,000.[62]
Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign
Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008




Clinton campaigning for her mother


In December 2007, Clinton began campaigning in Iowa in support of her mother's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.[63] She appeared across the country, largely on college campuses.[64][65][66] By early April 2008, she had spoken at 100 colleges on behalf of her mother's candidacy.[67]
While campaigning, Clinton answered audience questions but did not give interviews or respond to press questions,[68] including one from a nine-year-old Scholastic News reporter asking whether her father would be a good "first man".[69] She replied, "I'm sorry, I don't talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately. Even though I think you're cute."[70] Philippe Reines, her mother's press secretary, intervened when the press attempted to approach Chelsea directly.[69]
When MSNBC reporter David Shuster characterized Clinton's participation in her mother's campaign as "sort of being pimped out", the Clinton campaign objected. Shuster subsequently apologized on-air and was suspended for two weeks.[71][72]




Clinton speaking at the 2008 Democratic National Convention


The first time she was asked about her mother's handling of the Lewinsky scandal at a campaign stop Clinton responded, "I do not think that is any of your business."[67] As she became a more experienced campaigner, she refined her responses and deflected questions on the issue with comments such as, "If that's what you want to vote on, that's what you should vote on. But I think there are other people [who are] going to vote on things like healthcare and economics."[67][73]
At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Chelsea called Hillary "my hero and my mother" and introduced her with a long video tribute.[74]

Clinton Foundation

Since 2011, Clinton has taken a prominent role at the family's Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation,[75] and has had a seat on its board.[1] As part of her work, she gives paid speeches to raise money with her fees going directly to the foundation, whose goals relate to improving global health, creating opportunities for women, and promoting economic growth. A spokesperson for the foundation told The New York Times in 2014 that her speeches "are on behalf of the Clinton Foundation, and 100 percent of the fees are remitted directly to the foundation".[76][77]
Personal life
On July 31, 2010, Clinton and investment banker Marc Mezvinsky[78] were married in an interfaith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York; she is Methodist and he is Jewish.[79] Mezvinsky is the son of former members of Congress Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky, and was raised in the Conservative Jewish tradition. The senior Clintons and Mezvinskys were friends in the 1990s and their children met on a Renaissance Weekend retreat in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.[80] They first were reported to be a couple in 2005, and became engaged over Thanksgiving weekend in 2009.[78]
Following their wedding, the couple lived in New York City's Gramercy Park neighborhood for three years [79] and later purchased a condominium in the NoMad district of Manhattan for $10.5 million.[81] Their daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in September 2014,[82] and their son, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in June 2016.[83][84] Shortly after Aidan was born, the family moved to the nearby Flatiron District.[85]
As a young child, Clinton was raised in her father's Southern Baptist faith, and later attended her mother's United Methodist church.[86]
In popular culture
Clinton is portrayed in the film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, where Butt-Head flirts with her; she responds by tossing him out of a window.[87] In Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, a Disney Channel Original Movie set in the year 2049, Clinton is the President of the United States.[88][89] This joke was also made in an episode of Clarissa Explains It All.
Chelsea Clinton appeared in a Sesame Street skit with Elmo, advocating the importance of reading to young children.[90]

      Chelsea Clinton's $3 million wedding budget Chelsea Clinton's $3 million wedding budget   BY  Jacob E. Osterhaut  DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER Tuesday, July 27, 2010, 10:14 AM     facebook   Tweet   email          Chelsea Clinton will wed fiance Marc Mezinsky in a lavish ceremony estimated to cost at least $3 million dollars. (Sykes/AP)       BY  Jacob E. Osterhaut  DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER Tuesday, July 27, 2010, 10:14 AM    First Daughter Chelsea Clinton's wedding budget:
Tents $600,000
Clinton is using tents with glass walls. "It's not going to be your standard run-of-the-mill wedding cost," says Brian Rieke, director of operations for Stamford Tent & Event Services, whose company has sub-rented some equipment for Chelsea's shindig. That includes tenting, flooring, climate control, service tents, trucking and transportation.
Flowers $500,000
Rory Pierpont, head designer at Castle & Pierpont in SoHo, says that high-end choices, like flown-in orchids or Casablanca lilies, hit the half-a-mil mark. Even midrange blooms like hydrangeas, garden roses and perennials are a cool $250,000.
Photographer/videographer $40,000
Celebrity and wedding photographers Jerritt Clark and Denis Leon say the cost of one main photojournalist and assistant, plus two second photojournalists, brings the cost to $20,000. Prewedding events (such as the rehearsal dinner) cost an additional $5,000, and any after-event purchases, such as enlargements or duplicates, are an additional $5,000. Photo albums are $2,000 each. Because no recording devices will be allowed in the venue, the Clintons will likely have additional photos taken as memorabilia for guests. 
Security $200,000
That's to protect the high-level politicians and global celebrities by land and water - and to shut down air space, says Diann Valentine, a We TV and Wedding Central wedding expert.
Music (including sound system) $40,000
Rumor has it Jimmy Vali, who charges $28,000, is coordinating the music. For a wedding of this caliber, it's much higher.
Toilets $15,000
"The Clintons would opt, fittingly, for the Presidential Series Luxury Washrooms, which are equipped with vanities for the ladies, sinks with hot water, marble interior, air conditioning, skylights and flushing toilets, plus plenty of paper products and soap," says Keri Ross at Room To Go, Inc. "They would need three." Add a male and female attendant in each trailer ($55 per hour), and another trailer for the serving staff ($900).
Wedding planner $200,000
Sharon Stimpfle of TheKnot.com and WeddingChannel.com says that number factors in privacy, security and planning where the guests are staying.
Booze $30,000
If everyone drinks the equivalent of one bottle of wine, champagne and a cocktail, that's $60 per person.
Food (wedding & afterparty) $125,000
Passed hors d'oeuvres, seated first course, and entree go upwards of $200 per person. For afterparty food, such as a late-night breakfast, add $50 a head.
Wedding dress $25,000
At the moment, Vera Wang is the front-runner for Chelsea, with Oscar de la Renta for Hillary - two couture gowns made from "best of the best fabric that takes tons of hours to make," says Stimpfle. "We're expecting something more tailored and very sophisticated," she says.
Groom's tuxedo $2,000
Wedding bands $10,000
Hair and makeup $20,000
"A celebrity hair stylist charges between $3,500 and $5,000 a day, and a celebrity makeup artist about $3,000," says Claudia Hanlin at The Wedding Library. For Chelsea, Hillary, Mark's mother and the bridal party (typically three or four girls), there'll be two stylists. Add in the rehearsal dinner, the grandmothers' hair, and gratuity and transportation.
Cake $10,000
The wedding cake is sure to be tall ... and costly, at $8,000 to $10,000. Handmade sugar flowers and fondant increase the cost, says Stimpfle.
Favors $25,000
Lighting $100,000
High-end weddings use LED lighting, says Joe Chappell a lighting consultant. "You're not just getting one look. You can change it. It's much more expensive because it's purer and fancier, basically."
Stationery $50,000
That's for a classic invitation, plus menu cards, security details, calligraphy, letterpress, programs and postage.
Tables $100,000
Factor in tables, chairs, linens, china, flatware and glassware at $2,000 for a table of 10, according to Rieke.
Rehearsal dinner $250,000
Rumor has it the family dinner will be inside a stone barn on the Grasmere Estate (r.), catered by Terrapin Restaurant. "From the cost per meal to the flowers, a rehearsal dinner for 100 to 200 guests could easily cost $100,000 to $250,000," says Stimpfle.
Catering staff $75,000
Peter Callahan of NYC's Callahan Catering says the party will need 100 waiters, 25 wine stewards and five captains - each of whom gets $50 an hour for six hours, plus two hours travel. Add in 50 kitchen workers, eight of whom get $45 an hour; the rest get $35. That's for a six-hour event, plus four hours prep time.
Media consultant $100,000
Donnie Brown, a wedding planner featured in "Whose Wedding Is It Anyway?" on the Style Network, estimates it cost the Clintons $100,000 just for a flat-fee publicist to handle all the details, including negotating with the magazines for the official pictures.
Transportation $500,000
That's just for flying in guests, says Valentine.
Rabbi/priest/shaman $5,000
Valet parking $10,000
Bride's jewelry $250,000
According to a high-end jeweler, celebrity brides can spend up to $500,000 on jewelry for the bride, but most lavish weddings drop close to $250,000 for bands, earrings, tiara and necklace.
Aisle runner $10,000
"The aisle runner is probably hand-painted," Donnie Brown says. "They can run anywhere from $1,500 to $10,000."
Total $3.3 million

Peter Schweizer: Clinton Global Initiative Folded Because They Can No Longer ‘Sell Access to Political Power’
 Michael Loccisano/Getty Images
by John Hayward17 Jan 20170 17 Jan, 2017
17 Jan, 2017


Clinton Cash author and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily for what Marlow described as a “victory lap” over the demise of the Clinton Global Initiative, whose questionable activities featured so prominently in Schweizer’s book.
Marlow saluted the work done by Schweizer and his Government Accountability Institute as “some of the most essential reporting of the 2016 election,” and said they collected a “major scalp” this week with the end of the CGI.advertisement
“Thank you, Alex. Certainly Breitbart was right there. I cannot imagine how many stories—it’s got to be north of a hundred stories on Clinton corruption—played an essential role,” Schweizer said.
He said the shutdown of the Clinton Global Initiative was a “remarkable event,” because “the Clintons have essentially made it so obvious that there’s a connection between this so-called charitable activity, CGI, and their political fortunes.” Schweizer went on:
They didn’t even wait until the election was a distant memory to say, you know what, we’re going to wrap this up. They ended it immediately. I think it’s just further confirmation to what we always believed, which is that their charitable activities really were directly linked to their political power, and now that that political power is gone, really honestly for the first time in 25 years – think about that – 25 years the Clintons have been on the national political stage. They’re gone, and they’re essentially saying, ‘Look, there’s no need or purpose behind doing this charitable work, so we’re just going to shut it down.’ It’s a pretty remarkable step on their part.
Schweizer chuckled at Marlow’s suggestion that the Clintons should have kept their organization running for a little while, with a few headline-ready boasts about how it was “stronger than ever,” just to maintain appearances. He said:
No, they just rolled it up, and you’re exactly right, they didn’t pretend. In a matter of weeks from the election results—it’s pretty stunning. I think we’ve also now got the Clinton Foundation itself, which is involved with CGI obviously, but they’re essentially separate entities. Their donations are way off. They’ve got a lot of foreign donations, the government of Australia for example, and Germany, who are essentially saying, ‘We’re not going to donate any more.’ Donations are down by some accounts by 70%. So it may be that the Clinton Foundation goes the way of CGI.
“Or it could be, which I think is probably more likely—I just can’t imagine them completely folding up their tent—I think it will be sort of a shadow of its former self, maybe one-tenth the size of what it once was,” he ventured. “Because let’s face it, what we talked about has been confirmed by the Podesta emails, it’s been confirmed by these events: if they can’t sell access to political power, they just don’t have a product, in the form of their form of philanthropy, that people want to donate to.” 

“That presents an essential problem. That means they have to seek some office somewhere so they can still sell access. Does Chelsea now have to bring the next generation forth, so they can continue with this political apparatus? There’s a lot of talk of that, that Chelsea’s going to run for Congress, potentially in two years,” Schweizer noted.
He expressed some appreciation for the difficult road Chelsea Clinton has walked, pointing out that the leaked emails from Clinton campaign chief John Podesta portrayed her as one of the few highly-placed people in the Clinton Foundation who realized something fishy was going on, and called for extensive audits.
“Bill and Hillary were fine with what was going on, the aides around them were fine. It was really Chelsea who was pushing this reform agenda. So I give her credit for that,” Schweizer said, before going on to agree with Marlow that she lacks the “presence” for a successful political career, even from a celebrity-obsessed Manhattan precinct controlled by the Democrat machine.
“You’ve still got to show you’ve got the chops to actually get things done for your district in Congress… that you have a certain innate strength and an ability to perform. I don’t think the celebrity is going to be enough,” he judged. “She’s going to have to prove that.”
He said Chelsea Clinton’s only guaranteed campaign asset would be “a lot of money, because the Clinton financial network is there.”

“Hillary Clinton did not win in November, but remember, Alex, they raised a lot of money for that race,” Schweizer pointed out. “Their ability to raise a lot of money for Chelsea I don’t think should be underestimated.”
He said that beyond vague hopes of launching Chelsea’s political career, it remained a “great mystery” where the Clintons would go from here. Schweizer pointed out:
Really since 1992, they have been part of the national conversation. Bill ran for President, he said you’re getting two for one, so he made it clear immediately that Hillary was going to be a political player as well. They leave the White House just as Hillary enters the U.S. Senate. She then runs for president in 2008 and loses. She then becomes Secretary of State. And other than this window between January of 2013, up until she announced her campaign in 2015, they have been in political office with political power. I think it’s very hard to give that up, once you’ve had it.
Schweizer said he doubted Hillary Clinton would try another presidential run in 2020, and that even “people in the echo chamber around them” would point out her advancing age and weakness on the campaign trail in 2016.
He also suggested there was resentment of Clinton within the Democratic Party itself. 
“We know they had the election wired against Bernie Sanders. We know they’ve got a lot of allies. But there is a lot of bubbling resentment among the Democratic grassroots that the Clintons need to go. They had their turn, they had their chance. A lot of Democrats are convinced that if they just had a different candidate, they could have beat Donald Trump. I don’t think that’s true, but I think there’s a lot of that thought out there,” he said. Schweizer predicted:

So they may be thinking about some run for higher office again, but I just don’t think the Democratic Party is the same party of the 1990s. I think we’re going to see them—probably kicking and screaming—fade into history. I just don’t see this as a dynasty like the Bush dynasty, for example, where you’ve got a sort of up-and-coming generation that can potentially run for national office. The Clintons just simply don’t have that, and I think we’re going to see them fade into history, essentially.
As for his own future plans, Schweizer said he was “cautiously optimistic” about government ethics under the new administration, although he noted he pushed hard for President-elect Trump to fully divest his assets, a path he chose not to pursue.
“In that sense I’m disappointed, but really, honestly Alex, when you look what he has done, he has gone far beyond what I believe the legal requirements were for him to do. So I give him a lot of credit for that,” he said.
Schweizer asked of Trump’s children and associates:
I think really now it’s going to come down to that whole issue of performance. How do they handle these issues?’ If the kids are offered a sweetheart deal, if they have a chance to do something and think that it can go undetected, are they going to be tempted, or are they going to take that deal? That’s really what it comes down to. You can set up all kinds of structures, you can say all kinds of things, but as we’ve seen in the past with other presidents, people when they want to make a buck at the public’s expense, they’re going to find a quick way around it.
“So I count myself right now cautiously optimistic. I love the Trump message of ‘drain the swamp.’ I think there’s some very serious things that he is looking at, that could get bipartisan support, to work to drain the swamp. If for no other reason, think about this: Donald Trump is the first candidate, I would have to say going back more than 30 years if not longer, who is not really beholden to the money class in Washington D.C. The lobbyists, the PACs—they didn’t give him money, so he doesn’t feel like he owes them anything,” Schweizer said.

Chelsea Victoria Clinton (born February 27, 1980) is the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She was a special correspondent for NBC News from 2011 to 2014 and now works with the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Since 2011, she has taken on a prominent role at the foundation and has a seat on its board.[1]
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, during her father's first term as governor. She attended public schools there until he was elected President and the family moved to the White House, where she began attending the private Sidwell Friends School. She received an undergraduate degree at Stanford University and later earned master's degrees from University College, Oxford and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, and a Doctor of Philosophy in international relations from the University of Oxford in 2014. Clinton married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in 2010. They have a daughter and a son.
Clinton has worked for NBC, McKinsey & Company, Avenue Capital Group, and New York University and serves on several boards, including those of the School of American Ballet, Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, Common Sense Media, Weill Cornell Medical College and IAC/InterActiveCorp. In 2007 and 2008, Clinton campaigned extensively on American college campuses for her mother's unsuccessful Democratic presidential nomination bid and introduced her at both the 2008 and 2016 Democratic National Conventions.

Early years
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 27, 1980. Chelsea's name was inspired by a visit to the Chelsea neighborhood of London during a Christmas 1978 vacation. Hillary said that upon hearing the 1969 Judy Collins recording of the Joni Mitchell song, "Chelsea Morning", Bill remarked, "If we ever have a daughter, her name should be Chelsea."[2][3][4]
When Chelsea was two years old, she accompanied her parents as they campaigned throughout Arkansas for her father's gubernatorial race.[2] She learned to read and write at a very young age. Chelsea claims that she started reading the newspaper by the age of three and also wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan when she was only five years old.[5] In the letter, which was photocopied and preserved by her father, she asked President Reagan not to visit a military cemetery in West Germany, where Nazi soldiers were buried.[5] Chelsea attended Forest Park Elementary School, Booker Arts and Science Magnet Elementary School and Horace Mann Junior High School, both Little Rock public schools.[6] She skipped the third grade.[7]
White House years




White House portrait of the Clintons (unknown date)


On January 20, 1993, the day of her father's first inauguration, Chelsea moved into the White House with her parents and was given the Secret Service codename "Energy".[8] The Clintons wanted their daughter to have a normal childhood, and they hoped to shield her from the media spotlight.[9]
Hillary Clinton followed the advice of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on raising children in the White House, and asked the press to limit coverage of Chelsea to her participation in public events such as state visits.[3] Margaret Truman, daughter of former president Harry S. Truman, supported the Clintons, and in March 1993 wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times about the damage that could be done if the press made Chelsea a subject of intense coverage.[10]
Journalists debated the issue of allowing Clinton to retain her privacy. Most media outlets concluded that she should be off-limits due to her age, although Rush Limbaugh[9] and Saturday Night Live both broadcast material mocking her appearance.[11] During this phase of her life, her father said, "We really work hard on making sure that Chelsea doesn't let other people define her sense of her own self-worth ... It's tough when you are an adolescent ... but I think she'll be ok."[12]
The Clintons' decision to remove Chelsea from public schooling and send her to Sidwell Friends School, a private school in Washington, D.C., drew criticism.[9] While several children of sitting presidents have attended Sidwell, the most recent prior child, Amy Carter, had gone to D.C. public schools. In a 1993 CBS This Morning town meeting, Bill defended the choice, stating that Chelsea did not like "getting a lot of publicity" and would have "more control over her destiny" at Sidwell. Bill explained that they made their decision in an effort to protect Chelsea's privacy; they did not "reject the public schools."[13] Sidwell's students and staff remained silent regarding Chelsea, declining to discuss her publicly.[9] A veteran of Model United Nations,[14] Clinton was a 1997 National Merit Scholarship semifinalist.[15] She graduated from Sidwell Friends in 1997; her father spoke at the graduation ceremony.[16]
Following Chelsea's high school graduation, media speculation regarding her choice of college resulted in heavy press coverage. She ultimately chose to attend Stanford University. During her father's eight years in office, there were 32 stories in The New York Times and 87 network news stories about Chelsea. Of all presidential children preceding her, she received the most television coverage.[17]




Clinton ringing a replica of the Liberty Bell at her father's first inauguration


Although her father is a Southern Baptist, Clinton was raised in her mother's Methodist faith.[18] She attended Foundry United Methodist Church on 16th Street, NW in Washington and met with other teens on Sunday mornings to examine questions of faith, philosophy, and issues of concern to her age group. Her parents joined her at the youth group's parent-teen round tables. An adult group leader thought Clinton to be "a terrific kid" and observed that she was treated as an equal in the group. Away from church, her social activities included visits to a Planet Hollywood restaurant with friends and sleep-overs in and out of the White House. President Clinton sometimes joined her and her sleep-over friends for breakfast.[9]
At age four, Clinton had begun taking dance classes in Arkansas,[19] and she continued her dance training at the Washington School of Ballet for several years. In her book, It Takes a Village, Hillary wrote that Bill was disappointed when Chelsea quit softball and soccer to concentrate on ballet, but he was nonetheless supportive, regularly attending her performances.[9] She was cast in the role of the Favorite Aunt[20] in the 1993 Washington Ballet production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker.[9][21]
In early 1999, the Clintons learned of an article being planned by People that examined the First Family's relationships in the wake of scandals and the impending vote on President Clinton's impeachment. The Secret Service told the magazine that they had concerns that the story could compromise Chelsea's security. People decided to run the story anyway, and Bill and Hillary issued a statement expressing their regret and sadness. Carol Wallace, People managing editor, affirmed the magazine's sensitivity to the Clintons' concerns, but felt 19-year-old Chelsea was "an eyewitness to family drama and historical events" and thus "a valid journalistic subject". The article, entitled "Grace Under Fire", was published in February 1999 with a cover photo of Chelsea and Hillary.[22]
During the last year of her father's presidency, Chelsea assumed some White House hostess responsibilities when her mother was campaigning for the U.S. Senate, traveling with her father on several overseas trips and attending state dinners with him.[23]
Education and academic life
Stanford University
Clinton entered Stanford University in the fall of 1997 and majored in history.[24][25]
The week before she arrived on campus, her mother published an open letter in her syndicated column asking journalists to leave her daughter alone. Chelsea arrived at Stanford in a motorcade with her parents, Secret Service agents, and almost 250 journalists. For her security, bullet-proof glass was installed in her dorm windows and surveillance cameras were placed in hallways. Secret Service agents in plain clothes lived in her dorm.[26] With the exception of an occasional tabloid story written about her, Chelsea's four years at Stanford remained out of public view.[27]
Clinton obtained a B.A. degree in history, with highest honors, at Stanford in 2001.[24][27] The topic of her 167-page senior thesis was the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, advised by Jack Rakove.[27][28] At the time of Chelsea's graduation, President Clinton issued a statement saying, "Hillary and I are grateful for the friendships and great learning experiences Chelsea had at Stanford, and we are very proud of her on this special day."[29]
University of Oxford
In July 2001, President Clinton revealed that Chelsea would be pursuing a master's degree at University College of the University of Oxford later that year – the same college where he studied politics between 1968 and 1970 on a Rhodes Scholarship;[30] Chelsea did not apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. Lord Butler of Brockwell, the Master of University College, said: "Her record at Stanford shows that she is a very well-qualified and able student. The college is also pleased to extend its link with the Clinton family." Upon the recommendation of British and American advisers, the university implemented security measures,[31] and fellow students were asked not to discuss her with the press.[32]
Arriving at Oxford just after the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American students who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told Talk magazine:

Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find that I want to be around Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.[32]

Clinton was criticized for those remarks in the London press and by the newspaper Oxford Student, which angered the university by directly attacking her in an editorial. However, people who met Clinton at that time described her as charming, poised and unaffected, and she seemed to be adjusting successfully to life abroad. During her time at Oxford, Chelsea adopted a more sophisticated look, reportedly assisted by a family friend, Donatella Versace, whose couture shows she attended in early 2002. Geordie Greig, the editor of Tatler, ranked her number five on the magazine's 2002 "Top 10 Girls" list.[32]
In 2003, Clinton completed an MPhil degree in international relations at Oxford.[33] Her 132-page thesis was titled The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria: A Response to Global Threats, a Part of a Global Future, supervised by Jennifer Welsh and Ngaire Woods.[34] Following her graduation, she returned to the United States.[24]
In 2011, Clinton transferred back to University College, Oxford, from the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University to complete her DPhil degree in International Relations.[35] She stated this was to be under her preferred doctoral advisor, Ngaire Woods.[36] She finished her dissertation from New York City where she resides[37] and was awarded the degree in May 2014.[38] Her 712-page dissertation was titled The Global Fund: An Experiment in Global Governance.[39][40]
Columbia University and New York University
In the spring of 2010, Clinton completed a M.P.H. degree at the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University[41][42] and she began teaching graduate classes there in 2012.[43]
Starting in 2010, Clinton began serving as Assistant Vice-Provost for the Global Network University of New York University, working on international recruitment strategies.[37] She is the co-founder of the Of Many Institute for Multifaith Leadership at NYU and serves as its co-chair.[44] By 2010, she was also pursuing PhD coursework at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service, but later transferred back to Oxford in 2011 to complete her dissertation.[36][45]
In 2012, Clinton received an award from the Temple of Understanding for her "work in advancing a new model of integrating interfaith and cross-cultural education into campus life," together with Imam Khalid Latif and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna.[46]
Professional life
In 2003, Clinton joined the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in New York City,[24] and she went to work for Avenue Capital Group in late 2006. She served as co-chair for a fund-raising week for the Clinton Foundation, and subsequently became Vice Chair for the foundation.[38] She serves on the board of the School of American Ballet[24] and on IAC's board of directors.[47][48]
In November 2011, NBC announced that they had hired Clinton as a special correspondent. One of her roles was reporting feature stories about "Making a Difference" for NBC Nightly News and Rock Center with Brian Williams. It was a three-month contract and allowed her to concurrently continue working for the Clinton Foundation and pursue her education.[49][50] Clinton's first appearance was on the December 12, 2011, episode of Rock Center.[51] Although she received some negative critical reviews for her work, Clinton's contract with NBC was renewed in February 2012.[52][53] Rock Center ended in May 2013, and she left the network in August 2014.[54][55] Clinton reportedly earned an annual salary of $600,000 for her work at NBC.[56]
In September 2015, Clinton made her authorial debut with It's Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired and Get Going!, which was published by Philomel Books. The 400-page book is aimed at middle school students (ages 10 to 14) and introduces them to a range of social issues, encouraging them to take action to make the world a better place.[57] The Today Show gave Clinton a full segment in which to discuss the book with her former colleagues at NBC.[58] The book received mixed reviews from critics, who lauded Clinton for her effort but "lament[ed] its didactic tone".[57][59][60]
In May 2017 Clinton published her sophomore authorial work, a children's book entitled, She Persisted. Upon its release, the book became a bestseller.[61]
Chelsea Clinton's estimated net worth is USD $15,000,000.[62]
Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign
Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008




Clinton campaigning for her mother


In December 2007, Clinton began campaigning in Iowa in support of her mother's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.[63] She appeared across the country, largely on college campuses.[64][65][66] By early April 2008, she had spoken at 100 colleges on behalf of her mother's candidacy.[67]
While campaigning, Clinton answered audience questions but did not give interviews or respond to press questions,[68] including one from a nine-year-old Scholastic News reporter asking whether her father would be a good "first man".[69] She replied, "I'm sorry, I don't talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately. Even though I think you're cute."[70] Philippe Reines, her mother's press secretary, intervened when the press attempted to approach Chelsea directly.[69]
When MSNBC reporter David Shuster characterized Clinton's participation in her mother's campaign as "sort of being pimped out", the Clinton campaign objected. Shuster subsequently apologized on-air and was suspended for two weeks.[71][72]




Clinton speaking at the 2008 Democratic National Convention


The first time she was asked about her mother's handling of the Lewinsky scandal at a campaign stop Clinton responded, "I do not think that is any of your business."[67] As she became a more experienced campaigner, she refined her responses and deflected questions on the issue with comments such as, "If that's what you want to vote on, that's what you should vote on. But I think there are other people [who are] going to vote on things like healthcare and economics."[67][73]
At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Chelsea called Hillary "my hero and my mother" and introduced her with a long video tribute.[74]

Clinton Foundation

Since 2011, Clinton has taken a prominent role at the family's Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation,[75] and has had a seat on its board.[1] As part of her work, she gives paid speeches to raise money with her fees going directly to the foundation, whose goals relate to improving global health, creating opportunities for women, and promoting economic growth. A spokesperson for the foundation told The New York Times in 2014 that her speeches "are on behalf of the Clinton Foundation, and 100 percent of the fees are remitted directly to the foundation".[76][77]
Personal life
On July 31, 2010, Clinton and investment banker Marc Mezvinsky[78] were married in an interfaith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York; she is Methodist and he is Jewish.[79] Mezvinsky is the son of former members of Congress Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky, and was raised in the Conservative Jewish tradition. The senior Clintons and Mezvinskys were friends in the 1990s and their children met on a Renaissance Weekend retreat in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.[80] They first were reported to be a couple in 2005, and became engaged over Thanksgiving weekend in 2009.[78]
Following their wedding, the couple lived in New York City's Gramercy Park neighborhood for three years [79] and later purchased a condominium in the NoMad district of Manhattan for $10.5 million.[81] Their daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in September 2014,[82] and their son, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in June 2016.[83][84] Shortly after Aidan was born, the family moved to the nearby Flatiron District.[85]
As a young child, Clinton was raised in her father's Southern Baptist faith, and later attended her mother's United Methodist church.[86]
In popular culture
Clinton is portrayed in the film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, where Butt-Head flirts with her; she responds by tossing him out of a window.[87] In Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, a Disney Channel Original Movie set in the year 2049, Clinton is the President of the United States.[88][89] This joke was also made in an episode of Clarissa Explains It All.
Chelsea Clinton appeared in a Sesame Street skit with Elmo, advocating the importance of reading to young children.[90]

Chelsea Victoria Clinton (born February 27, 1980) is the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She was a special correspondent for NBC News from 2011 to 2014 and now works with the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Since 2011, she has taken on a prominent role at the foundation and has a seat on its board.[1]
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, during her father's first term as governor. She attended public schools there until he was elected President and the family moved to the White House, where she began attending the private Sidwell Friends School. She received an undergraduate degree at Stanford University and later earned master's degrees from University College, Oxford and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, and a Doctor of Philosophy in international relations from the University of Oxford in 2014. Clinton married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in 2010. They have a daughter and a son.
Clinton has worked for NBC, McKinsey & Company, Avenue Capital Group, and New York University and serves on several boards, including those of the School of American Ballet, Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, Common Sense Media, Weill Cornell Medical College and IAC/InterActiveCorp. In 2007 and 2008, Clinton campaigned extensively on American college campuses for her mother's unsuccessful Democratic presidential nomination bid and introduced her at both the 2008 and 2016 Democratic National Conventions.

Early years
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 27, 1980. Chelsea's name was inspired by a visit to the Chelsea neighborhood of London during a Christmas 1978 vacation. Hillary said that upon hearing the 1969 Judy Collins recording of the Joni Mitchell song, "Chelsea Morning", Bill remarked, "If we ever have a daughter, her name should be Chelsea."[2][3][4]
When Chelsea was two years old, she accompanied her parents as they campaigned throughout Arkansas for her father's gubernatorial race.[2] She learned to read and write at a very young age. Chelsea claims that she started reading the newspaper by the age of three and also wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan when she was only five years old.[5] In the letter, which was photocopied and preserved by her father, she asked President Reagan not to visit a military cemetery in West Germany, where Nazi soldiers were buried.[5] Chelsea attended Forest Park Elementary School, Booker Arts and Science Magnet Elementary School and Horace Mann Junior High School, both Little Rock public schools.[6] She skipped the third grade.[7]
White House years




White House portrait of the Clintons (unknown date)


On January 20, 1993, the day of her father's first inauguration, Chelsea moved into the White House with her parents and was given the Secret Service codename "Energy".[8] The Clintons wanted their daughter to have a normal childhood, and they hoped to shield her from the media spotlight.[9]
Hillary Clinton followed the advice of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on raising children in the White House, and asked the press to limit coverage of Chelsea to her participation in public events such as state visits.[3] Margaret Truman, daughter of former president Harry S. Truman, supported the Clintons, and in March 1993 wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times about the damage that could be done if the press made Chelsea a subject of intense coverage.[10]
Journalists debated the issue of allowing Clinton to retain her privacy. Most media outlets concluded that she should be off-limits due to her age, although Rush Limbaugh[9] and Saturday Night Live both broadcast material mocking her appearance.[11] During this phase of her life, her father said, "We really work hard on making sure that Chelsea doesn't let other people define her sense of her own self-worth ... It's tough when you are an adolescent ... but I think she'll be ok."[12]
The Clintons' decision to remove Chelsea from public schooling and send her to Sidwell Friends School, a private school in Washington, D.C., drew criticism.[9] While several children of sitting presidents have attended Sidwell, the most recent prior child, Amy Carter, had gone to D.C. public schools. In a 1993 CBS This Morning town meeting, Bill defended the choice, stating that Chelsea did not like "getting a lot of publicity" and would have "more control over her destiny" at Sidwell. Bill explained that they made their decision in an effort to protect Chelsea's privacy; they did not "reject the public schools."[13] Sidwell's students and staff remained silent regarding Chelsea, declining to discuss her publicly.[9] A veteran of Model United Nations,[14] Clinton was a 1997 National Merit Scholarship semifinalist.[15] She graduated from Sidwell Friends in 1997; her father spoke at the graduation ceremony.[16]
Following Chelsea's high school graduation, media speculation regarding her choice of college resulted in heavy press coverage. She ultimately chose to attend Stanford University. During her father's eight years in office, there were 32 stories in The New York Times and 87 network news stories about Chelsea. Of all presidential children preceding her, she received the most television coverage.[17]




Clinton ringing a replica of the Liberty Bell at her father's first inauguration


Although her father is a Southern Baptist, Clinton was raised in her mother's Methodist faith.[18] She attended Foundry United Methodist Church on 16th Street, NW in Washington and met with other teens on Sunday mornings to examine questions of faith, philosophy, and issues of concern to her age group. Her parents joined her at the youth group's parent-teen round tables. An adult group leader thought Clinton to be "a terrific kid" and observed that she was treated as an equal in the group. Away from church, her social activities included visits to a Planet Hollywood restaurant with friends and sleep-overs in and out of the White House. President Clinton sometimes joined her and her sleep-over friends for breakfast.[9]
At age four, Clinton had begun taking dance classes in Arkansas,[19] and she continued her dance training at the Washington School of Ballet for several years. In her book, It Takes a Village, Hillary wrote that Bill was disappointed when Chelsea quit softball and soccer to concentrate on ballet, but he was nonetheless supportive, regularly attending her performances.[9] She was cast in the role of the Favorite Aunt[20] in the 1993 Washington Ballet production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker.[9][21]
In early 1999, the Clintons learned of an article being planned by People that examined the First Family's relationships in the wake of scandals and the impending vote on President Clinton's impeachment. The Secret Service told the magazine that they had concerns that the story could compromise Chelsea's security. People decided to run the story anyway, and Bill and Hillary issued a statement expressing their regret and sadness. Carol Wallace, People managing editor, affirmed the magazine's sensitivity to the Clintons' concerns, but felt 19-year-old Chelsea was "an eyewitness to family drama and historical events" and thus "a valid journalistic subject". The article, entitled "Grace Under Fire", was published in February 1999 with a cover photo of Chelsea and Hillary.[22]
During the last year of her father's presidency, Chelsea assumed some White House hostess responsibilities when her mother was campaigning for the U.S. Senate, traveling with her father on several overseas trips and attending state dinners with him.[23]
Education and academic life
Stanford University
Clinton entered Stanford University in the fall of 1997 and majored in history.[24][25]
The week before she arrived on campus, her mother published an open letter in her syndicated column asking journalists to leave her daughter alone. Chelsea arrived at Stanford in a motorcade with her parents, Secret Service agents, and almost 250 journalists. For her security, bullet-proof glass was installed in her dorm windows and surveillance cameras were placed in hallways. Secret Service agents in plain clothes lived in her dorm.[26] With the exception of an occasional tabloid story written about her, Chelsea's four years at Stanford remained out of public view.[27]
Clinton obtained a B.A. degree in history, with highest honors, at Stanford in 2001.[24][27] The topic of her 167-page senior thesis was the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, advised by Jack Rakove.[27][28] At the time of Chelsea's graduation, President Clinton issued a statement saying, "Hillary and I are grateful for the friendships and great learning experiences Chelsea had at Stanford, and we are very proud of her on this special day."[29]
University of Oxford
In July 2001, President Clinton revealed that Chelsea would be pursuing a master's degree at University College of the University of Oxford later that year – the same college where he studied politics between 1968 and 1970 on a Rhodes Scholarship;[30] Chelsea did not apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. Lord Butler of Brockwell, the Master of University College, said: "Her record at Stanford shows that she is a very well-qualified and able student. The college is also pleased to extend its link with the Clinton family." Upon the recommendation of British and American advisers, the university implemented security measures,[31] and fellow students were asked not to discuss her with the press.[32]
Arriving at Oxford just after the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American students who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told Talk magazine:

Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find that I want to be around Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.[32]

Clinton was criticized for those remarks in the London press and by the newspaper Oxford Student, which angered the university by directly attacking her in an editorial. However, people who met Clinton at that time described her as charming, poised and unaffected, and she seemed to be adjusting successfully to life abroad. During her time at Oxford, Chelsea adopted a more sophisticated look, reportedly assisted by a family friend, Donatella Versace, whose couture shows she attended in early 2002. Geordie Greig, the editor of Tatler, ranked her number five on the magazine's 2002 "Top 10 Girls" list.[32]
In 2003, Clinton completed an MPhil degree in international relations at Oxford.[33] Her 132-page thesis was titled The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria: A Response to Global Threats, a Part of a Global Future, supervised by Jennifer Welsh and Ngaire Woods.[34] Following her graduation, she returned to the United States.[24]
In 2011, Clinton transferred back to University College, Oxford, from the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University to complete her DPhil degree in International Relations.[35] She stated this was to be under her preferred doctoral advisor, Ngaire Woods.[36] She finished her dissertation from New York City where she resides[37] and was awarded the degree in May 2014.[38] Her 712-page dissertation was titled The Global Fund: An Experiment in Global Governance.[39][40]
Columbia University and New York University
In the spring of 2010, Clinton completed a M.P.H. degree at the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University[41][42] and she began teaching graduate classes there in 2012.[43]
Starting in 2010, Clinton began serving as Assistant Vice-Provost for the Global Network University of New York University, working on international recruitment strategies.[37] She is the co-founder of the Of Many Institute for Multifaith Leadership at NYU and serves as its co-chair.[44] By 2010, she was also pursuing PhD coursework at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service, but later transferred back to Oxford in 2011 to complete her dissertation.[36][45]
In 2012, Clinton received an award from the Temple of Understanding for her "work in advancing a new model of integrating interfaith and cross-cultural education into campus life," together with Imam Khalid Latif and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna.[46]
Professional life
In 2003, Clinton joined the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in New York City,[24] and she went to work for Avenue Capital Group in late 2006. She served as co-chair for a fund-raising week for the Clinton Foundation, and subsequently became Vice Chair for the foundation.[38] She serves on the board of the School of American Ballet[24] and on IAC's board of directors.[47][48]
In November 2011, NBC announced that they had hired Clinton as a special correspondent. One of her roles was reporting feature stories about "Making a Difference" for NBC Nightly News and Rock Center with Brian Williams. It was a three-month contract and allowed her to concurrently continue working for the Clinton Foundation and pursue her education.[49][50] Clinton's first appearance was on the December 12, 2011, episode of Rock Center.[51] Although she received some negative critical reviews for her work, Clinton's contract with NBC was renewed in February 2012.[52][53] Rock Center ended in May 2013, and she left the network in August 2014.[54][55] Clinton reportedly earned an annual salary of $600,000 for her work at NBC.[56]
In September 2015, Clinton made her authorial debut with It's Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired and Get Going!, which was published by Philomel Books. The 400-page book is aimed at middle school students (ages 10 to 14) and introduces them to a range of social issues, encouraging them to take action to make the world a better place.[57] The Today Show gave Clinton a full segment in which to discuss the book with her former colleagues at NBC.[58] The book received mixed reviews from critics, who lauded Clinton for her effort but "lament[ed] its didactic tone".[57][59][60]
In May 2017 Clinton published her sophomore authorial work, a children's book entitled, She Persisted. Upon its release, the book became a bestseller.[61]
Chelsea Clinton's estimated net worth is USD $15,000,000.[62]
Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign
Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008




Clinton campaigning for her mother


In December 2007, Clinton began campaigning in Iowa in support of her mother's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.[63] She appeared across the country, largely on college campuses.[64][65][66] By early April 2008, she had spoken at 100 colleges on behalf of her mother's candidacy.[67]
While campaigning, Clinton answered audience questions but did not give interviews or respond to press questions,[68] including one from a nine-year-old Scholastic News reporter asking whether her father would be a good "first man".[69] She replied, "I'm sorry, I don't talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately. Even though I think you're cute."[70] Philippe Reines, her mother's press secretary, intervened when the press attempted to approach Chelsea directly.[69]
When MSNBC reporter David Shuster characterized Clinton's participation in her mother's campaign as "sort of being pimped out", the Clinton campaign objected. Shuster subsequently apologized on-air and was suspended for two weeks.[71][72]




Clinton speaking at the 2008 Democratic National Convention


The first time she was asked about her mother's handling of the Lewinsky scandal at a campaign stop Clinton responded, "I do not think that is any of your business."[67] As she became a more experienced campaigner, she refined her responses and deflected questions on the issue with comments such as, "If that's what you want to vote on, that's what you should vote on. But I think there are other people [who are] going to vote on things like healthcare and economics."[67][73]
At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Chelsea called Hillary "my hero and my mother" and introduced her with a long video tribute.[74]

Clinton Foundation

Since 2011, Clinton has taken a prominent role at the family's Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation,[75] and has had a seat on its board.[1] As part of her work, she gives paid speeches to raise money with her fees going directly to the foundation, whose goals relate to improving global health, creating opportunities for women, and promoting economic growth. A spokesperson for the foundation told The New York Times in 2014 that her speeches "are on behalf of the Clinton Foundation, and 100 percent of the fees are remitted directly to the foundation".[76][77]
Personal life
On July 31, 2010, Clinton and investment banker Marc Mezvinsky[78] were married in an interfaith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York; she is Methodist and he is Jewish.[79] Mezvinsky is the son of former members of Congress Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky, and was raised in the Conservative Jewish tradition. The senior Clintons and Mezvinskys were friends in the 1990s and their children met on a Renaissance Weekend retreat in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.[80] They first were reported to be a couple in 2005, and became engaged over Thanksgiving weekend in 2009.[78]
Following their wedding, the couple lived in New York City's Gramercy Park neighborhood for three years [79] and later purchased a condominium in the NoMad district of Manhattan for $10.5 million.[81] Their daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in September 2014,[82] and their son, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in June 2016.[83][84] Shortly after Aidan was born, the family moved to the nearby Flatiron District.[85]
As a young child, Clinton was raised in her father's Southern Baptist faith, and later attended her mother's United Methodist church.[86]
In popular culture
Clinton is portrayed in the film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, where Butt-Head flirts with her; she responds by tossing him out of a window.[87] In Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, a Disney Channel Original Movie set in the year 2049, Clinton is the President of the United States.[88][89] This joke was also made in an episode of Clarissa Explains It All.
Chelsea Clinton appeared in a Sesame Street skit with Elmo, advocating the importance of reading to young children.[90]

Chelsea Victoria Clinton (born February 27, 1980) is the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She was a special correspondent for NBC News from 2011 to 2014 and now works with the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Since 2011, she has taken on a prominent role at the foundation and has a seat on its board.[1]
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, during her father's first term as governor. She attended public schools there until he was elected President and the family moved to the White House, where she began attending the private Sidwell Friends School. She received an undergraduate degree at Stanford University and later earned master's degrees from University College, Oxford and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, and a Doctor of Philosophy in international relations from the University of Oxford in 2014. Clinton married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in 2010. They have a daughter and a son.
Clinton has worked for NBC, McKinsey & Company, Avenue Capital Group, and New York University and serves on several boards, including those of the School of American Ballet, Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, Common Sense Media, Weill Cornell Medical College and IAC/InterActiveCorp. In 2007 and 2008, Clinton campaigned extensively on American college campuses for her mother's unsuccessful Democratic presidential nomination bid and introduced her at both the 2008 and 2016 Democratic National Conventions.

Early years
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 27, 1980. Chelsea's name was inspired by a visit to the Chelsea neighborhood of London during a Christmas 1978 vacation. Hillary said that upon hearing the 1969 Judy Collins recording of the Joni Mitchell song, "Chelsea Morning", Bill remarked, "If we ever have a daughter, her name should be Chelsea."[2][3][4]
When Chelsea was two years old, she accompanied her parents as they campaigned throughout Arkansas for her father's gubernatorial race.[2] She learned to read and write at a very young age. Chelsea claims that she started reading the newspaper by the age of three and also wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan when she was only five years old.[5] In the letter, which was photocopied and preserved by her father, she asked President Reagan not to visit a military cemetery in West Germany, where Nazi soldiers were buried.[5] Chelsea attended Forest Park Elementary School, Booker Arts and Science Magnet Elementary School and Horace Mann Junior High School, both Little Rock public schools.[6] She skipped the third grade.[7]
White House years




White House portrait of the Clintons (unknown date)


On January 20, 1993, the day of her father's first inauguration, Chelsea moved into the White House with her parents and was given the Secret Service codename "Energy".[8] The Clintons wanted their daughter to have a normal childhood, and they hoped to shield her from the media spotlight.[9]
Hillary Clinton followed the advice of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on raising children in the White House, and asked the press to limit coverage of Chelsea to her participation in public events such as state visits.[3] Margaret Truman, daughter of former president Harry S. Truman, supported the Clintons, and in March 1993 wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times about the damage that could be done if the press made Chelsea a subject of intense coverage.[10]
Journalists debated the issue of allowing Clinton to retain her privacy. Most media outlets concluded that she should be off-limits due to her age, although Rush Limbaugh[9] and Saturday Night Live both broadcast material mocking her appearance.[11] During this phase of her life, her father said, "We really work hard on making sure that Chelsea doesn't let other people define her sense of her own self-worth ... It's tough when you are an adolescent ... but I think she'll be ok."[12]
The Clintons' decision to remove Chelsea from public schooling and send her to Sidwell Friends School, a private school in Washington, D.C., drew criticism.[9] While several children of sitting presidents have attended Sidwell, the most recent prior child, Amy Carter, had gone to D.C. public schools. In a 1993 CBS This Morning town meeting, Bill defended the choice, stating that Chelsea did not like "getting a lot of publicity" and would have "more control over her destiny" at Sidwell. Bill explained that they made their decision in an effort to protect Chelsea's privacy; they did not "reject the public schools."[13] Sidwell's students and staff remained silent regarding Chelsea, declining to discuss her publicly.[9] A veteran of Model United Nations,[14] Clinton was a 1997 National Merit Scholarship semifinalist.[15] She graduated from Sidwell Friends in 1997; her father spoke at the graduation ceremony.[16]
Following Chelsea's high school graduation, media speculation regarding her choice of college resulted in heavy press coverage. She ultimately chose to attend Stanford University. During her father's eight years in office, there were 32 stories in The New York Times and 87 network news stories about Chelsea. Of all presidential children preceding her, she received the most television coverage.[17]




Clinton ringing a replica of the Liberty Bell at her father's first inauguration


Although her father is a Southern Baptist, Clinton was raised in her mother's Methodist faith.[18] She attended Foundry United Methodist Church on 16th Street, NW in Washington and met with other teens on Sunday mornings to examine questions of faith, philosophy, and issues of concern to her age group. Her parents joined her at the youth group's parent-teen round tables. An adult group leader thought Clinton to be "a terrific kid" and observed that she was treated as an equal in the group. Away from church, her social activities included visits to a Planet Hollywood restaurant with friends and sleep-overs in and out of the White House. President Clinton sometimes joined her and her sleep-over friends for breakfast.[9]
At age four, Clinton had begun taking dance classes in Arkansas,[19] and she continued her dance training at the Washington School of Ballet for several years. In her book, It Takes a Village, Hillary wrote that Bill was disappointed when Chelsea quit softball and soccer to concentrate on ballet, but he was nonetheless supportive, regularly attending her performances.[9] She was cast in the role of the Favorite Aunt[20] in the 1993 Washington Ballet production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker.[9][21]
In early 1999, the Clintons learned of an article being planned by People that examined the First Family's relationships in the wake of scandals and the impending vote on President Clinton's impeachment. The Secret Service told the magazine that they had concerns that the story could compromise Chelsea's security. People decided to run the story anyway, and Bill and Hillary issued a statement expressing their regret and sadness. Carol Wallace, People managing editor, affirmed the magazine's sensitivity to the Clintons' concerns, but felt 19-year-old Chelsea was "an eyewitness to family drama and historical events" and thus "a valid journalistic subject". The article, entitled "Grace Under Fire", was published in February 1999 with a cover photo of Chelsea and Hillary.[22]
During the last year of her father's presidency, Chelsea assumed some White House hostess responsibilities when her mother was campaigning for the U.S. Senate, traveling with her father on several overseas trips and attending state dinners with him.[23]
Education and academic life
Stanford University
Clinton entered Stanford University in the fall of 1997 and majored in history.[24][25]
The week before she arrived on campus, her mother published an open letter in her syndicated column asking journalists to leave her daughter alone. Chelsea arrived at Stanford in a motorcade with her parents, Secret Service agents, and almost 250 journalists. For her security, bullet-proof glass was installed in her dorm windows and surveillance cameras were placed in hallways. Secret Service agents in plain clothes lived in her dorm.[26] With the exception of an occasional tabloid story written about her, Chelsea's four years at Stanford remained out of public view.[27]
Clinton obtained a B.A. degree in history, with highest honors, at Stanford in 2001.[24][27] The topic of her 167-page senior thesis was the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, advised by Jack Rakove.[27][28] At the time of Chelsea's graduation, President Clinton issued a statement saying, "Hillary and I are grateful for the friendships and great learning experiences Chelsea had at Stanford, and we are very proud of her on this special day."[29]
University of Oxford
In July 2001, President Clinton revealed that Chelsea would be pursuing a master's degree at University College of the University of Oxford later that year – the same college where he studied politics between 1968 and 1970 on a Rhodes Scholarship;[30] Chelsea did not apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. Lord Butler of Brockwell, the Master of University College, said: "Her record at Stanford shows that she is a very well-qualified and able student. The college is also pleased to extend its link with the Clinton family." Upon the recommendation of British and American advisers, the university implemented security measures,[31] and fellow students were asked not to discuss her with the press.[32]
Arriving at Oxford just after the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American students who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told Talk magazine:

Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find that I want to be around Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.[32]

Clinton was criticized for those remarks in the London press and by the newspaper Oxford Student, which angered the university by directly attacking her in an editorial. However, people who met Clinton at that time described her as charming, poised and unaffected, and she seemed to be adjusting successfully to life abroad. During her time at Oxford, Chelsea adopted a more sophisticated look, reportedly assisted by a family friend, Donatella Versace, whose couture shows she attended in early 2002. Geordie Greig, the editor of Tatler, ranked her number five on the magazine's 2002 "Top 10 Girls" list.[32]
In 2003, Clinton completed an MPhil degree in international relations at Oxford.[33] Her 132-page thesis was titled The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria: A Response to Global Threats, a Part of a Global Future, supervised by Jennifer Welsh and Ngaire Woods.[34] Following her graduation, she returned to the United States.[24]
In 2011, Clinton transferred back to University College, Oxford, from the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University to complete her DPhil degree in International Relations.[35] She stated this was to be under her preferred doctoral advisor, Ngaire Woods.[36] She finished her dissertation from New York City where she resides[37] and was awarded the degree in May 2014.[38] Her 712-page dissertation was titled The Global Fund: An Experiment in Global Governance.[39][40]
Columbia University and New York University
In the spring of 2010, Clinton completed a M.P.H. degree at the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University[41][42] and she began teaching graduate classes there in 2012.[43]
Starting in 2010, Clinton began serving as Assistant Vice-Provost for the Global Network University of New York University, working on international recruitment strategies.[37] She is the co-founder of the Of Many Institute for Multifaith Leadership at NYU and serves as its co-chair.[44] By 2010, she was also pursuing PhD coursework at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service, but later transferred back to Oxford in 2011 to complete her dissertation.[36][45]
In 2012, Clinton received an award from the Temple of Understanding for her "work in advancing a new model of integrating interfaith and cross-cultural education into campus life," together with Imam Khalid Latif and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna.[46]
Professional life
In 2003, Clinton joined the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in New York City,[24] and she went to work for Avenue Capital Group in late 2006. She served as co-chair for a fund-raising week for the Clinton Foundation, and subsequently became Vice Chair for the foundation.[38] She serves on the board of the School of American Ballet[24] and on IAC's board of directors.[47][48]
In November 2011, NBC announced that they had hired Clinton as a special correspondent. One of her roles was reporting feature stories about "Making a Difference" for NBC Nightly News and Rock Center with Brian Williams. It was a three-month contract and allowed her to concurrently continue working for the Clinton Foundation and pursue her education.[49][50] Clinton's first appearance was on the December 12, 2011, episode of Rock Center.[51] Although she received some negative critical reviews for her work, Clinton's contract with NBC was renewed in February 2012.[52][53] Rock Center ended in May 2013, and she left the network in August 2014.[54][55] Clinton reportedly earned an annual salary of $600,000 for her work at NBC.[56]
In September 2015, Clinton made her authorial debut with It's Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired and Get Going!, which was published by Philomel Books. The 400-page book is aimed at middle school students (ages 10 to 14) and introduces them to a range of social issues, encouraging them to take action to make the world a better place.[57] The Today Show gave Clinton a full segment in which to discuss the book with her former colleagues at NBC.[58] The book received mixed reviews from critics, who lauded Clinton for her effort but "lament[ed] its didactic tone".[57][59][60]
In May 2017 Clinton published her sophomore authorial work, a children's book entitled, She Persisted. Upon its release, the book became a bestseller.[61]
Chelsea Clinton's estimated net worth is USD $15,000,000.[62]
Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign
Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008




Clinton campaigning for her mother


In December 2007, Clinton began campaigning in Iowa in support of her mother's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.[63] She appeared across the country, largely on college campuses.[64][65][66] By early April 2008, she had spoken at 100 colleges on behalf of her mother's candidacy.[67]
While campaigning, Clinton answered audience questions but did not give interviews or respond to press questions,[68] including one from a nine-year-old Scholastic News reporter asking whether her father would be a good "first man".[69] She replied, "I'm sorry, I don't talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately. Even though I think you're cute."[70] Philippe Reines, her mother's press secretary, intervened when the press attempted to approach Chelsea directly.[69]
When MSNBC reporter David Shuster characterized Clinton's participation in her mother's campaign as "sort of being pimped out", the Clinton campaign objected. Shuster subsequently apologized on-air and was suspended for two weeks.[71][72]




Clinton speaking at the 2008 Democratic National Convention


The first time she was asked about her mother's handling of the Lewinsky scandal at a campaign stop Clinton responded, "I do not think that is any of your business."[67] As she became a more experienced campaigner, she refined her responses and deflected questions on the issue with comments such as, "If that's what you want to vote on, that's what you should vote on. But I think there are other people [who are] going to vote on things like healthcare and economics."[67][73]
At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Chelsea called Hillary "my hero and my mother" and introduced her with a long video tribute.[74]

Clinton Foundation

Since 2011, Clinton has taken a prominent role at the family's Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation,[75] and has had a seat on its board.[1] As part of her work, she gives paid speeches to raise money with her fees going directly to the foundation, whose goals relate to improving global health, creating opportunities for women, and promoting economic growth. A spokesperson for the foundation told The New York Times in 2014 that her speeches "are on behalf of the Clinton Foundation, and 100 percent of the fees are remitted directly to the foundation".[76][77]
Personal life
On July 31, 2010, Clinton and investment banker Marc Mezvinsky[78] were married in an interfaith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York; she is Methodist and he is Jewish.[79] Mezvinsky is the son of former members of Congress Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky, and was raised in the Conservative Jewish tradition. The senior Clintons and Mezvinskys were friends in the 1990s and their children met on a Renaissance Weekend retreat in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.[80] They first were reported to be a couple in 2005, and became engaged over Thanksgiving weekend in 2009.[78]
Following their wedding, the couple lived in New York City's Gramercy Park neighborhood for three years [79] and later purchased a condominium in the NoMad district of Manhattan for $10.5 million.[81] Their daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in September 2014,[82] and their son, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in June 2016.[83][84] Shortly after Aidan was born, the family moved to the nearby Flatiron District.[85]
As a young child, Clinton was raised in her father's Southern Baptist faith, and later attended her mother's United Methodist church.[86]
In popular culture
Clinton is portrayed in the film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, where Butt-Head flirts with her; she responds by tossing him out of a window.[87] In Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, a Disney Channel Original Movie set in the year 2049, Clinton is the President of the United States.[88][89] This joke was also made in an episode of Clarissa Explains It All.
Chelsea Clinton appeared in a Sesame Street skit with Elmo, advocating the importance of reading to young children.[90]

Chelsea Victoria Clinton (born February 27, 1980) is the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She was a special correspondent for NBC News from 2011 to 2014 and now works with the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Since 2011, she has taken on a prominent role at the foundation and has a seat on its board.[1]
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, during her father's first term as governor. She attended public schools there until he was elected President and the family moved to the White House, where she began attending the private Sidwell Friends School. She received an undergraduate degree at Stanford University and later earned master's degrees from University College, Oxford and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, and a Doctor of Philosophy in international relations from the University of Oxford in 2014. Clinton married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in 2010. They have a daughter and a son.
Clinton has worked for NBC, McKinsey & Company, Avenue Capital Group, and New York University and serves on several boards, including those of the School of American Ballet, Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, Common Sense Media, Weill Cornell Medical College and IAC/InterActiveCorp. In 2007 and 2008, Clinton campaigned extensively on American college campuses for her mother's unsuccessful Democratic presidential nomination bid and introduced her at both the 2008 and 2016 Democratic National Conventions.

Early years
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 27, 1980. Chelsea's name was inspired by a visit to the Chelsea neighborhood of London during a Christmas 1978 vacation. Hillary said that upon hearing the 1969 Judy Collins recording of the Joni Mitchell song, "Chelsea Morning", Bill remarked, "If we ever have a daughter, her name should be Chelsea."[2][3][4]
When Chelsea was two years old, she accompanied her parents as they campaigned throughout Arkansas for her father's gubernatorial race.[2] She learned to read and write at a very young age. Chelsea claims that she started reading the newspaper by the age of three and also wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan when she was only five years old.[5] In the letter, which was photocopied and preserved by her father, she asked President Reagan not to visit a military cemetery in West Germany, where Nazi soldiers were buried.[5] Chelsea attended Forest Park Elementary School, Booker Arts and Science Magnet Elementary School and Horace Mann Junior High School, both Little Rock public schools.[6] She skipped the third grade.[7]
White House years




White House portrait of the Clintons (unknown date)


On January 20, 1993, the day of her father's first inauguration, Chelsea moved into the White House with her parents and was given the Secret Service codename "Energy".[8] The Clintons wanted their daughter to have a normal childhood, and they hoped to shield her from the media spotlight.[9]
Hillary Clinton followed the advice of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on raising children in the White House, and asked the press to limit coverage of Chelsea to her participation in public events such as state visits.[3] Margaret Truman, daughter of former president Harry S. Truman, supported the Clintons, and in March 1993 wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times about the damage that could be done if the press made Chelsea a subject of intense coverage.[10]
Journalists debated the issue of allowing Clinton to retain her privacy. Most media outlets concluded that she should be off-limits due to her age, although Rush Limbaugh[9] and Saturday Night Live both broadcast material mocking her appearance.[11] During this phase of her life, her father said, "We really work hard on making sure that Chelsea doesn't let other people define her sense of her own self-worth ... It's tough when you are an adolescent ... but I think she'll be ok."[12]
The Clintons' decision to remove Chelsea from public schooling and send her to Sidwell Friends School, a private school in Washington, D.C., drew criticism.[9] While several children of sitting presidents have attended Sidwell, the most recent prior child, Amy Carter, had gone to D.C. public schools. In a 1993 CBS This Morning town meeting, Bill defended the choice, stating that Chelsea did not like "getting a lot of publicity" and would have "more control over her destiny" at Sidwell. Bill explained that they made their decision in an effort to protect Chelsea's privacy; they did not "reject the public schools."[13] Sidwell's students and staff remained silent regarding Chelsea, declining to discuss her publicly.[9] A veteran of Model United Nations,[14] Clinton was a 1997 National Merit Scholarship semifinalist.[15] She graduated from Sidwell Friends in 1997; her father spoke at the graduation ceremony.[16]
Following Chelsea's high school graduation, media speculation regarding her choice of college resulted in heavy press coverage. She ultimately chose to attend Stanford University. During her father's eight years in office, there were 32 stories in The New York Times and 87 network news stories about Chelsea. Of all presidential children preceding her, she received the most television coverage.[17]




Clinton ringing a replica of the Liberty Bell at her father's first inauguration


Although her father is a Southern Baptist, Clinton was raised in her mother's Methodist faith.[18] She attended Foundry United Methodist Church on 16th Street, NW in Washington and met with other teens on Sunday mornings to examine questions of faith, philosophy, and issues of concern to her age group. Her parents joined her at the youth group's parent-teen round tables. An adult group leader thought Clinton to be "a terrific kid" and observed that she was treated as an equal in the group. Away from church, her social activities included visits to a Planet Hollywood restaurant with friends and sleep-overs in and out of the White House. President Clinton sometimes joined her and her sleep-over friends for breakfast.[9]
At age four, Clinton had begun taking dance classes in Arkansas,[19] and she continued her dance training at the Washington School of Ballet for several years. In her book, It Takes a Village, Hillary wrote that Bill was disappointed when Chelsea quit softball and soccer to concentrate on ballet, but he was nonetheless supportive, regularly attending her performances.[9] She was cast in the role of the Favorite Aunt[20] in the 1993 Washington Ballet production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker.[9][21]
In early 1999, the Clintons learned of an article being planned by People that examined the First Family's relationships in the wake of scandals and the impending vote on President Clinton's impeachment. The Secret Service told the magazine that they had concerns that the story could compromise Chelsea's security. People decided to run the story anyway, and Bill and Hillary issued a statement expressing their regret and sadness. Carol Wallace, People managing editor, affirmed the magazine's sensitivity to the Clintons' concerns, but felt 19-year-old Chelsea was "an eyewitness to family drama and historical events" and thus "a valid journalistic subject". The article, entitled "Grace Under Fire", was published in February 1999 with a cover photo of Chelsea and Hillary.[22]
During the last year of her father's presidency, Chelsea assumed some White House hostess responsibilities when her mother was campaigning for the U.S. Senate, traveling with her father on several overseas trips and attending state dinners with him.[23]
Education and academic life
Stanford University
Clinton entered Stanford University in the fall of 1997 and majored in history.[24][25]
The week before she arrived on campus, her mother published an open letter in her syndicated column asking journalists to leave her daughter alone. Chelsea arrived at Stanford in a motorcade with her parents, Secret Service agents, and almost 250 journalists. For her security, bullet-proof glass was installed in her dorm windows and surveillance cameras were placed in hallways. Secret Service agents in plain clothes lived in her dorm.[26] With the exception of an occasional tabloid story written about her, Chelsea's four years at Stanford remained out of public view.[27]
Clinton obtained a B.A. degree in history, with highest honors, at Stanford in 2001.[24][27] The topic of her 167-page senior thesis was the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, advised by Jack Rakove.[27][28] At the time of Chelsea's graduation, President Clinton issued a statement saying, "Hillary and I are grateful for the friendships and great learning experiences Chelsea had at Stanford, and we are very proud of her on this special day."[29]
University of Oxford
In July 2001, President Clinton revealed that Chelsea would be pursuing a master's degree at University College of the University of Oxford later that year – the same college where he studied politics between 1968 and 1970 on a Rhodes Scholarship;[30] Chelsea did not apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. Lord Butler of Brockwell, the Master of University College, said: "Her record at Stanford shows that she is a very well-qualified and able student. The college is also pleased to extend its link with the Clinton family." Upon the recommendation of British and American advisers, the university implemented security measures,[31] and fellow students were asked not to discuss her with the press.[32]
Arriving at Oxford just after the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American students who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told Talk magazine:

Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find that I want to be around Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.[32]

Clinton was criticized for those remarks in the London press and by the newspaper Oxford Student, which angered the university by directly attacking her in an editorial. However, people who met Clinton at that time described her as charming, poised and unaffected, and she seemed to be adjusting successfully to life abroad. During her time at Oxford, Chelsea adopted a more sophisticated look, reportedly assisted by a family friend, Donatella Versace, whose couture shows she attended in early 2002. Geordie Greig, the editor of Tatler, ranked her number five on the magazine's 2002 "Top 10 Girls" list.[32]
In 2003, Clinton completed an MPhil degree in international relations at Oxford.[33] Her 132-page thesis was titled The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria: A Response to Global Threats, a Part of a Global Future, supervised by Jennifer Welsh and Ngaire Woods.[34] Following her graduation, she returned to the United States.[24]
In 2011, Clinton transferred back to University College, Oxford, from the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University to complete her DPhil degree in International Relations.[35] She stated this was to be under her preferred doctoral advisor, Ngaire Woods.[36] She finished her dissertation from New York City where she resides[37] and was awarded the degree in May 2014.[38] Her 712-page dissertation was titled The Global Fund: An Experiment in Global Governance.[39][40]
Columbia University and New York University
In the spring of 2010, Clinton completed a M.P.H. degree at the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University[41][42] and she began teaching graduate classes there in 2012.[43]
Starting in 2010, Clinton began serving as Assistant Vice-Provost for the Global Network University of New York University, working on international recruitment strategies.[37] She is the co-founder of the Of Many Institute for Multifaith Leadership at NYU and serves as its co-chair.[44] By 2010, she was also pursuing PhD coursework at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service, but later transferred back to Oxford in 2011 to complete her dissertation.[36][45]
In 2012, Clinton received an award from the Temple of Understanding for her "work in advancing a new model of integrating interfaith and cross-cultural education into campus life," together with Imam Khalid Latif and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna.[46]
Professional life
In 2003, Clinton joined the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in New York City,[24] and she went to work for Avenue Capital Group in late 2006. She served as co-chair for a fund-raising week for the Clinton Foundation, and subsequently became Vice Chair for the foundation.[38] She serves on the board of the School of American Ballet[24] and on IAC's board of directors.[47][48]
In November 2011, NBC announced that they had hired Clinton as a special correspondent. One of her roles was reporting feature stories about "Making a Difference" for NBC Nightly News and Rock Center with Brian Williams. It was a three-month contract and allowed her to concurrently continue working for the Clinton Foundation and pursue her education.[49][50] Clinton's first appearance was on the December 12, 2011, episode of Rock Center.[51] Although she received some negative critical reviews for her work, Clinton's contract with NBC was renewed in February 2012.[52][53] Rock Center ended in May 2013, and she left the network in August 2014.[54][55] Clinton reportedly earned an annual salary of $600,000 for her work at NBC.[56]
In September 2015, Clinton made her authorial debut with It's Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired and Get Going!, which was published by Philomel Books. The 400-page book is aimed at middle school students (ages 10 to 14) and introduces them to a range of social issues, encouraging them to take action to make the world a better place.[57] The Today Show gave Clinton a full segment in which to discuss the book with her former colleagues at NBC.[58] The book received mixed reviews from critics, who lauded Clinton for her effort but "lament[ed] its didactic tone".[57][59][60]
In May 2017 Clinton published her sophomore authorial work, a children's book entitled, She Persisted. Upon its release, the book became a bestseller.[61]
Chelsea Clinton's estimated net worth is USD $15,000,000.[62]
Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign
Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008




Clinton campaigning for her mother


In December 2007, Clinton began campaigning in Iowa in support of her mother's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.[63] She appeared across the country, largely on college campuses.[64][65][66] By early April 2008, she had spoken at 100 colleges on behalf of her mother's candidacy.[67]
While campaigning, Clinton answered audience questions but did not give interviews or respond to press questions,[68] including one from a nine-year-old Scholastic News reporter asking whether her father would be a good "first man".[69] She replied, "I'm sorry, I don't talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately. Even though I think you're cute."[70] Philippe Reines, her mother's press secretary, intervened when the press attempted to approach Chelsea directly.[69]
When MSNBC reporter David Shuster characterized Clinton's participation in her mother's campaign as "sort of being pimped out", the Clinton campaign objected. Shuster subsequently apologized on-air and was suspended for two weeks.[71][72]




Clinton speaking at the 2008 Democratic National Convention


The first time she was asked about her mother's handling of the Lewinsky scandal at a campaign stop Clinton responded, "I do not think that is any of your business."[67] As she became a more experienced campaigner, she refined her responses and deflected questions on the issue with comments such as, "If that's what you want to vote on, that's what you should vote on. But I think there are other people [who are] going to vote on things like healthcare and economics."[67][73]
At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Chelsea called Hillary "my hero and my mother" and introduced her with a long video tribute.[74]

Clinton Foundation

Since 2011, Clinton has taken a prominent role at the family's Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation,[75] and has had a seat on its board.[1] As part of her work, she gives paid speeches to raise money with her fees going directly to the foundation, whose goals relate to improving global health, creating opportunities for women, and promoting economic growth. A spokesperson for the foundation told The New York Times in 2014 that her speeches "are on behalf of the Clinton Foundation, and 100 percent of the fees are remitted directly to the foundation".[76][77]
Personal life
On July 31, 2010, Clinton and investment banker Marc Mezvinsky[78] were married in an interfaith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York; she is Methodist and he is Jewish.[79] Mezvinsky is the son of former members of Congress Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky, and was raised in the Conservative Jewish tradition. The senior Clintons and Mezvinskys were friends in the 1990s and their children met on a Renaissance Weekend retreat in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.[80] They first were reported to be a couple in 2005, and became engaged over Thanksgiving weekend in 2009.[78]
Following their wedding, the couple lived in New York City's Gramercy Park neighborhood for three years [79] and later purchased a condominium in the NoMad district of Manhattan for $10.5 million.[81] Their daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in September 2014,[82] and their son, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in June 2016.[83][84] Shortly after Aidan was born, the family moved to the nearby Flatiron District.[85]
As a young child, Clinton was raised in her father's Southern Baptist faith, and later attended her mother's United Methodist church.[86]
In popular culture
Clinton is portrayed in the film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, where Butt-Head flirts with her; she responds by tossing him out of a window.[87] In Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, a Disney Channel Original Movie set in the year 2049, Clinton is the President of the United States.[88][89] This joke was also made in an episode of Clarissa Explains It All.
Chelsea Clinton appeared in a Sesame Street skit with Elmo, advocating the importance of reading to young children.[90]

Chelsea Victoria Clinton (born February 27, 1980) is the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She was a special correspondent for NBC News from 2011 to 2014 and now works with the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Since 2011, she has taken on a prominent role at the foundation and has a seat on its board.[1]
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, during her father's first term as governor. She attended public schools there until he was elected President and the family moved to the White House, where she began attending the private Sidwell Friends School. She received an undergraduate degree at Stanford University and later earned master's degrees from University College, Oxford and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, and a Doctor of Philosophy in international relations from the University of Oxford in 2014. Clinton married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in 2010. They have a daughter and a son.
Clinton has worked for NBC, McKinsey & Company, Avenue Capital Group, and New York University and serves on several boards, including those of the School of American Ballet, Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, Common Sense Media, Weill Cornell Medical College and IAC/InterActiveCorp. In 2007 and 2008, Clinton campaigned extensively on American college campuses for her mother's unsuccessful Democratic presidential nomination bid and introduced her at both the 2008 and 2016 Democratic National Conventions.

Early years
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 27, 1980. Chelsea's name was inspired by a visit to the Chelsea neighborhood of London during a Christmas 1978 vacation. Hillary said that upon hearing the 1969 Judy Collins recording of the Joni Mitchell song, "Chelsea Morning", Bill remarked, "If we ever have a daughter, her name should be Chelsea."[2][3][4]
When Chelsea was two years old, she accompanied her parents as they campaigned throughout Arkansas for her father's gubernatorial race.[2] She learned to read and write at a very young age. Chelsea claims that she started reading the newspaper by the age of three and also wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan when she was only five years old.[5] In the letter, which was photocopied and preserved by her father, she asked President Reagan not to visit a military cemetery in West Germany, where Nazi soldiers were buried.[5] Chelsea attended Forest Park Elementary School, Booker Arts and Science Magnet Elementary School and Horace Mann Junior High School, both Little Rock public schools.[6] She skipped the third grade.[7]
White House years




White House portrait of the Clintons (unknown date)


On January 20, 1993, the day of her father's first inauguration, Chelsea moved into the White House with her parents and was given the Secret Service codename "Energy".[8] The Clintons wanted their daughter to have a normal childhood, and they hoped to shield her from the media spotlight.[9]
Hillary Clinton followed the advice of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on raising children in the White House, and asked the press to limit coverage of Chelsea to her participation in public events such as state visits.[3] Margaret Truman, daughter of former president Harry S. Truman, supported the Clintons, and in March 1993 wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times about the damage that could be done if the press made Chelsea a subject of intense coverage.[10]
Journalists debated the issue of allowing Clinton to retain her privacy. Most media outlets concluded that she should be off-limits due to her age, although Rush Limbaugh[9] and Saturday Night Live both broadcast material mocking her appearance.[11] During this phase of her life, her father said, "We really work hard on making sure that Chelsea doesn't let other people define her sense of her own self-worth ... It's tough when you are an adolescent ... but I think she'll be ok."[12]
The Clintons' decision to remove Chelsea from public schooling and send her to Sidwell Friends School, a private school in Washington, D.C., drew criticism.[9] While several children of sitting presidents have attended Sidwell, the most recent prior child, Amy Carter, had gone to D.C. public schools. In a 1993 CBS This Morning town meeting, Bill defended the choice, stating that Chelsea did not like "getting a lot of publicity" and would have "more control over her destiny" at Sidwell. Bill explained that they made their decision in an effort to protect Chelsea's privacy; they did not "reject the public schools."[13] Sidwell's students and staff remained silent regarding Chelsea, declining to discuss her publicly.[9] A veteran of Model United Nations,[14] Clinton was a 1997 National Merit Scholarship semifinalist.[15] She graduated from Sidwell Friends in 1997; her father spoke at the graduation ceremony.[16]
Following Chelsea's high school graduation, media speculation regarding her choice of college resulted in heavy press coverage. She ultimately chose to attend Stanford University. During her father's eight years in office, there were 32 stories in The New York Times and 87 network news stories about Chelsea. Of all presidential children preceding her, she received the most television coverage.[17]




Clinton ringing a replica of the Liberty Bell at her father's first inauguration


Although her father is a Southern Baptist, Clinton was raised in her mother's Methodist faith.[18] She attended Foundry United Methodist Church on 16th Street, NW in Washington and met with other teens on Sunday mornings to examine questions of faith, philosophy, and issues of concern to her age group. Her parents joined her at the youth group's parent-teen round tables. An adult group leader thought Clinton to be "a terrific kid" and observed that she was treated as an equal in the group. Away from church, her social activities included visits to a Planet Hollywood restaurant with friends and sleep-overs in and out of the White House. President Clinton sometimes joined her and her sleep-over friends for breakfast.[9]
At age four, Clinton had begun taking dance classes in Arkansas,[19] and she continued her dance training at the Washington School of Ballet for several years. In her book, It Takes a Village, Hillary wrote that Bill was disappointed when Chelsea quit softball and soccer to concentrate on ballet, but he was nonetheless supportive, regularly attending her performances.[9] She was cast in the role of the Favorite Aunt[20] in the 1993 Washington Ballet production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker.[9][21]
In early 1999, the Clintons learned of an article being planned by People that examined the First Family's relationships in the wake of scandals and the impending vote on President Clinton's impeachment. The Secret Service told the magazine that they had concerns that the story could compromise Chelsea's security. People decided to run the story anyway, and Bill and Hillary issued a statement expressing their regret and sadness. Carol Wallace, People managing editor, affirmed the magazine's sensitivity to the Clintons' concerns, but felt 19-year-old Chelsea was "an eyewitness to family drama and historical events" and thus "a valid journalistic subject". The article, entitled "Grace Under Fire", was published in February 1999 with a cover photo of Chelsea and Hillary.[22]
During the last year of her father's presidency, Chelsea assumed some White House hostess responsibilities when her mother was campaigning for the U.S. Senate, traveling with her father on several overseas trips and attending state dinners with him.[23]
Education and academic life
Stanford University
Clinton entered Stanford University in the fall of 1997 and majored in history.[24][25]
The week before she arrived on campus, her mother published an open letter in her syndicated column asking journalists to leave her daughter alone. Chelsea arrived at Stanford in a motorcade with her parents, Secret Service agents, and almost 250 journalists. For her security, bullet-proof glass was installed in her dorm windows and surveillance cameras were placed in hallways. Secret Service agents in plain clothes lived in her dorm.[26] With the exception of an occasional tabloid story written about her, Chelsea's four years at Stanford remained out of public view.[27]
Clinton obtained a B.A. degree in history, with highest honors, at Stanford in 2001.[24][27] The topic of her 167-page senior thesis was the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, advised by Jack Rakove.[27][28] At the time of Chelsea's graduation, President Clinton issued a statement saying, "Hillary and I are grateful for the friendships and great learning experiences Chelsea had at Stanford, and we are very proud of her on this special day."[29]
University of Oxford
In July 2001, President Clinton revealed that Chelsea would be pursuing a master's degree at University College of the University of Oxford later that year – the same college where he studied politics between 1968 and 1970 on a Rhodes Scholarship;[30] Chelsea did not apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. Lord Butler of Brockwell, the Master of University College, said: "Her record at Stanford shows that she is a very well-qualified and able student. The college is also pleased to extend its link with the Clinton family." Upon the recommendation of British and American advisers, the university implemented security measures,[31] and fellow students were asked not to discuss her with the press.[32]
Arriving at Oxford just after the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American students who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told Talk magazine:

Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find that I want to be around Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.[32]

Clinton was criticized for those remarks in the London press and by the newspaper Oxford Student, which angered the university by directly attacking her in an editorial. However, people who met Clinton at that time described her as charming, poised and unaffected, and she seemed to be adjusting successfully to life abroad. During her time at Oxford, Chelsea adopted a more sophisticated look, reportedly assisted by a family friend, Donatella Versace, whose couture shows she attended in early 2002. Geordie Greig, the editor of Tatler, ranked her number five on the magazine's 2002 "Top 10 Girls" list.[32]
In 2003, Clinton completed an MPhil degree in international relations at Oxford.[33] Her 132-page thesis was titled The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria: A Response to Global Threats, a Part of a Global Future, supervised by Jennifer Welsh and Ngaire Woods.[34] Following her graduation, she returned to the United States.[24]
In 2011, Clinton transferred back to University College, Oxford, from the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University to complete her DPhil degree in International Relations.[35] She stated this was to be under her preferred doctoral advisor, Ngaire Woods.[36] She finished her dissertation from New York City where she resides[37] and was awarded the degree in May 2014.[38] Her 712-page dissertation was titled The Global Fund: An Experiment in Global Governance.[39][40]
Columbia University and New York University
In the spring of 2010, Clinton completed a M.P.H. degree at the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University[41][42] and she began teaching graduate classes there in 2012.[43]
Starting in 2010, Clinton began serving as Assistant Vice-Provost for the Global Network University of New York University, working on international recruitment strategies.[37] She is the co-founder of the Of Many Institute for Multifaith Leadership at NYU and serves as its co-chair.[44] By 2010, she was also pursuing PhD coursework at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service, but later transferred back to Oxford in 2011 to complete her dissertation.[36][45]
In 2012, Clinton received an award from the Temple of Understanding for her "work in advancing a new model of integrating interfaith and cross-cultural education into campus life," together with Imam Khalid Latif and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna.[46]
Professional life
In 2003, Clinton joined the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in New York City,[24] and she went to work for Avenue Capital Group in late 2006. She served as co-chair for a fund-raising week for the Clinton Foundation, and subsequently became Vice Chair for the foundation.[38] She serves on the board of the School of American Ballet[24] and on IAC's board of directors.[47][48]
In November 2011, NBC announced that they had hired Clinton as a special correspondent. One of her roles was reporting feature stories about "Making a Difference" for NBC Nightly News and Rock Center with Brian Williams. It was a three-month contract and allowed her to concurrently continue working for the Clinton Foundation and pursue her education.[49][50] Clinton's first appearance was on the December 12, 2011, episode of Rock Center.[51] Although she received some negative critical reviews for her work, Clinton's contract with NBC was renewed in February 2012.[52][53] Rock Center ended in May 2013, and she left the network in August 2014.[54][55] Clinton reportedly earned an annual salary of $600,000 for her work at NBC.[56]
In September 2015, Clinton made her authorial debut with It's Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired and Get Going!, which was published by Philomel Books. The 400-page book is aimed at middle school students (ages 10 to 14) and introduces them to a range of social issues, encouraging them to take action to make the world a better place.[57] The Today Show gave Clinton a full segment in which to discuss the book with her former colleagues at NBC.[58] The book received mixed reviews from critics, who lauded Clinton for her effort but "lament[ed] its didactic tone".[57][59][60]
In May 2017 Clinton published her sophomore authorial work, a children's book entitled, She Persisted. Upon its release, the book became a bestseller.[61]
Chelsea Clinton's estimated net worth is USD $15,000,000.[62]
Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign
Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008




Clinton campaigning for her mother


In December 2007, Clinton began campaigning in Iowa in support of her mother's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.[63] She appeared across the country, largely on college campuses.[64][65][66] By early April 2008, she had spoken at 100 colleges on behalf of her mother's candidacy.[67]
While campaigning, Clinton answered audience questions but did not give interviews or respond to press questions,[68] including one from a nine-year-old Scholastic News reporter asking whether her father would be a good "first man".[69] She replied, "I'm sorry, I don't talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately. Even though I think you're cute."[70] Philippe Reines, her mother's press secretary, intervened when the press attempted to approach Chelsea directly.[69]
When MSNBC reporter David Shuster characterized Clinton's participation in her mother's campaign as "sort of being pimped out", the Clinton campaign objected. Shuster subsequently apologized on-air and was suspended for two weeks.[71][72]




Clinton speaking at the 2008 Democratic National Convention


The first time she was asked about her mother's handling of the Lewinsky scandal at a campaign stop Clinton responded, "I do not think that is any of your business."[67] As she became a more experienced campaigner, she refined her responses and deflected questions on the issue with comments such as, "If that's what you want to vote on, that's what you should vote on. But I think there are other people [who are] going to vote on things like healthcare and economics."[67][73]
At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Chelsea called Hillary "my hero and my mother" and introduced her with a long video tribute.[74]

Clinton Foundation

Since 2011, Clinton has taken a prominent role at the family's Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation,[75] and has had a seat on its board.[1] As part of her work, she gives paid speeches to raise money with her fees going directly to the foundation, whose goals relate to improving global health, creating opportunities for women, and promoting economic growth. A spokesperson for the foundation told The New York Times in 2014 that her speeches "are on behalf of the Clinton Foundation, and 100 percent of the fees are remitted directly to the foundation".[76][77]
Personal life
On July 31, 2010, Clinton and investment banker Marc Mezvinsky[78] were married in an interfaith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York; she is Methodist and he is Jewish.[79] Mezvinsky is the son of former members of Congress Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky, and was raised in the Conservative Jewish tradition. The senior Clintons and Mezvinskys were friends in the 1990s and their children met on a Renaissance Weekend retreat in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.[80] They first were reported to be a couple in 2005, and became engaged over Thanksgiving weekend in 2009.[78]
Following their wedding, the couple lived in New York City's Gramercy Park neighborhood for three years [79] and later purchased a condominium in the NoMad district of Manhattan for $10.5 million.[81] Their daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in September 2014,[82] and their son, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in June 2016.[83][84] Shortly after Aidan was born, the family moved to the nearby Flatiron District.[85]
As a young child, Clinton was raised in her father's Southern Baptist faith, and later attended her mother's United Methodist church.[86]
In popular culture
Clinton is portrayed in the film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, where Butt-Head flirts with her; she responds by tossing him out of a window.[87] In Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, a Disney Channel Original Movie set in the year 2049, Clinton is the President of the United States.[88][89] This joke was also made in an episode of Clarissa Explains It All.
Chelsea Clinton appeared in a Sesame Street skit with Elmo, advocating the importance of reading to young children.[90]

Chelsea Victoria Clinton (born February 27, 1980) is the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She was a special correspondent for NBC News from 2011 to 2014 and now works with the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Since 2011, she has taken on a prominent role at the foundation and has a seat on its board.[1]
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, during her father's first term as governor. She attended public schools there until he was elected President and the family moved to the White House, where she began attending the private Sidwell Friends School. She received an undergraduate degree at Stanford University and later earned master's degrees from University College, Oxford and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, and a Doctor of Philosophy in international relations from the University of Oxford in 2014. Clinton married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in 2010. They have a daughter and a son.
Clinton has worked for NBC, McKinsey & Company, Avenue Capital Group, and New York University and serves on several boards, including those of the School of American Ballet, Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, Common Sense Media, Weill Cornell Medical College and IAC/InterActiveCorp. In 2007 and 2008, Clinton campaigned extensively on American college campuses for her mother's unsuccessful Democratic presidential nomination bid and introduced her at both the 2008 and 2016 Democratic National Conventions.

Early years
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 27, 1980. Chelsea's name was inspired by a visit to the Chelsea neighborhood of London during a Christmas 1978 vacation. Hillary said that upon hearing the 1969 Judy Collins recording of the Joni Mitchell song, "Chelsea Morning", Bill remarked, "If we ever have a daughter, her name should be Chelsea."[2][3][4]
When Chelsea was two years old, she accompanied her parents as they campaigned throughout Arkansas for her father's gubernatorial race.[2] She learned to read and write at a very young age. Chelsea claims that she started reading the newspaper by the age of three and also wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan when she was only five years old.[5] In the letter, which was photocopied and preserved by her father, she asked President Reagan not to visit a military cemetery in West Germany, where Nazi soldiers were buried.[5] Chelsea attended Forest Park Elementary School, Booker Arts and Science Magnet Elementary School and Horace Mann Junior High School, both Little Rock public schools.[6] She skipped the third grade.[7]
White House years




White House portrait of the Clintons (unknown date)


On January 20, 1993, the day of her father's first inauguration, Chelsea moved into the White House with her parents and was given the Secret Service codename "Energy".[8] The Clintons wanted their daughter to have a normal childhood, and they hoped to shield her from the media spotlight.[9]
Hillary Clinton followed the advice of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on raising children in the White House, and asked the press to limit coverage of Chelsea to her participation in public events such as state visits.[3] Margaret Truman, daughter of former president Harry S. Truman, supported the Clintons, and in March 1993 wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times about the damage that could be done if the press made Chelsea a subject of intense coverage.[10]
Journalists debated the issue of allowing Clinton to retain her privacy. Most media outlets concluded that she should be off-limits due to her age, although Rush Limbaugh[9] and Saturday Night Live both broadcast material mocking her appearance.[11] During this phase of her life, her father said, "We really work hard on making sure that Chelsea doesn't let other people define her sense of her own self-worth ... It's tough when you are an adolescent ... but I think she'll be ok."[12]
The Clintons' decision to remove Chelsea from public schooling and send her to Sidwell Friends School, a private school in Washington, D.C., drew criticism.[9] While several children of sitting presidents have attended Sidwell, the most recent prior child, Amy Carter, had gone to D.C. public schools. In a 1993 CBS This Morning town meeting, Bill defended the choice, stating that Chelsea did not like "getting a lot of publicity" and would have "more control over her destiny" at Sidwell. Bill explained that they made their decision in an effort to protect Chelsea's privacy; they did not "reject the public schools."[13] Sidwell's students and staff remained silent regarding Chelsea, declining to discuss her publicly.[9] A veteran of Model United Nations,[14] Clinton was a 1997 National Merit Scholarship semifinalist.[15] She graduated from Sidwell Friends in 1997; her father spoke at the graduation ceremony.[16]
Following Chelsea's high school graduation, media speculation regarding her choice of college resulted in heavy press coverage. She ultimately chose to attend Stanford University. During her father's eight years in office, there were 32 stories in The New York Times and 87 network news stories about Chelsea. Of all presidential children preceding her, she received the most television coverage.[17]




Clinton ringing a replica of the Liberty Bell at her father's first inauguration


Although her father is a Southern Baptist, Clinton was raised in her mother's Methodist faith.[18] She attended Foundry United Methodist Church on 16th Street, NW in Washington and met with other teens on Sunday mornings to examine questions of faith, philosophy, and issues of concern to her age group. Her parents joined her at the youth group's parent-teen round tables. An adult group leader thought Clinton to be "a terrific kid" and observed that she was treated as an equal in the group. Away from church, her social activities included visits to a Planet Hollywood restaurant with friends and sleep-overs in and out of the White House. President Clinton sometimes joined her and her sleep-over friends for breakfast.[9]
At age four, Clinton had begun taking dance classes in Arkansas,[19] and she continued her dance training at the Washington School of Ballet for several years. In her book, It Takes a Village, Hillary wrote that Bill was disappointed when Chelsea quit softball and soccer to concentrate on ballet, but he was nonetheless supportive, regularly attending her performances.[9] She was cast in the role of the Favorite Aunt[20] in the 1993 Washington Ballet production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker.[9][21]
In early 1999, the Clintons learned of an article being planned by People that examined the First Family's relationships in the wake of scandals and the impending vote on President Clinton's impeachment. The Secret Service told the magazine that they had concerns that the story could compromise Chelsea's security. People decided to run the story anyway, and Bill and Hillary issued a statement expressing their regret and sadness. Carol Wallace, People managing editor, affirmed the magazine's sensitivity to the Clintons' concerns, but felt 19-year-old Chelsea was "an eyewitness to family drama and historical events" and thus "a valid journalistic subject". The article, entitled "Grace Under Fire", was published in February 1999 with a cover photo of Chelsea and Hillary.[22]
During the last year of her father's presidency, Chelsea assumed some White House hostess responsibilities when her mother was campaigning for the U.S. Senate, traveling with her father on several overseas trips and attending state dinners with him.[23]
Education and academic life
Stanford University
Clinton entered Stanford University in the fall of 1997 and majored in history.[24][25]
The week before she arrived on campus, her mother published an open letter in her syndicated column asking journalists to leave her daughter alone. Chelsea arrived at Stanford in a motorcade with her parents, Secret Service agents, and almost 250 journalists. For her security, bullet-proof glass was installed in her dorm windows and surveillance cameras were placed in hallways. Secret Service agents in plain clothes lived in her dorm.[26] With the exception of an occasional tabloid story written about her, Chelsea's four years at Stanford remained out of public view.[27]
Clinton obtained a B.A. degree in history, with highest honors, at Stanford in 2001.[24][27] The topic of her 167-page senior thesis was the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, advised by Jack Rakove.[27][28] At the time of Chelsea's graduation, President Clinton issued a statement saying, "Hillary and I are grateful for the friendships and great learning experiences Chelsea had at Stanford, and we are very proud of her on this special day."[29]
University of Oxford
In July 2001, President Clinton revealed that Chelsea would be pursuing a master's degree at University College of the University of Oxford later that year – the same college where he studied politics between 1968 and 1970 on a Rhodes Scholarship;[30] Chelsea did not apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. Lord Butler of Brockwell, the Master of University College, said: "Her record at Stanford shows that she is a very well-qualified and able student. The college is also pleased to extend its link with the Clinton family." Upon the recommendation of British and American advisers, the university implemented security measures,[31] and fellow students were asked not to discuss her with the press.[32]
Arriving at Oxford just after the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American students who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told Talk magazine:

Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find that I want to be around Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.[32]

Clinton was criticized for those remarks in the London press and by the newspaper Oxford Student, which angered the university by directly attacking her in an editorial. However, people who met Clinton at that time described her as charming, poised and unaffected, and she seemed to be adjusting successfully to life abroad. During her time at Oxford, Chelsea adopted a more sophisticated look, reportedly assisted by a family friend, Donatella Versace, whose couture shows she attended in early 2002. Geordie Greig, the editor of Tatler, ranked her number five on the magazine's 2002 "Top 10 Girls" list.[32]
In 2003, Clinton completed an MPhil degree in international relations at Oxford.[33] Her 132-page thesis was titled The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria: A Response to Global Threats, a Part of a Global Future, supervised by Jennifer Welsh and Ngaire Woods.[34] Following her graduation, she returned to the United States.[24]
In 2011, Clinton transferred back to University College, Oxford, from the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University to complete her DPhil degree in International Relations.[35] She stated this was to be under her preferred doctoral advisor, Ngaire Woods.[36] She finished her dissertation from New York City where she resides[37] and was awarded the degree in May 2014.[38] Her 712-page dissertation was titled The Global Fund: An Experiment in Global Governance.[39][40]
Columbia University and New York University
In the spring of 2010, Clinton completed a M.P.H. degree at the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University[41][42] and she began teaching graduate classes there in 2012.[43]
Starting in 2010, Clinton began serving as Assistant Vice-Provost for the Global Network University of New York University, working on international recruitment strategies.[37] She is the co-founder of the Of Many Institute for Multifaith Leadership at NYU and serves as its co-chair.[44] By 2010, she was also pursuing PhD coursework at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service, but later transferred back to Oxford in 2011 to complete her dissertation.[36][45]
In 2012, Clinton received an award from the Temple of Understanding for her "work in advancing a new model of integrating interfaith and cross-cultural education into campus life," together with Imam Khalid Latif and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna.[46]
Professional life
In 2003, Clinton joined the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in New York City,[24] and she went to work for Avenue Capital Group in late 2006. She served as co-chair for a fund-raising week for the Clinton Foundation, and subsequently became Vice Chair for the foundation.[38] She serves on the board of the School of American Ballet[24] and on IAC's board of directors.[47][48]
In November 2011, NBC announced that they had hired Clinton as a special correspondent. One of her roles was reporting feature stories about "Making a Difference" for NBC Nightly News and Rock Center with Brian Williams. It was a three-month contract and allowed her to concurrently continue working for the Clinton Foundation and pursue her education.[49][50] Clinton's first appearance was on the December 12, 2011, episode of Rock Center.[51] Although she received some negative critical reviews for her work, Clinton's contract with NBC was renewed in February 2012.[52][53] Rock Center ended in May 2013, and she left the network in August 2014.[54][55] Clinton reportedly earned an annual salary of $600,000 for her work at NBC.[56]
In September 2015, Clinton made her authorial debut with It's Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired and Get Going!, which was published by Philomel Books. The 400-page book is aimed at middle school students (ages 10 to 14) and introduces them to a range of social issues, encouraging them to take action to make the world a better place.[57] The Today Show gave Clinton a full segment in which to discuss the book with her former colleagues at NBC.[58] The book received mixed reviews from critics, who lauded Clinton for her effort but "lament[ed] its didactic tone".[57][59][60]
In May 2017 Clinton published her sophomore authorial work, a children's book entitled, She Persisted. Upon its release, the book became a bestseller.[61]
Chelsea Clinton's estimated net worth is USD $15,000,000.[62]
Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign
Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008




Clinton campaigning for her mother


In December 2007, Clinton began campaigning in Iowa in support of her mother's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.[63] She appeared across the country, largely on college campuses.[64][65][66] By early April 2008, she had spoken at 100 colleges on behalf of her mother's candidacy.[67]
While campaigning, Clinton answered audience questions but did not give interviews or respond to press questions,[68] including one from a nine-year-old Scholastic News reporter asking whether her father would be a good "first man".[69] She replied, "I'm sorry, I don't talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately. Even though I think you're cute."[70] Philippe Reines, her mother's press secretary, intervened when the press attempted to approach Chelsea directly.[69]
When MSNBC reporter David Shuster characterized Clinton's participation in her mother's campaign as "sort of being pimped out", the Clinton campaign objected. Shuster subsequently apologized on-air and was suspended for two weeks.[71][72]




Clinton speaking at the 2008 Democratic National Convention


The first time she was asked about her mother's handling of the Lewinsky scandal at a campaign stop Clinton responded, "I do not think that is any of your business."[67] As she became a more experienced campaigner, she refined her responses and deflected questions on the issue with comments such as, "If that's what you want to vote on, that's what you should vote on. But I think there are other people [who are] going to vote on things like healthcare and economics."[67][73]
At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Chelsea called Hillary "my hero and my mother" and introduced her with a long video tribute.[74]

Clinton Foundation

Since 2011, Clinton has taken a prominent role at the family's Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation,[75] and has had a seat on its board.[1] As part of her work, she gives paid speeches to raise money with her fees going directly to the foundation, whose goals relate to improving global health, creating opportunities for women, and promoting economic growth. A spokesperson for the foundation told The New York Times in 2014 that her speeches "are on behalf of the Clinton Foundation, and 100 percent of the fees are remitted directly to the foundation".[76][77]
Personal life
On July 31, 2010, Clinton and investment banker Marc Mezvinsky[78] were married in an interfaith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York; she is Methodist and he is Jewish.[79] Mezvinsky is the son of former members of Congress Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky, and was raised in the Conservative Jewish tradition. The senior Clintons and Mezvinskys were friends in the 1990s and their children met on a Renaissance Weekend retreat in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.[80] They first were reported to be a couple in 2005, and became engaged over Thanksgiving weekend in 2009.[78]
Following their wedding, the couple lived in New York City's Gramercy Park neighborhood for three years [79] and later purchased a condominium in the NoMad district of Manhattan for $10.5 million.[81] Their daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in September 2014,[82] and their son, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in June 2016.[83][84] Shortly after Aidan was born, the family moved to the nearby Flatiron District.[85]
As a young child, Clinton was raised in her father's Southern Baptist faith, and later attended her mother's United Methodist church.[86]
In popular culture
Clinton is portrayed in the film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, where Butt-Head flirts with her; she responds by tossing him out of a window.[87] In Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, a Disney Channel Original Movie set in the year 2049, Clinton is the President of the United States.[88][89] This joke was also made in an episode of Clarissa Explains It All.
Chelsea Clinton appeared in a Sesame Street skit with Elmo, advocating the importance of reading to young children.[90]

Chelsea Victoria Clinton (born February 27, 1980) is the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She was a special correspondent for NBC News from 2011 to 2014 and now works with the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Since 2011, she has taken on a prominent role at the foundation and has a seat on its board.[1]
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, during her father's first term as governor. She attended public schools there until he was elected President and the family moved to the White House, where she began attending the private Sidwell Friends School. She received an undergraduate degree at Stanford University and later earned master's degrees from University College, Oxford and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, and a Doctor of Philosophy in international relations from the University of Oxford in 2014. Clinton married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in 2010. They have a daughter and a son.
Clinton has worked for NBC, McKinsey & Company, Avenue Capital Group, and New York University and serves on several boards, including those of the School of American Ballet, Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, Common Sense Media, Weill Cornell Medical College and IAC/InterActiveCorp. In 2007 and 2008, Clinton campaigned extensively on American college campuses for her mother's unsuccessful Democratic presidential nomination bid and introduced her at both the 2008 and 2016 Democratic National Conventions.

Early years
Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 27, 1980. Chelsea's name was inspired by a visit to the Chelsea neighborhood of London during a Christmas 1978 vacation. Hillary said that upon hearing the 1969 Judy Collins recording of the Joni Mitchell song, "Chelsea Morning", Bill remarked, "If we ever have a daughter, her name should be Chelsea."[2][3][4]
When Chelsea was two years old, she accompanied her parents as they campaigned throughout Arkansas for her father's gubernatorial race.[2] She learned to read and write at a very young age. Chelsea claims that she started reading the newspaper by the age of three and also wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan when she was only five years old.[5] In the letter, which was photocopied and preserved by her father, she asked President Reagan not to visit a military cemetery in West Germany, where Nazi soldiers were buried.[5] Chelsea attended Forest Park Elementary School, Booker Arts and Science Magnet Elementary School and Horace Mann Junior High School, both Little Rock public schools.[6] She skipped the third grade.[7]
White House years




White House portrait of the Clintons (unknown date)


On January 20, 1993, the day of her father's first inauguration, Chelsea moved into the White House with her parents and was given the Secret Service codename "Energy".[8] The Clintons wanted their daughter to have a normal childhood, and they hoped to shield her from the media spotlight.[9]
Hillary Clinton followed the advice of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on raising children in the White House, and asked the press to limit coverage of Chelsea to her participation in public events such as state visits.[3] Margaret Truman, daughter of former president Harry S. Truman, supported the Clintons, and in March 1993 wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times about the damage that could be done if the press made Chelsea a subject of intense coverage.[10]
Journalists debated the issue of allowing Clinton to retain her privacy. Most media outlets concluded that she should be off-limits due to her age, although Rush Limbaugh[9] and Saturday Night Live both broadcast material mocking her appearance.[11] During this phase of her life, her father said, "We really work hard on making sure that Chelsea doesn't let other people define her sense of her own self-worth ... It's tough when you are an adolescent ... but I think she'll be ok."[12]
The Clintons' decision to remove Chelsea from public schooling and send her to Sidwell Friends School, a private school in Washington, D.C., drew criticism.[9] While several children of sitting presidents have attended Sidwell, the most recent prior child, Amy Carter, had gone to D.C. public schools. In a 1993 CBS This Morning town meeting, Bill defended the choice, stating that Chelsea did not like "getting a lot of publicity" and would have "more control over her destiny" at Sidwell. Bill explained that they made their decision in an effort to protect Chelsea's privacy; they did not "reject the public schools."[13] Sidwell's students and staff remained silent regarding Chelsea, declining to discuss her publicly.[9] A veteran of Model United Nations,[14] Clinton was a 1997 National Merit Scholarship semifinalist.[15] She graduated from Sidwell Friends in 1997; her father spoke at the graduation ceremony.[16]
Following Chelsea's high school graduation, media speculation regarding her choice of college resulted in heavy press coverage. She ultimately chose to attend Stanford University. During her father's eight years in office, there were 32 stories in The New York Times and 87 network news stories about Chelsea. Of all presidential children preceding her, she received the most television coverage.[17]




Clinton ringing a replica of the Liberty Bell at her father's first inauguration


Although her father is a Southern Baptist, Clinton was raised in her mother's Methodist faith.[18] She attended Foundry United Methodist Church on 16th Street, NW in Washington and met with other teens on Sunday mornings to examine questions of faith, philosophy, and issues of concern to her age group. Her parents joined her at the youth group's parent-teen round tables. An adult group leader thought Clinton to be "a terrific kid" and observed that she was treated as an equal in the group. Away from church, her social activities included visits to a Planet Hollywood restaurant with friends and sleep-overs in and out of the White House. President Clinton sometimes joined her and her sleep-over friends for breakfast.[9]
At age four, Clinton had begun taking dance classes in Arkansas,[19] and she continued her dance training at the Washington School of Ballet for several years. In her book, It Takes a Village, Hillary wrote that Bill was disappointed when Chelsea quit softball and soccer to concentrate on ballet, but he was nonetheless supportive, regularly attending her performances.[9] She was cast in the role of the Favorite Aunt[20] in the 1993 Washington Ballet production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker.[9][21]
In early 1999, the Clintons learned of an article being planned by People that examined the First Family's relationships in the wake of scandals and the impending vote on President Clinton's impeachment. The Secret Service told the magazine that they had concerns that the story could compromise Chelsea's security. People decided to run the story anyway, and Bill and Hillary issued a statement expressing their regret and sadness. Carol Wallace, People managing editor, affirmed the magazine's sensitivity to the Clintons' concerns, but felt 19-year-old Chelsea was "an eyewitness to family drama and historical events" and thus "a valid journalistic subject". The article, entitled "Grace Under Fire", was published in February 1999 with a cover photo of Chelsea and Hillary.[22]
During the last year of her father's presidency, Chelsea assumed some White House hostess responsibilities when her mother was campaigning for the U.S. Senate, traveling with her father on several overseas trips and attending state dinners with him.[23]
Education and academic life
Stanford University
Clinton entered Stanford University in the fall of 1997 and majored in history.[24][25]
The week before she arrived on campus, her mother published an open letter in her syndicated column asking journalists to leave her daughter alone. Chelsea arrived at Stanford in a motorcade with her parents, Secret Service agents, and almost 250 journalists. For her security, bullet-proof glass was installed in her dorm windows and surveillance cameras were placed in hallways. Secret Service agents in plain clothes lived in her dorm.[26] With the exception of an occasional tabloid story written about her, Chelsea's four years at Stanford remained out of public view.[27]
Clinton obtained a B.A. degree in history, with highest honors, at Stanford in 2001.[24][27] The topic of her 167-page senior thesis was the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, advised by Jack Rakove.[27][28] At the time of Chelsea's graduation, President Clinton issued a statement saying, "Hillary and I are grateful for the friendships and great learning experiences Chelsea had at Stanford, and we are very proud of her on this special day."[29]
University of Oxford
In July 2001, President Clinton revealed that Chelsea would be pursuing a master's degree at University College of the University of Oxford later that year – the same college where he studied politics between 1968 and 1970 on a Rhodes Scholarship;[30] Chelsea did not apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. Lord Butler of Brockwell, the Master of University College, said: "Her record at Stanford shows that she is a very well-qualified and able student. The college is also pleased to extend its link with the Clinton family." Upon the recommendation of British and American advisers, the university implemented security measures,[31] and fellow students were asked not to discuss her with the press.[32]
Arriving at Oxford just after the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American students who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told Talk magazine:

Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find that I want to be around Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.[32]

Clinton was criticized for those remarks in the London press and by the newspaper Oxford Student, which angered the university by directly attacking her in an editorial. However, people who met Clinton at that time described her as charming, poised and unaffected, and she seemed to be adjusting successfully to life abroad. During her time at Oxford, Chelsea adopted a more sophisticated look, reportedly assisted by a family friend, Donatella Versace, whose couture shows she attended in early 2002. Geordie Greig, the editor of Tatler, ranked her number five on the magazine's 2002 "Top 10 Girls" list.[32]
In 2003, Clinton completed an MPhil degree in international relations at Oxford.[33] Her 132-page thesis was titled The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria: A Response to Global Threats, a Part of a Global Future, supervised by Jennifer Welsh and Ngaire Woods.[34] Following her graduation, she returned to the United States.[24]
In 2011, Clinton transferred back to University College, Oxford, from the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University to complete her DPhil degree in International Relations.[35] She stated this was to be under her preferred doctoral advisor, Ngaire Woods.[36] She finished her dissertation from New York City where she resides[37] and was awarded the degree in May 2014.[38] Her 712-page dissertation was titled The Global Fund: An Experiment in Global Governance.[39][40]
Columbia University and New York University
In the spring of 2010, Clinton completed a M.P.H. degree at the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University[41][42] and she began teaching graduate classes there in 2012.[43]
Starting in 2010, Clinton began serving as Assistant Vice-Provost for the Global Network University of New York University, working on international recruitment strategies.[37] She is the co-founder of the Of Many Institute for Multifaith Leadership at NYU and serves as its co-chair.[44] By 2010, she was also pursuing PhD coursework at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service, but later transferred back to Oxford in 2011 to complete her dissertation.[36][45]
In 2012, Clinton received an award from the Temple of Understanding for her "work in advancing a new model of integrating interfaith and cross-cultural education into campus life," together with Imam Khalid Latif and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna.[46]
Professional life
In 2003, Clinton joined the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in New York City,[24] and she went to work for Avenue Capital Group in late 2006. She served as co-chair for a fund-raising week for the Clinton Foundation, and subsequently became Vice Chair for the foundation.[38] She serves on the board of the School of American Ballet[24] and on IAC's board of directors.[47][48]
In November 2011, NBC announced that they had hired Clinton as a special correspondent. One of her roles was reporting feature stories about "Making a Difference" for NBC Nightly News and Rock Center with Brian Williams. It was a three-month contract and allowed her to concurrently continue working for the Clinton Foundation and pursue her education.[49][50] Clinton's first appearance was on the December 12, 2011, episode of Rock Center.[51] Although she received some negative critical reviews for her work, Clinton's contract with NBC was renewed in February 2012.[52][53] Rock Center ended in May 2013, and she left the network in August 2014.[54][55] Clinton reportedly earned an annual salary of $600,000 for her work at NBC.[56]
In September 2015, Clinton made her authorial debut with It's Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired and Get Going!, which was published by Philomel Books. The 400-page book is aimed at middle school students (ages 10 to 14) and introduces them to a range of social issues, encouraging them to take action to make the world a better place.[57] The Today Show gave Clinton a full segment in which to discuss the book with her former colleagues at NBC.[58] The book received mixed reviews from critics, who lauded Clinton for her effort but "lament[ed] its didactic tone".[57][59][60]
In May 2017 Clinton published her sophomore authorial work, a children's book entitled, She Persisted. Upon its release, the book became a bestseller.[61]
Chelsea Clinton's estimated net worth is USD $15,000,000.[62]
Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign
Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008




Clinton campaigning for her mother


In December 2007, Clinton began campaigning in Iowa in support of her mother's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.[63] She appeared across the country, largely on college campuses.[64][65][66] By early April 2008, she had spoken at 100 colleges on behalf of her mother's candidacy.[67]
While campaigning, Clinton answered audience questions but did not give interviews or respond to press questions,[68] including one from a nine-year-old Scholastic News reporter asking whether her father would be a good "first man".[69] She replied, "I'm sorry, I don't talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately. Even though I think you're cute."[70] Philippe Reines, her mother's press secretary, intervened when the press attempted to approach Chelsea directly.[69]
When MSNBC reporter David Shuster characterized Clinton's participation in her mother's campaign as "sort of being pimped out", the Clinton campaign objected. Shuster subsequently apologized on-air and was suspended for two weeks.[71][72]




Clinton speaking at the 2008 Democratic National Convention


The first time she was asked about her mother's handling of the Lewinsky scandal at a campaign stop Clinton responded, "I do not think that is any of your business."[67] As she became a more experienced campaigner, she refined her responses and deflected questions on the issue with comments such as, "If that's what you want to vote on, that's what you should vote on. But I think there are other people [who are] going to vote on things like healthcare and economics."[67][73]
At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Chelsea called Hillary "my hero and my mother" and introduced her with a long video tribute.[74]

Clinton Foundation

Since 2011, Clinton has taken a prominent role at the family's Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation,[75] and has had a seat on its board.[1] As part of her work, she gives paid speeches to raise money with her fees going directly to the foundation, whose goals relate to improving global health, creating opportunities for women, and promoting economic growth. A spokesperson for the foundation told The New York Times in 2014 that her speeches "are on behalf of the Clinton Foundation, and 100 percent of the fees are remitted directly to the foundation".[76][77]
Personal life
On July 31, 2010, Clinton and investment banker Marc Mezvinsky[78] were married in an interfaith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York; she is Methodist and he is Jewish.[79] Mezvinsky is the son of former members of Congress Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky, and was raised in the Conservative Jewish tradition. The senior Clintons and Mezvinskys were friends in the 1990s and their children met on a Renaissance Weekend retreat in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.[80] They first were reported to be a couple in 2005, and became engaged over Thanksgiving weekend in 2009.[78]
Following their wedding, the couple lived in New York City's Gramercy Park neighborhood for three years [79] and later purchased a condominium in the NoMad district of Manhattan for $10.5 million.[81] Their daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in September 2014,[82] and their son, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in June 2016.[83][84] Shortly after Aidan was born, the family moved to the nearby Flatiron District.[85]
As a young child, Clinton was raised in her father's Southern Baptist faith, and later attended her mother's United Methodist church.[86]
In popular culture
Clinton is portrayed in the film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, where Butt-Head flirts with her; she responds by tossing him out of a window.[87] In Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, a Disney Channel Original Movie set in the year 2049, Clinton is the President of the United States.[88][89] This joke was also made in an episode of Clarissa Explains It All.
Chelsea Clinton appeared in a Sesame Street skit with Elmo, advocating the importance of reading to young children.[90]

When Chelsea Clinton became the first daughter of the United States of America, she was just a twelve-year-old from Arkansas with a full head of voluminous frizzy curls.But over the years, as Chelsea has grown up into an intelligent and elegant woman, her curls quickly began to fade, appearing more and more controlled as the years wore on, before eventually vanishing completely.Now, in a candid interview with Elle magazine, Chelsea has finally revealed just what happened to her much-loved ringlets – insisting that, far from being an intentional style change, her once-unruly mane simply straightened itself out over time.Scroll down for video   





 All grown up: In the latest issue of Elle, Chelsea Clinton finally reveals to the world just what happened to her once-curly hair 





 





Mystery solved: Chelsea's famous curls (pictured left in 1998) went from unmanageable frizz to tight ringlets, before fading into a fuller, wavier style (pictured right, in 2015)When asked by the magazine about what became of her 'pre-Raphaelite curls', Chelsea revealed: 'I don't actually have curly hair anymore.' 'My curls, in my early twenties, just fell into waves. I don't know if they got tired of me, but the curls slowly subsided, and so now it's naturally a little bit wavy but... I miss my curls.The 35-year-old daughter of Bill Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States, also talked about her marriage to investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in the new interview, as well as her role as a mother to her baby daughter Charlotte.

We've watched her grow up in the White House to become a woman who commands much commending through her fiercely intelligent and graceful character.  Chelsea Clinton may be the first daughter again and she shows off her sleek grown up look on the cover of Elle Magazine in a Gucci dress from the spring 2015 collection.
She's now a mother herself and dresses appropriately for her age in a chic little black dress.  The carefully placed cut out and luxurious fabric show off her enviable figure.  The simple slim line belt really highlights that and we love the minimalist styling.  This makes us focus on the woman in front of us.
We could see this dress being not only a workhorse item in your wardrobe that carries you from the boardroom to the bar for happy hour but a perfect date night outfit if you added a few sparkling baubles here and there.

'I'm curious if Charlotte's going to have curly hair,' she told the magazine, adding that the scrutiny on little Charlotte's locks will 'inevitably' match her own growing up.  'I should apologize to her now,' she added.Chelsea noted that seven-month-old Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, who was born on September 26, has now become the center of her and her husband's life 'in the most blessed sense'.She said: 'I now understand - this is something else that Marc and I talk about all the time - all of the enthusiastic, bombastically spectacular, wonderful things people say about their children, because we also feel and think all those things about Charlotte - that she is just the most remarkable little bubbly, perfect, chunky monkey creature ever.'






 





 





What a difference a decade makes: Chelsea in 2004 (L) and 2014 (R) showing off the naturally changing state of her locks  





 Still springy: At only 13-years-old Chelsea had already tamed most of her frizz, but rocked a tightly curled look for most of the years of her father's presidencyDespite her glamorous look in this month's Elle fashion spread, Chelsea confessed that fashion is not her forte.The former White House resident spoke of her family's relationship with designer Oscar de la Renta, who passed away in October, saying he 'was always giving me fashion advice - often in the form of just telling me what to wear, because I don't have a fashion brain'.Although shying away from making a direct comment on her mother's run for president and her own potential return to the role of first daughter, Chelsea did comment at length on the need for women in politics and gender equality in the workplace. 'We've made real progress on legal protections for women, but in no way are women at parity to men in our country in the workplace,' she explained.'And if we look in the political sphere, it is challenging to me that women comprising 20 percent of Congress is treated as a real success. Since when did 20 percent become the definition of equality?'And so when you ask about the importance of having a woman president, absolutely it's important, for, yes, symbolic reasons—symbols are important; it is important who and what we choose to elevate, and to celebrate.'

Hillary Clinton Fan Gets Tattoos of Chelsea Clinton | Time.comNewsfeedSearchSearchSign InSpainA Commuter Train Accident in Barcelona Has Injured About 50 PeoplePakistanPakistan's Top Court Disqualifies Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif From OfficeCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDCongressThree Republicans Just Derailed the Senate Health Care BillLarry Marano—Getty ImagesBizarreThis Guy Who Got Hillary Clinton Chelsea Clinton Tattoos Wants One of Bill NowCady LangMay 04, 2017Hillary Rodham Clinton has some famous fans like Katy Perry, who not only campaigned for her during the 2016 election, but went so far as to dress up as the Secretary of State for Halloween. However, there's one superfan of the Democrat who makes all other Clinton supporters pale in comparison — Justin Smith, a 34-year-old man from South Carolina who loves Hillary so much, he got her noble visage tattooed on his leg and and even got a portrait of daughter Chelsea Clinton tattooed on his arm for good measure.In an interview with Vice, Smith revealed that he's been a supporter of the Clinton family since he was ten years old, before Bill Clinton even took office, saying that he "saw at a young age that they care deeply about human rights," which hit close to home as he identifies as bisexual. He's had the chance to show off his ink of HRC to both Chelsea and Hillary, who he said apparently "absolutely loved" the tatt.Smith also shared that he thinks his tattoo of Chelsea Clinton "might be the only Chelsea tattoo in existence" and that he hopes to get a Bill tattoo to complete his Clinton family body art portraiture.See Smith's Clinton tattoos below.My new @HillaryClinton tattoo! #MyHero #Hillary2016 #ImWithHer @HillaryforSC pic.twitter.com/Jj7lWYAf1M- Justin Smith (@SternFanJustin) January 16, 2016My new #ChelseaClinton tattoo is healing up nicely. @ChelseaClinton pic.twitter.com/uKkrrWubmy- Justin Smith (@SternFanJustin) April 25, 2017Had the amazing honor of meeting one of my heroes, @ChelseaClinton.

Personal Quote:
[on the badly-injured 15 year-old Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai] The Taliban almost made Malala a martyr. They succeeded in making her a symbol. The memoir she is writing to raise awareness about the 61 million children around the world who are not in school indicates she accepts that unasked-for responsibility as a synonym for courage and a champion for girls everywhere.

Chelsea Mourning
Chelsea Clinton landed a lucrative job at NBC after graduating college, but her salary wasn't $900,000, and she wasn't working for her parents.














            14K        












  

CLAIM

    Chelsea Clinton was paid $900,000 to work for her parents after she finished college.            See Example(s)



EXAMPLES
Collected via e-mail, July 2016


Rumor going around that Chelsea Clinton was paid $900,000 to work for her parents right out of college. Is this true?









FALSE




RATING


FALSE

ORIGIN
Shortly after Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, completed her Master’s degree at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health in 2010, she landed a rather lucrative job.  However, that job didn’t pay her $900,000 per year, nor did it involve working for her parents, as was widely claimed online.
Chelsea Clinton was hired by NBC News as a special correspondent in 2011. She was reportedly paid $600,000 a year by the network until 2014, when she switched from an annual salary to a month-to-month contract due to the possibility of her mother’s running for president:
Chelsea Clinton earned an annual salary of $600,000 at NBC News before switching to a month-to-month contract earlier this year, sources with knowledge of the agreement [said].
Clinton, who joined NBC News as a special correspondent in November 2011, was up for renewal or nonrenewal this year. Instead, the sources said, the network decided to keep her on the payroll on a month-to-month basis so the two parties could sever ties if Clinton’s mother, Hillary Clinton, runs for president.
Chelsea Clinton announced in August 2014, a month before the birth of her first child, that she would be leaving NBC to focus on philanthropic work at the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. 
NBC News likely awarded Chelsea Clinton such a hefty contract in part due to her name recognition, but she also came to the position with an impressive résumé: a B.A. in History from Stanford University, a Master of Public Health degree from Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health, and a DPhil degree in International Relations from Oxford University, in addition to job stints with the consulting firm McKinsey & Company and Avenue Capital Group.
Moreover, her position with the network did not involve “working for her parents,” and her hiring was not out of the ordinary. In 2009 Jenna Bush, the daughter of former President George W. Bush,  was also hired by NBC as a news correspondent on Today, and Senator John McCain’s daughter, Megan McCain, has held numerous positions at MSNBC, Pivot, and Fox News.
The discrepancy between the size of Chelsea Clinton’s actual contract with NBC ($600,000) and the amount commonly reported as her salary ($900,000), as well as the misperception that Chelsea was “working for her parents,” likely stemmed from conflation involving Clinton’s pay for her other positions as Vice Chair of the “Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation ($0) and as a board member of IAC/Interactive Corp ($300,000):
In addition to her gig at NBC, Chelsea also serves Vice Chair of the recently renamed “Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation,” where she was “a major force in steering her parents’ charitable work” in the final years of her mother’s time at the State Department.
Chelsea also benefits from a job as a board member for Barry Diller’s IAC/InteractiveCorp. Salary for Chelsea: $300,000. The board position also pays an annual retainer of $50,000 and a $250,000 grant of restricted stock.
Although Chelsea Clinton’s connections may have helped her land a role at IAC, her parents do not make the hiring decisions for that Internet media holding company:
Paul Lapides, head of the Corporate Governance Center at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, says those connections may have helped her. “There’s no question that she knows a lot of people,” he said.
“Ms. Clinton is a keenly intelligent, insightful and inspirational young woman with experience in consulting and public policy,” a spokeswoman for IAC said.

Personal Quote:
[on the badly-injured 15 year-old Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai] The Taliban almost made Malala a martyr. They succeeded in making her a symbol. The memoir she is writing to raise awareness about the 61 million children around the world who are not in school indicates she accepts that unasked-for responsibility as a synonym for courage and a champion for girls everywhere.

About Chelsea Clinton


Chelsea Victoria Clinton was born on February 27, 1980 in Little Rock, Arkansas and is the daughter of former US President Bill Clinton and US Senator Hillary Clinton. Bill and Hillary named their daughter after a Judy Collin's recording of the Joni Mitchell song “Chelsea Morning”.
While living in Arkansas, Chelsea had a somewhat typical childhood attending Forest Park Elementary School, Booker Arts Magnet Elementary School, and Horace Mann Junior High School.
Chelsea moved to the White House when her father was elected president and inaugurated on January 20, 1993 at the age of 12. While living at the White House, Chelsea attended Sidwell Friends School. She enjoyed being a part of the varsity soccer team.
Chelsea had taken some ballet classes beginning at the age of four and at the Washington School of Ballet in 1993. In the Washington Ballet's production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker in 1996, Chelsea played the part of the Favorite Aunt. In 1997, she was a finalist for the National Merit Scholarship.
As with any person living in the public eye, media poked fun at the teenager of the President of United States. On the other hand, the Clintons did their best to keep their daughter tagged “off limits”. However, of course, this was pretty much impossible. A few that did make crude remarks include Julia Sweeney did an impersonation of Chelsea, Rush Limbaugh made crude remarks, Jess Oxfeld was fired from Stanford University in 1997 for writing an article about Chelsea, Senator John McCain ridiculed Chelsea with an off color joke, and The National Review author John Derbyshire wrote a column attacking Chelsea. These are just a few of the media attempts to attack or humiliate a young teenager living in the White House.
Chelsea must have taken all the media with a grain of salt as after the presidency she turned down Brown, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale and went to Stanford University. During her first two years at Stanford, her major was chemistry, which she changed to history beginning of her third year. She graduated from Stanford in 2001 with an undergraduate thesis on the 1998 Northern Ireland peace agreement. After this, Chelsea went to University College, Oxford where she earned a Master's Degree in international relations.
Chelsea went to work at McKinsey & Company in New York City in 2003. She was the youngest person hired in her class and was earning a low six figure salary.
In 2006, she went to work of Avenue Capital, which is a hedge fund, ran by Marc Lasry. At this time, she is still working at Avenue Capital. Avenue Capital employees have contributed over $30,000 to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.
Today, you may get a glimpse of Chelsea around New York with her boy Marc Mezvinsky. Marc is an investment banker and the son of former Democratic Representative Ed Mezvinsky of Iowa. Chelsea has known Marc since they were both teenagers in Washington DC.
Whether Chelsea will be seen on the democratic trail along with her mother's campaign is not known. She will more than likely support her mother's campaign by at least tagging along; however, she may or may not do any public speaking.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Now she’s finally carving out her own identity–by joining the family business.
By Danielle Sackslong ReadOnce upon a time, Chelsea Clinton was a little girl from Arkansas.advertisementAnd deep down, she still is. Despite her White House–Stanford-Oxford-Columbia-McKinsey–hedge-fund grooming, she’s still got a thing for poultry. “Fried chicken is my husband’s favorite food,” she divulges in her new office at the Clinton Foundation, a midtown Manhattan space outfitted with thick mahogany desks and an inordinate amount of beige that’s brightened ever so slightly by Chelsea’s surprisingly casual look–gray suede ankle boots and jeans. The first time her then-boyfriend, now-husband, Marc Mezvinsky, visited Little Rock, she whisked him off to Bojangles, her favorite childhood fried-chicken hole. In New York, she explains, he’ll now indiscriminately “gorge himself on fried chicken” anywhere from Popeyes on 14th Street to the more refined Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken in the East Village. Chelsea insists she would get in on the grease too, were it not for an allergy to gluten. “I was a vegetarian for 10 years and a pescatarian for eight. Then I woke up one day when I was 29 and craved red meat,” says Chelsea, now 34, and a self-described omnivore. “I’m a big believer in listening to my body’s cravings.”Of course, there was another Clinton who believed in listening to his body’s cravings; and the sad fact that such a harmless statement could call to mind a national embarrassment perfectly illustrates the dilemma facing the scion of one former president and one potential contender. For years, the world has been wondering what Chelsea would do someday, wondering especially if she would do things like, and with, her family. “One of my earliest childhood memories is being three years old and on the campaign trail with my dad,” says Chelsea, who was born when her father was governor of Arkansas. That day, a woman approached her and asked, “‘Do you want to grow up and be governor one day too?’ And I looked at her and said, ‘No, I’m 3. I’m just waving the flag. That is my job right now.’ Flag-waving extraordinaire.”“It is frustrating,” says Chelsea, “because who wants to grow up and follow their parents? … It’s funny to realize I feel called to this work as a daughter–proudly as a daughter.”For a decade after graduating from Stanford in 2001, Chelsea experimented with the world beyond the Clinton machine. In peripatetic bursts, she tried out international relations, then management consulting, then Wall Street, then a PhD. She even signed on for (an embarrassingly lightweight) gig as an NBC News “special correspondent.” Chelsea rationalizes this career promiscuity as a hallmark of being just another millennial, experimenting liberally until she figures out her professional purpose. But, of course, she’s not just another millennial. She’s political royalty. And now, finally, she has decided to join the Clinton family business. As vice chair of the recently rebranded Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, she is helping one of the world’s most notable philanthropies grow up.
At the Democratic National Convention in 1992Globe Photos, Zuma PressAs with all things Clinton, it is anything but a simple, straightforward task. Reflecting her father’s famously scattered genius, the foundation has grown chaotically. Recently, it has been criticized scathingly by the New York Times and the New Republic for past bureaucratic ineptitude, and worse. It’s clear that Chelsea’s power within the organization, and in relation to its many and various power players, is a matter of some debate. But by applying all that she’s learned from her decade of job-hopping, Chelsea just may bring order to the organization. She’s been there three years and has a solid record. And her plans for its future are deeply ambitious.advertisement“It is frustrating, because who wants to grow up and follow their parents?” admits Chelsea. “I’ve tried really hard to care about things that were very different from my parents. I was curious if I could care about [money] on some fundamental level, and I couldn’t. That wasn’t the metric of success that I wanted in my life. I’ve talked about this to my friends who are doctors and whose parents are doctors, or who are lawyers and their parents are lawyers. It’s a funny thing to realize I feel called to this work both as a daughter–proudly as a daughter–and also as someone who believes that I have contributions to make.”Working in any family business is complicated. Working in this one is something else altogether. But opting in may turn out to be the best decision Chelsea Clinton has ever made.Enrolling in Stanford University back in 1997 was Chelsea’s first attempt to cut the umbilical cord connecting her to the family tradition of public life. Far from the Beltway, she found herself surrounded by people who used technology rather than politics to solve problems. It was the height of the first tech boom, and her new friends were dropping out of school to start or join startups (including Mezvinsky, who was also at Stanford, also the child of politicians, and then just a good friend; he now runs his own hedge fund). “This was all just beginning. That moment of being in Silicon Valley, it helped shape all of us,” says Anne Hubert, a close friend from Chelsea’s freshman year who now works as SVP of Viacom’s Scratch consultancy. Chelsea, who considered premed but majored in history, wasn’t drawn to the entrepreneurial life, but she did discover that she was “a person who wanted to fix, improve, expand things.”After graduating in 2001, Chelsea had no clear plan for how she could apply that inclination. She attended Oxford University in England, where she got her master’s in international relations. One day, she says, “I woke up and thought, Wow, I love this. Do I want to do a PhD? And then I realized, I’m going to be 27 and know a whole lot about one thing. So I did what everyone I knew was doing when they didn’t know what the right professional answer was for them and applied to different consulting firms. I thought that might help sort out if I wanted to have a professional track in health and public health, or an academic track, or something else altogether.”Chelsea spent three years at McKinsey, working in its public health practice before rising up the ranks to become a team manager in its financial services and technology practice. Then the doubts encroached again. “Was I going to continue to work a hundred hours a week and invest time there and energy to remain on the partner track?” she says. “Or was I going to go do something else?” “Something else” was working as a chemical-industry analyst at a hedge fund called Avenue Capital Group. As with every new job during these years, Chelsea had to make people forget her heritage. She explains that her method of debunking assumptions is pretty simple: She behaves as the overachiever that she has always been. “I will just always work harder [than anybody else] and hopefully perform better. And hopefully, over time, I preempt and erase whatever expectations people have of me not having a good work ethic, or not being smart, or not being motivated.”But ultimately, she was becoming more frayed than focused. She took a leave of absence from Avenue to work on Hillary’s 2008 campaign. After returning to her Wall Street job, she decided to also get her master’s in public health at Columbia, which entailed night and weekend classes. It was a grueling schedule. While she enjoyed being in the same industry as Mezvinsky–“We both built lots of Excel models and can talk about pivot tables together. We geek out a lot,” she says–the couple had little downtime. Chelsea left Avenue to finish her master’s and got a job as an assistant vice provost at NYU.advertisementSurprisingly, it took Chelsea and Marc’s 2010 wedding to put an end to the meandering. According to Bari Lurie, Chelsea’s chief of staff, the heretofore private Chelsea was caught off guard by the level of attention paid to the event. “It was abundantly clear there was this pent-up interest in her, and she couldn’t understand why,” says Lurie. When she had campaigned for her mom in 2008–400 events in 40 states–Chelsea had first experienced the impact her voice could have in a public setting. As Lurie explains it, “It was, ‘Gosh, everywhere I go it seems like there’s this interest in me. How can I displace some of that; how can I use that interest to help push forward issues I care about?’ ” Over the years, Chelsea had turned to her grandmother many times for advice. Hillary’s mother had a favorite phrase–“to whom much is given, much is expected”–that continually tugged at Chelsea. The bottom line, says Lurie, is that there was a platform waiting for her, if she could only figure out how and when to use it: “She quickly realized, ‘There is nothing I’m doing now that’s satiating this interest. This doing-nothing thing: I’ve tried it, and it didn’t work.’ ”Chelsea’s To-Do ListPart data geek, part dynasty daughter, part celebrity, Chelsea’s found a way to thrive both within and without the family business.

The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation is not a foundation. Unlike the Gates or Rockefeller foundations, which function as trusts managing the disposal of the families’ wealth, the Clinton’s organization is actually a charity that must raise money from others in order to do work on the ground. This is just the beginning of the confusing nature of this philanthropic bureaucracy. The group has eight CEOs. One, Eric Braverman, is CEO of the whole enterprise, which is in some ways an umbrella organization for nine separate “initiatives” and two “entities.” In fact, they are divisions, each with its own leader, that focus philanthropy on a range of causes, including global warming (the Clinton Climate Initiative), food and health care for poverty-stricken Africans (the Clinton Development Initiative), sustainable small businesses (the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership), infant and toddler health (Too Small to Fail), and rebuilding the Haitian economy and infrastructure (the Clinton Foundation in Haiti). The glue that has held this together is President Clinton, who created the charity in 1997 (its first task was to raise funds for his presidential library) and who now presides over the annual three-day gathering of his pet project, the Clinton Global Initiative, in midtown Manhattan. The conference, which shuts down traffic as thoroughly as the General Assembly of the United Nations because it features equally noteworthy speakers from around the globe, brings together CGI members, who pay a $20,000 yearly membership fee to get a seat at the table with other corporations, NGOs, not-for-profits, and governments that want to partner and commit to solving specific global problems.CGI is a creature that only a character like Bill Clinton could create. With conferences and events around the year, it is his perpetual cocktail party, his Rolodex brought to vivid, brilliant life. “CGI combines all the things that the press and all of us love: money, celebrity, and doing good,” says Brad Smith, president of the Foundation Center, a non-for-profit information source on philanthropy. Put another way, says one Democratic consultant, “He gets the CEO of Coca-Cola in the room and says, ‘You can help distribute medicine in Tanzania.’ Everybody does it because everyone does what Bill Clinton says. It’s like he has this magic wand.” It is a unique construction designed to generate real good: CGI has helped create $103 billion of pledges to 2,800 philanthropic projects around the globe.
At CGI events, the locus of power is constantly shifting between Chelsea and her parents.Photograph by Melissa GoldenEnter Chelsea. When she arrived in 2011, she knew her primary role was to apply the data-driven skills she had developed in her other jobs to an organization that had long outgrown its startuplike infrastructure. “My father has always been such a doer. He had never focused on ensuring that we had the functions that not only enabled [other] doers to focus on doing, but also to help us keep systematic track of all the work that was being done,” she says. The foundation had more than 2,000 employees in 36 countries, but its back-office support had fallen behind. There was little collaboration between initiatives. Employees were focused on the work, but there was no unified system to report, measure, or assess the impact. There wasn’t even a comprehensive database that housed the hundreds of projects the foundation was working on.Furthermore, according to lengthy articles in The New York Times and The New Republic, there was considerable internal strife. The stories paint a picture of an organization mismanaged by old Clinton insiders, including the president’s longtime adviser, Doug Band, who allegedly had been exploiting his access to the former president, causing conflict-of-interest issues within CGI. (Band is no longer at the foundation; after the article came out, President Clinton told CBS This Morning that he is “very grateful” for all the fundraising Band had done for the foundation.)advertisementUnderstandably, this isn’t a past anyone at the foundation really wants to discuss. CGI CEO and former Goldman Sachs investment banker Bob Harrison denies outright that there were ever any issues. “I don’t think there’s ever been organizational chaos in my experience at CGI,” he snapped defensively when I asked him about the stories, telling me also that, “She [Chelsea] has not impacted the organization of CGI. And CGI has not, in my experience, been in any state of disarray.” And when I ask Chelsea herself to give me an assessment of the state of the foundation when she arrived, the former McKinsey consultant fails to mention any of these problems, and she doesn’t bring up the audit she and her father commissioned that year to analyze the foundation’s health until I explicitly ask her about it. She is her parents’ daughter, after all; during interviews, her crystal-clear thinking is accompanied by a healthy bit of deft stonewalling.But when you look closely, you find myriad ways Chelsea has been reorganizing this foundation that supposedly has never been in “disarray.” Of the three Clintons, she is the one who’s most hands-on. (She is also the only one whom staffers actually address by name; Bill and Hillary are “the President” and “the Secretary.”) Bill spends much of his time traveling around the globe, collecting checks from speeches at a rate as high as $11,000 per minute. Hillary, who has used the foundation as a refuge since her resignation as Secretary of State, will presumably be on the road again, working to get into the White House. So the onus is on Chelsea to help shift the foundation from a star-powered charity into a sophisticated, data-driven, sustainable organization that can thrive for decades to come. “You can’t measure everything,” says Chelsea, “but you can measure almost everything through quantitative or qualitative means, so that we know what we’re disproportionately good at. And, candidly, what we’re not so good at, so we can stop doing that and double down on what we’re particularly disproportionately good at.”Slowly, she is turning the Clinton Foundation into a more entrepreneurial enterprise. “Many of the initiatives of the foundation were in silos,” says CGI’s deputy director, Ed Hughes. “The president was happy to see each succeed on its own, but he did not necessarily appreciate them as a more comprehensive connection of opportunities.” When Chelsea arrived, some CGI employees worked out of the president’s office in Harlem, others operated out of midtown, and the rest were headquartered in downtown Manhattan. To incite collaboration, Chelsea insisted on a consolidation, which occurred last year, bringing all three offices into one midtown location. This January, Chelsea created a new position that sits across all nine initiatives. Julie Guariglia, the new-initiative liaison, compiles lengthy biweekly reports that alert workers at all the divisions of potential overlap, and suggests possible connections between initiatives. In the works is a database that will finally give employees access to data on all of the foundation’s activities. “Chelsea’s brought a willingness to invest in the product,” says Hughes. “I think she’s recognized–maybe it’s her background in management consulting–you need to spend money to make money.”Chelsea is also reshaping the way the foundation chooses the issues it wants to attack. “Sometimes President Clinton simply would come in and say, ‘You know, I had a great conversation with the King of Jordan. We should do something about Jordan.’ And it would be like, Well, now we’ll make Jordan a priority,” explains Hughes. Chelsea, on the other hand, “wants to see some evidence of why we’re making decisions, as opposed to the anecdotes,” adds Hughes. Chelsea especially wants the foundation to address concerns that have, in her words, “existed too long in the shadows, that historically have made people uncomfortable.” Two projects: ensuring that the juvenile justice system offers healthy food and combatting childhood diarrhea.Trying to give causes like these a new prominence is where Chelsea’s celebrity and political heritage are strategic weapons. Within the foundation, she has steered the Alliance for a Healthier Generation (a partnership with the American Heart Association) to train juvenile detention facilities to collectively bargain for healthier food. But the foundation can’t drive this alone, so she’s also pushing for national standards. According to Chelsea, the week before our second interview, “I did a foundation fundraiser in Connecticut and Senator Blumenthal came. I beelined for him, because he’s on the Judiciary Committee,” she admits. “He’s really interested in prison reform.”
CGI’s Bob Harrison, right, is one of eight CEOs at the Clinton Foundation. “CGI has not been in any state of disarray,” he says.Photograph by Melissa GoldenIn 2011, Chelsea pushed the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which had historically focused on driving down the prices of HIV and AIDS vaccines, to do the same for Zinc/ORS, the leading treatment for diarrhea, which is the second-leading killer of children under 5 years old in the developing world. One of the first countries it targeted was Nigeria, but negotiating with the government, NGOs, public-sector organizations, pharma companies, and others threatened to endlessly delay the effort. According to Guariglia, the team asked Chelsea if she “could facilitate it–get the right players at the table, get them to commit to this program.” After a couple of weeks of intense preparation, Chelsea traveled to Nigeria and “went around to every partner, knew exactly what we needed from them, pledged her support and belief in this program, and got them to commit,” says Guariglia. Her academic work (she’s finishing her PhD in global health governance) armed her with the ability to talk about the issues, and she was able to get each player to understand how their role was important in the bigger picture. “Without her, it would have taken months of meetings,” says Guariglia. Prices of Zinc/ORS have been cut by 40% to 60% in Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda.advertisement“Celebrate those who have the courage to be second,” says Chelsea, “because I do think that often there is this claustrophobic pressure to innovate.”Chelsea’s most significant impact on the foundation’s long-term credibility is through the work she has done on her father’s signature initiative, CGI. She is trying to bring in younger members, hoping to “democratize” its commitments through a more sophisticated online platform, and doing everything she can to ensure that CGI can measure its actual impact. When the organization was created in 2005, it was highly forgiving of its members. Almost half are corporations, which regularly lap up tons of press with headline-grabbing declarations and are rarely held accountable on the other end. “The idea was that we were going to be a platform that allows a thousand flowers to bloom, without judgment,” says CGI’s Hughes. “We basically celebrated the effort, if not the achievement.” But when Chelsea arrived, she started asking questions about the actual results. So now the entire organization is undergoing an impact audit of its 2,800 commitments. The results so far, according to CGI CEO Harrison, suggest that in the organization’s first decade, 800 commitments have been completed. “But,” he adds, “then there are the 1,600 that are in the category of ongoing. Not every one of those we have a high level of confidence in where they stand.” Those deemed failures would be removed from the portfolio, albeit with no real consequence or public shaming (“We’re not a law-enforcement organization,” says Harrison). Nevertheless, says Hughes, “it is very clear that, at whatever point the book on CGI is written, it will need to reference whether what people got up and said they were going to do actually happened, and whether it made a difference.”This impact audit is part of a larger effort to transform CGI into a smart, accountable, and sustainable support system for philanthropic disrupters around the world. CGI now has 70 working sessions a year, where members and potential members can meet, brainstorm, and come up with ways to collaborate. The data-gathering exercise will help CGI learn what works best, so it can help members shape more effective commitments in the future. So far, CGI has learned that commitments are more successful when there’s a three- to five-year goal that is made by a group of organizations together, versus a single one. That’s the kind of learning that excites a data geek like Chelsea. She wants to see more groups make commitments that build on proven success, versus always feeling like they need to blaze a new trail. “Celebrate those who have the courage to be second,” says Chelsea, “because I do think that often there really is this claustrophobic pressure to innovate instead of to adapt.”On a blindingly snowy morning in Febru­ary, Chelsea Clinton takes the stage of a packed NYU auditorium along with the women married to the world’s two most powerful Bills. Melinda Gates and Hillary Clinton–along with Chelsea–are there to announce No Ceilings, a new collaboration between the Clinton Foundation and the Gates Foundation that will use data to analyze the progress of women and girls globally. While the three chairs onstage are intended to appear egalitarian, it quickly becomes apparent that here, Chelsea will function as a glorified Vanna White. She politely tees up questions for the two and melts into the backdrop when her mother cuts her off.

She’s always been “a person who wanted to fix, improve, expand things.”Photograph by Melissa GoldenIt’s a sharp contrast to her appearance one week later at CGI’s annual winter meeting. In front of several hundred people, she displays all the earmarks of a natural leader: command of the subject matter, passion that feels authentic, and off-the-cuff comments spliced in with academic favorites such as gestalt and milieu. She even displays an edgy wit during a Q&A session she shares with Harrison, who mentions that in Bill’s Harlem office he drank purified water from one of CGI’s developing-world commitments and jokes, “I’m alive today.” Chelsea, as if compensating for an embarrassing uncle, chides: “You’re more than alive, thankfully.”advertisementThe more her handlers try to ensure a narrative that Chelsea is her own person, the more they remind you that she is also part of a machine.This day is clearly Chelsea’s operation. That is, it’s clear until an hour later, when, halfway through a discussion she’s leading on elephant poaching, the conference room doors open, two Secret Service men appear, and Chelsea’s father attempts to slip in quietly. By the time the former president sits down at the table, reaching for a cookie and a Diet Coke, the gravity in the room has shifted. The ebb and flow of power changes depending on which and how many Clintons are in a particular space at any given moment.There was a time when Hillary was defined by her husband. Chelsea’s challenge is to work within a Clinton enterprise without being solely defined by her parents. The Clinton machine makes this a particularly daunting task. Chelsea is as forward-thinking and open-minded as any Silicon Valley entrepreneur of her generation, but none of those folks is surrounded by the suffocating retinue that envelopes her public life. Chelsea’s handlers are likely auditioning for White House gigs, should Hillary become president, and they bring to their current jobs all the paranoia that may serve them well in Washington. One repeatedly urges Chelsea not to change her facial expression during the cover shoot for this issue, standing so close that it’s a miracle the staffer’s mug isn’t on the cover alongside Chelsea’s. Another sits in on her interviews holding an iPhone like a stopwatch (“you have two minutes”), whisks her away when she’s in the middle of answering one final question, and scolds this journalist for even mentioning Doug Band’s name in Chelsea’s presence. It’s all an odd, occasionally funny blend of control and confusion. Their four-page press release pointing to Chelsea’s impact at the foundation only obfuscates her true accomplishments by mentioning such ephemera as visiting rural Myanmar “where she delivered the six-billionth liter of clean water to a family” or “a Starkey Hearing Foundation event in Uganda, where Chelsea helped fit patients for hearing aids.” One handler explains that “CGI America is the project Chelsea’s least involved in,” while another insists that the division’s upcoming June conference is really Chelsea’s coming-out party.The more they try to ensure a narrative that Chelsea is her own person, the more they remind you that she is also part of a machine. Perhaps this is the way of Washington, but it’s not the way of the entrepreneurial culture she supposedly is embracing. “We see it as different things–the foundation, CGI, running for office, Hillary’s book, these trips,” says a Democratic consultant. “It’s all one thing. It’s all the family. Capital T, capital F.”The Family will almost surely call on Chelsea for a favor in 2016, assuming Hillary does again run for the presidency. In the 2008 campaign, Chelsea’s smart, lively, and engaged appearances helped younger voters feel connected to her then-60-year-old mother. Amie Parnes, coauthor of the recent New York Times best seller HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton, is convinced Chelsea will take an even more formal role in her mother’s next run. “I can see her being a senior adviser,” she says. “You can see it already; she and her mom are working on these issues together–elephant poaching, women and girls. Something her mom learned last time was that there was arrogance at the top. She wasn’t hearing the truth from people, and Chelsea will give her the truth.”advertisementThe lines are blurring even now, as her profile grows bigger. In March, she visited Jimmy Fallon’s Tonight Show, the web series Mondays With Marlo [Thomas], and South by Southwest (not exactly her typical academic or humanitarian backdrop), where she told an audience of 3,000 about how technology can be used for social change. Sure, the SXSW speech could further Chelsea’s goal of winning over developers who can create quick and cheap apps in service of the foundation’s efforts in the developing world. But it also doesn’t hurt that she is starting to connect to the young technology-friendly voters Hillary lost to Obama the last time around. Assuming Chelsea gets very active in Hillary 2016, her presence at the foundation will have to go to the back burner. In addition to the all-encompassing nature of a campaign, under tax and election-campaign laws, a charity like the Clinton Foundation is prohibited from being involved in campaigning. So, explains Leslie Lenkowsky, professor of practice in public affairs and philanthropy at Indiana University, if Chelsea were traveling on behalf of the foundation and made a pit stop to give a Hillary campaign speech, “not one drop of money from the foundation can make its way to her campaign, not even a Xerox or cup of coffee. It becomes very, very tricky.”Where this might lead after 2016 is already a matter of much anticipation. Burberry CEO Christopher Bailey, a close friend of Chelsea’s, says, “I’m sure the foundation will always be part of her life, but I don’t know if it will be the only part of her life. I certainly do not think she’s come to the conclusion that this is it.” HRC‘s Parnes predicts Chelsea will ultimately end up in politics. “I could see her running for Congress in New York in 10 years,” she says. “She has the Clinton name, she has the chops, and she’s really smart and savvy. Nothing will hold her back.” In that scenario, you could look at the Clinton Foundation in Manhattan (where Chelsea lives with Mezvinsky in a $10 million apartment) as the perfect perch for Chelsea to prove her command of a wide range of vital global issues. Politics is inextricably in the fabric of her being, in her bloodline and her breeding. “People [were] always asking me [since I was a kid], ‘Do you want to go into politics?’ ” she tells me, her long, bony fingers and rounded features reminiscent of her father’s. “And for so long the answer was just a visceral no. Not because I had made any conscientious, deliberate decision, but since people had been asking for as long as literally I could remember, it was no.”
Photograph by Peter Hapak“People were always asking me, ‘Do you want to go into politics?’ ” says Chelsea. “For so long the answer was just a visceral no.”It’s less visceral now. As Chelsea told Fast Company at SXSW, she’s now willing to leave the door open a crack. “I live in a city and a state and a country where I support my elected representatives. If at some point that weren’t the case, and I didn’t support my mayor or my city councilwoman or my congresswoman or either of my senators–and I’m lucky to live in a state where I have lots of women representing me, you know–maybe then I’d have to ask and answer the question for myself, and come to a different answer.”This is a person who will have a significant impact on the society around us, whether she operates within or outside of politics. Chelsea characterizes her career before the foundation as something like an act of rebellion. She’s grown up, and in her mid-thirties seems to have grown comfortable with her dual role as Clinton scion and self-defining adult. It’s an accommodation almost all of us make at some point.advertisementDuring one of our interviews, Chelsea tells me the story of her discovery of coffee, which she, like many a millennial, deems a signature life event. Back in 1996, when Chelsea was a high school junior and her father was in his first term in the White House, a Starbucks opened near the ballet school she attended for a couple of hours every afternoon. One day she walked in with a friend, and, she recalls, “I just had one of those moments where I was like, How have I not had coffee before in my life? I love the way it tastes, I love the smell, I love the ambience.”“Were your parents coffee drinkers?” I ask.“My dad had always been a big decaf coffee drinker. But my mom had always been more of a tea drinker. So I grew up around a lot of tea. And I also really love tea. But I’m not one of those people who has ever felt the need to choose between coffee and tea. I think that is a completely false dichotomy.” It’s not the only one.advertisementRelated StoriesIdeasCRISPR Pioneer Jennifer Doudna On Gene Editing’s Potential For Good And EvilIdeasThe Ethics Of CRISPRMagazineThe CEO Of Flywheel Sports Wants You To Celebrate Your FailuresadvertisementVideoIdeasIdeasThis Dam Has Been A Disaster–Can Turning It Into a Solar Plant Save It?IdeasAutomated Buses Are Here, Now We Have To Decide How They Will Reshape Our CitiesIdeasHow Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Sequel” Plans To Convert Viewers Into ActivistsEntertainmentEntertainmentKesha Goes Back Into Old Home Movies In New Anti-Nostalgic Music VideoEntertainmentPanorama Is Around The Corner: This Week In MusicEntertainmentAngelina Jolie’s Casting Strategy Is Either Meaningful Or ExploitativeCo.DesignProductOMG!

Chelsea Clinton earned her net worth through her career at the consulting firm of McKinsey & Company, as well as Avenue Capital Group and she is also on the board of the School for American Ballet. She was born in Little Rock, Arkansas on February 27, 1980 during her father's first term as Governor. She attended public schools there until he was elected President and the family moved to Washington, DC; she then started attending the private school, Sidwell Friends School. She received her undergraduate degree from Stanford University and master's degrees from both Oxford University and Columbia University; she is currently pursing a PhD from the University of Oxford. Throughout her professional career, Clinton has worked for McKinsey & Company, Avenue Capital Group, and New York University and has also served on several boards for high-profile organizations. In 2010, Clinton married Marc Mezvinsky. The Clintons and the Mezvinsky family were friends in the 1990s and their children met on a weekend Democratic political retreat in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. The couple became engaged over Thanksgiving weekend in 2009 and after the honeymoon, they settled in New York City's Gramercy Park neighborhood. They were married in an interfaith ceremony (Mezvinsky is Jewish and Clinton is Methodist) in Rhinebeck, New York and the wedding was held at Astor Courts, an estate overlooking the Hudson River, at the home of Kathleen Hammer, who was once a producer at Oxygen Media. In March of 2013 they purchased a $10.5 million condominium on Madison Square Park in the Flatiron District of Manhattan.
