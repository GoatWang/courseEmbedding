A Flawless Performance Is Needed To Justify PacWest Bancorp's Current Valuation - PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) | Seeking Alpha

Profit FanValueA Flawless Performance Is Needed To Justify PacWest Bancorp's Current Valuation PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) has been an interesting name to follow. And more importantly, a profitable play for long-term shareholders. I first passed on PACW in October 2015, when I concluded my analysis by saying, "I'm holding out for a cheaper entry point. Earnings are going to grow, and I think there is upside hidden in the financials that most investors haven't factored in - because shares haven't moved during a time when the bank has gotten stronger, bigger, and is now paying a larger dividend (doubled last year). With that, this is definitely one to either slowly add or sit tight and watch." Sitting on the sidelines hoping to catch cheaper shares more often than not ends up                        ...

Fitch Affirms and Withdraws PacWest Bancorp's Ratings at 'BB+/B'; Outlook Stable | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms and Withdraws PacWest Bancorp's Ratings at 'BB+/B'; 
      Outlook Stable
    





May 18, 2015 11:08 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed and withdrawn the ratings of PacWest Bancorp 
      (PACW), Pacific Western Bank and various trust preferred securities 
      issued by PACW's subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch has 
      chosen to withdraw the ratings for commercial reasons. A full list of 
      ratings follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VRs and SENIOR DEBT
    

      The affirmation and Stable Outlook reflects PACW's good market position 
      in key business segments, including its national commercial lending 
      platform to middle-market companies. PACW's financial profile is solid 
      and characterized by good earnings, a low volume of nonperforming assets 
      (NPAs), relatively low net charge-offs and adequate capital levels, 
      which appear to be sufficient to support the business mix. This is 
      counterbalanced by the firm's relatively higher risk appetite given its 
      acquisitive strategy, high balance sheet growth and niche lending focus 
      relative to peers, which constrain PACW's ratings at its current levels.
    

      Fitch notes that there has not been a material change to PACW's overall 
      credit profile since the company was recently reviewed on April 7, 2015.
    

      Core earnings, which adjust for acquisitions and non-recurring revenues 
      and expenses, were solid relative to PACW's rating. The company has 
      posted positive earnings since 2011, supported by strong net interest 
      margins (NIM). Fitch assesses PACW on a core basis to remove distortions 
      created by acquisition accounting. Fitch-calculated annualized adjusted 
      return on average assets (ROAA) was 1.57% for the first-quarter of 2015 
      (1Q15), which remains consistent with historical averages and compares 
      favorably relative to peers. PACW's above-average profitability metrics 
      reflect the firm's niche-lending focus and middle-market customer base.
    

      Adjusted asset quality metrics have also remained relatively stable 
      despite significant loan growth, both organic and resulting from 
      acquisitions. NPAs, inclusive for performing restructured loans but 
      exclusive of covered loans) were 1.45% of non-covered loans and leases 
      at 1Q15. PACW's NPAs may be somewhat understated due to recent outsized 
      loan growth. Nonetheless, credit costs remain favorable compared to 
      peers, with trailing 12 months (TTM) net charge-offs to average 
      non-covered loans of 0.07% at 1Q15. Fitch expects asset quality metrics 
      will remain stable over the medium term given PACW's ability to manage 
      its loan portfolio with relatively low credit costs.
    

      Fitch views PACW's capital levels as adequate relative to its growth and 
      overall risk profile. At March 31, 2015, the company reported ratios of 
      12.01%, 12.35% and 15.90% for tangible common equity (TCE), Tier 1 
      risk-based capital (RBC) and total RBC ratios, respectively. The 
      contemplated merger with Square 1 Financial, which is expected to close 
      in 4Q15, will be capital neutral given the stock-for-stock transaction. 
      On a pro forma basis as of year-end 2014, capital is expected to be 
      11.5%, 12.6% and 15.7% for TCE, Tier 1 RBC and total RBC, respectively.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VRs and SENIOR DEBT
    

      Rating sensitivities are no longer relevant given today's rating 
      withdrawal.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES
    

      PACW's subordinated debt and hybrid issuances are rated two notches 
      below PACW's Viability Rating (VR). The notch differential reflects loss 
      severity and an assessment of incremental non-performance risk.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES
    

      Rating sensitivities are no longer relevant given today's rating 
      withdrawal.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG AND SHORT TERM DEPOSITS
    

      Pacific Western Bank's long- and short-term deposit ratings reflect 
      Fitch's view of how these deposits would be treated in liquidation by 
      the FDIC.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS
    

      Rating sensitivities are no longer relevant given today's rating 
      withdrawal.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY
    

      PACW's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and VR are equalized with those of 
      its bank, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is 
      mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank 
      subsidiaries.
    

      Rating sensitivities are no longer relevant given today's rating 
      withdrawal.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - Support and Support Rating Floors
    

      PACW has a Support Rating of '5' and a Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In 
      Fitch's view, PACW is not systemically important and therefore, Fitch 
      believes the probability of support to be unlikely. PACW's IDR and VR do 
      not incorporate any support.
    

      Rating sensitivities are no longer relevant given today's rating 
      withdrawal.
    

      Fitch has affirmed and withdrawn the following ratings:
    

      PacWest Bancorp
    

      --Long-term IDR at 'BB+';
    

      --Short-term IDR at 'B';

PacWest Bancorp was formerly known as First Community Bancorp. In 2005, First Community Bancorp acquired Glendora, California-based Foothill Independent Bancorp (NASDAQ: FOOT) for $238 million.[3] In 2006, First Community Bancorp combined the two banks it then owned, Pacific Western National Bank and First National Bank, renaming them the Pacific Western Bank.[4] In 2008, First Community Bancorp announced its plans to reincorporate in Delaware and change its name to PacWest Bancorp.[5]
Pacific Western Bank acquired the deposits and other assets of other banking institutions which failed during the financial crisis. In 2008, Pacific Western assumed the deposits and other assets of Security Pacific Bank of Los Angeles, CA.[6] In 2009, Pacific Western assumed the deposits and other assets of Affinity Bank, Ventura, CA.[7] In 2010, Pacific Western assumed the deposits and other assets of Los Padres Bank, Solvang, CA.[8]
In July 2013, PacWest announced it would acquire the commercial bank CapitalSource for around $2.29 billion.[9]
On March 2, 2015,[1] an $894 million merger was announced[2] with Square 1 Financial Inc., the parent company of Durham, North Carolina-based Square 1 Bank.[10] The bank started in 2005 grew to 13 locations and $3.1 billion in assets. The merger would result in Pacific Western becoming California's sixth largest publicly traded bank.[1]

As of March 2015, Pacific Western had $21 billion in assets and 79 locations in California, primarily in the southern and central parts of the state.[1] Pacific Western has primarily built by the acquisition of other banks.[2]. PacWest Bancorp was named the best bank in United States for 2017 by Forbes.
History[edit]
PacWest Bancorp was formerly known as First Community Bancorp. In 2005, First Community Bancorp acquired Glendora, California-based Foothill Independent Bancorp (NASDAQ: FOOT) for $238 million.[3] In 2006, First Community Bancorp combined the two banks it then owned, Pacific Western National Bank and First National Bank, renaming them the Pacific Western Bank.[4] In 2008, First Community Bancorp announced its plans to reincorporate in Delaware and change its name to PacWest Bancorp.[5]
Pacific Western Bank acquired the deposits and other assets of other banking institutions which failed during the financial crisis. In 2008, Pacific Western assumed the deposits and other assets of Security Pacific Bank of Los Angeles, CA.[6] In 2009, Pacific Western assumed the deposits and other assets of Affinity Bank, Ventura, CA.[7] In 2010, Pacific Western assumed the deposits and other assets of Los Padres Bank, Solvang, CA.[8]
In July 2013, PacWest announced it would acquire the commercial bank CapitalSource for around $2.29 billion.[9]
On March 2, 2015,[1] an $894 million merger was announced[2] with Square 1 Financial Inc., the parent company of Durham, North Carolina-based Square 1 Bank.[10] The bank started in 2005 grew to 13 locations and $3.1 billion in assets. The merger would result in Pacific Western becoming California's sixth largest publicly traded bank.[1]

PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ: PACW) is a bank holding company based in Los Angeles, California, with one wholly owned banking subsidiary, Pacific Western Bank. Pacific Western Bank has 79 full-service branches located throughout the state of California and one branch in Durham, North Carolina. Pacific Western provides commercial banking services, including real estate, construction, and commercial loans, and comprehensive deposit and treasury management services to small and medium-sized businesses. Pacific Western offers additional products and services under the brands of its business groups, CapitalSource and Square 1 Bank. CapitalSource provides cash flow, asset-based, equipment and real estate loans and treasury management services to established middle-market businesses on a national basis. Square 1 Bank offers a comprehensive suite of financial services focused on entrepreneurial businesses and their venture capital and private equity investors, with offices located in key innovation hubs across the United States.
As of March 2015, Pacific Western had $21 billion in assets and 79 locations in California, primarily in the southern and central parts of the state.[1] Pacific Western has primarily built by the acquisition of other banks.[2]. PacWest Bancorp was named the best bank in United States for 2017 by Forbes.
History[edit]
PacWest Bancorp was formerly known as First Community Bancorp. In 2005, First Community Bancorp acquired Glendora, California-based Foothill Independent Bancorp (NASDAQ: FOOT) for $238 million.[3] In 2006, First Community Bancorp combined the two banks it then owned, Pacific Western National Bank and First National Bank, renaming them the Pacific Western Bank.[4] In 2008, First Community Bancorp announced its plans to reincorporate in Delaware and change its name to PacWest Bancorp.[5]
Pacific Western Bank acquired the deposits and other assets of other banking institutions which failed during the financial crisis. In 2008, Pacific Western assumed the deposits and other assets of Security Pacific Bank of Los Angeles, CA.[6] In 2009, Pacific Western assumed the deposits and other assets of Affinity Bank, Ventura, CA.[7] In 2010, Pacific Western assumed the deposits and other assets of Los Padres Bank, Solvang, CA.[8]
In July 2013, PacWest announced it would acquire the commercial bank CapitalSource for around $2.29 billion.[9]
On March 2, 2015,[1] an $894 million merger was announced[2] with Square 1 Financial Inc., the parent company of Durham, North Carolina-based Square 1 Bank.[10] The bank started in 2005 grew to 13 locations and $3.1 billion in assets. The merger would result in Pacific Western becoming California's sixth largest publicly traded bank.[1]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
