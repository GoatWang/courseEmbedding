Commit To Purchase AMAG Pharmaceuticals At $16, Earn 16.7% Annualized Using Options






StockOptionsChannel.com




Jul 6, 2017 11:39 AM EDT













 




























































 Investors considering a purchase of AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( AMAG) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $19.05/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the February 2018 put at the $16 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.65. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 10.3% return against the $16 commitment, or a 16.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).     START SLIDESHOW:Top YieldBoost Puts of the S&P 500 »   Selling a put does not give an investor access to AMAG's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $16 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. ( Do options carry counterparty risk? This and six other common options myths debunked). So unless AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. sees its shares fall 15.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $14.35 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.65 from $16), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 16.7% annualized rate of return.

Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's Top Aide Dismissed for Russian Ties


July 22, 2017 20:01·





Rohrabacher aide fired over Russia connections
According to the Los Angeles Times, Rohrabacher dismissed reports on Wednesday that the "Russian government asked him to change his colleagues" opinions about Russian sanctions as a "nothing burger trying to distract the American people from real issues'". "PEBS00039-topic.html" class="local_link" >Trump campaign. The meeting sparked concern from embassy officials who warned Rohrabacher and Behrends about the presence of Russian intelligence at the meeting.
"Paul Behrends has done a terrific job for me and the committee", Rohrabacher said in a statement on Wednesday, according to The Hill. However, when asked about the documents Rohrabacher apparently received from the Prosecutor General's office, Grubbs admitted this was true but remarked that the congressman's meeting with officials in April 2016 was "brief and formal".The goal of this "show trial", according to an email reviewed by the Daily Beast, was to undermine a set of sanctions placed on Russia that were named after Sergei Magnitsky, who served as Browder's tax attorney before being imprisoned after exposing a Russian corruption scandal. At the hearing, Rohrabacher expressed skepticism about the expanded Magnitsky Act and advocated for removing Magnitsky's name from it. I am looking forward to discussing this with the committee leadership.

				A bombshell report claims that Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), who has always been described as "Putin's favorite congressman", was given explicit instructions by the Kremlin for how to attack sanctions against Russian Federation previous year.But on Thursday, Rohrabacher's spokesman said that he and Royce agreed that canceling trip was for the best. "It's absolutely appropriate, and I think anybody that doesn't spend that time focusing on their responsibility is derelict in their duty"."Whenever there is some controversy, you get information from those people all the time, whatever government you are talking to has all the information you need right here to prove their case", Rohrabacher said.

Two Israelis stabbed to death in West Bank settlement: army
					Palestinians say the attacks stem from anger over decades of Israeli occupation of territories they claim for their future state.  An off-duty soldier who was nearby heard the commotion and ran to the home, where he shot the terrorist, wounding him.
				"At the end of the meeting simply as I was walking out, they said this gentleman has some documents for you".Rohrabacher originally said he canceled the trip because he was anxious the focus on Russian Federation would make the trip hard.

Company
About Us






Your partner in life science exploration
Based in the heart of Silicon Valley, Pacific Biosciences provides sophisticated genomic analysis systems that deliver invaluable insights for scientists who strive to resolve complex genetic challenges.
In an effort to push the boundaries of molecular biology, our founders invented a new way to study the synthesis and regulation of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Harnessing advances in biochemistry, optics, nanofabrication, and more, we developed Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) Sequencing technology. This powerful technology transforms the understanding of biological systems by enabling real-time analysis of biomolecules with single-molecule resolution.
PacBio sequencing offers the most comprehensive view of genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenomes — including the full spectrum of genetic variation — by providing the longest average read lengths, highest consensus accuracy, and most uniform coverage of any sequencing technology on the market today. Ideal for de novo genome assembly and genetic variation characterization of humans, animals, plants, and microbes, this system features high-performance optics, automated liquid handling, and an intuitive, intelligent operating system.
We are passionate about developing high-quality, innovative technologies and systems that impact areas of critical importance, including the diagnosis and treatment of disease and efforts to improve the world’s food and energy supply. We believe that our tools will lead to advances that will create long-lasting benefits for the world and its future.

Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. is a biotechnology company founded in 2004 that develops and manufactures systems for gene sequencing and some novel real time biological observation.[1][2] They describe their platform as single molecule real time sequencing (SMRT), based on the properties of zero-mode waveguides. Their first commercial product, the PacBio RS, was sold to a limited set of customers in 2010 and was commercially released in early 2011.[3][4] A new version of the sequencer called the PacBio RS II was released in April 2013.[5][6] On 25 September 2013 a partnership between Pacific Biosciences and Roche Diagnostics was announced for the development of in vitro diagnostic products using the technology, with Roche providing US$75,000,000 in the deal.[7][8] In 2015, the company launched a new sequencing instrument called the Sequel System with approximately 7-fold greater capacity than the PacBio RS II.[9][10]

History[edit]
The company was founded based on research done at Cornell University, that combined semiconductor processing and photonics with biotechnology research.[1] It was initially founded under the name Nanofluidics, Inc. The company raised nearly US$400,000,000 in six rounds of primarily venture capital financing, making it one of the most capitalized startups in 2010 leading up to their public offering in October of that year.[11] Key investors included Mohr Davidow Ventures, Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, Alloy Ventures, and Wellcome Trust.[1]
Recognitions[edit]
The company received the Technology Pioneer Award from the World Economic Forum in 2009.[1][12]
In 2010, The Scientist named the company and their first product the top life science innovation of the year,[13] and the company received the 2010 Advanced Sequencing Technology Award from the National Human Genome Research Institute.[14] Technology Review magazine included them in their list of the top 50 most innovative companies for both 2010 and 2011.[15] Founder and Chief Technical Officer Dr. Stephen Turner was awarded the 2010 Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Outstanding Postdoctoral Entrepreneur award for his work at the company.[16]
Going public[edit]
Pacific Biosciences first offered stock on NASDAQ under the symbol PACB. They sold 12,500,000 shares at an initial price of $16 per share and raised approximately $200 million in an initial public offering of stock on October 27, 2010.[17]
Products[edit]
Sequencing instruments[edit]
The company’s first scientific instrument, called the “PacBio RS”, was released to a limited set of eleven customers in late 2010.[18] Sequencing provider GATC Biotech was selected by Pacific Biosciences as its first European service provider in late 2010.[19] The product was then commercially released in early 2011.[4] A new version of the sequencer called the "PacBio RS II" was released in April 2013; it produces longer sequence reads and offers higher throughput than the original instrument.[5][6] In September 2015, the company announced the launch of a new sequencing instrument, the Sequel System. The sequencer has increased capacity with 1 million zero-mode waveguides compared to 150,000 in the PacBio RS II, and is approximately one-third the size and one-half the price of the PacBio RS II.[20][21] Pacific Biosciences said it would ship about 10 of the new instruments in the final quarter of 2015.[22]




A PacBio RSII sequencer


To use the instrument, customers must also purchase reagent packs for DNA preparation and sequencing and small plastic cells called “SMRT Cells”. Each cell is slightly less than one centimeter square and contains thousands of zero-mode waveguides. The cells are sold in packs of eight. Their secondary analysis bioinformatics product, called “SMRT Analysis”, is open source.[23] In 2013, the company released new bioinformatics tools for automated genome assembly (HGAP) and finishing to 99.999% accuracy (Quiver).[24][25][26]
In May 2010, they published an article in Nature Methods, showing that their instrument can detect methylation of DNA strands without altering the DNA.[27] In 2012 scientists used SMRT sequencing to generate full bacterial methylomes.[28]
Reagents[edit]
P6-C4 chemistry[edit]
On Oct 15, 2014, PacBio announced the release of new chemistry P6-C4, which represents the company's 6th generation of polymerase and 4th generation chemistry, further extends the average read length to 10,000 - 15,000 bases, with the longest reads exceeding 40,000 bases. The throughput with the new chemistry is expected to be between 500 million to 1 billion bases per SMRT® Cell, depending on the sample being sequenced.[29]
P5-C3 chemistry[edit]
On Oct 3, 2013, PacBio released new reagent combination for PacBio RS II, the P5 DNA polymerase with C3 chemistry (P5-C3). Together, they extend sequencing read lengths to an average of approximately 8.5 kb, with the longest reads exceeding 30,000 bases.[30] Throughput per SMRT cell is around 500 million bp based on sequencing results from CHM1 cell line.[31]
P4-C2 chemistry[edit]
On Aug 21, 2013, PacBio released new DNA/Polymerase Binding Kit P4. This P4 enzyme has average read lengths of >4,300 bp when paired with the C2 sequencing chemistry and >5,000 bp when paired with the XL chemistry. The enzyme’s accuracy is similar to C2, reaching QV50 between 30X and 40X coverage. The resulting P4 attributes will provide you with higher-quality assemblies using fewer SMRT® Cells, and with improved variant calling. This kit is compatible with both PacBio RS and PacBio RS II instrument.[32]

Before the first commercial release of their sequencer, scientists published in January 2009 the first sequence data generated from a single molecule real time sequencing in the journal Science.[33] Then in April 2010, scientists published a paper in Nature showing that they had used zero-mode waveguides to perform real-time observation of ribosomal translation.[34]
Demonstrating the value for bacterial sequencing, scientists from Pacific Biosciences and other institutions published in January 2011 a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrating the origin of the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti.[35] In August 2011, Pacific Biosciences scientists and collaborators at other organizations published a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine describing the classification of the E. coli strain causing the virulent 2011 outbreak in Germany responsible for hundreds of cases of hemolytic–uremic syndrome.[36] This paper showed that the strain of E. coli responsible for the outbreak had acquired a Shiga-toxin–encoding phage through lateral gene transfer. In July 2012, several papers were published in peer-review journals demonstrating methods to automate genome finishing for bacteria using single molecule real-time sequencing.[37][38][39] In 2013, scientists estimated that the majority of bacterial and archaeal genomes could be fully sequenced and assembled to closure using PacBio long reads.[40]
Several papers published by researchers at Pacific Biosciences demonstrated that the sequencing instrument can be used to collect data on methylation, DNA damage, and other epigenetic information.[41][42][43] The polymerase that performs the sequencing reaction in the zero-mode waveguides produces kinetic data that can be used to distinguish base modifications.[44] In October 2012, scientists used SMRT sequencing to generate the methylomes of six bacteria, reporting their results in a paper in Nucleic Acids Research.[28]
With increasing read length and throughput, mammalian studies increased using the product. In April 2012, scientists from Pacific Biosciences, the University of California, and other institutes used SMRT sequencing to prove the validity of activating internal tandem duplication mutations in FLT3 as a therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia.[45] Their findings were published in the journal Nature.[46] In August 2012, scientists at the Broad Institute published a paper reporting the findings of their evaluation of the Pacific Biosciences sequencer for SNP calling and discovery.[47] Scientists reported in Genome Research in October 2012 the use of the PacBio platform to sequence the full repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene responsible for Fragile X Syndrome.[48]
A paper published in December 2012 offered the first demonstration of how to generate sequence data with the PacBio sequencer with no library preparation.[49]
In 2013, scientists published papers demonstrating the use of PacBio sequencing to analyze transcriptomes, showing that long reads were able to fully capture complete isoforms.[50][51]

History[edit]
The company was founded based on research done at Cornell University, that combined semiconductor processing and photonics with biotechnology research.[1] It was initially founded under the name Nanofluidics, Inc. The company raised nearly US$400,000,000 in six rounds of primarily venture capital financing, making it one of the most capitalized startups in 2010 leading up to their public offering in October of that year.[11] Key investors included Mohr Davidow Ventures, Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, Alloy Ventures, and Wellcome Trust.[1]
Recognitions[edit]
The company received the Technology Pioneer Award from the World Economic Forum in 2009.[1][12]
In 2010, The Scientist named the company and their first product the top life science innovation of the year,[13] and the company received the 2010 Advanced Sequencing Technology Award from the National Human Genome Research Institute.[14] Technology Review magazine included them in their list of the top 50 most innovative companies for both 2010 and 2011.[15] Founder and Chief Technical Officer Dr. Stephen Turner was awarded the 2010 Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Outstanding Postdoctoral Entrepreneur award for his work at the company.[16]
Going public[edit]
Pacific Biosciences first offered stock on NASDAQ under the symbol PACB. They sold 12,500,000 shares at an initial price of $16 per share and raised approximately $200 million in an initial public offering of stock on October 27, 2010.[17]
Products[edit]
Sequencing instruments[edit]
The company’s first scientific instrument, called the “PacBio RS”, was released to a limited set of eleven customers in late 2010.[18] Sequencing provider GATC Biotech was selected by Pacific Biosciences as its first European service provider in late 2010.[19] The product was then commercially released in early 2011.[4] A new version of the sequencer called the "PacBio RS II" was released in April 2013; it produces longer sequence reads and offers higher throughput than the original instrument.[5][6] In September 2015, the company announced the launch of a new sequencing instrument, the Sequel System. The sequencer has increased capacity with 1 million zero-mode waveguides compared to 150,000 in the PacBio RS II, and is approximately one-third the size and one-half the price of the PacBio RS II.[20][21] Pacific Biosciences said it would ship about 10 of the new instruments in the final quarter of 2015.[22]




A PacBio RSII sequencer


To use the instrument, customers must also purchase reagent packs for DNA preparation and sequencing and small plastic cells called “SMRT Cells”. Each cell is slightly less than one centimeter square and contains thousands of zero-mode waveguides. The cells are sold in packs of eight. Their secondary analysis bioinformatics product, called “SMRT Analysis”, is open source.[23] In 2013, the company released new bioinformatics tools for automated genome assembly (HGAP) and finishing to 99.999% accuracy (Quiver).[24][25][26]
In May 2010, they published an article in Nature Methods, showing that their instrument can detect methylation of DNA strands without altering the DNA.[27] In 2012 scientists used SMRT sequencing to generate full bacterial methylomes.[28]
Reagents[edit]
P6-C4 chemistry[edit]
On Oct 15, 2014, PacBio announced the release of new chemistry P6-C4, which represents the company's 6th generation of polymerase and 4th generation chemistry, further extends the average read length to 10,000 - 15,000 bases, with the longest reads exceeding 40,000 bases. The throughput with the new chemistry is expected to be between 500 million to 1 billion bases per SMRT® Cell, depending on the sample being sequenced.[29]
P5-C3 chemistry[edit]
On Oct 3, 2013, PacBio released new reagent combination for PacBio RS II, the P5 DNA polymerase with C3 chemistry (P5-C3). Together, they extend sequencing read lengths to an average of approximately 8.5 kb, with the longest reads exceeding 30,000 bases.[30] Throughput per SMRT cell is around 500 million bp based on sequencing results from CHM1 cell line.[31]
P4-C2 chemistry[edit]
On Aug 21, 2013, PacBio released new DNA/Polymerase Binding Kit P4. This P4 enzyme has average read lengths of >4,300 bp when paired with the C2 sequencing chemistry and >5,000 bp when paired with the XL chemistry. The enzyme’s accuracy is similar to C2, reaching QV50 between 30X and 40X coverage. The resulting P4 attributes will provide you with higher-quality assemblies using fewer SMRT® Cells, and with improved variant calling. This kit is compatible with both PacBio RS and PacBio RS II instrument.[32]
Key publications[edit]
Before the first commercial release of their sequencer, scientists published in January 2009 the first sequence data generated from a single molecule real time sequencing in the journal Science.[33] Then in April 2010, scientists published a paper in Nature showing that they had used zero-mode waveguides to perform real-time observation of ribosomal translation.[34]

In July 2012, several papers were published in peer-review journals demonstrating methods to automate genome finishing for bacteria using single molecule real-time sequencing.[37][38][39] In 2013, scientists estimated that the majority of bacterial and archaeal genomes could be fully sequenced and assembled to closure using PacBio long reads.[40]
Several papers published by researchers at Pacific Biosciences demonstrated that the sequencing instrument can be used to collect data on methylation, DNA damage, and other epigenetic information.[41][42][43] The polymerase that performs the sequencing reaction in the zero-mode waveguides produces kinetic data that can be used to distinguish base modifications.[44] In October 2012, scientists used SMRT sequencing to generate the methylomes of six bacteria, reporting their results in a paper in Nucleic Acids Research.[28]

The company’s first scientific instrument, called the “PacBio RS”, was released to a limited set of eleven customers in late 2010.[18] Sequencing provider GATC Biotech was selected by Pacific Biosciences as its first European service provider in late 2010.[19] The product was then commercially released in early 2011.[4] A new version of the sequencer called the "PacBio RS II" was released in April 2013; it produces longer sequence reads and offers higher throughput than the original instrument.[5][6] In September 2015, the company announced the launch of a new sequencing instrument, the Sequel System. The sequencer has increased capacity with 1 million zero-mode waveguides compared to 150,000 in the PacBio RS II, and is approximately one-third the size and one-half the price of the PacBio RS II.[20][21] Pacific Biosciences said it would ship about 10 of the new instruments in the final quarter of 2015.[22]




A PacBio RSII sequencer


To use the instrument, customers must also purchase reagent packs for DNA preparation and sequencing and small plastic cells called “SMRT Cells”. Each cell is slightly less than one centimeter square and contains thousands of zero-mode waveguides. The cells are sold in packs of eight. Their secondary analysis bioinformatics product, called “SMRT Analysis”, is open source.[23] In 2013, the company released new bioinformatics tools for automated genome assembly (HGAP) and finishing to 99.999% accuracy (Quiver).[24][25][26]
In May 2010, they published an article in Nature Methods, showing that their instrument can detect methylation of DNA strands without altering the DNA.[27] In 2012 scientists used SMRT sequencing to generate full bacterial methylomes.[28]
Reagents[edit]
P6-C4 chemistry[edit]
On Oct 15, 2014, PacBio announced the release of new chemistry P6-C4, which represents the company's 6th generation of polymerase and 4th generation chemistry, further extends the average read length to 10,000 - 15,000 bases, with the longest reads exceeding 40,000 bases. The throughput with the new chemistry is expected to be between 500 million to 1 billion bases per SMRT® Cell, depending on the sample being sequenced.[29]
P5-C3 chemistry[edit]
On Oct 3, 2013, PacBio released new reagent combination for PacBio RS II, the P5 DNA polymerase with C3 chemistry (P5-C3). Together, they extend sequencing read lengths to an average of approximately 8.5 kb, with the longest reads exceeding 30,000 bases.[30] Throughput per SMRT cell is around 500 million bp based on sequencing results from CHM1 cell line.[31]
P4-C2 chemistry[edit]
On Aug 21, 2013, PacBio released new DNA/Polymerase Binding Kit P4. This P4 enzyme has average read lengths of >4,300 bp when paired with the C2 sequencing chemistry and >5,000 bp when paired with the XL chemistry. The enzyme’s accuracy is similar to C2, reaching QV50 between 30X and 40X coverage. The resulting P4 attributes will provide you with higher-quality assemblies using fewer SMRT® Cells, and with improved variant calling. This kit is compatible with both PacBio RS and PacBio RS II instrument.[32]
Key publications[edit]
Before the first commercial release of their sequencer, scientists published in January 2009 the first sequence data generated from a single molecule real time sequencing in the journal Science.[33] Then in April 2010, scientists published a paper in Nature showing that they had used zero-mode waveguides to perform real-time observation of ribosomal translation.[34]
Demonstrating the value for bacterial sequencing, scientists from Pacific Biosciences and other institutions published in January 2011 a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrating the origin of the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti.[35] In August 2011, Pacific Biosciences scientists and collaborators at other organizations published a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine describing the classification of the E. coli strain causing the virulent 2011 outbreak in Germany responsible for hundreds of cases of hemolytic–uremic syndrome.[36] This paper showed that the strain of E. coli responsible for the outbreak had acquired a Shiga-toxin–encoding phage through lateral gene transfer. In July 2012, several papers were published in peer-review journals demonstrating methods to automate genome finishing for bacteria using single molecule real-time sequencing.[37][38][39] In 2013, scientists estimated that the majority of bacterial and archaeal genomes could be fully sequenced and assembled to closure using PacBio long reads.[40]
Several papers published by researchers at Pacific Biosciences demonstrated that the sequencing instrument can be used to collect data on methylation, DNA damage, and other epigenetic information.[41][42][43] The polymerase that performs the sequencing reaction in the zero-mode waveguides produces kinetic data that can be used to distinguish base modifications.[44] In October 2012, scientists used SMRT sequencing to generate the methylomes of six bacteria, reporting their results in a paper in Nucleic Acids Research.[28]
With increasing read length and throughput, mammalian studies increased using the product. In April 2012, scientists from Pacific Biosciences, the University of California, and other institutes used SMRT sequencing to prove the validity of activating internal tandem duplication mutations in FLT3 as a therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia.[45] Their findings were published in the journal Nature.[46] In August 2012, scientists at the Broad Institute published a paper reporting the findings of their evaluation of the Pacific Biosciences sequencer for SNP calling and discovery.[47] Scientists reported in Genome Research in October 2012 the use of the PacBio platform to sequence the full repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene responsible for Fragile X Syndrome.[48]
A paper published in December 2012 offered the first demonstration of how to generate sequence data with the PacBio sequencer with no library preparation.[49]
In 2013, scientists published papers demonstrating the use of PacBio sequencing to analyze transcriptomes, showing that long reads were able to fully capture complete isoforms.[50][51]

History[edit]
The company was founded based on research done at Cornell University, that combined semiconductor processing and photonics with biotechnology research.[1] It was initially founded under the name Nanofluidics, Inc. The company raised nearly US$400,000,000 in six rounds of primarily venture capital financing, making it one of the most capitalized startups in 2010 leading up to their public offering in October of that year.[11] Key investors included Mohr Davidow Ventures, Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, Alloy Ventures, and Wellcome Trust.[1]
Recognitions[edit]
The company received the Technology Pioneer Award from the World Economic Forum in 2009.[1][12]
In 2010, The Scientist named the company and their first product the top life science innovation of the year,[13] and the company received the 2010 Advanced Sequencing Technology Award from the National Human Genome Research Institute.[14] Technology Review magazine included them in their list of the top 50 most innovative companies for both 2010 and 2011.[15] Founder and Chief Technical Officer Dr. Stephen Turner was awarded the 2010 Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Outstanding Postdoctoral Entrepreneur award for his work at the company.[16]
Going public[edit]
Pacific Biosciences first offered stock on NASDAQ under the symbol PACB. They sold 12,500,000 shares at an initial price of $16 per share and raised approximately $200 million in an initial public offering of stock on October 27, 2010.[17]

Sequencing instruments[edit]
The company’s first scientific instrument, called the “PacBio RS”, was released to a limited set of eleven customers in late 2010.[18] Sequencing provider GATC Biotech was selected by Pacific Biosciences as its first European service provider in late 2010.[19] The product was then commercially released in early 2011.[4] A new version of the sequencer called the "PacBio RS II" was released in April 2013; it produces longer sequence reads and offers higher throughput than the original instrument.[5][6] In September 2015, the company announced the launch of a new sequencing instrument, the Sequel System. The sequencer has increased capacity with 1 million zero-mode waveguides compared to 150,000 in the PacBio RS II, and is approximately one-third the size and one-half the price of the PacBio RS II.[20][21] Pacific Biosciences said it would ship about 10 of the new instruments in the final quarter of 2015.[22]

Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. is a biotechnology company founded in 2004 that develops and manufactures systems for gene sequencing and some novel real time biological observation.[1][2] They describe their platform as single molecule real time sequencing (SMRT), based on the properties of zero-mode waveguides. Their first commercial product, the PacBio RS, was sold to a limited set of customers in 2010 and was commercially released in early 2011.[3][4] A new version of the sequencer called the PacBio RS II was released in April 2013.[5][6] On 25 September 2013 a partnership between Pacific Biosciences and Roche Diagnostics was announced for the development of in vitro diagnostic products using the technology, with Roche providing US$75,000,000 in the deal.[7][8] In 2015, the company launched a new sequencing instrument called the Sequel System with approximately 7-fold greater capacity than the PacBio RS II.[9][10]

History[edit]
The company was founded based on research done at Cornell University, that combined semiconductor processing and photonics with biotechnology research.[1] It was initially founded under the name Nanofluidics, Inc. The company raised nearly US$400,000,000 in six rounds of primarily venture capital financing, making it one of the most capitalized startups in 2010 leading up to their public offering in October of that year.[11] Key investors included Mohr Davidow Ventures, Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, Alloy Ventures, and Wellcome Trust.[1]
Recognitions[edit]
The company received the Technology Pioneer Award from the World Economic Forum in 2009.[1][12]
In 2010, The Scientist named the company and their first product the top life science innovation of the year,[13] and the company received the 2010 Advanced Sequencing Technology Award from the National Human Genome Research Institute.[14] Technology Review magazine included them in their list of the top 50 most innovative companies for both 2010 and 2011.[15] Founder and Chief Technical Officer Dr. Stephen Turner was awarded the 2010 Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Outstanding Postdoctoral Entrepreneur award for his work at the company.[16]
Going public[edit]
Pacific Biosciences first offered stock on NASDAQ under the symbol PACB. They sold 12,500,000 shares at an initial price of $16 per share and raised approximately $200 million in an initial public offering of stock on October 27, 2010.[17]
Products[edit]
Sequencing instruments[edit]
The company’s first scientific instrument, called the “PacBio RS”, was released to a limited set of eleven customers in late 2010.[18] Sequencing provider GATC Biotech was selected by Pacific Biosciences as its first European service provider in late 2010.[19] The product was then commercially released in early 2011.[4] A new version of the sequencer called the "PacBio RS II" was released in April 2013; it produces longer sequence reads and offers higher throughput than the original instrument.[5][6] In September 2015, the company announced the launch of a new sequencing instrument, the Sequel System. The sequencer has increased capacity with 1 million zero-mode waveguides compared to 150,000 in the PacBio RS II, and is approximately one-third the size and one-half the price of the PacBio RS II.[20][21] Pacific Biosciences said it would ship about 10 of the new instruments in the final quarter of 2015.[22]




A PacBio RSII sequencer


To use the instrument, customers must also purchase reagent packs for DNA preparation and sequencing and small plastic cells called “SMRT Cells”. Each cell is slightly less than one centimeter square and contains thousands of zero-mode waveguides. The cells are sold in packs of eight. Their secondary analysis bioinformatics product, called “SMRT Analysis”, is open source.[23] In 2013, the company released new bioinformatics tools for automated genome assembly (HGAP) and finishing to 99.999% accuracy (Quiver).[24][25][26]
In May 2010, they published an article in Nature Methods, showing that their instrument can detect methylation of DNA strands without altering the DNA.[27] In 2012 scientists used SMRT sequencing to generate full bacterial methylomes.[28]
Reagents[edit]
P6-C4 chemistry[edit]
On Oct 15, 2014, PacBio announced the release of new chemistry P6-C4, which represents the company's 6th generation of polymerase and 4th generation chemistry, further extends the average read length to 10,000 - 15,000 bases, with the longest reads exceeding 40,000 bases. The throughput with the new chemistry is expected to be between 500 million to 1 billion bases per SMRT® Cell, depending on the sample being sequenced.[29]
P5-C3 chemistry[edit]
On Oct 3, 2013, PacBio released new reagent combination for PacBio RS II, the P5 DNA polymerase with C3 chemistry (P5-C3). Together, they extend sequencing read lengths to an average of approximately 8.5 kb, with the longest reads exceeding 30,000 bases.[30] Throughput per SMRT cell is around 500 million bp based on sequencing results from CHM1 cell line.[31]
P4-C2 chemistry[edit]
On Aug 21, 2013, PacBio released new DNA/Polymerase Binding Kit P4. This P4 enzyme has average read lengths of >4,300 bp when paired with the C2 sequencing chemistry and >5,000 bp when paired with the XL chemistry. The enzyme’s accuracy is similar to C2, reaching QV50 between 30X and 40X coverage. The resulting P4 attributes will provide you with higher-quality assemblies using fewer SMRT® Cells, and with improved variant calling. This kit is compatible with both PacBio RS and PacBio RS II instrument.[32]
Key publications[edit]
Before the first commercial release of their sequencer, scientists published in January 2009 the first sequence data generated from a single molecule real time sequencing in the journal Science.[33] Then in April 2010, scientists published a paper in Nature showing that they had used zero-mode waveguides to perform real-time observation of ribosomal translation.[34]
Demonstrating the value for bacterial sequencing, scientists from Pacific Biosciences and other institutions published in January 2011 a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrating the origin of the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti.[35] In August 2011, Pacific Biosciences scientists and collaborators at other organizations published a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine describing the classification of the E. coli strain causing the virulent 2011 outbreak in Germany responsible for hundreds of cases of hemolytic–uremic syndrome.[36] This paper showed that the strain of E. coli responsible for the outbreak had acquired a Shiga-toxin–encoding phage through lateral gene transfer. In July 2012, several papers were published in peer-review journals demonstrating methods to automate genome finishing for bacteria using single molecule real-time sequencing.[37][38][39] In 2013, scientists estimated that the majority of bacterial and archaeal genomes could be fully sequenced and assembled to closure using PacBio long reads.[40]
Several papers published by researchers at Pacific Biosciences demonstrated that the sequencing instrument can be used to collect data on methylation, DNA damage, and other epigenetic information.[41][42][43] The polymerase that performs the sequencing reaction in the zero-mode waveguides produces kinetic data that can be used to distinguish base modifications.[44] In October 2012, scientists used SMRT sequencing to generate the methylomes of six bacteria, reporting their results in a paper in Nucleic Acids Research.[28]
With increasing read length and throughput, mammalian studies increased using the product. In April 2012, scientists from Pacific Biosciences, the University of California, and other institutes used SMRT sequencing to prove the validity of activating internal tandem duplication mutations in FLT3 as a therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia.[45] Their findings were published in the journal Nature.[46] In August 2012, scientists at the Broad Institute published a paper reporting the findings of their evaluation of the Pacific Biosciences sequencer for SNP calling and discovery.[47] Scientists reported in Genome Research in October 2012 the use of the PacBio platform to sequence the full repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene responsible for Fragile X Syndrome.[48]
A paper published in December 2012 offered the first demonstration of how to generate sequence data with the PacBio sequencer with no library preparation.[49]
In 2013, scientists published papers demonstrating the use of PacBio sequencing to analyze transcriptomes, showing that long reads were able to fully capture complete isoforms.[50][51]

	Conflict Minerals Report of Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc.




	in Accordance with Rule 13p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934




	﻿




	This is the Conflict Minerals Report (“CMR”) of Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. (“PACB,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) for


	the reporting period January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015


	in accordance with Rule 13p-1 (“Rule 13p-1”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”). Please refer to Rule 13p-1, Form SD and the 1934 Act Release No. 34-67716 for definitions to the terms used in this Report, unless otherwise defined herein.




	﻿




	Company Overview




	﻿




	We design, develop and manufacture sequencing systems to help scientists resolve genetically complex problems. Based on our novel Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT


	®


	) Sequencing technology, our products enable:


	de novo


	genome assembly to finish genomes in order to more fully identify, annotate and decipher genomic structures; full-length transcript analysis to improve annotations in reference genomes, characterize alternatively spliced isoforms in important gene families, and find novel genes; targeted sequencing to more comprehensively characterize genetic variations; and real-time kinetic information for epigenome characterization. Our technology provides high accuracy, ultra-long reads, uniform coverage, and is the only DNA sequencing technology that provides the ability to simultaneously detect epigenetic changes. PacBio


	®


	sequencing systems, including consumables and software, provide a simple, fast, end-to-end workflow for SMRT Sequencing.




	﻿




	In September 2015, we announced that we had launched a new nucleic acid sequencing platform, the Sequel


	TM


	 System, which will provide higher throughput, more scalability, a reduced footprint and lower sequencing project costs compared to the PacBio


	®


	 RS II System, while maintaining the existing benefits of our SMRT Technology.




	﻿




	PACB conducted an analysis of its products and found that the SEC defined “conflict minerals,” namely tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (“3TG”), can be found in its PacBio


	®


	RS II instrument and the Sequel


	TM


	 


	System. Therefore, the products that PACB manufactures are subject to the reporting obligations of Rule 13p-1.




	﻿




	Reasonable country of origin inquiry




	﻿




	Our Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (“RCOI”) process began with an evaluation of our suppliers that provided materials, components or products that became part of products PACB manufactured or contract to manufactured in 2015, which it knew contained or were likely to contain 3TG minerals. This evaluation consisted of examining internal records such as bills of materials or other product specifications and performing a qualitative review of purchasing records and/or information provided by the supplier. Based on PACB’s evaluation, it surveyed the suppliers of those materials, components or products which it concluded contained or were likely to contain 3TG minerals. The suppliers were asked to report on the presence of any 3TG minerals in the goods sold to us. In cases where PACB confirmed that 3TG minerals were present, it asked the applicable supplier to submit information to us about the country of origin of the 3TG minerals.




	﻿




	Due Diligence




	﻿




	In accordance with the rules, PACB performed due diligence procedures to determine the conflict minerals status of the 3TG minerals used in its products. In conducting its due diligence, PACB implemented the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (the “OECD Framework”), an internationally recognized due diligence framework.  The Company designed its due diligence process, management and measures within the OECD Framework for a company downstream in the supply chain.




	﻿




	As a company in the DNA sequencing market, PACB is several levels removed from the actual mining of 3TG. PACB does not make purchases of raw ore or unrefined 3TG and makes no purchases of 3TG directly from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (“DRC”) or an adjoining country (together, the “Covered Countries”).










	 




	The following is a summary of the due diligence actions that PACB has taken with regard to the reporting period for which this CMR is submitted:




	﻿












	1)










	Establish strong company management systems








	﻿












	·










	Established an internal management team and coordinator to ensure compliance with respect to the reporting requirements relating to conflict minerals. PACB’s internal management team consists of, or works with, representatives from supply chain and procurement, engineering, legal and finance.








	﻿












	·










	Defined the scope of PACB’s conflict minerals due diligence by identifying and reaching out to current suppliers that provide components or engage in manufacturing activities that are likely to contain 3TG.








	﻿












	·










	Determined data gathering and assessment procedures in order to understand the scope of PACB’s supply chain inquiry.








	﻿












	2)










	Identify and assess risks in the supply chain








	﻿












	·










	Adopted the standard Conflict Minerals Reporting Template established by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (“EICC”) and Global e-Sustainability Initiative (“GeSI”) for data collection and verification. PACB requested product-level information from its Tier 1 suppliers on the parts and products it purchased from them.








	﻿












	·










	In an effort to increase awareness of PACB’s conflict minerals program, PACB provided suppliers with background materials describing the conflict minerals rule, leading industry initiatives, conflict minerals tracing, reporting requirements, and other guidelines and resources relating to conflict minerals.








	﻿












	·










	Relied on these supplier’s responses to provide PACB with information about the source of conflict minerals contained in the components supplied to PACB. PACB’s direct suppliers of 3TG minerals are similarly reliant upon information provided to them by their respective suppliers.








	﻿












	·










	PACB reviewed and evaluated all supplier responses for consistency and completeness, as well as the origin of those materials.   








	﻿












	3)










	Design and implement a strategy to respond to identified risks








	﻿












	·










	The status and findings of PACB’s RCOI and due diligence efforts were reported to senior management.








	﻿












	·










	PACB followed a risk mitigation plan that is consistent with its conflict minerals approach: If a smelter or refiner in the supply chain were known to be sourcing from a mine within a Covered Country which directly or indirectly finances or benefits armed groups, PACB would consider all available options, including, but not limited to, making changes to its sourcing of those items.








	﻿












	4)










	Independent third-party audits of smelter or refiner’s due diligence practices








	﻿




	PACB use resources from the GeSI and OECD, including their conflict free smelter lists and Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (“CFSI”) resources.  As a downstream company, PACB’s due diligence efforts rely on cross-industry initiatives such as a “conflict free” designation from the Conflict Free Smelter Program CFSP led by the CFSI.  The CFSI is a global leader for the responsible sourcing of minerals and provides information on conflict-free smelters and refiners, common tools to gather sourcing information, and forums for exchanging best practices on addressing Conflicts Minerals.




	﻿








	 












	5)










	Report on supply chain due diligence








	﻿




	PACB plans to continue to report annually to the SEC by filing a Form SD and Conflict Minerals Report as required by applicable law.




	﻿




	Findings and Conclusion




	﻿




	PACB sent out surveys to the 60 suppliers identified in its due diligence efforts and received responses from 56 suppliers, providing a 93% response rate. A significant improvement was noted with regards to the completeness and quality of responses PACB received from its suppliers in 2015 compared to prior years.  Of the responses received in 2015, 71% were acceptable at the Company Level compared to only 20% in 2014, where “Company Level” refers to reports that do not identify the smelters or refiners used for a particular part, component, or business customer bur rather report the data for all of the company’s product lines in the aggregate.  However, suppliers and manufacturers generally provided facility information at the Company Level, representing the suppliers’ and manufacturers’ entire product lines, and generally did not limit their responses to facility information for Covered Minerals in products they supply to PACB specifically.  In 2015, only four suppliers provided responses specific to PACB products (“Product Level”) compared to zero in 2014. 




	﻿




	Out of the 56 responses received, 12 stated that their products do not contain 3TG minerals, 8 stated that the 3TG minerals were not sourced from the Covered Countries, 18 stated that at least some of their 3TG minerals were sourced from Covered Countries and 18 stated that they were uncertain as to the origin of the 3TG minerals in their products or did not provide sufficient information to adequately determine the source.  Of the 18 suppliers that stated that at least some of their 3TG minerals were sourced from Covered Countries, 10 noted that all of their products were from sources certified as being conflict free, active in the process to obtain conflict free certification or had complete control from mine to production.  The remaining sources were uncertified or had an unknown certification status.  However, PACB has not identified any known instances in which any 3TG minerals were sourced directly or indirectly from armed groups of the conflict region of the Covered Countries.




	﻿




	Of the 36 suppliers whose responses indicated that their products may contain 3TG sourced from the Covered Countries, all but one of those suppliers responded at a Company Level. As a result, many of those smelters identified in a Company Level declaration by PACB’s suppliers may not actually be involved in the products supplied to PACB.




	﻿




	Based on the representation made by its suppliers, PACB does not have sufficient information to determine whether its supply chain is “DRC conflict-free” for calendar 2015. PACB has been unable to determine the origin of all 3TG used in certain integrated circuits and other components used in the manufacturing of its instruments and related consumables. This was due to a lack of information from its suppliers to conclude whether the 3TG minerals originated in the Covered Countries and, if so, whether the 3TG minerals were from recycle or scrap sources, were DRC conflict free or have not been found to be DRC conflict free.




	﻿




	Future Steps




	﻿




	PACB is continuing to develop methods, implement tools and adopt procedures that are designed to be both auditable and in accordance with the OECD Framework. In the next compliance period, PACB intends to continue to develop its processes in working with its suppliers to provide accurate and complete information regarding Conflict Mineral sourcing.




	﻿




	Additional Risk Factors and Considerations




	﻿




	This CMR contains forward looking statements relating to actions that PACB may take in the future. Such statements are based on the current expectations of our management and are neither promises nor guarantees of future performance of the actions. Subsequent events and developments may cause management’s views to change. While PACB may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, it specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of this report.










	 




	﻿




	The statements above are based on the due diligence performed in good faith by PACB. The statements are all based on information available at the time, and many factors can introduce error impacting PACB’s Conflict Minerals status. Some factors could include but are not limited to unavailable supplier data, incomplete supplier data, incomplete smelter data, errors or omissions in supplier or smelter responses, and suppliers or smelter operators who are unfamiliar with the Conflict Minerals rule and protocols for responding to requests for information about Conflict Minerals. 




	﻿




	Suppliers and manufacturers generally provided facility information at the company level, representing the suppliers’ and manufacturers’ entire product lines, and generally did not limit their responses to facility information for Covered Minerals in products they supply to PACB specifically. 




	﻿




	Independent Private Sector Audit




	﻿




	This CMR has not been subject to an independent private sector audit as allowed under Rule 13p-1.
