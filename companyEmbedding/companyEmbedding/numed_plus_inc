Nitric Oxide is a naturally occurring molecule that was first identified in the late 18th century. NO should not be confused with Nitrous Oxide, a common anesthetic that is otherwise known as "laughing gas." Nitric Oxide's significance in biological processes began to materialize only in the late 1980s. Today, it is widely recognized as an important biological regulator and a fundamental molecule in the fields of pulmonary medicine, cardiology, neuroscience, physiology and immunology. In 1998, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for discoveries concerning NO as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system.
Inhaled Nitric Oxide is presently used to treat thousands of patients per year in the US, including term infants with pulmonary hypertension and some pre-term infants with respiratory insufficiency. Inhaled Nitric Oxide is a potent, pulmonary specific vasodilator that dilates blood vessels.


Numerous academic sponsored clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical utility of NO and potential uses for NO in an extensive variety of diseases and health complications, including:  inflammatory disorders; head trauma; erectile dysfunction; pain and neuroprotection.  
Once inhaled into the lungs, NO causes blood vessels to relax and widen, resulting in an increase in blood flow.  This increase in blood flow allows tissues to receive more oxygen. Once tissues receive more oxygen, the cells within the tissues become available to provide energy for all activities that organisms perform, both actively and passively.   NO exerts its’ properties locally and is metabolized quickly, thus minimizing systemic adverse reactions associated with other vasodilators. Vasodilator therapies are widely used in hospital settings for patients with pulmonary and cardiac diseases. Although these  
						
					

therapies are both safe and effective, they are cumbersome to use and prohibitively expensive.  Because of the lack of transportability and the expense, NO is not often used in underdeveloped countries where there is significant need for NO therapy. Current providers of NO use large tanks of compressed gas that contain NO diluted in pure nitrogen.
Nu-Med believes there is a significant marketplace for its’ inhaled NO medical therapies.  Currently available NO delivery systems are a concern for hospitals due to usage, tracking, storage and the necessity of returning empty compressed gas tanks. In addition, existing systems are large and awkward to use, impairing patient mobility within the hospital, and making inhaled Nitric Oxide outside the hospital environment nearly impossible.  Nu-Med’s planned NO delivery systems are expected to be smaller, more portable and easier to use, and available at significantly lower price points than systems currently available.

1. Neonatal Complications - 
1.3 Million cases/year



								About one third of all new born infant deaths 
								are related to respiratory complications.
							

							    Nitric Oxide is currently being used to cure these problems in infants, with a high degree of success.
							

								Treatments cost about $125 per hour and 
								usually last about 72 hours. Due to the 
								high cost, the use of Nitric Oxide in this 
								market is very limited.
							

								Nu-Med Plus is developing a cost-effective 
								way to produce and transmit Nitric Oxide.
							



2. COPD - 
80 Million cases/year


								A disease of the lungs that is the 
								third leading cause of death in the U.S. 
								and the fourth leading cause of death worldwide.
							




3. Tuberculosis - 
8 Million cases/year



								Lethal infectious disease that attacks 
								the lungs of the person infected.
							

								Nitric Oxide has been used in trials 
								and has shown promising results to 
								cure the disease.
							

4. ARDS - 
2.2 Million cases/year


								Severe lung syndrome with no known cure.
							

                                Inhaled Nitric Oxide reduces the vascular resistance of open alveoli, exerting a potentially beneficial effect on arterial oxygenation.    
                            




5. Malaria - 
216 Million cases/year



								This disease is transmitted through mosquitoes 
								to humans and is most prevalent in Africa.
							

								About 1 million people die every year from 
								this disease and there is currently no known cure.
							

								Most of the survivors have severe respiratory problems.
							
Inhaled NO potentially may well be used as adjuvant therapy in children with severe malaria because of its’ systemic anti-inflammatory properties to "buy time" for chemical antiparasite therapy to lower the parasite load.

Technology Platforms
1. Low cost, innovative Nitric
						Oxide production


								Nu-Med Plus has completed the initial development of a clinical unit to accurately deliver and safely monitor inhaled Nitric Oxide for use in adults, and neonates who are on a ventilator in a hospital setting under close medical supervision.
							

								It is designed to be modest and instinctive to use. The basis of our patent pending Nitric Oxide delivery system is the kinetically controlled release of Nitric Oxide from a chemical reaction which converts our low cost proprietary powder into a highly purified, therapeutic metered dose of Nitric Oxide.
							

								Currently, competitors offer a single 
								72 hour treatment of Nitric Oxide 
								for over $9,000.
							




2. Mobile rechargeable Nitric
						Oxide generator


								Portable unit to produce and 
								deliver Nitric Oxide in a 
								simple and safe process.
							



								Expands the use of Nitric Oxide into 
								third world countries where it is 
								currently not possible due to the 
								large amount of equipment and power needed.
							

3. Nitric Oxide Clinical Delivery Unit

The smaller multi-dose Inhaled Nitric Oxide clinical device will have the capability to deliver high-purity NO in single-dose treatments, using our proprietary formulation. 

 The emphasis is to generate controlled-flow of NO for internal and external therapies with integrating accessories. 

Intended usage will be emergency rooms/urgent care facilities, medical and chiropractic offices, convalescent and nursing homes, and for EMT use. 




* Nu-Med's Nitric Oxide delivery systems are investigational and limited by federal law to investigational use only. Our units will require testing and FDA approval prior to any commercial use.

							Nu-Med Plus’s strategy of developing and bringing to market new and innovative medical products has led us to several new advanced technologies which are under development in the area of generation and controlled delivery of Nitric Oxide gas for human consumption. During our stages of research and product development, several potentially patentable products have been discovered. Presently, we have 2 patents pending relating to our Nitric Oxide platform which will serve as the foundation of our IP portfolio and which will lead to creating value for our company and our shareholders. Nu-Med Plus will take into consideration both offensive and defensive postures.
						



							We expect that through our teams’ research and product development efforts, several other patents will be generated within our medical Nitric Oxide delivery platform.  As we expand our innovative technologies into other additional areas, we anticipate involvement in additional markets which will lead to increased revenue potential.  In addition to the patent portfolio for Nu-Med Plus, we are also pursuing a proprietary protection strategy of certain key formulations and methods for further strengthening the overall Intellectual Property portfolio.  Our teams’ in-house manufacturing expertise will give Nu-Med a competitive advantage, creating additional value to the company.
						



							As our products progress, we plan to assess additional potential labeled indications for inhaled NO using our patent pending delivery systems and expand our commercial reach worldwide. In addition, we may form strategic arrangements, create joint ventures relationships or enter into licensing provisions with third parties with respect to products and technologies that we believe will complement and supplement our existing business.

 All the World’s a Cloud
        All of Cloud Is at Cloud Expo!

 Cloud Computing - Big Data | Analytics - Internet of Things 
          Containers - Microservices - WebRTC - DevOps 


Join Us at the Javits Center in New York, NY, June 6-8 

          Cloud computing software is eating the world, and each day is bringing new developments in this world. 

          Yesterday's debate about public vs. private has transformed into the reality of hybrid cloud: a recent survey shows that 74% of enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy. 

          Meanwhile, 94% of enterprises are using some form of XaaS – software, platform, and Infrastructure as a Service.

          Big Data | Analytics and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) are driving exponentially increased demands on datacenters and developers alike, as we cross the zettabyte horizon this year.

          Containers and microservices are now part of every PaaS conversation, and IaaS providers are increasingly competing for platform customers. 

          WebRTC continues to reform web communications, and DevOps is pushing its way into an enterprise IT world that is increasingly agile, lean, and continuous.

          Through all this, Cloud Expo remains the single independent event where delegates and technology vendors can meet to experience and discuss the entire world of the cloud.

        Only Cloud Expo brings together all this in a single location: 
        
          •	Cloud Computing
            •	Big Data | Analytics
            •	Internet of Things
            •	Containers | Microservices
            •	WebRTC
            •	DevOps


        Cloud computing budgets worldwide are reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and no organization can survive long without some sort of cloud migration strategy. Each month brings new announcements, use cases, and success stories. 

          Cloud Expo offers the world's most comprehensive selection of technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100+ exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies. 

          The floor also features a Demo Theater that give delegates the opportunity to get even closer to the technology they want to see and the people who offer it. 

          Attend Cloud Expo. Create your own custom experience. Learn the latest from the world's best technologists. Talk to the vendors you are considering, and put them to the test.

          See you in New York!

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  Certain statements in this Report constitute "forward-looking statements." Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, among others, uncertainties relating to general economic and business conditions; industry trends; changes in demand for our products and services; uncertainties relating to customer plans and commitments and the timing of orders received from customers; announcements or changes in our pricing policies or that of our competitors; unanticipated delays in the development, market acceptance or installation of our products and services; changes in government regulations; availability of management and other key personnel; availability, terms and deployment of capital; relationships with third-party equipment suppliers; and worldwide political stability and economic growth. The words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend" and "plan" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  The Company's accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the audited financial statements in our recently filed Form 10-K. As discussed in Note 2, the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual differences could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes that the following addresses the Company's most critical accounting policies.  We recognize revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition" ("SAB 104"). Under SAB 104, revenue is recognized at the point of passage to the customer of title and risk of loss, when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.  Our policy for our allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers' inability to make required payments. If there is deterioration of our customers' credit worthiness and/or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used, additional allowances may be required.  We account for income taxes in accordance with FASC 740-20, "Accounting for Income Taxes". Under FASC 740-20, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets will be reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized.  -13-  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  NU-MED PLUS, INC., a Utah corporation ("NU-MED" or the "Company") was incorporated in October 2011 in the state of Utah as an early stage, emerging growth company, to develop, manufacture and market new technologies in the medical device field. NU-MED's immediate focus is on the creation of a Nitric Oxide powder formulation along with a bedside Nitric Oxide generator and a mobile rechargeable device to deliver Nitric Oxide gas. NU-MED is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Business  The mission of NU-MED is to design, develop, and market technologies in the medical device field. Our technologies will focus on market niches in high growth trend areas. We hope each developed technology will fill a current need in medical procedures by improving upon an existing technology or device, or by designing a device to serve a need that is clearly defined and acknowledged by medical professionals.  NU-MED intends to become a medical device company principally engaged in the design, innovation, development, enhancement and commercialization of beginning, early, and selective later-stage quality medical devices. Our immediate focus is on the creation of a Nitric Oxide powder formulation, a hospital bedside Nitric Oxide ("NO") generator and a mobile rechargeable device to deliver Nitric Oxide gas to offer solutions to hospitals, health systems and the medical community throughout the world.  Prior to the founding of NU-MED PLUS, our core team Jeff Robins, William Moon, and Dr. Craig Morrison investigated researched and worked on initial formulations of a conceptual product to convert Nitric Oxide from a proprietary formulation to a gas used to in the medical field. Based on our team's backgrounds in the field of mechanical engineering, chemistry and medicine it was determined a potential niche market existed and the conceptual proprietary product could possibly be created. From this initial research and some initial testing, our team believed we could create a mechanical device that could deliver Nitric Oxide to medical patients and use a new formulation of Nitric Oxide that, when combined with the new delivery device, could be accomplished in a more economical method than those currently in existence. Recognizing the experimental nature of the intended product and the time and money commitments to get such a product to market, the team spent almost a year working on various initial equipment and formulizations before determining they could not proceed further without some additional capital. From this realization of the need for capital, NU-MED was incorporated and an initial private placement was completed to raise some capital to create a small lab and purchase equipment, including chemicals to start working on testing the theories of the founding team. Even with almost a year of working on the proposed product and formulation, NU-MED recognizes the difficulty in developing a medical product and that other companies could expend far more resources on a similar solution and beat NU-MED to the market. Investors in NU-MED face tremendous risk and would be betting on current management and its development staff which have not had prior success in developing and marketing medical products. Although management believes they are developing a unique and economical solution for Nitric Oxide delivery, management acknowledges they have not developed medical products before and all of their prior development work has been for other companies and this will be the first time management and their team have tried to do so without the support of a large organization and such organizations funding capabilities.  The core of the product embodiment is the kinetically controlled release of nitric oxide from a chemical reaction. The mechanical means to deliver a metered dose to a patient is of secondary concern and will be addressed once the nitric oxide generation has been optimized. A research laboratory, completed in July 2012, has been equipped with  -14-  the appropriate safety measures (negative pressure fume hood), nitric oxide analyzer, and standard lab ware to assess chemical reactions that produce nitric oxide. The initial goal is developing a kinetic control and be able to complete testing to optimize the process. Initial efforts are focusing on a proprietary mixture that will show the requisite parameters for generating nitric oxide in a controlled manner. Once this stage of development is complete, we will move forward with additional development of the delivery system. The optimization may take an unknown direction that will necessitate changes in the anticipated design of the mechanical delivery apparatus. Additionally, unforeseen delays, such as obtaining needed chemicals, which we experienced in September and October of 2012, can hamper development timelines. Management believes it will take some time before a product will be finalized and testing completed. Until a final product is completed and testing done, no assurance can be given we will be able to complete the product or achieve the costs savings for the patient.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  At March 31, 2014, we had assets of $501,517 with current assets of $322,950 and liabilities of $257,458. Our current assets consisted primarily of prepaid expenses in the amount of $315,200 and cash of only $7,750. We currently do not have the cash to pay ongoing expenses and have had to rely on loans from shareholders to cover expenses. Without additional capital, we will not be able to stay in business and move our business plan forward. We anticipate, based on our preliminary budgets, that we will need $120,000 in additional financing for the next twelve months to cover just our corporate overhead and need another $100,000 to cover ongoing product development. In April 2014, we entered into a stock subscription agreements with two investors for them to purchase up to $121,500 of common stock at a price of $0.30 per share. The total proceeds received from the subscription agreement total $29,000 with the balance to be paid over the next three months. Since we will not have a commercial product in the next twelve months, we will have to rely on outside funding to support our operations and product development and testing efforts. Given the financial state of NU-MED, we will not be able to seek traditional bank financing and have to rely on private stock sales as we did in 2012 as well as potential loans from investors and shareholders. At this time, we have no commitments from any party to help fund our operations and if we are unable to raise additional capital, we will be force to shut operations until such capital can be raised or go out of business. At this time, we cannot say the full costs to bring our proposed product to market or the timing of such commercialization. Given the nature of our product being in the medical field, testing is very expensive and we would need more capital prior to completing the testing phase. Any refinement or modification of the product after the prototype is developed would also require additional capital. At this time, we will have to continue to rely on outside capital and a budget that may require adjustment as we move further in the product development phase.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  For the three months ended March 31, 2014, we had no revenues and expense associated with our operations of $178,988 resulted in a net loss of $213,625 compared to a net loss of $82,658 for the three months ended March 31, 2013.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.  The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements and it is not anticipated that the Company will enter into any off-balance sheet arrangements.  -15-  Forward-looking Statements  Our Company and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are "forward-looking," including statements contained in this Quarterly Report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our Company's stockholders. Management believes that all statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters, as well as from developments beyond our Company's control including changes in global economic conditions are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. These statements are made on the basis of management's views and assumptions, as of the time the statements are made, regarding future events and business performance. There can be no assurance, however, that management's expectations will necessarily come to pass. Factors that may affect forward- looking statements include a wide range of factors that could materially affect future developments and performance, including the following:  Changes in Company-wide strategies, which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which our Company is involved or chooses to invest; changes in U.S., global or regional economic conditions, changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including significant interest rate fluctuations, which may impede our Company's access to, or increase the cost of, external financing for our operations and investments; increased competitive pressures, both domestically and internationally, legal and regulatory developments, such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities, the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions and changes in international tax laws or currency controls; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, labor disputes, which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations.  This list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements is illustrative, but by no means exhaustive. Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.  May 13, 2014  (c) 1995-2014 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

The Nu-Med Plus mission is to design, develop and market new patented technologies in the medical field along with building key intellectual assets. Our strategy is to focus on high growth potential markets where there is a clearly defined need recognized by the medical community that can be addressed by Nu-Med Plus and its’ technological expertise.
Our initial market focus is on medical applications for Nitric Oxide (NO).  NO is an important, naturally-occurring molecule, widely recognized for its’ importance in a number of biological processes.  NO has the potential for treating diseases ranging from malaria to neonatal hypertension. Nu-Med Plus has developed inhaled Nitric Oxide products for use in hospital settings as well as for longer term applications outside hospital surroundings.* Our product candidates are designed to deliver NO safely for a variety of therapeutic indications to clinicians and other end users. Nu–Med Plus will provide solutions that are less expensive and more user-friendly.  In addition, the company has designed a NO delivery system that is lightweight and portable.  Nu-Med Plus’ medical devices deliver cost effective inhaled Nitric Oxide to patients in a manner unique to the market.
(* Nu-Med's Nitric Oxide delivery systems are investigational and limited by federal law to investigational use only. Our units will require testing and FDA approval prior to any commercial use.)
We invite you to learn more about our efforts and the medical significance of Nitric Oxide by browsing through our website.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
