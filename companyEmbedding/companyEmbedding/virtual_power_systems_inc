Virtual Power Systems, Inc. Key Developments

CUI Inc. Signs Hardware Development Agreement with Virtual Power Systems
Jan 25 16
CUI Inc. has entered into a limited exclusivity agreement for hardware development with Virtual Power Systems (VPS). The companies will partner to set a new standard for an efficient power infrastructure for data centers. With this agreement, CUI will exclusively design, manufacture, and sell the ICE Block hardware component of the ICE (Intelligent Control of Energy) system that realizes the full value of the VPS solution. The ICE Block hardware is managed and controlled through the ICE Platform, a tightly integrated suite of software developed by VPS. The ICE Block will enable data center operators to double power and server utilization, reduce costs, and greatly improve availability. This partnership between the two organizations is the first step in creating a larger Software Defined Power ecosystem, from board level to system level, ultimately creating a more intelligent, more efficient data center infrastructure. A fully integrated data center can see a 15% to 25% reduction in power cost, with a capex at 40% to 60% of a traditional investment with the combined ICE system. In addition, this new infrastructure will enable data centers to continue their aggressive growth paths via a solution that can be installed in just days vs. the months required with traditional approaches. Data center operators can immediately experience significant improvements.

CUI Inc and its parent company CUI Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: CUI), today announced that they have entered into an agreement to be the exclusive third party hardware design and development provider for Virtual Power Systems (VPS), a cutting edge Software Defined Power® company. This agreement further expands the previously announced limited exclusivity agreement for hardware development with VPS as the companies will continue to partner in setting a new standard for an efficient power infrastructure.“We view software as the next step in redefining the way engineers look at power supply design,” explained Matt McKenzie, President of CUI Inc. “By becoming VPS’ exclusive hardware design firm, CUI will be able to better support our valued partner as they continue to expand the reach of their industry-changing software.”With this agreement, CUI will become VPS’ key hardware design resource for their ICE® (Intelligent Control of Energy) solution, enabling both CUI as well as third party power vendors to leverage its design services to accelerate time to market with VPS solutions. CUI will provide hardware design support for the ICE Block component of the system that is managed through the ICE Platform, a tightly integrated suite of software developed by VPS. The ICE system brings the benefits of elastic power to data centers, doubling power, reducing costs and improving reliability through a fully automated solution. Additionally, the new agreement will seek to expand beyond data center infrastructure and enter all market segments and applications that would benefit from a complete Software Defined Power® ecosystem.“CUI has proven to be a key partner on the hardware side of the Software Defined Power infrastructure and has been a great match with our innovative software. This expanded agreement enables a wider array of product offerings by CUI and third party vendors allowing for faster adoption into new markets and applications in the future,” stated Shankar Ramamurthy, CEO of Virtual Power Systems.“We have been incredibly pleased by our partnership with VPS and this announcement further solidifies our commitment to support leading edge innovations,” said William Clough, CUI Global’s President & CEO. “Our diversified portfolio of key partnerships and technologies will further drive profitability and bring value to our shareholders as CUI expands into ever-larger markets,” concluded Clough.

CUI and Virtual Power Systems Forge Strategic Partnership to Develop a More Intelligent, Efficient Data Center Infrastructure

CUI Inc and its parent company CUI Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:CUI), announced a limited exclusivity agreement today for hardware development with Virtual Power Systems (VPS), a cutting edge Software Defined Power® company. The companies will partner to set a new standard for an efficient power infrastructure for data centers.
With this agreement, CUI will design, manufacture, and distribute the hardware component of the ICE (Intelligent Control of Energy) system that realizes the full value of the VPS solution. The ICE Block hardware is managed and controlled through the ICE Platform, a tightly integrated suite of software developed by VPS. The ICE Block will enable data center operators to double power and server utilization, reduce costs, and greatly improve availability. This partnership between the two organizations is the first step in creating a larger Software Defined Power ecosystem, from board level to system level, ultimately creating a more intelligent, more efficient data center infrastructure.
“We continue to look for partners that add value to the entire power ecosystem,” said Matt McKenzie, President of CUI Inc. “This partnership is the first that is outside of the power supply itself and adds significant value to our entire power infrastructure portfolio, from board to rack level.”
Through numerous surveys and studies, data center power consistently emerges as the most critical area that needs to be addressed to support the growth of ”Internet of Things”, mobile, and supporting infrastructure. The first ICE Block is under development now, with initial prototype installs coming later in 2016.
“We see VPS’s patented technology as a difference maker for the data center, but we also see value in other markets going forward,” added McKenzie. “A true Software Defined Power ecosystem requires a collaborative effort, and our partnership with VPS is the first of many we will look to so we can continue to support this space in new and innovative ways.”
An existing data center can see up to a 15-25% reduction in power cost coupled with the avoidance of 40-60% of conventional capex investment with the combined ICE system. In addition, this new infrastructure will enable data centers to continue their aggressive growth paths via a solution that can be installed and initialized in just days vs. the months required with traditional approaches. Data center operators can immediately experience significant improvements in operational flexibility, utilization, and management.
“VPS needed a partner that could move quickly, understood the value of Software Defined Power, and had the design capabilities required to develop the hardware that could mate with our innovative software. CUI became the logical choice as our hardware partner,” said Shankar Ramamurthy, CEO of Virtual Power Systems.
CUI and Virtual Power Systems will plan to demonstrate the technology at APEC (Applied Power Electronics Conference) in Long Beach, CA from March 20th to the 24th.

CyberPower manufactures high-quality UPS systems, PDUs, surge protectors, mobile chargers, and connectivity products for consumers and IT professionals. As an industry leader, we continue to provide a wide range of power solutions to safeguard your critical equipment and valued data.












UPS Systems 

 

				CyberPower offers IT professionals and home office users a broad selection of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) solutions, all designed to protect sensitive electronic equipment and vital data from potential harm. The three topologies — standby, line interactive, and double-conversion — offer different levels of protection from power problems to address the needs of users in varying environments. The waveform output is either sine wave or simulated sine wave, depending upon the product family and model. These forms of output are crucial to the optimal performance of connected equipment. Typical features include energy-saving GreenPower UPS™ design, data line protection, and management software to easily control and monitor your UPS.

PDUs 

 

				CyberPower Power Distribution Units (PDUs) distribute reliable network power to multiple devices. Rather than generating conditioned power, a PDU delivers AC power from a UPS (uninterruptible power supply), a generator, or utility power source to servers, network/telecom equipment, and other devices. Selecting the best PDU for your needs depends on the output voltage required, the number of outlets needed for connected devices, plug and outlet types, mounting options, and other factors. CyberPower offers a PDU solution to meet a range of purposes. We offer the several product families: Basic, Metered, Monitored, Switched, Switched Metered-by-Outlet, Metered ATS, Switched ATS and Maintenance Bypass PDUs.
