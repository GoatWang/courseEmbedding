Denise L. Ramos Joins ITT Corporation as Chief Financial Officer







5/21/2007

Denise L. Ramos Joins ITT Corporation as Chief Financial Officer 

White Plains, N.Y. - May 21, 2007 -  ITT Corporation (NYSE: ITT) announced today that Denise L. Ramos will join the Company as Chief Financial Officer, effective July 1, 2007.  Ms. Ramos, 50, currently Chief Financial Officer of Furniture Brands International, will succeed George E. Minnich, 57, who is retiring from the Company. 

        Ms. Ramos brings broad industry and functional experience to this position, with almost 30 years of financial assignments at several industry-leading companies.  In her current role, which she has held since February 2005, Ms. Ramos was instrumental in designing corporate strategy and enhancing the planning process for this $2.4 billion manufacturer, marketer and retailer of residential furniture.   

        Her previous experience included five years at Yum! Brands, Inc. in Louisville, Kentucky, where she was Senior Vice President and Corporate Treasurer for Yum! and Chief Financial Officer for KFC.  She began her career at Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) of Los Angeles, California, where she spent 21 years in a number of increasingly responsible finance positions, including Corporate Internal Auditor and Assistant Treasurer, the position she held when the company was acquired in 2000 by British Petroleum. She holds an M.B.A. in finance from the University of Chicago. 

        In making the announcement, ITT Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Steve Loranger said, "We are delighted to welcome Denise to the strong leadership team of ITT.  She brings a wealth of experience in her area of expertise, and is known as an executive with great visionary and strategic capability, solid communication skills, and a history of building strong partnerships and developing talent.  I know she will be a tremendous asset to our Company and to our senior leadership team. We look forward to her contributions in moving our business forward." 

        Mr. Loranger continued, "As ITT's CFO, George Minnich has been a strong partner to me, and has brought great perspective and guidance to the business as we have worked to position ourselves for future growth.  Over the past few months, it became clear that George's horizon for retirement did not align with our need to have a CFO in place who can lead ITT's financial strategy and execution for the long term.  We are grateful for George's many contributions during his tenure in this role. Under his leadership, our company has continued its strong performance as we realigned the portfolio, launched our share repurchase program and made great progress in building a world-class finance organization.  We wish George the very best in his future endeavors." 

        Mr. Minnich will remain at the Company through the end of July to ensure a smooth transition.  

        Mr. Loranger will speak at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time today at the 2007 Electrical Products Group Conference in Longboat Key, Florida, where he will confirm the Company's strong financial outlook and say that the Company believes robust organic revenue growth, coupled with execution of operational initiatives, provides it with a high level of confidence in successfully achieving its existing 2007 financial targets.
