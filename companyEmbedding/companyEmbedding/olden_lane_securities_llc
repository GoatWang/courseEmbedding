Who We Are
Olden Lane Advisors LLC ("Olden Lane") is developing the next generation of liquid alternative investment products. We seek to bring new options to the liquid alternatives movement, offering potential advantages including liquidity, transparency, lower costs and faster development times.
We work closely with clients including institutional investors, private banks and wealth managers. Our Target Outcome Funds can be offered as '40 Act registered funds or customized private trusts, both of which can be tailored to meet investor requirements for specific exposures or target outcomes.
Traditionally alternative investments have allowed investors to diversify their portfolios with return streams less correlated to equities and fixed income investments. Our products hope to add a new set of options for investors beyond simple diversification.
Established in 2015, Olden Lane has built a team with decades of experience in alternative investments, liquid alternatives, product structuring and distribution – experience which has been central to our ability to innovate.

Our Philosophy
Olden Lane is grounded in a culture of high performance, operational excellence, and close partnership. We seek to provide a premium service to a select number of financial institutions. Transparency and clarity are the foundation of our work and the catalysts of our competitive edge in an underserved market.
one size does not fit all
Olden Lane believes that in investing "one size does not fit all." We work diligently to match an expected investment outcome to the needs of a particular investor. We can structure solutions utilizing both registered investment companies and private trusts; include credit enhancement features; and deliver specific investment exposures or target desired investment outcomes.
What you see iswhat you get
Olden Lane believes that a well-structured investment must include a clear statement of risks. We understand that many of our structures, even those which employ credit enhancements, have additional risks that must be considered before investment. To assist investors in understanding the risks inherent in an investment, Olden Lane is committed to a process of careful attention in construction and design and is highly focused on the presentation of risks in marketing and sales materials. We believe strongly that an investor should enter every investment decision with an accurate, clear and balanced articulation of how the product works.

Our Strategies
Our business responds to the growing demand for more liquid and regulated alternative investment products. Olden Lane works with institutional clients to provide solutions that might benefit individual and institutional clients alike. Growth is being driven by investor demand for strategies and asset classes that can diversify portfolios through income streams less correlated to equity and fixed income investments.
In working with clients, Olden Lane generally classifies alternative investment return streams into two categories.

Access products
Delivering exposure to a specific asset class or risk factor.
— For example, many of today’s investors are interested in accessing the return streams of asset classes traditionally beyond the reach of all but the most sophisticated investors.


Outcome products
Targeting a specific return unattainable though a traditional equity or fixed income investment.
— For example, an investor may desire an enhanced level of equity market upside or some protection against downside loss.


Next



Our Target Outcome Funds
 
Olden Lane’s Target Outcome Funds bring a new combination of capability and convenience to portfolio and risk management. This new family of innovative funds provides investors a broad set of alternatives to build more robust and resilient portfolios. Each Target Outcome Fund allows investors to participate in the return of a benchmark market index or other reference asset over a certain period of time and within specific risk constraints. These funds generally offer some measure of principal protection in exchange for a limit on participation in price appreciation. Some funds may also include features that leverage a particular return profile. In all cases, Target Outcome Funds are designed to provide an investor with the means to target an investment outcome aligned with his/her objectives and risk tolerance.
Target Outcome Funds are designed to reduce the risk and uncertainty inherent in the capital markets. The range of outcomes over a certain interval of time is defined when the fund is brought to market. The outcome orientation of these funds brings a new dimension to the rapidly growing market for index investing.  In a Target Outcome Fund, the uncertainty of an unconstrained allocation is replaced by a confidence in a controlled allocation. Target Outcome Funds encourage investors to consider how both positive and negative markets might affect their portfolios, allowing for better planning and portfolio management.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. Olden Lane Trust is a UIT that is registered under the Act. Any future Trust will be a registered UIT. Olden Lane, a Delaware limited liability company, is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is the Depositor of Olden Lane Trust. Each Series will be created by a supplement to a master trust agreement between the Depositor and a banking institution or trust company as trustee.
2. The Depositor acquires a portfolio of securities, which it deposits with the series custodian (“Series Custodian”) in exchange for certificates representing units of fractional undivided interest in the Series' portfolio (“Units”). The Units are offered to the public through the Depositor and dealers at a price which, during the initial offering period, is based upon the aggregate market value of the underlying portfolio, or, the aggregate offering side evaluation of the underlying securities if the underlying securities are not listed on a securities exchange, plus a front-end sales charge, a deferred sales charge or both. The maximum sales charge may be reduced in compliance with rule 22d-1 under the Act in certain circumstances, which are disclosed in the Series' prospectus.
3. The Depositor may, but is not legally obligated to, maintain a secondary market for Units of an outstanding Series. Other broker-dealers may or may not maintain a secondary market for Units of a Series. If a secondary market is maintained, investors will be able to purchase Units on the secondary market at the current public offering price plus a front-end sales charge. If such a market is not maintained at any time for any Series, holders of the Units (“Unitholders”) of that Series may redeem their Units through the Series Custodian.
A. Deferred Sales Charge and Waiver of Deferred Sales Charge Under Certain Circumstances
1. Applicants request an order to the extent necessary to permit one or more Series to impose a sales charge on a deferred basis (“DSC”). For each Series, the Depositor would set a maximum sales charge per Unit, a portion of which may be collected “up front” (i.e., at the time an investor purchases the Units). The DSC would be collected subsequently in installments (“Installment Payments”) as described in the application. The Depositor would not add any amount for interest or any similar or related charge to adjust for such deferral.
2. When a Unitholder redeems or sells Units, the Depositor intends to deduct any unpaid DSC from the redemption or sale proceeds. When calculating the amount due, the Depositor will assume that Units on which the DSC has been paid in full are redeemed or sold first. With respect to Units on which the DSC has not been paid in full, the Depositor will assume that the Units held for the longest time are redeemed or sold first. Applicants represent that the DSC collected at the time of redemption or sale, together with the Installment Payments and any amount collected up front, will not exceed the maximum sales charge per Unit. Under certain circumstances, the Depositor may waive the collection of any unpaid DSC in connection with redemptions or sales of Units. These circumstances will be disclosed in the prospectus for the relevant Series and implemented in accordance with rule 22d-1 under the Act.
3. Each Series offering Units subject to a DSC will state the maximum charge per Unit in its prospectus. In addition, the prospectus for such Series will include the table required by Form N-1A (modified as appropriate to reflect the difference between UITs and open-end management investment companies) and a schedule setting forth the number and date of each Installment Payment, along with the duration of the collection period. The prospectus also will disclose that portfolio securities may be sold to pay the DSC if distribution income is insufficient and that securities will be sold pro rata, if practicable, otherwise a specific security will be designated for sale.
B. Exchange Option and Rollover Option
1. Applicants request an order to the extent necessary to permit Unitholders of a Series to exchange their Units for Units of another Series (“Exchange Option”) and Unitholders of a Series that is terminating to exchange their Units for Units of a new Series of the same type (“Rollover Option”). The Exchange Option and Rollover Option would apply to all exchanges of Units sold with a front-end sales charge, a DSC or both.
2. A Unitholder who purchases Units under the Exchange Option or Rollover Option would pay a lower sales charge than that which would be paid for the Units by a new investor. The reduced sales charge will be reasonably related to the expenses incurred in connection with the administration of the DSC program, which may include an amount that will fairly and adequately compensate the Depositor and participating underwriters and brokers for their services in providing the DSC program.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
A. DSC and Waiver of DSC
1. Section 4(2) of the Act defines a “unit investment trust” as an investment company that issues only redeemable securities. Section 2(a)(32) of the Act defines a “redeemable security” as a security that, upon its presentation to the issuer, entitles the holder to receive approximately his or her proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets or the cash equivalent of those assets. Rule 22c-1 under the Act requires that the price of a redeemable security issued by a registered investment company for purposes of sale, redemption or repurchase be based on the security's current net asset value (“NAV”). Because the collection of any unpaid DSC may cause a redeeming Unitholder to receive an amount less than the NAV of the redeemed Units, applicants request relief from section 2(a)(32) and rule 22c-1.
2. Section 22(d) of the Act and rule 22d-1 under the Act require a registered investment company and its principal underwriter and dealers to sell securities only at the current public offering price described in the investment company's prospectus, with the exception of sales of redeemable securities at prices that reflect scheduled variations in the sales load. Section 2(a)(35) of the Act defines the term “sales load” as the difference between the sales price and the portion of the proceeds invested by the Start Printed Page 17050depositor or trustee. Applicants request relief from section 2(a)(35) and section 22(d) to permit waivers, deferrals or other scheduled variations of the sales load.
3. Under section 6(c) of the Act, the Commission may exempt classes of transactions, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that their proposal meets the standards of section 6(c). Applicants state that the provisions of section 22(d) are intended to prevent (a) riskless trading in investment company securities due to backward pricing, (b) disruption of orderly distribution by dealers selling shares at a discount, and (c) discrimination among investors resulting from different prices charged to different investors. Applicants assert that the proposed DSC program will present none of these abuses. Applicants further state that all scheduled variations in the sales load will be disclosed in the prospectus of each Series and applied uniformly to all investors, and that applicants will comply with all the conditions set forth in rule 22d-1.
4. Section 26(a)(2)(C) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits a trustee or custodian of a UIT from collecting from the trust as an expense any payment to the trust's depositor or principal underwriter. Because the Series Custodian's payment of the DSC to the Depositor may be deemed to be an expense under section 26(a)(2)(C), applicants request relief under section 6(c) from section 26(a)(2)(C) to the extent necessary to permit the Series Custodian to collect Installment Payments and disburse them to the Depositor. Applicants submit that the relief is appropriate because the DSC is more properly characterized as a sales load.
B. Exchange Option and Rollover Option
1. Sections 11(a) and 11(c) of the Act prohibit any offer of exchange by a UIT for the securities of another investment company unless the terms of the offer have been approved in advance by the Commission. Applicants request an order under sections 11(a) and 11(c) for Commission approval of the Exchange Option and the Rollover Option.
C. Net Worth Requirement
1. Section 14(a) of the Act requires that a registered investment company have $100,000 of net worth prior to making a public offering. Applicants state that each Series will comply with this requirement because the Depositor will deposit more than $100,000 of securities. Applicants assert, however, that the Commission has interpreted section 14(a) as requiring that the initial capital investment in an investment company be made without any intention to dispose of the investment. Applicants state that, under this interpretation, a Series would not satisfy section 14(a) because of the Depositor's intention to sell all the Units of the Series.
2. Rule 14a-3 under the Act exempts UITs from section 14(a) if certain conditions are met, one of which is that the UIT invest only in “eligible trust securities,” as defined in the rule. Applicants state that they may not rely on rule 14a-3 because certain Series (collectively, “Structured Series”) will invest all or a portion of their assets in equity securities, debt securities, shares of registered investment companies, Flexible Exchange® Options (“FLEX Options”),[2] 
           or other assets which do not satisfy the definition of eligible trust securities.
3. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act to the extent necessary to exempt the Structured Series from the net worth requirement in section 14(a). Applicants state that the Series and the Depositor will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 14a-3, except that the Structured Series will not restrict their portfolio investments to “eligible trust securities.”
D. Capital Gains Distribution
1. Section 19(b) of the Act and rule 19b-1 under the Act provide that, except under limited circumstances, no registered investment company may distribute long-term gains more than once every twelve months. Rule 19b-1(c), under certain circumstances, exempts a UIT investing in eligible trust securities (as defined in rule 14a-3) from the requirements of rule 19b-1. Because the Structured Series do not limit their investments to eligible trust securities, however, the Structured Series will not qualify for the exemption in paragraph (c) of rule 19b-1. Applicants therefore request an exemption under section 6(c) from section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 to the extent necessary to permit capital gains earned in connection with the sale of portfolio securities to be distributed to Unitholders along with the Structured Series' regular distributions. In all other respects, applicants will comply with section 19(b) and rule 19b-1.
2. Applicants state that their proposal meets the standards of section 6(c). Applicants assert that any sale of portfolio securities would be triggered by the need to meet Trust expenses, Installment Payments, or by redemption requests, events over which the Depositor and the Structured Series do not have control. Applicants further state that, because principal distributions must be clearly indicated in accompanying reports to Unitholders as a return of principal and will be relatively small in comparison to normal dividend distributions, there is little danger of confusion from failure to differentiate among distributions.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
A. DSC Relief and Exchange and Rollover Options
1. Whenever the Exchange Option or Rollover Option is to be terminated or its terms are to be amended materially, any holder of a security subject to that privilege will be given prominent notice of the impending termination or amendment at least 60 days prior to the date of termination or the effective date of the amendment, provided that: (a) No such notice need be given if the only material effect of an amendment is to reduce or eliminate the sales charge payable at the time of an exchange, to add one or more new Series eligible for the Exchange Option or the Rollover Option, or to delete a Series which has terminated; and (b) no notice need be given if, under extraordinary circumstances, either (i) there is a suspension of the redemption of Units of the Series under section 22(e) of the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or (ii) a Series temporarily delays or ceases the sale of its Units because it is unable to invest amounts effectively in accordance with applicable investment objectives, policies and restrictions.
2. An investor who purchases Units under the Exchange Option or Rollover Option will pay a lower sales charge than that which would be paid for the Units by a new investor.
3. The prospectus of each Series offering exchanges or rollovers and any sales literature or advertising that mentions the existence of the Exchange Option or Rollover Option will disclose that the Exchange Option and the Start Printed Page 17051Rollover Option are subject to modification, termination or suspension without notice, except in certain limited cases.
4. Any DSC imposed on a Series' Units will comply with the requirements of subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3) of rule 6c-10(a) under the Act.
5. Each Series offering Units subject to a DSC will include in its prospectus the disclosure required by Form N-1A relating to deferred sales charges (modified as appropriate to reflect the differences between UITs and open-end management investment companies) and a schedule setting forth the number and date of each Installment Payment.
B. Net Worth Requirement
Applicants will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 14a-3 under the Act, except that the Structured Series will not restrict their portfolio investments to “eligible trust securities.”

Financial Group, LLC (member of FINRA and SIPC, and an indirect majority owned subsidiary of Institutional Financial Markets, Inc. (NYSE MKT: IFMI)) ("JVB Financial") today announced that it has partnered with Olden Lane Securities LLC ("Olden Lane") to launch a new series of innovative unit investment trusts (UITs) called Target Outcome Funds.    Target Outcome Funds are a new category of UITs developed by Olden Lane and designed to offer a liquid, transparent and cost-effective vehicle for outcome-driven returns.  Through combining US Treasuries and exchange-listed option contracts which reference ETFs tracking broad-based equity indexes, Target Outcome Funds can offer efficient exposure to equity-market benchmarks within certain risk parameters, such as protection against downside risk.  UITs developed on Olden Lane's platform are designed to provide better liquidity and transparency, and lower counterparty risk, versus similar products currently offered as structured notes. The first series, offered by JVB Financial, is titled "Capped Performance Portfolio with Buffer Protection Linked to the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust" and seeks leveraged capital appreciation based on the three year price performance of the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust. The Trust's return will be subject to a cap of 25% and will seek to provide protection against the first 15% of any decline in the price of the reference fund, in each case, before fees and expenses."The leveraged buffered strategy has been a very popular structure used in wealth management channels for years. We've seen advisors and portfolio managers invest hundreds of millions of dollars in this strategy in the form of structured notes," said John G. Tessar III, CFP®, Head of Structured Investments at JVB Financial. "Through our partnership with Olden Lane, we can now offer a similar strategy in UIT form with improved price transparency, daily pricing and liquidity, and reduced counterparty risk." "We are excited to partner with JVB Financial to launch our first product in what will be the next generation of liquid alternatives," said Michel S. Serieyssol, Olden Lane Founding Partner.  "Our firm was founded on the belief that UITs offer a superior structure for outcome-driven investments. We've refined and improved the UIT architecture so that it can be utilized as an innovative portfolio management tool to help investors manage their portfolios with greater discipline, purpose and risk management.  UITs developed on our platform offer strong liquidity and transparency, reduced counterparty risk, and '40 Act registration, resulting in more compelling and effective products for investors."Olden Lane, established in 2015, has assembled a team with decades of experience in alternative investments, liquid alternatives, product structuring and distribution – experience which has been central to the firm's ability to innovate.For more information about JVB Financial and Olden Lane, please visit www.jvbfinancial.com and www.oldenlane.com, respectively.____________________________________________________Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus.
