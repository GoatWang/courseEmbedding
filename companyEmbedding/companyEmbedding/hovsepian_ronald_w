‹ Previous ArticleNext Article ›× BACK TO CIO ARTICLESRonald W. Hovsepian, President & CEO, Intralinks, on the company’s new product designed for secure enterprise collaboration, Intralinks VIATM
JASON REDLUS:  Why don’t you tell us a little bit about who you are and your background before you came to Intralinks?
RONALD HOVSEPIAN:  I spent just under 17 years at IBM in a variety of roles, from sales, to marketing and development of both hardware and software, and finally services. I had a wonderful, well-rounded experience at IBM. From there, I went to the venture capital part of the industry, which gave me a great appreciation for the creativity and startup mentality that one needs to have in the technology business. After that, I ran Novell, a billion-dollar enterprise software company, which gave me additional experience.
How did you come to Intralinks?
It’s a small world. I happened to have a distant acquaintance with one of the board members, and one day that person called me and asked if I’d be interested in the job. So I looked at the company, and three things really leaped out at me. One was the technology platform that the team had built, which showed a lot of innovation. Two, I felt the company had an opportunity to address some of the broader customer needs in a very controlled and compliant manner. And three, I saw that the company had grown very nicely but that growth had slowed, and I saw an opportunity for the next level of growth. I felt that I had the right skill set to help the company grow to that next level.
What does Intralinks do?
Intralinks is a technology provider of beyond-the-firewall collaboration solutions. Over 800 of the global Fortune 1000 use Intralinks to securely share content and collaborate with business partners and customers. We got our start 16 years ago when we created the first virtual data rooms, used to support the complex and highly regulated process of managing strategic financial transactions. Over the years Intralinks solutions have been used to support over $19 trillion in transactions involving over a billion documents.
In its simplest form, our service allows companies to share information in a highly controlled, compliant way. Companies can share information with outside business partners in a controlled manner that allows them to monitor who has seen the information, how long they have looked at it, and what they did with it. The company manages the rights, permissions and controls of that information. Businesses can ultimately use that information in a workflow. We do this extremely well.
What are some examples that illustrate that?
As I mentioned earlier, banks frequently share very sensitive client data and other data for bidding purposes, such as hedging, or when they’re putting together loan syndications. Intralinks allows those banks to put all of that data together in a common platform and permit multiple people to access that data from a controlled point of view.
The life sciences or pharmaceuticals industry is another good example because of the drug trials that a pharma company has to go through. In these trials, they have to coordinate and manage access for many people in a very controlled manner, including the investigator running the clinical trial who needs to upload patient files, all of the doctors involved, the chemical company that produces the compound, various people within their company who designed the drug, and the federal regulators. All of these people need access to information and the ability to input new information in a very organized, documented manner with various levels of control, or else the trial has to start all over again. That can mean another three-year delay before the drug is approved. So our product is critical for companies who need to share sensitive data beyond the firewall.
In all industries, we’re seeing more and more that information needs to be shared beyond a business’s four walls. But while most systems have been designed to protect data from coming in, they’re not designed to manage information in that broader manner.
I noticed that you’ve augmented your portfolio recently with some new acquisitions. Can you talk a little bit about those recent announcements?
Yes, I can. Advisors and anybody who advises clients on acquisitions are  tasked with helping their clients sell or augment the size of their companies, and there are a lot of medium-sized firms around the globe that are looking to grow. However, those firms don’t always know how to grow. For example, a toy manufacturer in Australia might want to buy a toy manufacturer in Latin America to get a footprint in that region, but they don’t know how to initiate that relationship.
To solve these problems, we’ve acquired two companies, PE-Nexus in the U.S. and MergerID in Europe, and are in the process of combining them to create the largest company for advisors to use as a tool for deal sourcing. So, whether you’re an advisor for a toy company in Australia or a cement company in Southeast Asia, you can go online and use this advisory service to help your clients. It will allow transactions to occur faster in the marketplace and allow advisors to more effectively manage their relationships. With these acquisitions, Intralinks now offers a unique end-to-end solution for managing the full lifecycle of strategic transactions, from deal preparation, marketing and sourcing through to due diligence and execution. We think that’s critical for success in that marketplace in the long run.
There has been a lot of buzz around the work you’re doing in your partnerships with CIOs and CISOs. Can you talk a little bit about what you’re doing there? What are the parallels between those two offices, and what are some of the unique opportunities presented in working with those leaders?
We have. When I joined Intralinks I saw an opportunity to apply our technology and expertise to address a growing problem for enterprise CIOs and CISOs – the need to securely manage their information outside-the-firewall. Most organizations need to share and collaborate with partners, customers and suppliers on a regular basis, but they struggle to do this in an efficient and controlled way. Many use email or FTP, or have brought consumer-grade file sharing apps into their company, exposing themselves to security risks. I saw an opportunity to address this issue.
So we stepped back and did some market research on where our customers are going and what issues they’re facing. We surveyed 652 business and IT leaders and followed that up with a series of direct interviews with around 70 of those leaders to get very specific details about what was needed in the market. Through that, we were able to identify five categories of client needs that were shifting in the technology market regarding how they share information outside of their enterprise. First, our clients want technology that is extremely secure and allows them to have full control over their information at all times, no matter where it travels. Second, they want more control from an IT perspective. Third, they want ease-of-use so that their end users will be able to comfortably and easily collaborate outside their company and create ad hoc work streams. Fourth, IT in particular needs better management tools so they understand where information is traveling, who has access, and so on. And fifth, our clients want better connections to their current internal enterprise systems.
It was this research that led us to develop our new product Intralinks VIA. What was really fascinating about our research was the amount of people who communicated that they really need to share information in order to get work done. There has been a lot of talk about file-sharing opportunities in the marketplace today, but our new product, Intralinks VIA, is unique in that it not only allows companies to share their information in a file-sharing format but to do so in a controlled manner within a work stream outside of the enterprise.
I think it’s important for CIOs and CISOs to understand that you really have to think holistically beyond the firewall, rather than trying to attack it in pieces—everything from data location right through to the concepts of work streams and the chain of custody for documents and content.
That issue has continued to be a topic of discussion, particularly regarding which devices people are going to use to access this information. It’s essentially becoming BYOC—bring your own collaboration. What’s driving this trend?
The consumerization of IT is having profound effects. It’s routine now for employees to use multiple consumer platforms to do work, and increasingly this means that they’re co-opting their personal DropBox account or Google Drive to share business information.
We factored this in when we designed Intralinks VIA. We knew that we needed a solution that was intuitive and easy to us. For example, a native feature built into the iPad framework is the ability to switch between screens by flipping your hand to the right or left. Because customers are used to that framework, we have to think about how our applications operate within that native toolset and adapt accordingly. Our research communicated the necessity of that loud and clear. As a matter of fact, our market research shows that over 90 percent of our customers wanted us to make sure that the Intralinks VIA product was driven by the native tools on various platforms—IOS platform, Android and Windows. So we did the extra work to make sure that our software operates on those devices in the way that our consumers are used to using them.
So, BYOC could also mean “bring your own consumer” because of the consumer collaborative phenomenon happening in the technology market. Fortunately, IT doesn’t have to worry about that problem anymore. We’re addressing that for them on whatever device they choose.
Is this related to the concept of UNsharing? How does that come into the mix?
Yes, that was part of the research. When we talked to consumers, they asked for something very simple: “Give me control.” We kept coming back to a conversation about wanting to share information with an outside colleague and then being able to take that information back after the work stream is completed.
So we’ve come up with the technology to do that. We call it UNsharing, and it exists within the Intralinks VIA product in two dimensions. First, you can place a timed expiration date on that information, which means that the other user has the right to access it for, say, 30 days, and after that, the user can no longer access the encrypted file. We also have a self-shredding feature installed as well, just to make sure that the information is securely removed from that device.
Secondly, we offer the ability to revoke the permissions to that encrypted file at any time. This is important. Whether we care to admit it or not, we’ve all sent the wrong file to the wrong person, and wished we’d had the ability to somehow get that file back. Now, you can.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Every once in a while, you read about how the amount of data generated by an organization is tripling and quadrupling. Are organizations seeing a greater outflow of information as the amount of data continues to increase?
Absolutely, and as I’ve mentioned before, the issue with that is that most architectures were built to protect what comes into the datasets and content but not the other way around. That’s why UNshare is so exciting—when I download that technology on my iPad, I’m synchronizing that device with my iPhone and PC. So there are technically three copies of that encrypted file on all three devices. When I’m done sharing that information, I can easily make sure that I pull all of that information off those devices. That’s where we’ve seen the largest upticks in usage.
Is there anything I didn’t ask that you think is important to share?
One exciting piece of news is that we are getting ready to publicly announce our first beta customer, the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes F1 team. As you can imagine, an F1 racing team has a lot of proprietary data and trade secrets that they’re constantly working to protect in order to maintain their edge because it’s so tenuous in their industry. In our discussions with them, they shared some of the challenges they face regarding collaborations outside their firewall and their need to audit and track all of the pieces that go out. Most importantly, they need to be able to UNshare information when they’re done with a particular partner. That was critical for them. So they selected us to be a key partner in sharing their intellectual property, and we’re very excited about working with them.
I’d also encourage people to try Intralinks VIA, which is available as a free download at http://www.intralinks.com/via/try.html.

@ThingsExpo BlogsBuilding & Securing the Workplace of the FutureBy Karyn JefferyFor any business to be successful, it must enable talent to focus on the innovation that will drive new value. As digital literacy and dexterity grows, people are increasingly agnostic about devices – they want to be able to access their personalized workspace and services anywhere, at any time, on any device that happens to be at hand. 
The concept of digital transformation is gathering pace. When Gartner surveyed 388 CEOs recently, 56% said their digital improvements had already increased profits. But there’s also significant pressure, with 47% reporting challenges from the board of directo...Jul. 24, 2017 04:34 PM EDT  Reads: 195IoT and the Network: A Health CheckBy Kevin SparenbergWithout a doubt, we’re at a tipping point when it comes to security and the Internet of Things (IoT). Recently, security flaws have been exposed in consumer products, including children’s toys, baby monitors, cars, and pacemakers. In late October 2016, Dyn®, an internet infrastructure vendor, suffered a malicious DDoS attack that was achieved by leveraging malware on IoT devices such as webcams and printers that were connected to the Dyn network. 
No, IoT security concerns are not new. In fact, any device that’s connected to a network represents an opportunity for malicious activity. But what...Jul. 24, 2017 03:29 PM EDT  Reads: 225DXWorldExpo to “Sponsor” Cloud Expo CASYS-CON Events announced today that DXWorldExpo has been named “Global Sponsor” of SYS-CON's 21st International Cloud Expo, which will take place on Oct 31 – Nov 2, 2017, at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara, CA. Digital Transformation is the key issue driving the global enterprise IT business. Digital Transformation is most prominent among Global 2000 enterprises and government institutions.Jul. 24, 2017 05:30 AM EDT  Reads: 1,140[slides] IoT Network Data AnalyticsBy Elizabeth WhiteWhile the focus and objectives of IoT initiatives are many and diverse, they all share a few common attributes, and one of those is the network. Commonly, that network includes the Internet, over which there isn't any real control for performance and availability. Or is there? The current state of the art for Big Data analytics, as applied to network telemetry, offers new opportunities for improving and assuring operational integrity.
In his session at @ThingsExpo, Jim Frey, Vice President of Strategic Alliances at Kentik, discussed tactics and tools to bridge the gap between IoT project team...Jul. 24, 2017 02:15 AM EDT  Reads: 1,431[video] Systena's End-to-End IoT SolutionsBy Liz McMillan"We provide IoT solutions. We provide the most compatible solutions for many applications. Our solutions are industry agnostic and also protocol agnostic," explained Richard Han, Head of Sales and Marketing and Engineering at Systena America, in this SYS-CON.tv interview at @ThingsExpo, held June 6-8, 2017, at the Javits Center in New York City, NY.Jul. 24, 2017 12:15 AM EDT  Reads: 1,113[video] Pulzze Systems' Smart City ProjectsBy Elizabeth White"We've been engaging with a lot of customers including Panasonic, we've been involved with Cisco and now we're working with the U.S. government - the Department of Homeland Security," explained Peter Jung, Chief Product Officer at Pulzze Systems, in this SYS-CON.tv interview at @ThingsExpo, held June 6-8, 2017, at the Javits Center in New York City, NY.Jul. 23, 2017 08:30 PM EDT  Reads: 1,723What DX Means to RetailersBy William SchmarzoA recent BusinessWeek article titled “America’s Retailers Are Closing Stores Faster Than Ever” summarizes the epidemic that retailers are facing today (see Figure 1).
Retailers are closing stores at a record path and the driving force behind the acceleration in store closings is Amazon, who now accounts for over 50% of all on-line retail sales (see Figure 2).
What are retailers to do when the tricks and techniques that worked in the past just don’t work in today’s real-time data and analytics driven business world?  Business models that worked in a world that valued size and location quickly...Jul. 23, 2017 01:00 PM EDT  Reads: 1,228How Is Apple Using Machine Learning?By Nate VickeryToday, machine learning is found in almost every product and service by Apple. They use deep learning to extend battery life between charges on their devices and detect fraud on the Apple store, recognize the locations and faces in your photos, and help Apple choose news stories for you.
The concept of AI (Artificial Intelligence) has been the subject of many discussions lately. According to some predictions, AI will have the ability to learn by itself, outclassing the capabilities of the human brain, and even manage to fight for equal rights by the year 2100. Even though these are (still) ju...Jul. 23, 2017 12:00 PM EDT  Reads: 1,225DXWorldExpo “Global Sponsor” of Cloud ExpoBy Liz McMillanSYS-CON Events announced today that DXWorldExpo has been named “Global Sponsor” of SYS-CON's 21st International Cloud Expo, which will take place on Oct 31 – Nov 2, 2017, at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara, CA. Digital Transformation is the key issue driving the global enterprise IT business. Digital Transformation is most prominent among Global 2000 enterprises and government institutions.Jul. 19, 2017 03:15 PM EDT  Reads: 2,141[video] Catchpoint's Digital Transformation By Liz McMillanThe current age of digital transformation means that IT organizations must adapt their toolset to cover all digital experiences, beyond just the end users’. Today’s businesses can no longer focus solely on the digital interactions they manage with employees or customers; they must now contend with non-traditional factors. Whether it's the power of brand to make or break a company, the need to monitor across all locations 24/7, or the ability to proactively resolve issues, companies must adapt to the new world. Jul. 17, 2017 06:00 PM EDT  Reads: 2,235[slides] IoT Security CertificationsBy Elizabeth WhiteIn his session at @ThingsExpo, Eric Lachapelle, CEO of the Professional Evaluation and Certification Board (PECB), provided an overview of various initiatives to certify the security of connected devices and future trends in ensuring public trust of IoT. Eric Lachapelle is the Chief Executive Officer of the Professional Evaluation and Certification Board (PECB), an international certification body. His role is to help companies and individuals to achieve professional, accredited and worldwide recognized certification against various international standards. He also has extensive experience as ...Jul. 17, 2017 03:00 AM EDT  Reads: 3,294Low-Code/No-Code Is DisruptiveBy Jason BloombergIn the No-Code corner are the ‘citizen developers’ – business users who can build functional but generally limited apps without having to write a line of code. The Low-Code corner, in contrast, centers on professional developers, streamlining and simplifying their work – delivering enterprise-class applications with little or no hand-coding.

So far so good. Confusing, yes – but focusing on personas rather than coding provides a useful frame of reference. 

Only one problem: even this emerging model of the Low-Code/No-Code marketplace is itself ripe for its own disruption. And you ain’t se...Jul. 16, 2017 01:00 PM EDT  Reads: 2,173Serverless Computing: Ready for Prime TimeBy Moshe KrancThe cloud ushered in a fundamental change in the way applications are deployed. Instead of worrying about how much dedicated hardware to order for your data center, you simply spin up as many servers as you need to do the job, then decommission them once the job is done. Yet, you still have to plan how many servers you will need at each stage of processing; you still have to remember to decommission them when done; and you pay for the entire virtual machine during the time you use it even though the server may be idle for most of that time.Jul. 16, 2017 12:15 PM EDT  Reads: 2,224Analytic Profiles: Key to Data MonetizationBy William SchmarzoMany organizations are associating data monetization with selling their data. But selling data is not a trivial task, especially for organizations whose primary business relies on its data. Organizations new to selling data need to be concerned with privacy and Personally Identifiable Information (PII), data quality and accuracy, data transmission reliability, pricing, packaging, marketing, sales, support, etc. Companies such as Nielsen, Experian and Acxiom are experts at selling data because that’s their business; they have built a business around gathering, aggregating, cleansing, aligning, ...Jul. 13, 2017 02:15 PM EDT  Reads: 3,258[video] IoT Panel: How to Handle All This DataBy Pat RomanskiMultiple data types are pouring into IoT deployments. Data is coming in small packages as well as enormous files and data streams of many sizes. Widespread use of mobile devices adds to the total. In this power panel at @ThingsExpo, moderated by Conference Chair Roger Strukhoff, panelists looked at the tools and environments that are being put to use in IoT deployments, as well as the team skills a modern enterprise IT shop needs to keep things running, get a handle on all this data, and deliver the analytics that add value.Jul. 12, 2017 11:45 PM EDT  Reads: 2,905The High-Level Plan for Digital TransformationBy Kevin BenedictThe size of competitors and the longevity of their brands, are less predictive of future success than the quality and speed of their information logistics systems, and their ability to use it as a competitive advantage. More data is being generated today than ever before, and successful companies are investing in business analytics and big data solutions to mine competitive advantages.  There is a new sense of urgency today as businesses realize data has a shelf life, and the value of it diminishes rapidly over time.  In an always-connected world where consumers and their needs are transient, ...Jul. 12, 2017 07:15 PM EDT  Reads: 2,696Disruptive Innovations, Digital TransformationBy David H DeansWhat's disruptive innovation, and why does it matter to leaders in the C-suite? It's how the savvy non-conformist will target market opportunities. How does this happen, when established companies seem to have the advantage? Creative software developers can quickly apply new technologies and digital business models to capture untapped demand.Moreover, the most disruptive new companies will eventually reshape entire industries, swiftly pushing aside the legacy incumbent players -- it's a form of Digital Darwinism. The global networked economy will blossom, thanks to the pervasive In...Jul. 12, 2017 05:45 PM EDT  Reads: 2,705AI Is About Machine ReasoningBy Rene BuestMachine Learning needs tons of data. But what are you going to do when the data only exist in the heads of your employees?
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Cognitive Computing, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Perception, Predictive APIs, Image Recognition, Speech Recognition, Virtual Agent, Intelligent Assistant, Personal Advisor, Chatbot, Semantic Search. Did I miss anything? I am sure I did. However, I guess I provide a good list for your next round of Artificial Intelligence (AI) bullshit bingo. Oh, one last thing - Machine Reasoning! If you've ...Jul. 12, 2017 01:45 PM EDT  Reads: 4,830In 2003, IT Didn’t Matter. Does It Now?By Jason BloombergIn the decade following his article, cloud computing further cemented Carr’s perspective. Compute, storage, and network resources have become simple utilities, available at the proverbial turn of the faucet. The value they provide is immense, but the cloud playing field is amazingly level. Carr’s quote above presaged the cloud to a T.

Today, however, we’re in the digital era. Mark Andreesen’s ‘software is eating the world’ prognostication is coming to pass, as enterprises realize they must become software companies to remain competitive.
The value IT brings to such companies is unquestiona...Jul. 12, 2017 10:15 AM EDT  Reads: 3,275Is Your ERP Ready for Digital Transformation?By Amy EagerCompanies have always been concerned that traditional enterprise software is slow and complex to install, often disrupting critical and time-sensitive operations during roll-out. With the growing need to integrate new digital technologies into the enterprise to transform business processes, this concern has become even more pressing.  A 2016 Panorama Consulting Solutions study revealed that enterprise resource planning (ERP) projects took an average of 21 months to install, with 57 percent of these projects experiencing timeline overruns. A span of almost two years can be a long time when disr...Jul. 12, 2017 02:15 AM EDT  Reads: 2,289

 All the World’s a Cloud
        All of Cloud Is at Cloud Expo!

 Cloud Computing - Big Data | Analytics - Internet of Things 
          Containers - Microservices - WebRTC - DevOps 


Join Us at the Javits Center in New York, NY, June 6-8 

          Cloud computing software is eating the world, and each day is bringing new developments in this world. 

          Yesterday's debate about public vs. private has transformed into the reality of hybrid cloud: a recent survey shows that 74% of enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy. 

          Meanwhile, 94% of enterprises are using some form of XaaS – software, platform, and Infrastructure as a Service.

          Big Data | Analytics and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) are driving exponentially increased demands on datacenters and developers alike, as we cross the zettabyte horizon this year.

          Containers and microservices are now part of every PaaS conversation, and IaaS providers are increasingly competing for platform customers. 

          WebRTC continues to reform web communications, and DevOps is pushing its way into an enterprise IT world that is increasingly agile, lean, and continuous.

          Through all this, Cloud Expo remains the single independent event where delegates and technology vendors can meet to experience and discuss the entire world of the cloud.

        Only Cloud Expo brings together all this in a single location: 
        
          •	Cloud Computing
            •	Big Data | Analytics
            •	Internet of Things
            •	Containers | Microservices
            •	WebRTC
            •	DevOps


        Cloud computing budgets worldwide are reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and no organization can survive long without some sort of cloud migration strategy. Each month brings new announcements, use cases, and success stories. 

          Cloud Expo offers the world's most comprehensive selection of technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100+ exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies. 

          The floor also features a Demo Theater that give delegates the opportunity to get even closer to the technology they want to see and the people who offer it. 

          Attend Cloud Expo. Create your own custom experience. Learn the latest from the world's best technologists. Talk to the vendors you are considering, and put them to the test.

          See you in New York!

"We enthusiastically welcome Ron to the ANSYS Board of Directors. His extensive experience in technology and software industries as a chief executive officer, senior manager and venture capital investor position him well to significantly contribute and provide guidance, particularly across the areas of sales, marketing and product development," said Peter J.

During his overall 28-year career, Hovsepian served as managing director with venture capital firms Bear Stearns Asset Management and Internet Capital Group.  
"It's an honor to join the ANSYS board and share the company's vision for Simulation-Driven Product Development™.  As business pressures rise to deliver innovative, high-quality products to the marketplace, ANSYS® engineering simulation solutions play an increasingly important role in customers' product development processes," said Hovsepian.
