About Us - Eigenworks































































650-999-0906 (US) or 226-780-0077 (Canada)newbusiness@eigenworks.com
About UsHome  About Us




Eigenworks does just one thing: We study buyer decisions.
We get the real story behind buyer decisions at the initial sale, the upgrade/downgrade, and the renewal/cancellation or churn event. We get the real story about wins and losses, mid-lifecycle customer success, pre-renewal likelihood to churn or renew, and post-renewal churn, buy-up, down-grade, and retention decisions.  We do this by hosting candid conversations with buyers, helping them express their full story using our Buyer-as-Hero™ dialogue model.
Using these insights, and drawing on a decade of experience and thousands of buyer conversations, we provide B2B product companies with strategic guidance on how to improve customer success and sales win rates. We work with venture-backed startups to help nail it, then scale it, and with mature public software companies to develop strategic competitive intelligence and roadmap guidance. We can advise sales, product, customer success, and marketing leaders. And we love what we do.
Eigenworks currently employs 10 people and has demonstrated 35% CAGR for the past 5 years. Eigenworks clients include industry giants such as Oracle and Cisco, mid-size companies such as Blackbaud and ReturnPath, and rocketship startups including Gainsight and VictorOps.
