What is OBALON?
The FIRST and ONLY swallowable, FDA-approved 3-balloon system for weight loss.



The Obalon Balloon System is a swallowable intragastric balloon system indicated for temporary use to facilitate weight loss in adults with obesity (BMI of 30 – 40 kg/m2) who have failed to lose weight through diet and exercise. The System is intended to be used as an adjunct to a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program. All balloons must be removed 6 months after the first balloon is placed.







PROVEN WEIGHT LOSS
Patients with the Obalon Balloon System combined with diet & exercise lost approximately twice as much weight as those with diet & exercise alone.
 
FDA-APPROVED, NON-SURGICAL
First and only swallowable, lightweight balloon system for weight loss.



JUMP-STARTS Long-Term Results
Average of 89% of weight loss was kept off six months after balloons were removed, when combined with a moderate intensity diet and exercise program.
CONVENIENT, NO DOWNTIME
The placement of each balloon typically takes less than 10 minutes and requires no surgery or sedation.

Safety Information 











Indications for use
The Obalon Balloon System (the "System") is a swallowable intragastric balloon system indicated for temporary use to facilitate weight loss in adults with obesity (BMI of 30 – 40 kg/m2) who have failed to lose weight through diet and exercise. The System is intended to be used as an adjunct to a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program. All balloons must be removed 6 months after the first balloon is placed.
Contraindications
The following contraindications apply to the Obalon Gastric Balloon System:

Anatomical abnormalities or functional disorders that may inhibit swallowing or passage through any portion of the entire Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract.
Prior surgeries that may have resulted in intestinal adhesions, narrowing of any portion of the digestive tract or any other condition that may inhibit passage through any portion of the GI tract.
Persons whom have undergone any bariatric surgery procedure.
Inflammatory and other pathophysiological conditions of the GI tract.
Chronic or acute use of medications known to be gastric irritants or to otherwise alter function or integrity of any portion of the GI tract, including but not limited to NSAIDs and aspirin.
Untreated Heliocobacter pylori infection.
Patients who are unable or unwilling to take prescribed proton pump inhibitor medication for the duration of the device implant.
Allergies to products/foods of porcine origin.
Patients diagnosed with bulimia, binge eating, compulsive overeating, high liquid calorie intake habits or similar eating related psychological disorders.
Patients with known history of structural or functional disorders of the stomach including, gastroparesis, gastric ulcer, chronic gastritis, gastric varices, hiatal hernia (> 2 cm), cancer or any other disorder of the stomach.
Patients requiring the use of anti-platelet drugs or other agents affecting the normal clotting of blood.
Pregnant or lactating women, or women with an intention to become pregnant.
Known history of duodenal ulcer, intestinal diverticula (diverticulitis), intestinal varices, intestinal stricture/stenosis, small bowel obstruction, or any other obstructive disorder of the gastrointestinal tract.
Known history of irritable bowel syndrome, radiation enteritis, or other inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn’s disease.
Patients taking medications on specified hourly intervals that may be affected by changes in gastric emptying, such as anti-seizure or anti-arrhythmic medications.
Alcoholism or drug addiction.

Warnings

To minimize radiation, during administration, if fluoroscopy is utilized instead of digital x-ray, monitoring of the actual swallow process is not required to ensure successful placement and is not recommended. Radiation exposure should be minimized to the lowest possible level during confirmation after swallow and balloon inflation. The balloon must not be inflated until the capsule can be clearly identified to be in the stomach.
The risk of balloon deflation is significantly higher with balloons that are left longer than 6 months.
Death due to intestinal obstruction is possible and has been reported with other intragastric balloons.
Patients reporting a loss of fullness, increased hunger, and/or weight gain should be examined by radiograph, as this may be a sign of balloon deflation. Additionally, any increase in nausea, vomiting and/or cramping after initial symptoms have subsided may indicate a deflated balloon. Patients should be evaluated by Radiograph and Endoscopic visualization might be required if the state of inflation cannot be determined radiographically. In the event of balloon deflation, the balloon should be removed as soon as possible.
Each patient should be monitored closely during the entire device therapy period in order to detect the development of possible complications. Patients should be instructed regarding symptoms of deflation, gastrointestinal obstruction, ulceration, esophageal injury, and other possible complications that could occur, and should be advised to contact their physician if these symptoms worsen over time or persist for more than 24 hours.
Do not place more than 3 balloons in one patient across the 6-month therapy cycle.
Do not place more than one device simultaneously. There should be no less than 14 days between Balloon placements. Risk of intolerance due to too much initial volume may occur.
Endoscopic retrieval might be required in the event that a capsule is swallowed, but not completely inflated. A foreign body retriever should be immediately available in the endoscopic suite.
Patients must not use gastric irritant medications including but not limited to NSAIDs or Aspirin during use. This can lead to an increase in ulcerations and gastric bleeding events while balloons are in residence.
Do not place balloons if the patient expects to permanently reside at an elevation greater than 4000 ft. from balloon placement elevation or lower than 2500 ft. from the balloon placement elevation. The risk of balloon deflation increases with significant change in elevation during balloon use.
The pressure gauge on the Dispenser must be monitored continuously to ensure there are no leaks in the system during inflation. All decision points require that prior to moving to the next step, that the measured value is stable and does not change more than 0.3 kPa in a 30 second period. Any value provided that is not stable or unexpected could indicate that there is a leak in the closed loop system.

Precautions

The Obalon Balloon System procedure should only be conducted by physicians specifically trained to perform the Obalon Balloon System procedure.
Prior to usage of the Obalon Gastric Balloon System, patients should have previously attempted to lose weight unsuccessfully using a medically supervised or non-medically supervised diet.
Patients using medications known to affect weight or who are undergoing chronic steroid immunosuppressive therapy should not use the treatment.
Patients should be advised not to undertake scuba diving or travel in an unpressurized airplane cabin as these activities might cause the balloons to deflate.
The safety and effectiveness of the Obalon Balloon System has not been established in patients with:

Type 1 diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes requiring insulin or other hypoglycemic oral agents.
Uncontrolled hypothyroidism or Cushing’s disease or syndrome.
Severe, unstable/uncontrolled medical conditions of major organ systems.
Patients with known cardiovascular disease such as recent acute coronary syndrome or clinically unstable ischaemic cardiac disease including evolving or ongoing myocardial infarction, typical angina at rest, recent coronary intervention, recent deterioration of ECG, laboratory or clinical findings.
Poorly controlled hypertension (≥160 mm Hg Systolic and ≥100 mm Hg Diastolic).
End stage renal disease or requiring hemodialysis within the past 6 months.

					Full Description



Obalon Therapeutics, Inc. is a commercial-stage medical device company focused on developing and commercializing medical devices to treat obese and overweight people by facilitating weight loss. The Company's product, Obalon balloon system, is a swallowable, gas-filled intragastric balloon designed to provide weight loss in obese patients. The Obalon balloon system is intended to be used as an adjunct to a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program. All balloons must be removed six months after the first balloon is placed. The Obalon balloon system intends to provide patients and physicians with a reversible and repeatable weight loss solution in an outpatient setting, without altering patient anatomy or requiring surgery. The Company has received Premarket approval (PMA) for its Obalon balloon system based on the results of its United States pivotal clinical trial, referred to as the SMART trial. It intends to sell the Obalon balloon system on a self-pay basis to bariatric surgeons and gastroenterologists with existing weight loss practices.The Company's Obalon balloon is filled with a mix of gas. Its system is designed to use approximately three Obalon balloons over the course of treatment, allowing the volume in the stomach to be gradually increased. The Obalon balloon is placed without anesthesia or an endoscopy through a swallowable capsule that dissolves in the stomach and releases the Obalon balloon. A microcatheter is attached to the balloon to enable inflation and is subsequently detached and removed from the patient. Placement typically occurs in less than 10 minutes and patients can return to normal activity once the placement is complete. The balloons are removed endoscopically under light, conscious sedation approximately six months after the first balloon placement. Its product pipeline includes vegetable-derived balloon capsule, its EzPz inflation system, which is being designed to be automated; a navigation system that could reduce the need for digital imaging at each balloon placement; a balloon that could be used to provide treatment for approximately one year, and a deflateable-passable balloon that could eliminate the need for an endoscopic procedure to remove the balloons.The Company competes with Vivus, Inc., Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd, AstraZeneca plc, Actavis plc, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic plc, Apollo EndoSurgery, Inc., Enteromedics Inc., ReShape Medical Inc., Apollo EndoSurgery, Inc., Aspire Bariatrics and Allurion Technologies, Inc.

 Obalon Announces FDA Approval of Obalon Balloon System 
 Mon, 09/12/2016 - 9:33am 
 Comments 
 by Obalon Therapeutics, Inc.  

 






Obalon Therapeutics, Inc. announced that it has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the Obalon Balloon System, a novel, nonsurgical, fully-reversible device for weight loss. The Obalon Balloon System is a swallowable intragastric balloon system indicated for temporary use to facilitate weight loss in adults with obesity (BMI of 30 – 40 kg/m2) who have failed to lose weight through diet and exercise. The System is intended to be used as an adjunct to a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program. All balloons must be removed 6 months after the first balloon is placed.  
"We're excited to bring this novel technology to the approximately 70 million adults in the United States who are struggling with obesity. For physicians, we believe that the Obalon technology represents an important new option for both their practices and their patients who are obese and looking to lose weight," commented Andy Rasdal, Chief Executive Officer of Obalon Therapeutics. "I'd also like to recognize the FDA for their efficient and interactive review of our product, which represents another option for physicians and patients in the battle against the obesity epidemic."
The Obalon Balloon System consists of a balloon folded inside a capsule that is swallowed by the patient, with no sedation or anesthesia required.  Once the balloon reaches the stomach, it is remotely inflated with gas via a micro-catheter that is then removed, leaving a lightweight, buoyant balloon in the stomach. Over the next three months of treatment, two additional balloons are swallowed and inflated. At the end of the six-month treatment period, all three balloons are removed via an outpatient endoscopy under conscious sedation.  
"We participated in the Obalon clinical trial and are excited to now have the Obalon Balloon System readily available for our patients who have been frustrated by not being able to lose weight through diet and exercise alone," stated Dr. Aurora Pryor, Director of the Bariatric and Metabolic Weight Loss Center at the Stony Brook University School of Medicine's Department of Surgery. "The Obalon balloon is swallowable, can typically be placed in less than 10 minutes without the use of sedation or anesthesia and was well-tolerated by our patients in the clinical trial. Having now received FDA approval, we can begin treating more patients with the device."
In the clinical trial, 387 patients in the United States across fifteen clinical trial sites were randomized in a double-blind, sham-controlled study. The patients in the clinical trial received either three Obalon balloons or three sham placebo-like devices that looked similar to the balloons, but were filled with sugar. The patients in both groups were given minimal diet counseling of 25 minutes every three weeks. Both co-primary weight loss endpoints were met, with approximately 65% of patients who received the Obalon Balloon System experiencing clinically meaningful weight loss of at least 5% of their total body weight, which is twice as many people than in the sham-control group. The clinical trial data will be presented at Obesity Week this Fall in New Orleans.
"The clinical trial design for the Obalon Balloon System was highly rigorous and the system demonstrated a favorable safety profile," stated Dr. Shelby Sullivan, Director of the Gastroenterology Bariatric and Metabolic Program at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. "We were also pleased to see that patients tolerated the administrations of the Obalon balloon remarkably well with no recovery time needed. This is in contrast to other currently approved intragastric balloon devices, where most patients cannot immediately return to normal activities."    
The Obalon Balloon System is expected to be available in early 2017 to physicians who complete the Obalon Balloon System training program. Obalon is currently in the process of identifying, hiring and training the appropriate personnel to ensure that the product can be implemented in the commercial setting with the same strong safety and efficacy profile as was demonstrated in the clinical trial. A prior generation of the Obalon Balloon System indicated for three-months of treatment is currently available in select international markets, with more than 23,000 balloons having been sold internationally.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Description




Obalon Therapeutics, Inc. is a United States-based commercial-stage medical device company focused on developing and commercializing medical devices to treat obese and overweight people by facilitating weight loss. The Company's product, Obalon balloon system, is a swallowable, gas-filled intragastric balloon designed to provide weight loss in obese patients. The Obalon balloon system is intended to be used as an adjunct to a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program. All balloons must be removed six months after the first balloon is placed. The Obalon balloon system intends to provide patients and physicians with a reversible and repeatable weight loss solution in an outpatient setting, without altering patient anatomy or requiring surgery. The Company has received Premarket approval (PMA) for its Obalon balloon system based on the results of its United States pivotal clinical trial, referred to as the SMART trial.
