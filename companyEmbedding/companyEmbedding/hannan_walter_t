Vacuum Forming









							 
						



HANNAN®






									The 420 VF Series provides the ultimate in versatility for vacuum forming and skin packaging. By combining two complete vacuum systems, a high volume turbine and positive displacement (surge tank), the 420 VF Series can do the work of two machines. The 420 VF can do plastic vacuum forming because of the strong vacuum created by the high volume turbine.
								

									Vacuum forming is a versatile method of molding plastic (film) into a specific shape. Vacuum forming can be used to produce a wide variety of plastic objects such as blisters or trays. The process requires a heat source to soften the plastic sheets and a source of vacuum to "draw" the plastic into the required form.
