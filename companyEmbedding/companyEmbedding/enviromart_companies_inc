(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  Forward-looking Statements  Statements made in this Quarterly Report which are not purely historical are forward-looking statements with respect to the goals, plan objectives, intentions, expectations, financial condition, results of operations, future performance and our business, including, without limitation, (i) our ability to raise capital, and (ii) statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words "may," "would," "could," "should," "expects," "projects," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "plans," "intends," "targets" or similar expressions.  Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many of which are beyond our control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, including the following: general economic or industry conditions, nationally and/or in the communities in which we may conduct business, changes in the interest rate environment, legislation or regulatory requirements, conditions of the securities markets, our ability to raise capital, changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines, financial or political instability, acts of war or terrorism, other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting our current or potential business and related matters.  Accordingly, results actually achieved may differ materially from expected results in these statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.  Overview  On June 21, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets from Michael R. Rosa, its then chief executive officer, and commenced business operations. Since completing the acquisition, the Company has raised capital, hired employees, leased space, engaged consultants and advisors, conducted extensive sales and marketing related activities both domestically and internationally, negotiated vendor relationships and engaged seller's representatives.  As of January 2, 2015, the Company's business was operated through its wholly-owned subsidiary, EnviroPack Technologies, Inc. Effective on or about January 15, 2015, the Company changed its name to The Enviromart Companies, and the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, EnviroPack Technologies, Inc., changed its name to Enviromart Industries, Inc.  Sale of Operating Business  On February 16, 2016, The Rushcap Group, Inc. ("Rushcap"), an affiliate of Mark Shefts (then a significant shareholder), notified us that, effective March 31, 2016, it was discontinuing its funding of our wholly owned subsidiary under the Inventory Financing Agreement dated June 19, 2015. Rushcap reserved the right to discontinue the funding prior to March 31, 2016, if it so determined. The discontinuation of funding was expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation, as we did not believe that we would be able to timely secure funding to replace the discontinued Inventory Financing.  In light of the discontinuation of funding, our Board of Directors spent approximately one month assessing the operating company's current business and funding prospects, including whether to transfer the operating subsidiary to Michael R. Rosa, our founder and a significant shareholder, in accordance with that certain Agreement between the Company, Mr. Rosa and Mr. Shefts, dated July 14, 2014 ("Break-up Agreement"). The Break-up Agreement was disclosed in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed July 18, 2014, which is incorporated herein by this reference.  Our Board of Directors concluded that the discontinuation of funding would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation, as it did not believe that it would be able to timely secure funding to replace the discontinued Inventory Financing.  On March 17, 2016, our Board of Directors approved the sale of our sole operating subsidiary, Enviromart Industries, Inc., to Michael R. Rosa, our founder and a significant shareholder, as contemplated by that certain Agreement between us, Mr. Rosa and Mark Shefts, dated July 14, 2014 ("Break-up Agreement"). The Break-up Agreement was originally disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed July 18, 2014, which is incorporated herein by this reference.  On March 21, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement with Michael R. Rosa and Enviromart Industries, Inc., our sole operating subsidiary, pursuant to which we will transfer to Mr. Rosa all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Enviromart Industries, Inc.  In consideration for the transfer of the operating subsidiary to Mr. Rosa, surrendered to us all 13,567,500 shares of the Company's common stock then owned by him, which shares have been returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares. In addition, Mr. Rosa and Enviromart Industries, Inc. (the Companies former operating subsidiary) agreed to assume and discharge any and all of the Company's liabilities existing as the closing date, of which there were expected to be none, as all of the Company's operations have been conducted through Enviromart Industries, Inc. (its sole operating subsidiary).  The above described purchase and sale transaction closed on July 21, 2016, effective April 1, 2016, and was approved by a majority of the Company's shareholders by written consent on May 4, 2016. Upon consummation of the purchase and sale transaction, the Company's operating business has been discontinued, and it will focus on seeking to acquire a profitable operating business with strong growth potential.  Upon the closing of the purchase and sale transaction, Mr. George Adyns resigned from our board of directors and all offices held by him.  All of the disclosures in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q must be viewed in light of the disposition of our sole operating subsidiary, as our operating business has been discontinued, and the value of our company is now dependent upon our ability to locate and consummate the acquisition of a profitable operating business with strong growth potential.  Results of Operations  For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we had a net income of $1,142,000 as compared to a net loss of $187,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in loss was due primarily to the $1,328,000 gain on discontinued operations. This gain will not recur in subsequent periods. Unless and until the Company completes the acquisition of an operating business, the Company's expenses are expected to consist of the legal, accounting and administrative costs of maintaining a public company.  Recent Developments  None  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates  The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued disclosure guidance for "critical accounting policies." The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.  Our significant accounting policies are described below. We anticipate that the following accounting policies will require the application of our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:  Accounts Receivable  In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy defined credit criteria. Accounts receivable is recorded at carrying value, which approximates fair value, and is presented in the Company's unaudited consolidated balance sheets net of any allowance for doubtful accounts. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $-0- and $4,277, respectively, has been recorded.  Inventory  The Company's inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost primarily determined on a weighted-average cost basis on the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The Company continuously evaluates the composition of its inventory, assessing slow-turning product. Estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual products, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current orders in-house relating to the future sales of inventory. Estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, customer demand, and market conditions. The Company's historical estimates of these costs and any provisions have not differed materially from actual results. Any reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, an inventory reserve of $-0- and $52,147, respectively, has been recorded.  Concentration of Risk  Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash. Our cash balances are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located in the United States. The Company occasionally maintains amounts on deposit with a financial institution that are in excess of the federally insured limits. The risk is managed by maintaining all deposits in high quality financial institutions.  Machinery and Equipment  Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful life of depreciable assets, which is three years for machinery and equipment.  Long-lived Assets  Machinery and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be recoverable, or are less than their fair value. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.  Income Taxes  Income taxes are provided in accordance with FASB ASC 740 "Accounting for Income Taxes". A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. As of June 30, 2016, all deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved.  Revenue Recognition  Revenue is recognized across all segments of the business when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers.  Sales Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts  A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income is estimating sales reserves, which represent that portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized. In particular, wholesale revenue is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, markdowns, and operational chargebacks. In determining estimates of returns, discounts, markdowns and operational chargebacks, management analyzes current economic and market conditions. We review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis. As of June 30, 2016, a sales reserve had not been deemed necessary, and therefore, not recorded.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Currently, we have no cash. As discussed elsewhere in this report, we have issued stock in exchange for office space and all other services needed to maintain public company with respect to calendar year 2016.  As disclosed elsewhere in the Report, On March 21, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement with Michael R. Rosa and Enviromart Industries, Inc., our sole operating subsidiary, pursuant to which we transferred to Mr. Rosa all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Enviromart Industries, Inc.  In consideration for the transfer of the operating subsidiary to Mr. Rosa, he surrendered to us all 13,567,500 shares of the Company's common stock owned by him, which shares have been returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares. In addition, Mr. Rosa and Enviromart Industries, Inc. agreed to assume and discharge any and all of the Company's liabilities existing as the closing date, of which there were expected to be none, as all of the Company's operations have been conducted through Enviromart Industries, Inc. (its sole operating subsidiary).  The above described purchase and sale transaction closed on July 21, 2016, effective April 1, 2016, and was approved by a majority of the Company's shareholders by written consent on May 4, 2016. As a result of the closing of the purchase and sale transaction, the Company's operating business has been discontinued, and is focusing on seeking to acquire a profitable operating business with strong growth potential.  The value of our company is now dependent upon our ability to locate and consummate the acquisition of a profitable operating business with strong growth potential. As of the date of filing of this Report, we have no cash. However, prior to completing an acquisition, our expenses will consist primarily of compliance costs associated with being a public company, and we expect these compliance costs to be substantially less than they have been historically, at least until we complete an acquisition transaction. Also, as noted above, we have issued stock in exchange for office space and all other services needed to maintain public company with respect to calendar year 2016.  If we need to raise additional funds, we intend to do so through equity and/or debt financing.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a) (4)  Aug 22, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

THE
ENVIROMART COMPANIES, INC. 

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

 

NOTE 1.
ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 

The
Enviromart Companies, Inc. and subsidiary (the
“Company”), formerly known as Environmental Science and
Technologies, Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware on June 18, 2012. On June 21, 2013, the Company completed
an acquisition of intangible assets comprised of intellectual
property and trademarks from its former Chief Executive Officer. In
conjunction with the acquisition of the intangible assets, the
Company commenced operations.

 

As of
January 2, 2015, the Company’s business was operated through
its wholly-owned subsidiary, EnviroPack Technologies, Inc.
Effective on or about January 15, 2015, the Company changed its
name to The Enviromart Companies, and the Company’s
wholly-owned subsidiary, EnviroPack Technologies, Inc., changed its
name to Enviromart Industries, Inc. The Company’s other
wholly owned subsidiaries are currently inactive.

 

On
February 16, 2016, The Rushcap Group, Inc. (“Rushcap”),
an affiliate of Mark Shefts (then a significant shareholder),
notified us that, effective March 31, 2016, it was discontinuing
its funding of our wholly owned subsidiary under the Inventory
Financing Agreement dated June 19, 2015.

 

On March
21, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale
Agreement with Michael R. Rosa, founder and a significant
shareholder, and Enviromart Industries, Inc., its sole operating
subsidiary, pursuant to which the Company agreed to transfer to Mr.
Rosa all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Enviromart
Industries, Inc.

 

In
consideration for the transfer of the operating subsidiary to Mr.
Rosa, he surrendered to us all 13,657,500 shares of the
Company’s common stock then owned by him, which shares were
returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares. In
addition, Mr. Rosa and Enviromart Industries, Inc. agreed to assume
and discharge any and all of the Company’s liabilities
existing as the closing date, of which there was none, as all of
the Company’s operations have been conducted through
Enviromart Industries, Inc. (its sole operating
subsidiary).

 

The above
described purchase and sale transaction closed on July 21, 2016,
effective April 1, 2016, and was approved by a majority of the
Company’s shareholders by written consent on May 4, 2016. As
a result of the completion of the purchase and sale transaction,
the Company’s operating business has been discontinued, and
it is focusing on seeking to acquire an operating business with
strong growth potential.

 

Accordingly,
the Company now has only minimal assets and liabilities. Its
operations are focused on seeking to acquire an operating business
with strong growth potential. From and after the sale, unless and
until the Company completes an acquisition, its expenses are
expected to consist solely of legal, accounting and compliance
costs, including those related to complying with reporting
obligations under the Securities and Exchange act of
1934.

 

NOTE 2.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION

 

Basis of
Presentation

 

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the
Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”). In the opinion of management, all
adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary
for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of
operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected
herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full
year.

 

These
Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the
December 31, 2015 audited financial statements filed with the SEC
on April 14, 2016.

NOTE 3.
GOING CONCERN

 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, although the Company has
generated a gain from the sale of its discontinued operations, thus
far it has been unable to generate cash flows sufficient to support
its operations and has been dependent on debt and equity financing.
In addition to negative cash flow from operations, the Company has
experienced recurring net losses, and has an accumulated deficit of
$1,032,197 as of September 30, 2016. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is
unable to continue as a going concern.

 

In order
to ameliorate this liquidity deficiency, on July 21, 2016, the
Company transferred to Michael R. Rosa all the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Enviromart Industries, Inc., its sole
operating subsidiary. See Note 1, Organization and Description of
Business.

 

NOTE 4.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Use of
Estimates and Assumptions

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

 

Principles
of Consolidation

 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Enviromart Industries,
Inc. (f/k/a EnviroPack Technologies, Inc.), which was consolidated
through March 31, 2016 and the results of its operations are shown
as discontinued operations. All inter-company accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

The
Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with original
maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash
equivalents.

 

Accounts
Receivable

 

In the
normal course of business, the Company extended credit to customers
that satisfy defined credit criteria. Accounts receivable is
recorded at carrying value, which approximates fair value, and is
presented in the Company's unaudited consolidated balance sheets
net of any allowance for doubtful accounts. As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, an allowance for doubtful accounts of
$-0- and $4,277, respectively, had been recorded.

 

Inventory

 

The
Company’s inventory is stated at the lower of cost or
estimated realizable value, with cost primarily determined on a
weighted-average cost basis on the first-in, first-out
(“FIFO”) method. The Company continuously evaluates the
composition of its inventory, assessing slow-turning product.
Estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an
analysis of historical sales trends of our individual products, the
impact of market trends and economic conditions, and a forecast of
future demand, giving consideration to the value of current orders
in-house relating to the future sales of inventory. Estimates may
differ from actual results due to quantity, quality, and mix of
products in inventory, customer demand, and market conditions. The
Company’s historical estimates of these costs and any
provisions have not differed materially from actual results. Any
reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical
loss of inventory, are adjusted based upon physical inventory
counts. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, an
inventory reserve of $-0- and $52,147, respectively, had been
recorded.

 

Concentration
of Risk

 

Financial
instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of
credit risk, consist principally of cash. Our cash balances are
maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial
institutions located in the United States. The Company has in the
past occasionally maintained amounts on deposit with a financial
institution that are in excess of the federally insured limits. The
risk is managed by maintaining all deposits in high quality
financial institutions.




8

 

  

 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no individually
significant customers.

 

Machinery
and Equipment

 

Equipment
is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is
calculated using the straight-line method based upon the estimated
useful life of depreciable assets, which is three years for
machinery and equipment.

 

Long-lived
Assets

 

Machinery
and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated
for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not
be recoverable, or are less than their fair value. In evaluating
long-lived assets for recoverability, the Company uses its best
estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of
the asset and its eventual disposition. To the extent that
estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the
asset are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is
recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of
such asset and its fair value, considering external market
participant assumptions. Assets to be disposed of and for which
there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of
carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.

 

Income
Taxes

 

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation
allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amounts expected to be realized. As of September 30,
2016, all deferred tax assets continue to be fully
reserved.

 

Basic
Earnings (Loss) Per Share

 

Basic
earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and
dilutive common stock equivalents. Basic earnings per share is
computed by dividing net income/loss available to common
stockholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Weighted
average number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted loss
per share is considered the same as the effect of dilutive shares
is anti-dilutive for all periods presented. As of September 30,
2016 and, 2015, there were -0- common stock equivalents, not
included in dilutive earnings per share as their effect is
anti-dilutive.

 

Revenue
Recognition

 

Revenue
is recognized across all segments of the business when there is
persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, price
has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability is reasonably
assured. Revenue is recognized at the time title passes and risk of
loss is transferred to customers.

 

Sales
Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts

 

A
significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net
income is estimating sales reserves, which represent that portion
of gross revenues not expected to be realized. In particular,
revenue is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, markdowns,
and operational chargebacks. In determining estimates of returns,
discounts, markdowns and operational chargebacks, management
analyzes current economic and market conditions. We review and
refine these estimates on a quarterly basis. As of September 30,
2016, a sales reserve had not been deemed necessary, and therefore,
not recorded.

 

Cost of
Goods Sold and Selling Expenses

 

Cost of
goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and produce
inventory for sale, including product costs, freight-in, and any
import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and
inventory realizability. Any costs of selling merchandise,
including those associated with preparing the merchandise for sale,
such as picking, packing, warehousing, and order charges
(“handling costs”), are included in general and
administrative fees.




9

 

  

 

Stock-Based
Compensation

 

The
Company expenses all stock-based payments to employees and
non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the
awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for estimated
forfeitures.

 

Convertible
Notes

 

The
Company records a discount to convertible notes for the intrinsic
value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments, as
appropriate. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized
to noncash interest expense using the effective interest rate
method over the term of the related debt to their date of
maturity.

 

If a
security or instrument becomes convertible only upon the occurrence
of a future event outside the control of the Company, or, is
convertible from inception, but contains conversion terms that
change upon the occurrence of a future event, then any contingent
beneficial conversion feature is measured and recognized when the
triggering event occurs and contingency has been
resolved.

 

Recently
Issued Financial Accounting Standards

 

Management
believes the impact of recently issued standards and updates, which
are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows upon adoption.

 

NOTE 5.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

The
Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary rented its facility, on a
month to month basis from Michael R. Rosa, who was then a
significant shareholder of the Company. The facility consisted of
19,500 square feet of office and warehouse space located in
Plaistow, New Hampshire for $10,400 per month from an entity owned
beneficially by the Company’s former CEO, who was a
significant shareholder. The lease was a gross lease under which
the landlord paid all taxes, maintenance and repairs, and
insurance.

 

On July
14, 2014, the Company and its former CEO, Michael R. Rosa, entered
into an agreement with Mark Shefts (who is currently a significant
shareholder), as follows:

 

(1)

Mr.
Shefts: (i) agreed to provide management advisory services to the
Company for a period of one year, for $1,000 per month, (ii) made a
$125,000 equity investment into the Company, in exchange for 10
million shares of the Registrant’s common stock, (iii) agreed
to extend the maturity date of his convertible promissory note in
the principal amount of $100,000 until July 15, 2015 and make the
note non-interest bearing, and (iv) will have the option of
becoming CEO and a member of the board of the Company;

 

(2)

Mr. Shefts
and the Company’s former CEO agreed to endeavor for a
specified of time to appoint a mutually agreeable person to act as
a director of the Company. In the event that Mr. Shefts and the
Company’s former CEO are unable to agree on a third director,
Mr. Shefts would have the right to appoint the third
director;

 

(3)

Michael R
Rosa, former CEO of the Company, agreed to surrender approximately
6,692,500 shares of the Registrant’s common stock to the
treasury, to be restored to the status of authorized but unissued
shares; and

 

(4)

Mr. Rosa
agreed to accept a promissory note in the amount of $98,268 for
amounts he has advanced on behalf of the Company through June 30,
2014. Through December 31, 2014, the amount advanced totaled
$153,745 and was included in the consolidated balance sheet as due
to officer. This note was issued on January 21, 2015 for $100,000
and is non-interest bearing and matures on July 15,
2016.

 

The
original Agreement also provided that if the Board of Directors
should at any time determine to discontinue the business operations
of the Company, then, subject to compliance with applicable laws,
the Company would transfer to Michael R. Rosa its discontinued
operating businesses, in exchange for his surrendering to the
Company all shares of common stock of the Company owned or
controlled by him.

 

In
connection with the foregoing transaction, the Company, on July 14,
2014, sold to Rushcap Group, Inc. (Mark Shefts’ designee) (an
accredited investor) 10,000,000 shares of its common stock, for
aggregate consideration of $125,000 (a per-share price of
$.0125).




10

 

  

 

On
September 26, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with
Rushcap Group, Inc. (controlled by Mark Shefts (then a significant
shareholder)) to provide a revolving line of credit to purchase
inventory to the Company. The maximum borrowing amount under this
agreement was originally $300,000, and was increased to $750,000 in
May 2015.   
  As of September
30, 2016, $-0- had been advanced to the company under this
agreement, as all amounts were advanced to the operating
subsidiary, which we transferred to Michael R. Rosa, as described
below.

 

On March
24, 2015 the Company awarded its then CFO warrants to purchase
750,000 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $.10 per
share, subject to vesting annually over a three year period
commencing December 31, 2015.  These warrants include a
cashless exercise feature.  As part of the transfer of the
operating subsidiary, these warrants were cancelled.  See Note
6 Stockholders Equity.

 

On March
21, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale
Agreement with Michael R. Rosa, founder and then a significant
shareholder, and Enviromart Industries, Inc., its sole
opera

Overview of Product Design and Development Services
Whether you are a first-time inventor, a small start-up or an established company, Enhance can complement your business by delivering inspirational product design and development that will drive your bottom line.
 
 
 




Industrial Design
Taking an invention or product concept into reality is a core concern of our industrial design services.  Our mission is to optimize function, value and appearance for the mutual benefit of the product user and the manufacturer.  This means we seek to design both an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that is commercially feasible.
 
 
 



Engineering and Prototyping
Getting samples for presentations or proof of concept is a crucial step to test how a product will function, as well as survey interest from potential customers or licensees. Enhance has the capabilities of making you a part through the use of the best technologies in rapid prototyping, from fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and more.
 
 
 



Manufacturing Sourcing
Finding a source to manufacture a quality product at low prices and with reasonable terms is one of the most challenging aspects to commercializing a product.
