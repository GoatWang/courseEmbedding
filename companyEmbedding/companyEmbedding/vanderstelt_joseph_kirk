 Educational Background



 


Baker College of Auburn Hills

                  Since 1911, Baker College has been preparing people for successful careers. Today, we are the largest, independent, not-for-profit college in the State of Michigan—and one of the ten largest private colleges in the United States. Yet, each Baker College campus feels very personal and friendly, with small class sizes and individual attention. Baker is a career college. We believe that going to college should lead you directly to a great career, and everything at Baker from our programs to our facilities and support services—is guided by that belief.
