Tidewater's stock plunges after announcing bankruptcy plan
Shares of Tidewater Inc.  plunged 31% in premarket trade toward a record low Friday, after the oil services company said it expects to file for bankruptcy by May 17. The company has reached a restructuring deal with its lenders, which will effectively eliminate $1.6 billion in debt after the bankruptcy. Under the prepackaged bankruptcy plan, Tidewater existing shares of Tidewater common stock will be cancelled, and existing shareholders will receive common stock representing 5% of the common equity in reorganized Tidewater, Series A warrants to buy 7.5% of the equity in the reorganized Tidewater and Series B warrants to buy 7.5% of the equity. The stock traded at 61 cents ahead of the open. It has plummeted 74% year to date through Thursday, while the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF  has shed 17% and the S&P 500  has gained 7%.

Tidewater's stock plunges after announcing bankruptcy plan
Shares of Tidewater Inc.  plunged 31% in premarket trade toward a record low Friday, after the oil services company said it expects to file for bankruptcy by May 17. The company has reached a restructuring deal with its lenders, which will effectively eliminate $1.6 billion in debt after the bankruptcy. Under the prepackaged bankruptcy plan, Tidewater existing shares of Tidewater common stock will be cancelled, and existing shareholders will receive common stock representing 5% of the common equity in reorganized Tidewater, Series A warrants to buy 7.5% of the equity in the reorganized Tidewater and Series B warrants to buy 7.5% of the equity. The stock traded at 61 cents ahead of the open. It has plummeted 74% year to date through Thursday, while the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF  has shed 17% and the S&P 500  has gained 7%.

PHASE 1 ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS






  





Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (Phase I ESA) are typically required by lending institutions prior to purchase or refinancing of a property. These studies are conducted in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessment: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ASTM E 1527-13.) This standard is in compliance with the EPA’s All Appropriate Inquiry (40 CFR Part 312) under the Innocent Land-owner Defense. The goal is to research the history of the property and adjacent properties, as well as current operations to identify possible environmental liabilities associated with the site. Tidewater’s Environmental Scientists have conducted numerous Phase I ESAs for a wide range of private, commercial and state government facilities. 
The research required for Phase I ESAs includes, but is not limited to, the following: 

• Previous environmental reports for the property or structures on the property
• Reports of remediation of asbestos, radon, lead, or above/underground storage tanks
• Environmental permits (e.g., solid waste disposal permits, hazardous waste disposal permits, waste water permits, NPDES permits)
• Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures Plans
• Notices from any government agency relating to past/current violations of environmental laws








  












HOWARD COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING 
Tidewater conducted a Phase I ESA of a series of abandoned residential structures in Jessup, Maryland prior to redevelopment of the sites by Howard County. While no recognized environmental conditions were identified, findings included fuel storage tanks, well casings, asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paint, and flooding with extensive mold contamination. 






  












PHI QUINCE ORCHARD SUBSTATION UTILITY CORRIDOR 
Tidewater conducted a Phase I ESA of the Riffle Ford Road/Darnestown Road utility corridor in Germantown, Maryland. The property consisted of multiple transmission line corridors improved by metal lattice transmission towers, electrical substations and emergency generators running on a general west-east/southeast axis from the Pepco Quince Orchard Substation 118.

SPCC PLAN DEVELOPMENT






  





Federal regulations (40 CFR 112) require facilities with fuel storage capacities of greater than 1,320 gallons for aboveground tanks or 42,000 gallons for underground storage tanks to develop and implement Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plans to mitigate the potential for uncontrolled releases to the environment. The facility owner is responsible for reviewing and updating these plans every 5 years. Any amendments to the SPCC Plan must be certified by a Professional Engineer within six months after any changes to the facility’s design, construction, operation, or maintenance practices which change the potential for discharging oil into navigable waters. Tidewater’s Environmental Scientists and Professional Engineers are uniquely qualified to provide user-friendly SPCC plans to satisfy these laws.
SPCC Plans typically address the following topics: 

• Existing tanks, their capacities and their contents
• Predicting Flow Rates, Direction, and Maximum Discharge Quantities
• Existing containments and diversionary structures
• Requirements for periodic inspections, tests, and record keeping
• Personnel Training and Fuel Delivery Procedures
• Countermeasures, spill response and notification procedures








  












DULLES DISCOVERY FACILITY 
The Dulles Discovery Facility consists of approximately 135.82-acres in Herndon, Virginia. This facility has a combination of aboveground and underground fuel storage systems to provide adequate backup power to the building occupants in case of emergency. Tidewater prepared the full SPCC Plan following the addition of new tanks to the fuel storage system. 






  












BELTSVILLE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTER (BARC) 
BARC includes approximately 6,500 acres of land owned and operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Tidewater prepared the initial SPPC plan which included 80 emergency generators, 21 aboveground storage tanks and 11 underground storage tanks containing heating oil, used oil, diesel, unleaded gasoline. The facility also had 68 transformers and five (5) voltage regulators.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS






  





Compliance with the ever-changing regulatory environment is always a challenge for building owners and construction sites. The overlapping network of Federal, state and local laws can be inconsistent and confusing. Tidewater’s Environmental Scientists and Industrial Hygienists have decades of experience navigating the various regulatory agencies to clarify and ensure compliance for your job sites. Our experience ranges from public and private school systems, to commercial building owners, to work being conducted at various military and government facilities. Tidewater approaches these situations from the Client’s perspective, with an emphasis on providing plain language explanations and practical solutions. Common regulatory compliance challenges resolved by Tidewater include: 

• Complaints filed with OSHA by workers or building occupants
• Periodic inspections and 3-year re-inspections for public and private school systems, as well as updates to AHERA Management Plans
• Reporting chemical spills or releases from above ground or underground storage tanks
• Periodic inspections and testing for fuel storage systems
• Preparing Operations and Maintenance Plans for asbestos and lead-based paint
• Inventories and program development for management of confined spaces
• Reviews and updates of MSDS tracking systems and inventories








  












US COAST GUARD, AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER 
Tidewater provided full-time on base industrial hygiene support for Coast Guard activities in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. Duties included inspections of base operations for potential occupational safety and health issues, OSHA exposure assessments and sampling for heavy metals during aircraft repainting activities and noise assessments. 






  












NATIONAL OCEANIC & ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA)
Tidewater provides petroleum storage tank system management services, including annual UST catch basin testing, certified Underground Storage Tank (UST) systems inspections every three (3) years and tank tightness testing (TTT) services to verify the integrity of onsite USTs as required every five (5) years by the Maryland Department of the Environment.

OSHA EXPOSURE ASSESSMENTS






  





The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) for workers in an occupational environment. These standards are enforceable by law. Other organizations, such as The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH®) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), also provide recommended guidelines for exposure to potentially hazardous contaminants. On construction sites and manufacturing facilities, testing is necessary to determine if the existing personal protective equipment (PPE) policies are adequate for the exposures encountered on the job site. Tidewater has the regulatory knowledge and experience to conduct this personnel monitoring to ensure regulatory compliance.
Common exposure assessments conducted by Tidewater have included: 

• Asbestos
• Lead
• Silica
• Total and respirable particulate
• Noise/Sound
• Other chemicals released during application, curing or off-gassing of applied products








  












BN7 DATACENTER FACILITY 
This exposure assessment was conducted to document that onsite soil stabilization activities during construction would not result in potentially hazardous airborne Calcium Oxide concentrations. Results were compared to the OSHA PEL, as well as the recommended guidelines from NIOSH and ACGIH. 






  












MARRIOTT MARQUIS PROJECT 
The construction of the Marriott Marquis Hotel was based on the renovation of the historic Plumbers Union Building in Washington, DC. As part of our industrial hygiene support during this project, Tidewater conducted multiple worker exposure assessments for asbestos, lead, silica, hexavalent chromium and welding fumes in order to document compliance with OSHA regulations.

LEED PRE-OCCUPANCY IAQ TESTING






  





Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) guidance for new construction and major renovation require either a specific number of air changes in the renovation area prior to occupancy, or the collection and analysis of air samples to verify compliance with U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) guidelines for reoccupancy. These samples are collected after completion of renovation activities, and completion of the move-in of furniture and other systems necessary for the planned occupancy. Each set of samples is collected per floor, per air handling area unit zone, per 20,000 square feet to verify acceptable IAQ readings. Tidewater has the experience to conduct this sampling on short notice and with expedited analytical turnaround to avoid delays in project completion. Sampling includes: 

• Total Volatile Organic Compounds averaged over a 4 hour period using summa canisters. These samples are analyzed using EPA Method TO-15
• Airborne respirable particulate by data-logging over a 4-hour period to obtain average concentrations
• Formaldehyde samples are collected using passive monitoring badges over a 4-hour period
• Carbon monoxide (CO) by data-logging over a 4-hour period to obtain average concentrations
• Sampling for 4- Phenylcyclohexene (4-PCH)
• All samples are analyzed by an AIHA-accredited Laboratory

DRINKING WATER SAMPLING







  





Sampling of potable drinking water is usually conducted following significant renovation or periodically to ensure compliance with the EPA Primary and Secondary Drinking Water Standards. Sampling usually involves flushing the selected taps the evening prior to sampling, and then collection of the first water out of the taps the following morning. The EPA also recommends sampling of additional “flush” samples from the taps for more detailed analysis to show contaminant levels further back in the piping from the taps. Tidewater has field hygienists who are trained and experienced conducting drinking water sampling for EPA and state regulatory compliance. We also have hygienists who are Maryland-licensed for potable drinking sampling. Common sample analyses include: 

• Lead
• Copper
• Iron
• Total Coliforms & Escherichia coli (E. Coli)
• Legionella
• Turbidity
• pH, Color, Odor, Etc.








  












ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITAL – WASHINGTON, DC 
Tidewater conducts annual lead-in-drinking water sampling at Architect of the Capital facilities in the Washington DC Metropolitan area for compliance with EPA National Primary Drinking Water Regulations. The buildings that are sampled include the Capital Power Plant, the U.S. Senate Office Buildings, U.S. Supreme Court and Security Programs Offices.

INDOOR AIR QUALITY







  





Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) or Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) investigations and sampling remain one of the hottest issues in workplace occupational safety today. Tidewater has Certified Industrial Hygienists and Indoor Environmental Technicians with over 20 years of experience to help solve your occupant complaint problems. Our approach to addressing IAQ investigations is to design the scope of work to provide the best opportunity to provide useful information, while minimizing the cost. Whether it involves water infiltration problems, odor complaints or just general ventilation problems, Tidewater has the experience and training to help narrow the problem down to the root cause, so the problem can be solved. Field investigation and sampling typically includes: 

• Visual inspection of the complaint area and surrounding areas for common causes of IAQ problems, such as water infiltration, dust accumulation, HVAC problems or other issues
• Collecting measurements of Temperature, Relative Humidity, Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide and airborne respirable particulate in the complaint area and surrounding areas
• Data-logging of various air quality parameters to determine how conditions vary during the work day, or over several days
• Targeted air, bulk or swab sampling to address specific complaints in occupied areas; • Comparison with available EPA, OSHA, ACGIH or other available guidelines for occupied areas.








  












NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI) 
Tidewater provided consulting services at over thirty (30) locations at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Frederick, Maryland. IAQ and mold investigations were conducted, as well as quality control oversight during remediation to ensure the effectiveness of response actions. Sampling and monitoring would typically include swab testing surface sampling and air sampling.

ABATEMENT MONITORING






  





During the abatement of hazardous materials, on-site quality control industrial hygiene (IH) services are usually required to confirm that the materials are removed and disposed of in accordance with current regulations and the project specifications. Tidewater’s experienced Industrial Hygienists will continuously assess abatement contractor work practices and procedures, and collect daily air samples, to ensure compliance with approved work practices for the job site. Final clearance sampling can also be conducted as required by Federal or state regulations using either NIOSH 7400 Methodology (on-site analysis) or Transmission Electron Microscopy (laboratory analysis). Tidewater’s Industrial Hygienists are successful participants in the AIHA Asbestos Analytical Registry (AAR) Program. Services can include: 

• Assess abatement contractor work practices and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and project specifications governing the abatement
• Conduct air monitoring (daily and final clearance samples) and worker exposure assessments during abatement activities in accordance with EPA/OSHA regulations to verify the effectiveness of the work area containment and adequacy of worker personal protective equipment(PPE)
• Conduct final clearance visual inspections and appropriate air or surface wipe sampling to verify the effectiveness of the abatement process prior to reoccupancy by other trades or building occupants.

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS & INVESTIGATIONS







  





Tidewater has over a dozen trained and experienced hazardous materials building inspectors and risk assessors to assist during building renovation or demolition in the Mid-Atlantic region. These inspections are typically needed prior to start of work to identify any hazardous materials that might pose an exposure concern to building occupants or the contractors performing the work. Disturbance of these materials might also require Federal and state permitting, use of licensed remediation contractors and specialized waste stream disposal procedures. This is especially true for facilities built prior to 1981, but can also apply to newer structures depending on their use and history. These complications can have a serious impact on project timelines and costs. 

• Asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint or lead-containing materials
• Polychlorinated biphenyls (fluorescent light ballasts, transformers, electrical equipment, etc.)
• Mercury thermostats, switches, fluorescent light tubes, etc.
• Other types of universal waste
• Chemical storage and/or spills
• Water damage and mold
• Underground or aboveground storage tanks

Evaluated an average of 240 properties each month across 8 states in the Western United States, as well as several Pacific Island areas. Adjust resource allocations to accommodate large changes in task order volume while maintaining our commitments to quality, pricing, and 6-day turnaround time. Utilized an internet-based system to allow inspectors to upload data, notes, digital photographs, and other documentation from remote sites, saving time and allowing immediate QC oversight. Managed >40 subcontractors at geographically diverse locations while meeting rapid scheduling demands. Reduced site costs 20% through use of local resources.

Bar Supplies
All of the tools and supplies that professional bartenders need



        Bar supplies are an important part of our product offering at foodservicedirect. Finding quality products in this segment can be tricky, as many manufacturers of bar supplies are smaller and do not produce other food service items. For almost 20 years we have worked to fine tune our bar supply offering, we hope you'll enjoy our broad selection and competitive prices.
