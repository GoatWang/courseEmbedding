Rosalie O’Reilly Wooten Children’s Fund






Breast Cancer Foundation of the Ozarks names Rosalie O’Reilly Wooten Children’s Fund
Press Release PDF
Springfield, MO, May 2, 2017 – A special gift has been presented to Breast Cancer Foundation of the Ozarks (BCFO) from Rosalie O’Reilly Wooten.  Rosalie taught children during her career, and continues to be passionate about child welfare and childhood opportunities.  Because of her desire to help children in the Ozarks, Rosalie has made an estate gift to BCFO to endow the Children’s Fund.  “During treatment for breast cancer, a family frequently cannot afford the costs associated with traveling to treatment or paying household bills.  Children’s needs often go unaddressed during periods of family crisis,” states Rosalie O’Reilly Wooten.
BCFO provides financial assistance to families across the Ozarks with a household member in treatment for breast cancer.  Many years ago, founder Mary Beth O’Reilly recognized the special needs of children in these households.  “We are thrilled Rosalie has made this gift to help with the special needs of children in the homes of local breast cancer patients.  The Rosalie O’Reilly Wooten Children’s Fund will provide for these needs faced by many families as missed work combines with increased medical costs,” states BCFO founder Mary Beth O’Reilly.
As a component of BCFO’s endowment, the Rosalie O’Reilly Wooten Children’s Fund provides services including childcare, school lunches, school supplies, clothing, eyeglasses, orthodontic continuation, holiday gifts and other child specific needs.  During the last fiscal year, 167 children in the homes of local breast cancer patients received assistance from the Children’s Fund.  Mrs. O’Reilly Wooten’s gift will sustain this program for future generations.
BCFO is a local 501(c)3 not-for-profit.  BCFO is an organization of people reaching out to friends and neighbors who have been affected by breast cancer.  BCFO offers personal support and comfort in real and practical ways.   For more information regarding BCFO please contact (417) 862-3838 or visit online at bcfo.org.
