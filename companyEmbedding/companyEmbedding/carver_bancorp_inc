        NEW YORK, July 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Carver Bancorp, Inc. (the 'Company') (NASDAQ: CARV), the holding company for Carver Federal Savings Bank, today announced that on July 17, 2017, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market stating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because it did not timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K ('Form 10-K') for the period ended March 31, 2017 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
      


        As previously disclosed, the Company was unable to file its Form 10-K on time because, after consultation with BDO USA, LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Company has determined that it will restate its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and its unaudited interim financial statements for each of the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2015 through December 31, 2016.
      

        The Nasdaq Stock Market letter states that the Company has until September 15, 2017 to submit a plan to regain compliance with its rules.
      

        The Company is working diligently with its auditors and other external advisers to complete the necessary work required to file its Form 10-K for the period ended March 31, 2017 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Company intends to notify the Nasdaq Stock Market of such filing as soon as it is practicable.

History[edit]
Carver was named after agricultural researcher and scientist, George Washington Carver, and began its operations at 53 West 125th Street in 1948. Founders of the bank revered Mr. Carver, who used his immense talent to improve the economic status of his community, race, and all of mankind. On November 5, 1948, Carver received a federal bank charter under the name of Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association. On January 5, 1949, it opened its first branch office in Harlem, New York at 53 West 125th Street. In February 1961, Carver opened a second branch in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. In June 1975, a third branch was opened in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York. In July 1982, Carver merged with Allied Federal Bank. Carver became a federal savings bank and changed its name to Carver Federal Savings Bank in 1986. Today, the Bank manages ten full-service branches and fourteen ATM Centers in Bedford Stuyvesant, Crown Heights, Flatbush, Fort Greene, Harlem, East Harlem, Jamaica and St. Albans.
Relationship to the community[edit]
From its inception, the goal of Carver was to foster community growth by providing local residents a place to obtain mortgages to buy homes, and grow businesses within the communities it serves. 100% of Carver's multi-family loans are within low-to-moderate income neighborhoods. Eighty percent of Carver's deposits are invested in the neighborhoods that it serves. Over the last two years, Carver has provided $200 million in community development, commercial real estate, and small business loans. In addition, Carver provides free financial empowerment workshops and tax preparation services. Carver's strong devotion to community is represented in the company's slogan: "Building Wealth Block by Block." The logo of Carver Federal Savings Bank is represented by two conjoined "C"'s which is meant to express the nexus of Carver and the Communities it serves. Carver has been designated by the U.S. Treasury Department as a Community Development Financial Institution ("CDFI") because of Carver's community-focused banking services and dedication to the economic viability and revitalization of underserved neighborhoods. A measure of its progress in achieving this goal includes the Bank's consistent "Outstanding" Community Reinvestment Act rating.
Carver Federal Savings Bank Headquarters[edit]
Carver is headquartered at 75 West 125th Street in Harlem, New York.
Carver Rebuilds Headquarters[edit]
In October 1992, the banks headquarters at 75 West 125th Street was destroyed by a fire which caused the bank to temporarily move one block away. In March 1996, Carver returned home to a newly constructed headquarters, a four-story, state-of-the-art symbol of the economic renaissance of Harlem.
Carver IPO[edit]
On October 24, 1994, following an IPO, the Bank became the first African-American operated bank listed on NASDAQ, with the symbol "CARV". In 1996, Carver completed its reorganization into a holding company and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Carver Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Each share of the Bank's common stock was exchanged for one share of the Bancorp common stock. On May 21, 1997, Carver listed its stock on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol "CNY". On July 2, 2007, NASDAQ approved the company's application to transfer its common stock listing from the American Stock Exchange back to NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "CARV". Carver began trading again on July 10, 2007.
Transition of Leadership[edit]
From 1948 to 1968, Carver was led by Joseph E. Davis, its first President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). In 1970, Richard Greene was appointed President and CEO and led Carver for the next 25 years. In 1995, Thomas Clark Jr. was appointed director, President and succeeding Richard Greene. In April 1999, Carver's Board of Directors appointed Deborah C. Wright as its second female President and CEO. She retired as CEO on December 31, 2014 and will continue to serve as Executive Chairman of the Board. Effective January 1, 2015 Michael T. Pugh, the President and Chief Operating Officer succeeded Ms. Wright as CEO.[1]
Business and Branch Network[edit]

On November 5, 1948, Carver received a federal bank charter under the name of Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association. On January 5, 1949, it opened its first branch office in Harlem, New York at 53 West 125th Street. In February 1961, Carver opened a second branch in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. In June 1975, a third branch was opened in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York. In July 1982, Carver merged with Allied Federal Bank. Carver became a federal savings bank and changed its name to Carver Federal Savings Bank in 1986. Today, the Bank manages ten full-service branches and fourteen ATM Centers in Bedford Stuyvesant, Crown Heights, Flatbush, Fort Greene, Harlem, East Harlem, Jamaica and St. Albans.
Relationship to the community[edit]
From its inception, the goal of Carver was to foster community growth by providing local residents a place to obtain mortgages to buy homes, and grow businesses within the communities it serves. 100% of Carver's multi-family loans are within low-to-moderate income neighborhoods. Eighty percent of Carver's deposits are invested in the neighborhoods that it serves. Over the last two years, Carver has provided $200 million in community development, commercial real estate, and small business loans. In addition, Carver provides free financial empowerment workshops and tax preparation services. Carver's strong devotion to community is represented in the company's slogan: "Building Wealth Block by Block." The logo of Carver Federal Savings Bank is represented by two conjoined "C"'s which is meant to express the nexus of Carver and the Communities it serves. Carver has been designated by the U.S. Treasury Department as a Community Development Financial Institution ("CDFI") because of Carver's community-focused banking services and dedication to the economic viability and revitalization of underserved neighborhoods. A measure of its progress in achieving this goal includes the Bank's consistent "Outstanding" Community Reinvestment Act rating.
Carver Federal Savings Bank Headquarters[edit]
Carver is headquartered at 75 West 125th Street in Harlem, New York.
Carver Rebuilds Headquarters[edit]
In October 1992, the banks headquarters at 75 West 125th Street was destroyed by a fire which caused the bank to temporarily move one block away. In March 1996, Carver returned home to a newly constructed headquarters, a four-story, state-of-the-art symbol of the economic renaissance of Harlem.
Carver IPO[edit]
On October 24, 1994, following an IPO, the Bank became the first African-American operated bank listed on NASDAQ, with the symbol "CARV". In 1996, Carver completed its reorganization into a holding company and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Carver Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Each share of the Bank's common stock was exchanged for one share of the Bancorp common stock. On May 21, 1997, Carver listed its stock on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol "CNY". On July 2, 2007, NASDAQ approved the company's application to transfer its common stock listing from the American Stock Exchange back to NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "CARV". Carver began trading again on July 10, 2007.
Transition of Leadership[edit]
From 1948 to 1968, Carver was led by Joseph E. Davis, its first President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). In 1970, Richard Greene was appointed President and CEO and led Carver for the next 25 years. In 1995, Thomas Clark Jr. was appointed director, President and succeeding Richard Greene. In April 1999, Carver's Board of Directors appointed Deborah C. Wright as its second female President and CEO. She retired as CEO on December 31, 2014 and will continue to serve as Executive Chairman of the Board. Effective January 1, 2015 Michael T.

Safety Tips

Like your computer, your mobile device needs to be protected. Help protect your personal information by being aware of the following mobile security threats:

Fraudulent texting, calling and voicemails are on the rise. Just like in fraudulent email, requests for personal information or a call for immediate action are almost always a scam.
Fraudulent mobile apps may capture your personal information and transmit it to their servers. Always download apps from approved sources like your mobile service provider or mobile device manufacturer’s marketplace.
Identity thieves may physically access your mobile phone when you are not watching and try to steal personal information. Use the password or PIN feature on your mobile device.
Be aware of shoulder surfing while accessing mobile banking.
Do not store your PIN and personal data on your mobile devices.
Protect your mobile device just as you would your computer. Secure your mobile device by using a strong passcode and be cautious about the sites you visit and the information you release.
Do not leave your mobile device idle while your mobile banking session is still active.
When banking and shopping on your mobile device, check to be sure the sites are secure. Look for Web addresses with https: in the address. This means the site takes extra measures to help secure your information.


Mobile Deposit Capture

Mobile Deposit lets you electronically make deposits on-the-go from any smartphone. Just use the phone’s camera to take a picture of the front and back of a check, and then submit the image to your Carver Bank checking or savings account. Immediately get confirmation of your deposit. It couldn’t be easier or more convenient.

Investee business model
Carver Bancorp, Inc. is the holding company of Carver Federal Savings Bank (here the term Carver is used interchangeably for the two entities). It was founded in 1948 to serve African-American communities whose residents, businesses, and institutions had limited access to mainstream financial services. Carver provides loans to the housing and small business sectors, check cashing, remittances and other non-credit financial services, and financial counseling. It serves consumers, businesses, and nonprofit organizations, including faith-based institutions.

Motivations for investment
Carver is an attractive investment for NCIF due to its mission and long history of serving underserved communities. The bank has significant relationships with local community and faith-based organizations, city and state government programs, and nonprofit support. Carver's network enhances its impact while contributing to its future success. It is the largest African-American operated CDFI bank in the U.S. with a mission to expand wealth-enhancing opportunities in the multi-ethnic communities it serves. As of December 2010, 77 percent of its home lending and 67 percent of its branches were located in low- and moderate-income areas. Through NCIF, Carver has identified an investor that will help it endure the unprecedented impact of the U.S. financial crisis that began in 2008, continue its work in underserved markets, and grow. NCIF's investment has the potential to offer significant returns to it and other investors through Carver's organic growth in lending opportunities, new lines of business, and acquisitions.

Source of deal
NCIF was an existing investor in Carver when the bank began this capital raise. Carver secured a total of USD 55 million from seven institutional investors, including NCIF. NCIF invested to reinforce the bank's social and economic development commitment and to help close the capital raise. NCIF was Carver's only existing investor participating in this investment round, affirming its commitment to support institutions through socially responsible investments and its belief in Carver's impact.

Stage of company at time of investment
Mature

Purpose of investment
The funds from the capital raise are being used to recapitalize the bank and to provide growth capital for expanding its financial services in New York City's inner city communities.

Investment impact objectives
NCIF's targeted impact for the investment is twofold. First, the investment was made at a time when Carver was under stress due to the broader economic recession of 2008. Second, NCIF's investment in Carver supports one of the pillars of the CDFI banking industry and signals to other investors and stakeholders that CDFI banks are vital to traditionally financially-underserved populations and should be supported in difficult economic times. NCIF believes that its investment will allow Carver to grow and further expand its work in the communities it serves.

Social and environmental metrics tracked on investment
NCIF performs an annual impact analysis on all of its investees, based on the social performance metrics it pioneered for community development banks in 2007. These metrics focus on lending activity of depository institutions in low- to moderate-income communities as well as their physical presence in these communities.NCIF also collects data through a community impact survey that is sent to investee institutions. It contains questions on the size and demographics of institutions' employees, the types of credit, financial, and non-financial services they provide, and the demographic makeup of their customers. As part of the survey, NCIF also tracks metrics that are aligned with IRIS (IRIS alignment noted in parentheses), including:Number of Loans Originated or PurchasedLocation of Organization's Operating Facilities (IRIS aligned - OD1777)Mission Statement (IRIS aligned - OI4324) Total Employees (IRIS aligned - OI3160)Minority Employees (IRIS aligned - OI8147)Female Employees (IRIS aligned - OI6213)Number of Board Members (IRIS aligned - OI1075)Racial/ Ethnic Minority Board Members (IRIS aligned - OI6696)Female Board Members (IRIS aligned - OI8118)Product/Service Information - Other Financial Services Offered (IRIS aligned - PD5098)Product/Service Information - Non-Financial Services Offered (IRIS aligned - PD9681)Jobs Maintained (in Financed Enterprises) (IRIS aligned - PI5691)Jobs Created (in Financed Enterprises) (IRIS aligned - PI3687)Technical Assistance - Individuals (IRIS aligned - PI5352)Technical Assistance - Group-Based (IRIS aligned - PI7997)Technical Assistance - Organizations (IRIS aligned - PI6065)

History[edit]
Carver was named after agricultural researcher and scientist, George Washington Carver, and began its operations at 53 West 125th Street in 1948. Founders of the bank revered Mr. Carver, who used his immense talent to improve the economic status of his community, race, and all of mankind. On November 5, 1948, Carver received a federal bank charter under the name of Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association. On January 5, 1949, it opened its first branch office in Harlem, New York at 53 West 125th Street. In February 1961, Carver opened a second branch in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. In June 1975, a third branch was opened in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York. In July 1982, Carver merged with Allied Federal Bank. Carver became a federal savings bank and changed its name to Carver Federal Savings Bank in 1986. Today, the Bank manages ten full-service branches and fourteen ATM Centers in Bedford Stuyvesant, Crown Heights, Flatbush, Fort Greene, Harlem, East Harlem, Jamaica and St. Albans.
Relationship to the community[edit]
From its inception, the goal of Carver was to foster community growth by providing local residents a place to obtain mortgages to buy homes, and grow businesses within the communities it serves. 100% of Carver's multi-family loans are within low-to-moderate income neighborhoods. Eighty percent of Carver's deposits are invested in the neighborhoods that it serves. Over the last two years, Carver has provided $200 million in community development, commercial real estate, and small business loans. In addition, Carver provides free financial empowerment workshops and tax preparation services. Carver's strong devotion to community is represented in the company's slogan: "Building Wealth Block by Block." The logo of Carver Federal Savings Bank is represented by two conjoined "C"'s which is meant to express the nexus of Carver and the Communities it serves. Carver has been designated by the U.S. Treasury Department as a Community Development Financial Institution ("CDFI") because of Carver's community-focused banking services and dedication to the economic viability and revitalization of underserved neighborhoods. A measure of its progress in achieving this goal includes the Bank's consistent "Outstanding" Community Reinvestment Act rating.
Carver Federal Savings Bank Headquarters[edit]
Carver is headquartered at 75 West 125th Street in Harlem, New York.
Carver Rebuilds Headquarters[edit]
In October 1992, the banks headquarters at 75 West 125th Street was destroyed by a fire which caused the bank to temporarily move one block away. In March 1996, Carver returned home to a newly constructed headquarters, a four-story, state-of-the-art symbol of the economic renaissance of Harlem.
Carver IPO[edit]
On October 24, 1994, following an IPO, the Bank became the first African-American operated bank listed on NASDAQ, with the symbol "CARV". In 1996, Carver completed its reorganization into a holding company and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Carver Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Each share of the Bank's common stock was exchanged for one share of the Bancorp common stock. On May 21, 1997, Carver listed its stock on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol "CNY". On July 2, 2007, NASDAQ approved the company's application to transfer its common stock listing from the American Stock Exchange back to NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "CARV". Carver began trading again on July 10, 2007.
Transition of Leadership[edit]
From 1948 to 1968, Carver was led by Joseph E. Davis, its first President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). In 1970, Richard Greene was appointed President and CEO and led Carver for the next 25 years. In 1995, Thomas Clark Jr. was appointed director, President and succeeding Richard Greene. In April 1999, Carver's Board of Directors appointed Deborah C. Wright as its second female President and CEO. She retired as CEO on December 31, 2014 and will continue to serve as Executive Chairman of the Board. Effective January 1, 2015 Michael T. Pugh, the President and Chief Operating Officer succeeded Ms. Wright as CEO.[1]
Business and Branch Network[edit]
As of 2014, the Bank operates ten full-service branches and fourteen ATMs in stand-alone ATM centers in New York City. Carver has administrative offices in Harlem and Downtown Brooklyn. The company is headquartered in Harlem, New York.
The bank takes deposits, which it principally lends in the form of mortgage loans for purchase or refinance of residential and commercial properties, and for construction or renovation of commercial properties and residential housing developments. Carver is a leading lender to Houses of Worship and non-project organizations.

Carver was founded in 1948 in Harlem to serve African-American communities whose residents, businesses, and institutions global central banks, had limited access to mainstream financial services.

History[edit]
Carver was named after agricultural researcher and scientist, George Washington Carver, and began its operations at 53 West 125th Street in 1948. Founders of the bank revered Mr. Carver, who used his immense talent to improve the economic status of his community, race, and all of mankind. On November 5, 1948, Carver received a federal bank charter under the name of Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association. On January 5, 1949, it opened its first branch office in Harlem, New York at 53 West 125th Street. In February 1961, Carver opened a second branch in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. In June 1975, a third branch was opened in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York. In July 1982, Carver merged with Allied Federal Bank. Carver became a federal savings bank and changed its name to Carver Federal Savings Bank in 1986. Today, the Bank manages ten full-service branches and fourteen ATM Centers in Bedford Stuyvesant, Crown Heights, Flatbush, Fort Greene, Harlem, East Harlem, Jamaica and St. Albans.
Relationship to the community[edit]
From its inception, the goal of Carver was to foster community growth by providing local residents a place to obtain mortgages to buy homes, and grow businesses within the communities it serves. 100% of Carver's multi-family loans are within low-to-moderate income neighborhoods. Eighty percent of Carver's deposits are invested in the neighborhoods that it serves. Over the last two years, Carver has provided $200 million in community development, commercial real estate, and small business loans. In addition, Carver provides free financial empowerment workshops and tax preparation services. Carver's strong devotion to community is represented in the company's slogan: "Building Wealth Block by Block." The logo of Carver Federal Savings Bank is represented by two conjoined "C"'s which is meant to express the nexus of Carver and the Communities it serves. Carver has been designated by the U.S. Treasury Department as a Community Development Financial Institution ("CDFI") because of Carver's community-focused banking services and dedication to the economic viability and revitalization of underserved neighborhoods. A measure of its progress in achieving this goal includes the Bank's consistent "Outstanding" Community Reinvestment Act rating.
Carver Federal Savings Bank Headquarters[edit]
Carver is headquartered at 75 West 125th Street in Harlem, New York.
Carver Rebuilds Headquarters[edit]
In October 1992, the banks headquarters at 75 West 125th Street was destroyed by a fire which caused the bank to temporarily move one block away. In March 1996, Carver returned home to a newly constructed headquarters, a four-story, state-of-the-art symbol of the economic renaissance of Harlem.
Carver IPO[edit]
On October 24, 1994, following an IPO, the Bank became the first African-American operated bank listed on NASDAQ, with the symbol "CARV". In 1996, Carver completed its reorganization into a holding company and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Carver Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Each share of the Bank's common stock was exchanged for one share of the Bancorp common stock. On May 21, 1997, Carver listed its stock on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol "CNY". On July 2, 2007, NASDAQ approved the company's application to transfer its common stock listing from the American Stock Exchange back to NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "CARV". Carver began trading again on July 10, 2007.
Transition of Leadership[edit]
From 1948 to 1968, Carver was led by Joseph E. Davis, its first President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). In 1970, Richard Greene was appointed President and CEO and led Carver for the next 25 years. In 1995, Thomas Clark Jr. was appointed director, President and succeeding Richard Greene. In April 1999, Carver's Board of Directors appointed Deborah C. Wright as its second female President and CEO. She retired as CEO on December 31, 2014 and will continue to serve as Executive Chairman of the Board. Effective January 1, 2015 Michael T. Pugh, the President and Chief Operating Officer succeeded Ms. Wright as CEO.[1]
Business and Branch Network[edit]
As of 2014, the Bank operates ten full-service branches and fourteen ATMs in stand-alone ATM centers in New York City. Carver has administrative offices in Harlem and Downtown Brooklyn. The company is headquartered in Harlem, New York.
The bank takes deposits, which it principally lends in the form of mortgage loans for purchase or refinance of residential and commercial properties, and for construction or renovation of commercial properties and residential housing developments. Carver is a leading lender to Houses of Worship and non-project organizations.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
