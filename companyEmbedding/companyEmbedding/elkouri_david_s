In the beginning the insurance adjuster seemed like they were looking out for my best interest, but that soon changed when I asked about getting a second opinion from a doctor of my choosing. Soon after my weekly benefits were cut off, because of the doctor they(insurance company) sent me to said something other than what the doctor I went to for a second opinion said. I immediately hired Dennis Phelps as my work comp attorney. The power trip was over for the insurance company adjuster. Weekly benefits were reinstated and recommendations from that second opinion were followed through on. Over the four years, I underwent several surgeries and numerous procedures but if I had a question and called or emailed Mr. Phelps he would always respond back within a few hours. I am very grateful for Mr. Phelps attentive advice and support he provided to our family during this lengthy process. He was able to negotiate the maximum award amount for my injury which has helped greatly.  If you get injured at work, don't hesitate, give Dennis Phelps a call. He is very professional and will get you the correct medical treatment and benefits you deserve along with the maximum settlement in the end!Rocky Wiechman LawMisty R. ratedThings didn't work out, but Rocky let us switch most of our retainer to another attorney, so that was nice. Overall communication was poor, and I never received an invoice with hours. Rocky didn't go see my brother (his client) in jail to let him know what was going on with his case until I called the office to let him go from our council. It was a whole week before Rocky spoke with his client. I thought that was odd, but maybe he is just too busy. In my opinion, don't take cases you don't have time for. I cannot say how he is with other clients. It was a hassle to get a hold of Rocky too, he never answered, is never in the office, and never replied to my emails. He made my family and I feel like we were bothering him. I think that when you're paying for a job, you should be reassured about what's going on with a loved one, and you should never be made to feel like you are "bothering" the person you've contracted. Regardless, I am happy he was a decent person and gave back $1800 of the $2500 retainer we put down, even though he didn't speak to my brother (his client) once about his case the whole month and a half we had contracted him. Cummings Nika A Jbfulton85 ratedI was having a tough time last year after losing my job, and ended up being charged with dui afterdeciding to drive to see a girl after hanging downtown. I thought I was fine (I only had a couple drinks), but ended up being pulled over (I blew .08 - give me a break). I had to spend the whole night in jail with people that were absolutely hammered – a homeless guy literally puked. Since I'd been looking for a new job, the last thing I needed was a dui on my record. A friend recommended Bill, so I set up a meeting. It didn't cost anything to just go talk to him, which I really liked since it took the initial pressure off. I don't know if I would have been as likely to go if I knew it was going to cost me. I had to give up my license for a month instead of a year and he got me a diversion so my record stayed clean). My bill was about half of what I was led to expect (from my friend) – so I don't know if my case went more smoothly or he's just gotten quicker/better. All in all, thanks to Bill, it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be (minus the night in jail with that disgusting homeless guy).Lazzo, Markhannabanana4217 ratedI really tried my hardest to avoid filing bankruptcy (I spent more on my credit cards than I should have in college, expecting the job market to improve later when I graduated) but had to seek help when I finally realized I was in over my head. I guess I chose Mr. Lazzo because his office is closer to where I live than most of the attorneys in town (and I didn't want to have to mess with frequently commuting downtown). I don't think I was in as much debt as many that decide to go the bankruptcy route, but I needed help nonetheless. He handled everything extremely well, and now I can finally start over. I'm very glad I chose Mark. Law Office Of Tammy MartinCheryl J. ratedI have seen Tammy twice, the first time nearly 20 years ago and again just this week. She was, both times, very helpful, knowledgeable, courteous and friendly, caring, efficient, timely with services needed, and fees for services rendered were extremely reasonable. She met with me and my two witnesses at a nursing home so my brother did not have to leave his room to sign the forms needed. Both episodes of services needed were absolutely positive and I would not hesitate one second to seek further legal help from Tammy Martin. Thank you, again, Tammy!Arif Haeri LLP Law OfficesGayle S. ratedI know of five people that have used this attorney for their bankruptcies. & I plan to use them as well. They have all had very positive experiences. The attorney is very helpful in regard to payment arrangements and he is very aggressive with creditors who try to collect after the bankruptcy has been discharged. He is the only bankruptcy attorney I will recommend to others.Joseph Hollander & CraftWichita W. ratedThese are some of the most talented attorneys in Wichita and handle most of the big cases in the area as well. I have personally used their services several times for a few different issues and could not be happier. The divorce and dui defense teams are no joke.

She is very experienced in family law.Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of.
