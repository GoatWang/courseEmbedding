Quality Companies at Reasonable Prices


 

Frontier markets present unique challenges and rewards. They are inherently and attractively inefficient, brimming with opportunities for discerning investors to own stakes in high quality companies at relatively low share prices. They are also rife with potential pitfalls for less discriminating and passive investors. In frontier markets there is no substitute for proprietary research, analysis, and on-site exposure to the intricacies of the enterprises, their markets, and the social, financial, regulatory and government structures in which they operate.

MARKETS
 


 

Why Invest in Frontier Markets?
The case for equity investing in frontier markets draws from multiple factors: strong historical precedent, the power of economic globalization, the compelling diversification benefits demonstrated by frontier investments, and the unbridled optimism and entrepreneurial spirit of the people who live and work in these countries. 
Why invest in frontier markets? Here are just a few reasons:



Frontier Markets are Young 

The demographics of frontier market populations are tilted more toward the workforce than the retirement home, as seen  in developed and emerging markets. These characteristics point to potential for productivity growth and expanding consumer classes -- the stuff investment returns are made of.    




Frontier Markets Act Differently 

Stock market return patterns in frontier markets don't parallel those of the rest of the world. In fact, return patterns from country to country on the frontier show low correlation to each other, providing investors excellent potential to diversify any portfolio.



 Economic Development has Proven a Powerful Return Engine 

The ability of economic development to generate investment return has proven efficacious in the world's emerging markets, from the rapid growth of the Asian Tiger economies of the 1980s to the advances in Chile, Israel, and Brazil in the 1990s to the ascent of China and India in more recent years. Frontier markets tread this same path to development.



 Life is Getting Better Faster for People in Frontier Markets and this Positive Change is Fueling Optimism 

 People in developed markets do not necessarily believe life will be better for themselves and their children in the future. People in frontier markets have little doubt that their quality of life will improve and they are motivated to work hard to augment the change.   



 A Flatter, Shrinking World is Rapidly Delivering Benefits and Opportunities to Frontier Markets 

 Many business owners, workers, and consumers in frontier markets will never know a landline phone or fax machine. Leapfrogging technology is bringing incredible depth of information and power to the shirt pockets and fingertips of emerging entrepreneurs on the frontier.       



 Frontier Markets are Inefficient 

 For all of the modernity arriving on the frontier, investment information on the perimeter still needs to be retrieved through human sources, site visits, and traditional analysis. This means greater potential for investors who are able to enlist the resources of a focused and experienced professional team.

The Road Less Traveled: A Different Way to Invest in Frontier Markets 

The virtuous cycle of development in frontier markets goes from improved productivity to economic growth to a higher standard of living and back to more improving productivity. Investors who provide patient capital to the cycle through disciplined approaches may achieve desirable outcomes in terms of both risk and reward. 



Unconstrained and Disciplined 

Investment opportunity in frontier markets may occur in any of five regions (Africa, Asia, Caribbean/Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East) and in more than 60 different markets. Transaction costs can run high, liquidity conditions can be complex, and business practices are anything but standard. The ratio of participation between local and outside investors varies widely from country to country. As a result, the characteristics of individual markets and stocks are colored by market-specific human behavior and trading nuances. 

We add value through country analysis, security analysis and portfolio construction. We focus on businesses that are integrated to the development of frontier market consumers.  Investment candidates must offer quality products and service and also have good growth prospects, solid management, and transparent accounting practices. 

In this pursuit, there is no substitute for direct contact with company managements, field research, and hands-on confirmation. There is no standard form of analysis. Sometimes the greatest opportunities lie in places that are far from comfort, but have the potential for sweeping change. Our passports bear stamps documenting frequent travel to some of the world's least developed but most interesting locations. Likewise, our research dossiers bulge with customized financial analyses, interview notes, and qualitative reporting source material. 

All of this is essential to an investment strategy that seeks the best opportunities not the emulation of a benchmark. Our strictly opportunistic style means we won't drift into emerging or developed market stocks when more challenging conditions arise. 

With more than 40 years of experience in researching and analyzing the global marketplace and identifying growth trends and market opportunities, as well as more than a decade of exclusive frontier markets focus, we believe our philosophy and process will continue to deliver unique, investable insights and compelling outcomes from the frontier.

Core Beliefs  

At Frontier Market Asset Management we dutifully follow core tenets and apply rigorous disciplines.

We believe value provides protection and profit in frontier stock markets.
	Value must be complemented by sound businesses - we look for quality companies at reasonable prices (“QUARP”).

	Quality is defined by good growth prospects, competitive products and services, solid management, and transparent accounting practices. 

	We look for companies that Graham and Dodd would like for their value and Warren Buffett would like for their growth.


In following these disciplines we find that we are often co-owners of companies along with managements and long-term, local investors. We find ourselves less often in the company of larger, high-turnover funds.

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. THERE IS RISK OF LOSS. YOU CAN LOSE MONEY IN A MANAGED FUTURES PROGRAM.
*For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a funds’ monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.
Morningstar Rating is for the I share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics.
