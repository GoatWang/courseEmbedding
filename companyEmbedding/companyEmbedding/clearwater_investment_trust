				Services and Methods 
			



Clearwater employs a rigorous fundamental, active, and historically-informed management approach aimed to provide superior risk appropriate portfolios for clients.
 
Strategic asset allocation is implemented through evidence-based statistics, valuation awareness, and historically informed, active investment management. Clearwater believes this process offers the best means of realizing client goals and objectives by exploiting the full investment cycle. Portfolios are customized to address each client’s psychological and financial ability to accept risk. 
 
Clearwater is fee only and independent.  Fee only means--no commissions. Independent means--we do not sell a parent company fund investment suite or have third party revenue sharing agreements. We aim only to generate good returns.
 
Philosophy
 The firm's investment philosophy and process is intensely focused on risk management, seeking to protect client capital during periods of market decline while providing attractive returns during positive market environments.  Each individual has unique investment needs. ClearWater uses independent research, technology and innovation to help individual investors with their financial goals, now and in the future. 

Objectivity – We are fee-based and independent. Our only incentive is to generate good results.
Diversification – We believe in diversification to reduce asset class risk but we also believe in selectively exploiting asset class opportunities.
Discipline – Our discipline is based on rational decision rules and fundamental analysis. This mitigates sloppy decision making and emotionally based decision errors.
All-Star Approach – Exceptionally in-depth research gives us access to highly skilled managers.
Quality of Service – We tailor an investment plan to your needs. 
Access to intensive research and a disciplined process are critical to long-term investment success.
Global diversification expands our opportunity set.
A long-term approach allows us to take advantage of mis-priced investments.
Using mutual funds allows us to access some of the world’s premier investment minds.  No one organization has a monopoly on investment talent.

 
Strategic Allocation
 

Investment portfolios should be customized to meet the objectives of each client.
It’s a starting point for our portfolio allocations
It provides a sensible long-term target allocation absent of “fat-pitch” opportunities.
It offers a constant frame of reference against which to measure the impact of our tactical decisions
It ensures a consistent discipline in decision-making

 
Tactical Allocation
 

“Fat-Pitch” Opportunity — An extreme undervaluation (or overvaluation) relative to alternative asset classes.
Many Asset Class Options — Asset classes not included in the strategic allocations are considered as are style and market cap opportunities.
Analysis — Identifying fat-pitches requires in-depth analysis of fundamentals and valuations.
Patience — Requires waiting for fat-pitch opportunities and not swinging at bad pitches.
Adding Value — High odds of being right over a market cycle.

 
Scenario Analysis
 

Threshold for Loss -- Each portfolio has a one-year loss threshold.
Periodic Use of Risk Scenarios --   Different risk scenarios are identified and used to assess the potential impact on each holding as well as the portfolio as a whole. If risk is in excess of the threshold, the portfolio is adjusted.
No guarantees --  No guarantee that risk thresholds can be avoided

 
Communication 
 

Strategies customized to meet each client’s goals and objectives (Investment Policy Statement)
Frequent communication
Monthly brokerage reports
Quarterly performance reports and portfolio appraisals
Quarterly client letter discussing outlook and strategy
Semi-Annual reviews

This is How Merrill Lynch/Bank of America Treats Clients 

	on Thursday, 01 October 2015. 
Posted in Blog 



Bank of America & Merrill Lynch fines, those deceits, manipulations and frauds that we know about totaled $101 billion for the last 15 years. Of course, this behavior would be largely impossible for firms without giant sized budgets for buying congressional influence with lobbying and campaign contributions.  My favorite Merrill fraud: "settling with FINRA for overcharging more than 47,000 retirement accounts & charities that invested in mutual funds--fined $97 million."  Click below for corporate settlement table for BOA/ML.

The Truth About US Equity Valuations 

	Written by Ronald Granberg 
on Thursday, 25 September 2014. 
Posted in Blog 

	 Co-authored by Ron Granberg, CFA & John Lombardo, CFA of Bluewater Capital Management LLC 



It has been said that there are multiple stages leading to the acceptance of a great truth. It may initially be dismissed as absurd, then violently opposed, and finally accepted as though it were never in doubt. Warnings of investment bubbles follow a similar pattern. Because valuations correlate poorly with returns over the subsequent one-to-two years, early warnings that valuations are becoming stretched are often dismissed as stocks surge higher. As valuations rise further into the stratosphere, such warnings draw the ire of most investment professionals, whose counterattack typically relies on new valuation criteria, arguments that historically sound valuation metrics are no longer valid, and talk of “new eras.” When the bubble collapses, investors are left with steep losses and self-recrimination as they realize the market was indeed seriously overvalued.
Currently, we appear to be in the second stage of truth regarding the bubble in US equities, the third in just the last 15 years. The current narrative rests largely on the fallacy that you “can’t fight the Fed,” its corollary that investors must buy equities due to absurdly low bond yields, and that price-to-earnings ratios remain reasonable. The problem with this narrative is that easy monetary policy is not prophylactic against bear market declines and simple trailing and forward price-to-earnings multiples are not reliable indicators of subsequent equity market returns.
First, let’s address the argument that you “can’t fight the Fed.” Simply put, you could have followed that mantra down the rabbit’s hole in each of the last two bear markets. During 2001, the Fed cut the Fed Funds rate from 6.50% to 1.75%, where it remained until a 0.50% cut in November 2002. From January 2001 through September 2002 the S&P 500 declined 36.71%. Similarly, the central bank lowered its benchmark rate from 5.25% to just 2% from September 2007 through April 2008, at which point, what turned out to be one of the worst bear markets in history was still being called a correction. By December 2008 the Fed had cut the rate to 0-0.25%, where it remains today. For those keeping score, from the Fed’s first rate cut in September 2007 through the market lows in March 2009, the S&P 500 fell more than 50%. In short, “fighting the Fed” can be challenging, but failing to do so in the aftermath of one of their liquidity driven bubbles can be damaging to your financial health. While Fed largesse can induce complacency and provide fuel for a bubble, it’s of no consequence whatsoever once investors begin to re-price risk. 
Second, those suggesting market valuations are reasonable are either misinformed or disingenuous. We have often heard investment professional’s state that “valuations are not demanding,” yet such statements reference price relative to either trailing or forecasted earnings, neither of which correlate strongly with returns over the subsequent seven to 10-years. Lacking organic revenue growth, corporations have driven per share earnings higher through massive stock buyback programs (while the ratio of insiders buying to those selling is among the lowest in the last 15 years). Additionally, earnings have benefited from new all-time highs in profit margins despite weak revenue growth due to significant declines in labor and interest expense. Revenue will only be driven higher if consumer incomes begin to rise and that will likely be accompanied by rate normalization. Any further reduction in interest and labor expense would likely only occur if the economy returns to recession, further reducing revenue. In short, investors would be wise to remember that profit margins, among the most mean reverting statistics in finance, are likely to revert yet again. As such, today’s valuations are far more excessive that simple price/earnings ratios suggest. Meanwhile, valuation metrics such as Robert Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, i.e. CAPE, the ratio of company assets to their replacement cost, i.e. Tobin’s Q, or non-financial market capitalization-to-gross domestic product, are among their highest levels in history. Each is flashing serious warning signals and each correlates strongly with future returns.  
In light of the aforementioned, one would expect investment professionals to be cautioning clients about the risk of a bear market in US equities. Why then are the vast majority screaming “you can’t fight the Fed” and telling clients that valuations are reasonable? The answer likely resides in self-interest and career risk. As Keynes noted, “Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.” Additionally, there is the self-interest of the mutual fund industry, which collects enormous fees from the equity funds it manages. Simply put, their chief strategists are loathe to suggest significant reductions in client equity allocations and they likely wouldn’t have their jobs very long if they did. As a result, the investment industry’s response to each of the last two bear markets has essentially been “Who could have known? You can’t time the markets.” While not an advocate of market timing, the great Ben Graham noted that there are valuation levels as which investors “certainly should refrain from buying and probably would be wise to sell.” Today, if you aren’t concerned about valuations, you aren’t looking at the right metrics or simply don’t care to acknowledge them. Those that correlate strongly with long-term returns are at levels that in each and every instance have been followed by bear markets.
There are no valuation metrics that we know of that correlate well with returns over the subsequent 12-24 months. Yet market internals have deteriorated measurably this year. Nearly half of the stocks in the NASDAQ Composite are down 20% from their 52-week highs with the average stock in the index down 24%. Simply put, the benchmark’s solid year-to-date return is a function of the performance of a rather small number of its largest components. Similarly, about 40% of the stocks in the Russell 2000 are down at least 20%. Given the significant deterioration in market internals coupled with the excessive valuation exhibited by metrics that correlate well with long-term returns, prudent investors should aggressively reduce their exposure to US equity markets. Doing so will enable them to preserve capital and deploy additional money into equity markets when risk is far lower and potential returns much higher.

Advisor Behavior and Performance

Barclays Advisers' New Performance Metric: Their Behavior
Bank Could Dock Compensation in U.S. Wealth-Management Unit for Misconduct
By 
CORRIE DRIEBUSCH 
Updated Feb. 12, 2014 10:34 p.m. ET
The new pay model is part of Barclays's broad effort to clean its image. Associated Press
Barclays BARC.LN -2.90% PLC is shaking up the way it pays its U.S. financial advisers, breaking with industry practice as the British bank seeks to clean up its image.
Advisers at the Barclays Wealth & Investment Management division in the Americas will no longer get paid solely on how much money they bring in. Going forward, their compensation could be docked for misconduct.
While the size of any such cuts remains to be seen, the new policy already has spurred some of the firm's roughly 275 U.S.-based advisers to look for jobs elsewhere, according to recruiters, and could make it harder for the firm to find new brokers.
Tom Lee, who heads the adviser unit, defended the compensation model that went into effect Jan. 1, saying the firm "remains competitive as it rewards talent and continues to pay for performance." He called the changes "industry-leading and an important step toward aligning our remuneration practices with our clients and shareholders."
The change is a small part of a global reshaping of London-based Barclays's business and practices, with the aim of polishing a reputation tainted in recent years by scandals, including involvement in efforts to rig benchmark interest rates and improper sales of insurance and other financial products. It also follows regulatory and internal criticism of the U.S. wealth-management unit's culture for allegedly putting boosting profits ahead of following rules.
Barclays's adviser network is tiny in comparison with those at big U.S. banks such asMorgan Stanley, MS -1.69% which has more than 16,400 advisers, and recruiters say they don't expect other brokerages to follow suit.
But it is still causing something of a buzz in an industry in which advisers typically can—and routinely do—calculate their own pay almost to the penny, based on a percentage of the commissions and fees they generate. At the largest retail brokerages, that payout ranges from around 40% to 50%.
Barclays advisers will receive about half of their pay in the form of a monthly payment; the other half will be paid out every three months, according to people familiar with the new arrangement. While both payments will be based on a production formula similar to that at other firms, the quarterly payment also takes into account values-based criteria that include professional conduct and customer complaints. Poor performance in these areas could lead to a reduced payout.
Mr. Lee said the new pay model was "well received." But Andrew Parish, managing director at Axiom Consulting Group LLC, says he has fielded calls from at least 10 Barclays advisers in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, among other places, since they learned of the new arrangement late last year. So far, none has decided to move elsewhere, he said.
As part of his campaign to improve the Barclays image, Chief Executive Antony Jenkins announced last year that bonuses to employees will be based in part on how they uphold the bank's values. He said that employees unhappy with the changes could leave.
Barclays added about 200 U.S.-based financial advisers in its purchase of Lehman Brothers' North American operations in the 2008 financial crisis. Barclays's chief executive at the time, Robert Diamond, set out on an aggressive plan to build up the franchise but the unit has faced costs of increasing regulation and of paying a stable of well-connected wealth managers.
In 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it found cultural "deficiencies" at Barclays Wealth, as did a subsequent independent report which the bank acknowledged was suppressed by an executive. Leadership of the wealth-management division was later replaced. The bank has since presented plans to cut its physical presence across the globe and refocus on key clients.
Since the first quarterly variable payments to U.S. advisers won't be made until April, it is unclear exactly how much pay could be affected by the new criteria. Scott Smith, an analyst at research firm Cerulli Associates, believes the change could help Barclays and wouldn't cause many advisers to flee—if pay is docked only rarely.
Deep pay cuts for anything less than serious misconduct wouldn't make sense, Mr. Smith said. "I don't think anyone's going to be docked 20% of their pay because grandma had a complaint," he said.

Fees and Advisors at Large Investment Houses 

	on Tuesday, 21 January 2014. 
Posted in Blog 



The large investment firms, the ones that advertise and everyone knows well, as well as many others, pay their advisors a percentage of revenue they have generated from their clients.  In addition to, a fixed percentage of assets, revenues come from commissions, product fees, transaction fees, and revenue sharing agreements and these bias the large firm advisors to place their clients’ wealth in their proprietary investment funds, or in funds with clandestine revenue sharing arrangements.  Because they get paid out of revenue, their incentive is to use the high revenue generating products and they’re pressured by management to that end.  But, no individual firm has a monopoly on the best investment talent.  In fact the best investment talent leaves these firms, because they can’t stomach the politics.
 
These large firms love to hire ex-teachers and ex-military because teachers have a large network of children they’ve gotten to know, as well as, their parents.  Teachers are generally liked and trusted, so naturally clients will trust them with their wealth.  And of course, children grow up to become investors, too.  Ex-military are very diligent in going out and raising money. They take orders well and are unquestioning by prior career training.  That’s a super fit for the firms that want to push high profit margin funds. Can it be worse than this?  You bet.   These advisors that you’ll meet are good looking and tall and come from wealthy families. That’s right, good looking, tall, and a superior talent or access to collect clients, that’s the wire-house formula.  And it works.  None of this, however, gives them an edge on advising you and managing your money.  A few might be smart, but not by design.  By design, they want unquestioning advisors that believe they are best serving their clients, while unknowingly using inferior and high profit margin mutual fund products. 
 
But the greatest disadvantage of using these firms is they never go to cash in anticipation of a market crash.  They can’t, because it’s equivalent to dialing down their profits. It is calendar year earnings that are the most important focus of these large firms, not your long term investment performance.  Instead they tell their clients, “You can’t time the market.”  These firms don’t even share the same institutional research with their retail advisors that they share with their institutional clients. They have a whole other set of worthless research.  And that’s by design as well.  First, the retail advisor base will have difficulty understanding the institutional research, and second, you can’t have everyone getting out of the market at the same time.  These are big firms with trillions of dollars under management.  It’s more profitable for them to treat their more valuable untrusting clients better and use the less valuable trusting clients as a source of liquidity for when the valuable clients want to get out.

Investment and Insurance Advisors; Wirehouse vs. Independents and Third Party Custodians 

	on Wednesday, 22 January 2014. 
Posted in Blog 



It is best to hire an investment advisor and insurance professional separately.   Insurance by itself is extremely complicated.  You’ll end up with an investment advisor who has to spend a lot of time keeping up with the insurance industry regulations, pricing, performance, and new product bells and whistles. You want him focused on markets, risks, and investments.  And you don’t want him dealing with the second regulator, when the market is melting down.  Don’t settle on an advisor who does both.  It’s likely he/she will do both poorly.   If you find an advisor or insurance professional you like and are comfortable with, ask for a referral for the other.  They won’t want to take reputational risk by referring someone who’s not competent or has integrity issues.
Visit the FINRA’s (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) website to see if the advisor has complaints or been convicted of fraud etc.  These advisors can stay in business well beyond their usefulness to society by giving good lawyers lots of business.  
Be aware of the various compensation structures that advisors have.  These can be fee only, or commissions, or both.  That’s right, many advisors collect both.  Commissions are bad because of the incentive is not aligned with putting you in the best mutual funds.   And be careful, many firms say they are fee based only, but aren’t.  A recent study found that ~25% of a large sample of advisors who said in their marketing materials that they are fee based only, actually also collect commissions.  These advisors are liars.
Regarding fee based advisors, fees are a percentage of assets under management.  Merrill in 2014 will charge:  1.6% of the 1st $250,000, 1.3% for amounts over $250K up to $2,000,000 and 1% above that.  Morgan Stanley fees are similar. Independents charge significantly less than that, because they are not sharing the fee with their boss and their boss’s boss and with the firm.
There’s a large exodus of advisors from these large firm, many are going independent as technology and research has become widely available and affordable in the last few years.  Large firms account for 60% of private clients, down from 80%, ten years ago.
In short, go with a fee based firm that does not collect commissions, nor has revenue sharing agreements.  A truly fee based advisor can get you in a mutual fund with an upfront load without you having to pay that commission.  In this case, you don’t pay it and the advisor won’t collect it. That’s what fee based only, means.  By the way, you’ll pay that commission if you do it yourself online. 
Finally, make sure that the advisor has a third party custodian.  You don’t want to invest with future Bernie Madoffs. Every other week, I read about another advisor absconding with their clients’ lifetime savings.  If your money is housed at a third party custodian, you won’t be robbed. The custodian will send out monthly statements and year-end tax information directly to you.  The advisor should only be developing a customized asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and executing transactions to populate that strategy for you.  He should not be preparing your monthly statements and year-end tax information. He should also be knowledgeable about the investment environment and protect you portfolio from going over the cliff. Ideally, he’ll be moving you to cash before that.  That’s what the great investors do.

Large Investment Firms, Risk Management and Mainstream Media 

	on Tuesday, 21 January 2014.

But the greatest disadvantage of using these large investment firms is they never go to cash in anticipation of a market crash.  They can’t, because it’s equivalent to dialing down their profits. It is calendar year earnings that are the most important focus of these large firms, not your long term investment performance.  Instead they tell their clients, “You can’t time the market.”  These firms don’t even share the same institutional research with their retail advisors that they share with their institutional clients.

Ignore most of what’s on CNBC, Bloomberg and other media business programs.  On these shows, the “Chief Global Equity Strategist” from Merrill or Morgan is really a highly paid sales person, and he is there to market the firm and enhance the firms trading positions. There’s also more than one “Chief” at these firms—there’s too many venues and TV show for just one “Chief”.  Never take their free advice, it’s really not free. Understand they are given access to the program’s audience because they spend enormous amount of money on advertising.  This access to the millions who watch these programs enable them to drum up interest in specific securities that they want to unload at better prices. Also, the program format is remarkably similar to sports news, it is entertainment.  The format focuses too much attention on the recent past and the short term.  What’s hot and what’s not, rather than well thought out long term strategies based on fundamentals and valuation—that’s boring and alienates advertisers who want to drive the investment themes themselves. Also, ignore Jim Cramer.  A recent independent study of his advice has him wrong 54% of the time.

	 Good versus Bad Advice 



At a networking breakfast event on Thursday, I spoke briefly about the QE Taper and risk to investors.  The owner of a competing financial advisory spoke to group moments later, “investors should be in the market at all times,” he said. This is the worst financial advice I ever heard spoken.
On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finally climbed to a new all-time inflation adjusted record.  It took 14 years and the broader indices the S&P 500 and NASDAQ aren’t even close. So if you had your money in the stock markets before the crash in 2000 you’re likely still not back to breakeven.    
A bit of history first. The 2000 crash was easily anticipated, no earnings and enormous valuation. The crash of 2008 was less easily anticipated.  With mortgage fraud and Lehman Brother’s solvency/liquidity problems concealed, and no insight from policy makers, main stream media, and banking executives denying that a problem even exists, investors complacency can be understood.  Yet, when Lehman imploded a sensible response was to get out. And if you did you would have saved yourself from a further 50% fall, from 1250 to 666 (S&P 500.)
I see investing much like poker.  When the right hand comes along you can bet it all.   The risk with this, of course, is that if another player "calls" you and you lose – you’re busted.   In investing when you have the opportunistic set of conditions in your favor such as an extreme oversold market condition, panic and fear from investors, deep discounts in valuations, etc. these are times to invest more heavily into equities as the "risk" of loss is outweighed by the potential for reward because the "hand" you are holding is a strong one. 
The single biggest mistake that investors make today is they continue to be "all in" on every hand regardless of market conditions.  "Risk" is only a function of how much money you will lose "when", not "if", you are wrong. 
The advisor community too often abdicates the most important aspect of fiduciary duty, risk management.   If you are all-in at market tops you can lose everything on one hand.  If you are patient and adjust your risk appetite for the investment environment, you’ll do much better in the long run.
Here is my advice:  If you haven’t already, sell equities and let the cash sit un-invested. Cash provides ultimate optionality, all other investments assume price and liquidity risk.

Revenge of the mom and pop investors 

	on Friday, 24 October 2014. 
Posted in Blog 

	 by Joshua Brown,  published in Fortune 10/23/14 



“These days, your fellow investors have adopted a distinct preference for working with fiduciary advisors as opposed to the broker-dealers and wirehouses of the past. The Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) channel has absolutely exploded in size since the prior peak in household investing back in 2007. Large Wall Street brokerages have seen their market share of the investment business shrink below 50% for the first time in, well, ever. Increasingly, clients and assets are finding a home with advisors who are bound to a higher standard of care. RIA firms are paid solely by individual clients like you, and, as such, they do not have the myriad of conflicts inherent in the old brokerage model.”

management fee that is paid by the Trust to Clearwater  Management Company, Inc.
("CMC") to an annual rate of 0.45% of the Growth  Fund's net  assets.  From this
management  fee, CMC pays the Fund's  subadvisory fee to Parametric at an annual
rate of 0.15% of the Fund's net assets under Parametric's management, the Fund's
other  expenses,  and reimburses  itself for the expenses it incurs in providing
management  services to the Fund. The Fund has no direct  responsibility  to pay
the subadvisory fee to Parametric.

     the University of California.  She is a Chartered  Financial  Analyst and a

     The  discussion  of the Fund's  investment  objectives  and policies in the
Prospectus on p. 6 under the caption "Growth Fund" is supplemented as follows:  

     The Fund's fundamental investment objective is long-term capital growth. As
a secondary objective,  the Fund seeks current investment income. To achieve its
objective, the Fund will be passively managed to track the Russell 1000 Index(R)
(the  "Index").1 The Index is comprised of securities of the largest 1000 public
companies in the United States equity markets and is capitalization weighted.   

     The Fund attempts to track the investment results of the Index by investing
in all 1000 or a  statistical  sampling of the common  stocks that  comprise the
Index.  Unlike other equity funds that seek to outperform stock market averages,
the Fund seeks to track the Index to provide a return that  matches  that of the
benchmark.  However, because the Fund is also managed to reduce tax liability to
the  Fund's  shareholders  and bears  certain  expenses  not  factored  into the
performance of the Index,  the Fund will not track the  performance of the Index
perfectly.  To the  extent the Fund  tracks the Index,  the Fund will not pursue
opportunities  for total return by investing in companies  that are not included
in the Index.                                                                   

     Parametric  believes  that  this  passive  portfolio  management  strategy,
combined with tax management  techniques,  will provide the best opportunity for
the optimal level of after tax total return for the Fund's shareholders. Passive
portfolio management will limit the Fund's portfolio turnover rate to the lowest
possible  level.  Low turnover  improves the  opportunity  for higher  after-tax
performance because realization of capital gains can be deferred.               

     Under normal  circumstances,  the Fund will invest substantially all of its
assets in the common stocks of companies  represented in the Index. The Fund may
invest in certain short-term  fixed-income  securities such as cash equivalents,
although cash and cash equivalents are normally  expected to represent less than
1% of the Fund's total assets. The Fund intends to remain fully invested, to the
extent practicable,  in a pool of securities which will duplicate the investment
characteristics of the Index.                                                   

     The Fund may also invest in stock and stock  index  futures  contracts  and
options in order to invest  uncommitted cash balances,  to maintain liquidity to
meet  shareholder  redemptions,  or to minimize trading costs. The Fund's use of
futures and options will be limited by the Fund's avoidance of tax liability and
its low turnover rate.                                                          

The Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued basis and may       

--------

purchase or sell securities on a delayed  delivery  basis.  These terms refer to
securities  that have been created and for which a market exists,  but which are
not available for immediate delivery. There may be a risk of loss to the Fund if
the value of the security  declines prior to the  settlement  date. The Fund may
make short sales of  securities or maintain a short  position,  provided that at
all times when a short  position  is open the Fund owns an equal  amount of such
securities or securities  convertible into or  exchangeable,  without payment of
any further  consideration,  for an equal amount of the  securities  of the same
issuer as the securities sold short (a short sale against-the-box).             

     To reduce the potential for realization of capital gain from disposition of
portfolio securities, Parametric intends to gradually align the Fund's portfolio
with the Index over a period of several  years.  Until the Fund's  portfolio  is
aligned  with  the  Index,   the  Fund  may  continue  to  hold  common  stocks,
fixed-income  securities and foreign securities in amounts that do not match the
weightings in the Index. See "Investment Policies and Investments Common to Both
Funds--Equity  Securities;  Fixed Income Securities;  Foreign  Securities;  U.S.
Government Securities; and Temporary Defensive Investments" in the Prospectus.

 CLEARWATER INVESTMENT TRUST

Clearwater Growth Fund

Supplement to Statement of Additional Information dated April 30, 1997

     The Board of  Trustees  of  Clearwater  Investment  Trust (the  "Trust") on
behalf of  Clearwater  Growth Fund (the "Fund") has  terminated  SIT  Investment
Associates,  Inc. ("SIT") as the Fund's  subadviser.  The Board on behalf of the
Fund  appointed  Parametric  Portfolio  Associates,   Inc.   ("Parametric"),   a
registered investment adviser, as the Fund's new subadviser.  As of the close of
business on October 31, 1997, portfolio management services for the Fund will be
provided by Parametric  and will no longer be provided by SIT. As of November 1,
1997,  all  references  to SIT in the Statement of  Additional  Information  are
deleted, except references to the subadvisory fees paid to SIT for periods prior
to November 1, 1997.                                                            

     The  discussion  of Covered  Call  Options  under the caption  "Objectives,
Investment  Policies and  Restrictions"  on page B-2 is supplemented  for Growth
Fund as follows:                                                                

     Options on Securities  and  Securities  Indices.  The Fund may write (sell)
covered call and put options and purchase call and put options on any securities
in which it may invest or on any  securities  index  composed of  securities  in
which it may invest. The writing and purchase of options is a highly specialized
activity which  involves  investment  techniques and risks  different from those
associated with ordinary portfolio securities  transactions.  The use of options
to seek to increase total return  involves the risk of loss if the Subadviser is
incorrect in its expectation of  fluctuations  in securities  prices or interest
rates.  The successful use of options for hedging  purposes also depends in part
on the ability of the  Subadviser  to manage future price  fluctuations  and the
degree of  correlation  between  the  options  and  securities  markets.  If the
Subadviser is incorrect in its  expectation  of changes in securities  prices or
determination of the correlation between the securities indices on which options
are written and purchased and the securities in a Fund's  investment  portfolio,
the investment performance of the Fund will be less favorable than it would have
been in the absence of such options transactions. The writing of options will be
limited by the Fund's policy to have a very low portfolio turnover rate.        

     Futures  Contracts  and Options on Futures  Contracts.  To seek to increase
total return or to hedge against changes in interest rates, securities prices or
currency exchange rates, the Fund may purchase and sell various kinds of futures
contracts,  and  purchase  and write call and put options on any of such futures
contracts.  The Fund may also enter into closing purchase and sale  transactions
with respect to any such  contracts  and options.  The futures  contracts may be
based on various  securities  and  securities  indices.  The Fund will engage in
futures and  related  options  transactions  for bona fide  hedging  purposes as
defined in regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or to seek to
increase total return to the extent permitted by such regulations.  The Fund may
not  purchase or sell futures  contracts or purchase or sell related  options to
seek to increase total return, except for closing purchase or sale transactions,

-1- 

P-->497Last�Page�of�5TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�5th
if immediately  thereafter the sum of the amount of initial margin  deposits and
premiums paid on the Fund's outstanding positions in futures and related options
entered into for the purpose of seeking to increase total return would exceed 5%
of the  market  value of the  Fund's  net  assets.  These  transactions  involve
brokerage  costs,  require  margin  deposits  and, in the case of contracts  and
options  obligating the Fund to purchase  securities or currencies,  require the
Fund to segregate  and maintain  cash or liquid assets with a value equal to the
amount of the Fund's obligations.                                               

     While  transactions in futures  contracts and options on futures may reduce
certain risks,  such transactions  themselves entail certain risks.  Thus, while
the  Fund  may  benefit  from  the  use  of  futures  and  options  on  futures,
unanticipated  changes  in  securities  prices  may  result  in  poorer  overall
performance  than if the Fund had not  entered  into any  futures  contracts  or
options transactions. Because perfect correlation between a futures position and
portfolio  position  that is intended to be protected is  impossible to achieve,
the desired  protection  may not be obtained and the Fund may be exposed to risk
of loss. The loss incurred by the Fund in entering into futures contracts and in
writing  call  options on futures is  potentially  unlimited  and may exceed the
amount of the premium received.  Futures markets are highly volatile and the use
of futures  may  increase  the  volatility  of the Fund's net asset  value.  The
profitability  of a Fund's  trading in futures to seek to increase  total return
depends  upon the ability of the  Subadviser  to  correctly  analyze the futures
markets.  In addition,  because of the low margin deposits  normally required in
futures  trading,  a relatively  small price movement in a futures  contract may
result in substantial losses to the Fund. Further, futures contracts and options
on futures may be illiquid,  and  exchanges  may limit  fluctuations  in futures
contract prices during a single day.                                            

     The  following  disclosure  is added to the  information  under the caption
"Objectives, Investment Policies and Restrictions":                             

     Short  Sales  Against  the Box.  The Growth  Fund may engage in short sales
against the box. In a short sale  against the box,  the Fund agrees to sell at a
future date a security that it either contemporaneously owns or has the right to
acquire at no extra cost.  If the price of the  security has declined a the time
the Fund is required to deliver the  security,  the Fund will  benefit  from the
difference in the price.  If the price of the security has  increased,  the Fund
will be required to pay the difference.                                         

October 12, 1997

5 Reasons ITLL May Be the Most Profitable Stock Play of 2017

















In 2017, cell phones are as vital to us as the air we breathe. Between both old and young, from personal users to businesses and now even hospitals, mobile phones have become an essential part of the modern eco system. Without one, people have difficulty finding employment and leave themselves negatively exposed to emergencies. The vast majority of American adults - 95% - now own a cell phone. This has resulted in the massive growth of businesses supplying and supplementing this market. Of which ITLL is now becoming a key player. 


The OTCQB is an elite tier of the over the counter markets. These are companies that have audited financials available, are current in their reporting, have verified management and shareholders and additional disclosure requirements to meet. All in all, this signifies that ITLL is on the ball and doing business the right way. Morningstar rates OTC:ITLL at an excellent 3 stars, meaning it is of fair value. The rating is determined by three factors: a stock's current price, Morningstar's estimate of the stock's fair value, and the uncertainty rating of the fair value. The bigger the discount, the higher the star rating. Once again, an excellent omen for savvy investors!Breaking News: ITLL Successfully Closes Acquisition with Completion of Definitive Agreements


With such immense growth in the industry and corporate giants dominating the arena, we frequently see small companies either grow exponentially or get bought out before they become a threat. This is where OTC: ITLL comes into play. Their goal is to deliver market disruptive products and pricing to the millions of consumers who are looking for better deals in the mobile phone and application space. Since ITLL is a public company, we believe this is an excellent opportunity for savvy investors to capitalize on the booming industry. We’ve done some digging and have laid out 6 reasons why we believe ITLL may be the most profitable stock play of 2017. Breaking News: ITLL Successfully Closes Acquisition with Completion of Definitive Agreements.
















Massive telecom acquisitions are happening all the time. They're so common in fact, we barely notice the billions of dollars that are flying between these massive corporations, month after month. For example, in 2017 alone, we've already seen several major acquisitions. Telecom service provider GTT Communications announced in June that it plans to buy network connectivity provider Global Capacity for $100 million in cash and 1.85 million shares of GTT common stock. We also saw that in April, Windstream announced its plan to acquire cloud-based unified communications provider Broadview Networks in an all-cash transaction worth $228 million. And if that isn't enough, in March, Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. closed its $1.42 billion acquisition of Electric Lightwave, the company formerly known as Integra Telecom. All of this happened in just the last few months!All this makes you wonder why this is happening and whether ITLL has what it takes to dance with the big guys. Well, it is our belief that the telecom giants scoop up the smaller, competitive companies because they are a danger to their business model. Big companies like Verizon are making money hand over fist - why stop when you can just scoop up the competition and keep business going as usual?ITLL has made it clear that their goal is to be affordable and disruptive. A similar situation took place in Canada some years ago, when a company named Wind Mobile came into play. Over a few short years Wind grew a massive user base simply because their plans were significantly cheaper than the competition. Recently, Shaw bought them out for $1.6 billion. As a result of all this, our opinion of the ITLL business model is excellent.

As always, we encourage you to do your due diligence thoroughly before making a buying decision. 

Good trading! 

Sincerely, 

The American Tech Report Team


This is a statement that often attracts negativity from skeptics and self-pronounced market professionals. And frankly, it's understandable; it seems too good to be true. We always encourage our readers to do their own due-diligence and this is one of those scenarios. Dig through message boards, scanners and blogs and you'll quickly realize that stocks are making major moves like this on a regular basis. This isn't some mythical unicorn - once again, stocks do this on a regular basis. Below, you can see some examples of movements like this, but believe us when we say there are many, many more. 






3. One trade can make profits of 2,000% or more. 













At the time of writing this article, ITLL is sitting at 80 cents. We believe that this is an extremely attractive price for a company of this caliber. As was observed above, acquisitions in this industry often come in at hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. In addition to this, 80 cents is an excellent place for traders and investors to turn quicker profits. It is much easier for a stock to double or triple at these prices, in a very short period of time. "It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price” - Warren Buffet







2. The stock is priced right. Better than right.

OWCP - 63,900%


When going up against telecom giants, a company has to hold a competitive edge to stand out. Through our due diligence, we have found this to be undoubtedly true for ITLL. The cornerstone to every customer seeking a cell provider is the smartphones that they have available. Smartphones are expensive for your average consumer, as many flagship phones sit around the $1000 mark. ITLL has seemed to solve this problem by partnering up with the smartphone manufacturer, Leagoo. These phones have everything that the typical consumer wants at a fraction of the cost. They are well built, stylish, powerful and power through daily functions like taking photographs and browsing the web on par with phones that are five times the price. All of this seems consistent with ITLL's commitment to lower prices and maintain their competitive edge. In addition to this, they are offering all subscribers a premium mastercard, no questions asked! We believe that many consumers will find this to be an irresistible offer, making the growth potential for ITLL very attractive.

American Tech Report is owned and operated by Public Ventures Of America Corp, which is a Belize based corporation. We are paid advertisers, also known as stock touts or stock promoters, who disseminate favorable information (the “Information”) about publicly traded companies (the “Profiled Issuers”).
We publish the Information on our website, americantechreport.com and in newsletters, text message alerts, audio services, live interviews, featured “research” reports, on message boards and in email communications for specific time periods that are agreed upon between us and the Profiled Issuer and / or third party paying us. Our publication of the Information is known as a “Campaign”. This information may be sent to potential investors at different times that are minutes, hours, days or even weeks apart. Typically, the trading volume and price of a Profiled Issuer’s securities increases after the information is provided to the first group of investors. Therefore, the later an investor receives the Information, the more likely it is that he will suffer trading losses if they purchase the securities of a Profiled Issuer late in a Campaign. We are paid to advertise the Profiled Issuers, Intelligent Cloud Resources, Inc. American Tech Report has been hired by a third party, Golden Island Investments Ltd., for a period beginning on July 24th 2017 and is scheduled to end on August 18th 2017 to publicly disseminate information about (ITLL) via website and email. We expect to be paid three hundred thousand dollars via a series of bank wire transfers over this period. We will update any changes to our compensation. We own zero shares of (ITLL).

Third Parties paying us to market the Profiled Issuer we believe intend to sell their shares they hold while we tell investors to purchase during the Campaign. Intelligent Cloud Resources Inc. is a penny stock that was illiquid (little to no trading volume) prior to our Campaign, and therefore these securities are subject to wide fluctuations in trading price and volume. During the Campaign the trading volume and price of the securities of each Profile Issuer will likely increase significantly because of the media exposure. When the Campaign ends, the volume and price of the Profiled Issuer will likely decrease dramatically. As a result, investors who purchase during the Campaign and hold shares of the Profiled Issuer when the Campaign ends will probably lose most, if not all, of their investment.

The Information we publish in the Campaign is only a snapshot that provides only positive information about the Profiled Issuers. The Information consists of only positive content. We do not and will not publish any negative information about the Profiled Issuers; accordingly, investors should consider the Information to be one-sided and not balanced, complete, accurate, truthful and / or reliable. We do not verify or confirm any portion of the Information. We do not conduct any due diligence, nor do we research any aspect of the Information including the completeness, accuracy, truthfulness and / or reliability of the Information. We do not review the Profiled Issuers’ financial condition, operations, business model, management or risks involved in the Profiled Issuer’s business or an investment in a Profiled Issuer’s securities.

All information in our Campaign is publicly available information from 3rd party sources and / or the Profiled Issuers and/or the 3rd parties that hire us. We may also obtain the Information from publicly available sources such as the OTC Markets, Google, NASDAQ, NYSE, Yahoo, Bing, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Edgar database or other available public sources.

We select the stocks we profile and / or pick as we are compensated to advertise them. If an investor relies solely on the Information in making an investment decision it is highly probable that the investor will lose most, if not all, of his or her investment. Investors should not rely on the Information to make an investment decision.

The source of our compensation varies depending upon the particular circumstances of the Campaign. In certain cases, we are compensated by the Profiled Issuers, third party shareholders, and / or other parties related to the Profiled Issuers such as officers and/or directors who will derive a financial or other benefit from an increase in the trading price and/or volume of a Profiled Issuer’s securities.
We make no warranty and / or representation about the Information, including its completeness, accuracy, truthfulness or reliability and we disclaim, expressly and implicitly, all warranties of any kind, including whether the Information is complete, accurate, truthful, or reliable and as such, your use of the Information is at your own risk. The Information is provided as is without limitation.

We are not, and do not act in the capacity of any of the following; as such, you should not construe our activities as involving any of the following: an independent adviser or consultant; a fortune teller; an investment adviser or an entity engaging in activities that would be deemed to be providing investment advice that requires registration either at the federal and / or state level; a broker-dealer or an individual acting in the capacity of a registered representative or broker; a stock picker; a securities trading expert; a securities researcher or analyst; a financial planner or one who engages in financial planning; a provider of stock recommendations; a provider of advice about buy, sell or hold recommendations as to specific securities; or an agent offering or securities for sale or soliciting their purchase.


There are numerous risks associated with each Profiled Issuer and investors should undertake a full review of each Profiled Issuer with the assistance of their financial, legal, and tax advisers prior to purchasing the securities of any Profiled Issuer.
We are not objective or independent and have multiple conflicts of interest. The Profiled Issuers and parties hiring us have conflicts of interest. Third parties that have hired us and own shares will sell these shares while we tell investors to purchase, and this selling of the Profiled Issuer’s securities will likely cause investors to suffer losses.

Our publication of the Information involves actual and material conflicts of interest including but not limited to the fact that we receive monetary compensation in exchange for publishing the (favorable) Information about the Profiled Issuers; and we do not publish any negative information, whatsoever, about the Profiled Issuers; in addition to the fact that while we do not own the Profiled Issuer’s securities, the third parties that hired us do, and intend to sell all of these securities during the Campaign while we publish favorable information that instructs investors to purchase, and this selling of the Profiled Issuer’s securities will likely cause investors to suffer losses.

We are not responsible or liable for any person’s use of the Information or any success or failure that is directly or indirectly related to such person’s use of the Information because we have specifically stated that the information is not reliable and should not be relied upon for any purpose. We are not responsible for omissions and / or errors in the Information and we are not responsible for actions taken by any person who relies upon the Information.
We urge Investors to conduct their own in-depth investigation of the Profiled Issuers with the assistance of their legal, tax and / or investment adviser(s). An investor’s review of the Information should include but not be limited to the Profiled Issuer’s financial condition, operations, management, products and / or services, trends in the industry and risks that may be material to the profiled Issuer’s business and other information he and his advisers deem material to an investment decision. An investor’s review should include, but not be limited to a review of available public sources and information received directly from the Profiled Issuers or from websites such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, OTC Markets, NASDAQ, NYSE, www.sec.gov or other available public sources.

We are providing you with this disclaimer because we are publishing advertisements about penny stocks. Because we are paid to disseminate the Information to the public about securities, we are required by the securities laws including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), to specifically disclose my compensation as well as other important information, This information includes that we may hold, as well as purchase and sell, the securities of a Profiled Issuer before, during and after we publish favorable Information about the Profiled Issuer. We may urge investors to purchase the securities of a Profiled Issuer while we sell my own shares. The anti-fraud provisions of federal and state securities laws require us to inform you that we may engage in buying and selling of Profiled Issuer’s securities before, during and after the Campaigns.

Any investment in the Profiled Issuers involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. The securities may be subject to extreme volume and price volatility, especially during the Campaigns. Favorable past performance of a Profiled Issuer does not guarantee future results. If you purchase the securities of the Profiled Issuers, you should be prepared to lose your entire investment. Some of the risks involved in purchasing securities of the Profiled Issuers include, but are not limited to the risks stated below.

We do not endorse, independently verify or assert the truthfulness, completeness, accuracy or reliability of the Information. We conduct no due diligence or investigation whatsoever of the Information or the Profiled Issuers and we do not receive any verification from the Profiled Issuer regarding the Information we disseminate.

If we publish any percentage gain of a Profiled Issuer from the previous day close in the Information, it is not and should not be construed as an indication that the future stock price or future operational results will reflect gains or otherwise prove to be advantageous to your investment.
The Information may contain statements asserting that a Profiled Issuer’s stock price has increased over a certain period of time which may reflect an arbitrary period of time, and is not predictive or of any analytical quality; as such, you should not rely upon the (favorable) Information in your analysis of the present or future potential of a Profiled Issuer or its securities.
The Information should not be interpreted in any way, shape, form or manner whatsoever as an indication of the Profiled Issuer’s future stock price or future financial performance.

You may encounter difficulties determining what, if any, portions of the Information are material or non-material, making it all the more imperative that you conduct your own independent investigation of the Profiled Issuer and its securities with the assistance of your legal, tax and financial advisor.
When 3rd parties that hire us acquire, purchase and / or sell the securities of the Profiled Issuers, it may (a) cause significant volatility in the Profiled Issuer’s securities; (b) cause temporary but unrealistic increases in volume and price of the Profiled Issuer’s securities; (c) if selling, cause the Profiled Issuer’s stock price to decline dramatically; and (d) permit themselves to make substantial profits while investors who purchase during the Campaign experience significant losses.

The securities of the Profiled Issuers are high risk, unstable, unpredictable and illiquid which may make it difficult for investors to sell their securities of the Profiled Issuers.

We may hire third party service providers and stock promoters to electronically disseminate live news regarding the Profiled Issuers, yet we have no control over the content of and do not verify the information that the Profiled Issuers and/or third party service providers publish. These third party service providers are likely compensated for providing positive information about the Issuer and may fail to disclose their compensation to you.
If a Profiled Issuer is a SEC reporting company, it could be delinquent (not current) in its periodic reporting obligations (i.e., in its quarterly and annual reports), or if it is an OTC Markets Pink Sheet quoted company, it may be delinquent in its Pink Sheet reporting obligations, which may result in OTC Markets posting a negative legend pertaining to the Profiled Issuer at www.otcmarkets.com, as follows: (i) “Limited Information” for companies with financial reporting problems, economic distress, or that are unwilling to file required reports with the Pink Sheets; (ii) “No Information,” which characterizes companies that are unable or unwilling to provide any disclosure to the public markets, to the SEC or the Pink Sheets; and (iii) “Caveat Emptor,” signifying buyers should be aware that there is a public interest concern associated with a company’s illegal spam campaign, questionable stock promotion, known investigation of a company’s fraudulent activity or its insiders, regulatory suspensions or disruptive corporate actions.

If the Information states that a Profiled Issuer’s securities are consistent with the future economic trends or even if your independent research indicates that, you should be aware that economic trends have their own limitations, including: (a) that economic trends or predictions may be speculative; (b) consumers, producers, investors, borrowers, lenders and/or government may react in unforeseen ways and be affected by behavioral biases that we are unable to predict; (c) human and social factors may outweigh future economic trends that we state may or will occur; (d) clear cut economic predictions have their limitations in that they do not account for the fundamental uncertainty in economic life, as well as ordinary life; (e) economic trends may be disrupted by sudden jumps, disruptions or other factors that are not accounted for in economic trends analysis; in other words, past or present data predicting future economic trends may become irrelevant in light of new circumstances and situations in which uncertainty becomes reality rather than predicted economic outcome; or (f) if the trend predicted involves a single result, it ignores other scenarios that may be crucial to make a decision in the event of unknown contingencies.
The Information is presented only as a brief snapshot of the Profiled Issuer and should only be used, at most, and if at all, as a starting point for you to conduct a thorough investigation of the Profiled Issuer and its securities. You should consult your financial, legal or other adviser(s) and avail yourself of the filings and information that may be accessed at www.sec.gov, www.otcmarkets.com or other electronic media, including: (a) reviewing SEC periodic reports (Forms 10-Q and 10-K), reports of material events (Form 8-K), insider reports (Forms 3, 4, 5 and Schedule 13D); (b) reviewing Information and Disclosure Statements and unaudited financial reports filed with the OTCMarkets.com; (c) obtaining and reviewing publicly available information contained in commonly known search engines such as Google; and (d) consulting investment guides at www.sec.gov and www.finra.org. You should always be cognizant that the Profiled Issuers may not be current in their reporting obligations with the SEC and the OTC Markets and/or have negative legends and designations at otcmarkets.com.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
