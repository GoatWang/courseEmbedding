He leads innovation engagements with large and small organizations to help leadership enable transformational change that gets innovation into the DNA of the culture and thereby drive greater growth and success on a sustainable basis. Dr. Wasden has a doctorate in human and organizational learning from George Washington University in Washington, DC, an MBA from the UCLA Anderson School, and a bachelor's degree in accounting and Asian studies from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.

Is your practice ready for Medicare CCM reimbursement?        

  Let us guide you





 

 



Chronic Care Management 

 



The 2015 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) will pay for non face-to-face services for Chronic Care Management, reimbursing practices on average $42 per patient, per month. In response to Medicare’s Chronic Care Management (CCM) initiative, MD Revolution has developed a systematic approach designed specifically to mitigate the challenges a practice will face to take advantage of the new billing code. Our digital product, RevUp, is a scalable platform designed for Chronic Care Management and provides a high touch human interaction model at a very low delivery cost.
  

 


Increase Profit without Compromising Care
New Annual Revenue Stream



Measure the things that matter most
It's all about outcomes



We make implementing a CCM solution easy
Simplify your workflow















Why Choose RevUp
 Convert 1000 patients into $504,000 annually
Providers are constantly seeking evidence-based processes to improve the outcomes of high-need, high-cost Medicare populations. Strategies to enhance population management are critical for patients with multiple chronic conditions. As a result, effective, integrated approaches are necessary to receive compensation that ultimately will offset the rising cost of health care.
The financial incentive of Medicare's CCM initiative is designed to pay physicians who are currently practicing Chronic Care Management. However, meeting the Chronic Care Management billing regulations on your own can require a substantial investment in technology and a commitment to additional administrative staff.
Care management is not a new concept to health care. Medicare is taking it one step further by offering physicians the opportunity to bill for services they are currently managing. Implementing a sustainable solution is key to maximizing this new revenue stream.
MD Revolution's Chronic Care Management solution, RevUp, combines technology, clinical services and analytics that yield more patient interaction between office visits, with low impact on current personnel. RevUp maximizes patient enrollment, increases patient compliance, documents CCM requirements and minimizes additional workload.
It's simple; our end-to-end solution directly correlates to higher profits for your practice. The potential for recurring revenue with a minimum of 1000 eligible patients can be significant. Calculate how much you can add to your bottom line.
 

 
Transforming Healthcare through Digital Platform Engagement - it's all about the data.
Providers and patients working together to improve health is a new trend in health care. As part of the CCM requirement, Medicare included the patient's consent to encourage "program buy-in" and shared decision-making around care. Patients, who are compliant, tend to be healthier and achieve better outcomes. Introducing technology in the equation will provide meaningful data to begin analyzing the care provided to patents with multiple chronic diseases. These analytics will uncover what works in reducing high-cost outcomes such as hospital readmissions and emergency visits. The foundation of RevUp's technology infrastructure was intentionally built to capture and aggregate a multitude of health metrics.
RevUp's evidence based platform has been designed to cultivate self-monitoring on their current health status. The communication between a RevUp Health Coach and a patient, functions as an extension of the physician's practice. In addition, on going interactions through personalized messaging motivates and supports patient's to reach predetermined health goals set by them and their physician.
As a result, engaged patients are more likely to participate in healthy activities, adopt healthy behaviors and follow their care plan. The end result is higher quality of engagement, increased compliance, better outcomes and ultimately lower costs. We believe the proof is in the data.
 

 
Incorporating CCM with Minimal Disruption to Workflow
Compliance with Medicare's Chronic Care Management requirements is essential to ensure monthly payments. Automating the process allows a practice to focus resources on the patient, instead of the process. In order to minimize the impact on office workflow, incorporating a digital solution is necessary to consistently meet Medicare's billing requirements and maximize enrollment.
Our comprehensive Chronic Care Management solution combines human and digital assets that deliver effective and meaningful population management. Designed specifically to enhance patient interaction in between office visits, RevUp seamlessly interfaces with a practice's work environment and EHR system. Incorporating RevUp is easy. See how we can simplify your workflow and RevUp Care Management.

 About MD Revolution
MD Revolution uniquely combines technology, services, and analytics to produce scalable, high touch care models that enrich the patient-provider experience and reduce the cost of care.
 
Our digital care management platform, RevUp, delivers real, measurable improvements in health and lowers healthcare costs. We empower people with personalized, actionable data and coaching to help them make sustainable lifestyle changes that matter.
We provide custom solutions across all health and care management populations including; Chronic Care Management, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and Employer programs.
 
How it all started
Founded by Dr. Samir Damani, a practicing cardiologist, MD Revolution was born out of Dr. Damani’s drive to transform the delivery of healthcare and chronic disease management. 
As a healthcare provider, Dr. Damani had a unique perspective on the impact of chronic disease. Every day, he saw firsthand what happens when diet and exercise are neglected. His patients were often at a stage when disease is the riskiest and most expensive to fix. He knew they needed more support than he could provide in an office visit. The system was failing them both.
Healthcare costs continued to skyrocket, the incidence of preventable conditions soared, and the paradigm of “disease care” medicine showed no signs of changing. Frustrated, Dr. Damani began assembling a mix of investors, healthcare professionals, and technology experts who would together help launch an entirely new approach to care management. 




 
When the vision came to life

In 2011, MD Revolution Inc. opened its doors on the Scripps Memorial La Jolla campus in California. The overarching goal was – and still is – to get people excited about and engaged in their health.
As the team rapidly developed the models and solutions for population health and care management, Dr. Damani realized that the company had an obligation to bring MD Revolution’s unique combination of traditional medicine, nutrition and fitness science, and digital care management technology to the masses.

I believed then, and still believe today, that our approach will become the gold standard for the future of healthcare. After all, the only way we can reverse the chronic disease epidemic is to make the personalized health experience accessible to everyone. 


                    Samir Damani, MD, PharmD, FACC

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

MD Revolution Partners with Reliance Medical Group to Improve Patient Care
Oct 19 15
MD Revolution is partnering with Reliance Medical Group to improve patient engagement, enhance the patient-provider relationship, speed clinical decision-making, and increase revenue. With the Medicare compliant RevUp For CCM (RevUp) Solution, physician practices can outsource CCM and population health to MD Revolution with minimal disruption to practice operations. RevUp integrates with the practice’s electronic health record (EHR) to create the patient care plan and make it available anytime, anywhere securely. Using this care plan, MD Revolution’s clinicians act as a trusted extension of the physician to help patients meet their health improvement goals through earlier detection of health issues, medication compliance and nutrition and fitness advice. RevUp includes a smart phone application and Internet portal with support for multiple modalities including patient monitoring devices, fitness trackers, paper, and telephone to engage patients and securely gather patient-provided data. This data is integrated with the EHR to provide a comprehensive view of the patient’s health in between office visits.

DOSAGE: The recommended minimum dose is 2.7 mg selamectin per pound (6 mg/kg) of body weight.  Administer the entire contents of a single dose tube (or two tubes used in combination for dogs weighing over 130 pounds) of Revolution topically in accordance with the following tables. (see ADMINISTRATION for the recommended treatment intervals).    Cats (lbs) Package              color mg per tube Potency              (mg/mL) Administered              volume (mL)   Up to 5 Mauve 15 mg 60 0.25   5.1-15 Blue 45 mg 60 0.75    For cats over 15 lbs use the appropriate combination of tubes.    Dogs (lbs) Package              color mg per tube Potency              (mg/mL) Administered              volume (mL)   Up to 5 Mauve 15 mg 60 0.25   5.1-10 Purple 30 mg 120 0.25   10.1-20 Brown 60 mg 120 0.5   20.1-40 Red 120 mg 120 1.0   40.1-85 Teal 240 mg 120 2.0   85.1-130 Plum 120 mg + 240 mg* 120 3.0    *Two tubes used in combination. For dogs over 130 lbs use the appropriate combination of tubes. Recommended for use in dogs 6 weeks of age and older and in cats 8 weeks of age and older. ADMINISTRATION:  A veterinarian or veterinary technician should demonstrate or instruct the pet owner regarding the appropriate technique for applying Revolution topically to dogs and cats prior to first use. Firmly press the cap down to puncture the seal on the Revolution tube; a clicking sound will confirm that the cap has successfully punctured the seal. Remove the cap and check to ensure that the tip of the tube is open. To administer the product, part the hair on the back of the animal at the base of the neck in front of the shoulder blades until the skin is visible. Place the tip of the tube on the skin and squeeze the tube 3 or 4 times to empty its entire contents directly onto the skin in one spot. Keeping the tube squeezed, drag it away from the liquid and lift to remove. Check the tube to ensure that it is empty. Do not massage the product into the skin. Due to alcohol content, do not apply to broken skin. Avoid contact between the product and fingers. Do not apply when the haircoat is wet. Bathing or shampooing the animal 2 or more hours after treatment will not reduce the effectiveness of Revolution. Stiff hair, clumping of hair, hair discoloration, or a slight powdery residue may be observed at the treatment site in some animals. These effects are temporary and do not affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. Discard empty tubes in your ordinary household refuse. Flea Control in Dogs and Cats For the prevention and control of flea infestations, Revolution should be administered at monthly intervals throughout the flea season, starting one month before fleas become active. In controlled laboratory studies >98% of fleas were killed within 36 hours. Results of clinical field studies using Revolution monthly demonstrated >90% control of flea infestations within 30 days of the first dose. Dogs and cats treated with Revolution, including those with pre-existing flea allergy dermatitis, showed improvement in clinical signs associated with fleas as a direct result of eliminating the fleas from the animals and their environment.  If the dog or cat is already infested with fleas when the first dose of Revolution is administered, adult fleas on the animal are killed and no viable fleas hatch from eggs after the first administration. However, an environmental infestation of fleas may persist for a short time after beginning treatment with Revolution because of the emergence of adult fleas from pupae.  Heartworm Prevention in Dogs and Cats For the prevention of heartworm disease, Revolution must be administered on a monthly basis. Revolution may be administered year-round or at least within one month after the animal's first exposure to mosquitoes and monthly thereafter until the end of the mosquito season. The final dose must be given within one month after the last exposure to mosquitoes. If a dose is missed and a monthly interval between dosing is exceeded then immediate administration of Revolution and resumption of monthly dosing will minimize the opportunity for the development of adult heartworms. When replacing another heartworm preventive product in a heartworm disease prevention program, the first dose of Revolution must be given within a month of the last dose of the former medication.  Selamectin, the active ingredient in Revolution, is a macrocyclic lactone compound. These compounds effectively prevent the development of adult heartworms when administered to dogs and cats within one month of exposure to infective (L3) Dirofilaria immitis larvae. Efficacy of macrocyclic lactones decreases below 100% in dogs, however, if first administered >2 months after exposure to infective larvae. Thus, in heartworm endemic regions, delaying initiation of heartworm prevention using Revolution beyond 2 months of first exposure to infective larvae (e.g., starting puppies and kittens at >8 weeks of age), or gaps of >2 months in the administration of Revolution during periods of heartworm transmission, increases the risk of the animal acquiring heartworms. Animals with unknown heartworm history that test negative for heartworms prior to the initiation of Revolution may be harboring pre-patent infections at the time Revolution was started. Testing such animals 3-4 months after initiation of Revolution would be necessary to confirm their negative heartworm status.  At the discretion of the veterinarian, cats =6 months of age may be tested to determine the presence of existing heartworm infections before beginning treatment with Revolution. Cats already infected with adult heartworms can be given Revolution monthly to prevent further infections.  Ear Mite Treatment in Dogs and Cats For the treatment of ear mite (O. cynotis) infestations in dogs and cats, Revolution should be administered once as a single topical dose. A second monthly dose may be required in some dogs. Monthly use of Revolution will control any subsequent ear mite infestations. In the clinical field trials ears were not cleaned, and many animals still had debris in their ears after the second dose. Cleansing of the infested ears is recommended to remove the debris.  Sarcoptic Mange Treatment in Dogs For the treatment of sarcoptic mange (S. scabiei) in dogs, Revolution should be administered once as a single topical dose. A second monthly dose may be required in some dogs. Monthly use of Revolution will control any subsequent sarcoptic mange mite infestations. Because of the difficulty in finding sarcoptic mange mites on skin scrapings, effectiveness assessments also were based on resolution of clinical signs. Resolution of the pruritus associated with the mite infestations was observed in approximately 50% of the dogs 30 days after the first treatment and in approximately 90% of the dogs 30 days after the second monthly treatment.  Tick Control in Dogs For the control of tick (Dermacentor variabilis) infestations in dogs, Revolution should be administered on a monthly basis. In heavy tick infestations, complete efficacy may not be achieved after the first dose. In these cases, one additional dose may be administered two weeks after the previous dose, with monthly dosing continued thereafter.  Nematode Treatment in Cats For the treatment of intestinal hookworm (A. tubaeforme) and roundworm (T. cati) infections, Revolution should be applied once as a single topical dose.


Active Ingredient: Selamectin


CAUTION: US Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. WARNINGS Not for human use. Keep out of the reach of children. In humans, Revolution may be irritating to skin and eyes. Reactions such as hives, itching and skin redness have been reported in humans in rare instances. Individuals with known hypersensitivity to Revolution should use the product with caution or consult a health care professional. Revolution contains isopropyl alcohol and the preservative butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Wash hands after use and wash off any product in contact with the skin immediately with soap and water. If contact with eyes occurs, then flush eyes copiously with water. In case of ingestion by a human, contact a physician immediately. The material safety data sheet (MSDS) provides more detailed occupational safety information. For a copy of the MSDS or to report adverse reactions attributable to exposure to this product, call 1-800-366-5288.  Flammable - Keep away from heat, sparks, open flames or other sources of ignition.  Do not use in sick, debilitated or underweight animals.  PRECAUTIONS: Prior to administration of Revolution, dogs should be tested for existing heartworm infections. At the discretion of the veterinarian, infected dogs should be treated to remove adult heartworms. Revolution is not effective against adult D. immitis and, while the number of circulating microfilariae may decrease following treatment, Revolution is not effective for microfilariae clearance.  Hypersensitivity reactions have not been observed in dogs with patent heartworm infections administered three times the recommended dose of Revolution. Higher doses were not tested.
