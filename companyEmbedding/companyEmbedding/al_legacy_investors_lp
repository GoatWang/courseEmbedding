Safety Is a Core Value





LP Teamwork and Respect






Employee Spotlight
Lorraine Daley
Plant Safety ManagerEast River, Nova Scotia

I like that we have a strong team and they’re dedicated to safety. I was recruited from another job and when they interviewed me I was hesitant to take the job until I met the team. Once I knew I had this huge support system I knew they were supportive of the safety culture.
“Lorraine is a dedicated member of the LP East River team. She is passionate about her work as the safety manager. Her interactions with employees helps them solve problems on the floor and have a better understanding of how to protect themselves and look out for their co-workers,” said Kyle Kennedy, Plant Manager at LP’s East River Mill.
       
   



Employee Spotlight
Harry Gordon
Production ReliefNewberry, Michigan

I am the person that actually fills in for the production supervisor. We also take care of the day crew and spend time filling in for all the other positions if someone is out. I work with a very supportive team. They inspire the best out of everyone.
"Harry works hard and is well liked by his peers,” said John Duflo, Plant Operations Superintendent at LP’s Newberry mill. “He’s very respectful and a great teammate."
       
   



Employee Spotlight
Leonard Pittman
SupervisorJasper, TX Mill

I supervise our shipping department. I enjoy working with the people I work with and I like working in the area I work in. I’ve been in this department for 15 years. The people are good, safety-oriented people. We have a lot of goal-driven people, people with good ideas that motivate you in your job.
“Leonard does a great job ensuring that we keep our shipments on time and that they have very little error.  He is very dependable and does a great job managing his department,” said Joe Gernand, Production Superintendent at LP’s Jasper Mill.  “I really enjoy working with Leonard because I can trust him to take care of his fellow employees and to keep up with the shipping standards we have at LP.”

I love what I do. I love helping our customers and I’m very proud of the products we make. I have our LP SmartSide on my house that I bought from one of our distributors. If I had built my house I would’ve bought the I-joists we make. Red Bluff is small so when you find a good job you don’t change. And I found a good one.
"It’s so great to have a resource like Maria on our team. She has a lot of knowledge about our industry, our products, and our customers. And you can tell she cares about people, both inside and outside of LP,” said Alyssa Moore, EWP Customer Service Lead.

I keep track of the quality process in my area and make sure our customers get the product they ordered. We look for any defects before we package it, make sure it’s cut to the right lengths, etc. I like working here because LP cares about each individual person and looks out for their safety.
“Travis works very hard and is very dedicated. When he joined LP he was working in the packaging end and then quickly wanted more responsibility so he moved up and took a lead position. He’s a problem solver for the crew. He works well with his team, and is a very valuable employee,” said Danny Williams, Supervisor at LP’s Houlton Mill.

REAL ESTATE PRIVATE EQUITY
FOCUSED INVESTING. SUPERIOR RETURNS.

+Our Strategy
+Our Offerings


+Our Process

+Our Team




Legacy Capital Partners is a real estate private equity firm founded in 2004. Our ability to create value and achieve superior returns for our investors rests on five fundamental beliefs:

1Investment strategies have a shelf life. That is why we invest with strategies that work now and can be deployed quickly.
2It’s all about the fundamentals. We are real estate professionals experienced in finance rather than finance professionals investing in real estate.
3Relationships matter. Great investments are made with great partners whose capacity and ethics make all the difference.
4Risk is reduced by having a defined and consistent process for how investment opportunities are analyzed.
5Managing other people’s money requires strong internal systems and controls.  We take our role as a fiduciary seriously.
 






+Our Strategy


Middle market real estate investors, deploying capital nationally through a series of focused funds with targeted strategies.
We focus on secondary markets and filter opportunities based on the partner, the location, and the investment’s ability to generate annual yield and capital appreciation.

+Our Process
Our investment process is from the ground up and begins in the trenches, as you would expect from an investment manager with deep roots in real estate development. We strive to reduce the probability of investment errors through a defined sequence of actions; our investment process is the same regardless of fund strategy. It’s what differentiates us from other managers.Click here to learn more about our process.





+50Fund® Investing
“Legacy Capital Partners didn’t set out to create a new asset class, although that may very well be the by-product of our thinking.”David St. Pierre | Co-Founder and PresidentThere is a real possibility that Legacy Capital Partners’ 50Fund® investment model will change how many investors allocate capital. Fund Managers are constantly told that in order to attract larger investors and raise more capital, they need to raise bigger funds.At Legacy Capital Partners we believe that bigger funds are not necessarily better. Raising 50 million dollars per fund allows us to systematically deploy capital into focused investment strategies. It eliminates the pressure to chase deals to “get the dollars out.” 50Fund® Investing provides our investors a single stop for deploying significant capital into real estate through a menu of multiple funds with specific strategies designed to take advantage of timely opportunities in the market.Click here to learn more about Legacy’s next 50Fund®.

Lago Paradiso at the Hammocks
Legacy Capital Partners (Legacy) has created LAC Lago Paradiso LLC (Company) to provide accredited investors the opportunity to invest in Lago Paradiso at the Hammocks, a 424-unit garden style apartment community in Miami (Kendall), FL. (“Lago Paradiso” or “Project”). Lago Paradiso was built in 1987 and represents an opportunity to invest in a well-located community that will provide stable in-place cash flow and value appreciation through increased rental rates tied to significant renovations of unit interiors, building exteriors and common areas.
Legacy entered into a joint venture with Electra Multifamily Investment Fund (EMIF), to acquire the Lago Paradiso on May 31, 2017. This represents the thirteenth joint venture between Legacy and the CEO of EMIF. The purchase price was $61,236,600 and the total cost, including $8,413,400 for renovations, contingencies and closing costs, was $69,650,000. This represents a purchase price of $144,000 per unit and a total cost of $164,300 per unit which compares favorably to recent comparable sales in the market. The acquisition and renovation was capitalized with a loan in the amount of $46,875,000 and equity in the amount of $22,775,000. Legacy invested $9,300,000, EMIF invested $9,475,000 and a third party invested $4,000,000.
The investment strategy is to renovate the entire property - unit interiors, building exteriors, common areas, amenities, landscaping, and clubhouse - during the first 12 months of ownership. Approximately $10,000 per unit has been capitalized to complete these improvements. The unit interior renovations will be completed as lease renewals occur to allow each unit to be upgraded during the initial year. The underwriting assumes the renovations will allow the Project to achieve rental rate increases of $209 per unit on average over the Project’s in-place rental rates and in-line with rental rates at nearby competitive properties. Given the strength of the surrounding market and metro, the planned renovations combined with operational improvements should allow Lago Paradiso to compete favorably with comparable properties and generate the desired financial performance.
The Company is offering 87.72 Membership Units for an aggregate purchase price of $4,386,000, or $50,000 per Membership Unit. The minimum investment will be two (2) Membership Units for an
aggregate purchase price of $100,000 and the maximum investment will be six (6) Membership Units for an aggregate purchase price of $300,000. However, the Manager may, in its sole discretion, accept investments for less than two (2) or greater than six (6) Membership Units. Investors will receive an 8% preferred return on their invested capital paid from net cash flow, refinance proceeds or sale proceeds. After the preferred return is paid current, investors will receive 80% of excess net cash flow. Once the preferred return is paid current and 100% of the investors’ capital has been returned, the investors will receive 80% of excess refinance and/or sale proceeds.
To request a Private Placement Memorandum please contact us at legacy@LCP1.com or 216-381-2303.











Highlights

Off market transaction being acquired from family estate for below replacement cost
Rental rates per unit significantly below comparable/competitive properties and majority of units have original interiors
Well located project in an infill submarket with no new supply and strong demand drivers
Strong resident base with low historical turnover, high income to rent ratios and expressed interest for renovated units

The average annual cash yield is projected to be in excess of 8.5%
An initial investment of $100,000 is projected to generate a total return of $170,000
60% + of the return on investment is projected to be derived from cash flow

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
