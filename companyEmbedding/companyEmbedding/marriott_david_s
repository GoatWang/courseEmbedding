By visiting the properties within his family’s hotel empire, David Marriott stresses community to carry on the Marriott brand.








By  Carlo  Wolff
carlo.wolff@gmail.com






ASHBURN, Virginia—Born to the hotel life, David Marriott fits right in at the SpringHill Suites Ashburn in this northern Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C. In April, Marriott visited the property to pump up the troops, shaking the hand of each member of a group of Marriott associates gathered in the lobby of this fresh, select-service hotel, the only building with an identifying sign in an area slowly becoming a new city center.
“I feel like I started with the company the day they put a diaper on me,” the boyish scion of the storied Marriott brand told the group, seated in one of two circular “communal centers” in the lobby. 
As COO of Marriott International’s Americas Eastern Region, Marriott, 36, leads 220 hotels stretching from South Carolina to Maine to West Virginia, including 150 select-service properties and 10 Ritz-Carltons. As of that Thursday 1 April, he had been in the job for only 90 days. 








As COO of Marriott International's Americas Eastern Region, David Marriott makes it a point to greet the company's associates in person.




Meeting the people
“You’ve gone through a lot in the last 18 months,” Marriott said, his communication easy-going, his manner far more relaxed than his attire. What’s key to success in hospitality, he said, is “genuine care for people,” making sure family relationships are strong, and “day in and day out, you’re giving your all.”
He said Marriott is in a good position as the world emerges from recession. Marriott also noted that his favorite destination is Camelback Inn Resort & Spa in Scottsdale, Arizona, the Marriott spread where he and his family recently visited his father, 78-year-old J.W. (Bill) Marriott Jr., and Bill’s wife, Donna. Bill Marriott has spent 42 birthdays at the Scottsdale landmark, which is where David and his wife, Carey, became engaged.
The youngest of four children, Marriott ran global sales for Marriott for four years, decentralizing the operation into regional sales offices, until January, when he assumed his new position. Still acclimating to the greater responsibilities, he was leery about discussing whether he someday will take over for his father as leader of the company, but the question is inevitable. Debbie Marriott Harrison, the oldest child, is senior VP of government affairs for Marriott. Stephen, the next oldest, is executive VP of culture. John runs JW Marriott Family Enterprises. That leaves David, the one Marriott other than Bill with his hands—literally—on hotels.
In his talk with associates, Marriott said SpringHill Suites is “beautifully positioned” for business in the downturn and later; Ritz-Carlton had a really difficult 2009 but is getting back on track; the full-service J.W. Marriott brand is becoming more relevant to the business traveler; and the timing was bad to debut Edition and Nickelodeon, respectively a luxury boutique hotel and a family resort.
But he stressed the silver lining. 
“We’ve had a lot of really good learnings in the last year-and-a-half,” Marriott said, predicting robust growth in India, as well as China, where Marriott expects to open 30 hotels during the next two years (there are 40 already there).
Casual charisma
In an interview after the gathering, Marriott said he spends his day on reports from VPs responsible for Ritz-Carltons, the C-Res (Courtyard and Residence) hotels, and for larger markets including New York City, where Marriott will launch a renovation of the 2,000-room Marriott Marquis at the end of the year. Other imminent renovations: the 1,400-room Philadelphia Marriott Downtown and the 1,100-room Marriott Copley Place in Boston. Marriott visits GMs to “talk through their challenges” and attempts to make sure owners are “investing in the product and staying on top of their renovation schedules.” 
The hardest thing about the new job? 
“Finding the appropriate balance to pay attention to the competing priorities” issuing from customers, associates, owners and ownership groups. “I’m still learning about the job.” 
Did he want the job? 
“Absolutely,” he said. “Whenever you go into a big job, it feels overwhelming at times, but it’s a tremendous opportunity and I’m really enjoying it so far.”
He called his management style “really collaborative. If you ask my team, they would say I’m always looking for ideas and trying to create an environment where there’s a free flow of ideas.”
 Early in his new post, he organized a two-day retreat with an outside facilitator “to talk about what makes a high-performing team and what our priorities would be.” 
Trust was a hot topic: It’s not always easy to share things with your boss, particularly when the boss has the last name of Marriott.








David Marriott shares thoughts about hotels with Marriott associates.




‘Extended family’ 
While no member of the Marriott family would comment on David, his boss did. 
“His brother, John, introduced me to him when he was still in college,” recalled David Grissen, president of the Americas, Marriott International. “He handles himself extremely well, given he’s a younger guy. When I tour hotels with him, it’s kind of fun … He’s just charming with the associates, he’s kind of iconic. You walk in, the place is abuzz, the hourly staff, the housekeepers, the line staff in the kitchen, they just pop to attention.
“We’re kind of unique in the industry in that we have someone with their name on the building walk into the hotel. There isn’t a Mr. Starwood, and the Hiltons are kind of gone.”
Is it uncomfortable being his boss? 
“There’s no downside,” Grissen said. “The biggest downside would be if Mr. Marriott found out I didn’t give David constructive feedback and criticism; that’s when he might decide to find a new president of the Americas.” 
David hasn’t had a development or finance role in the company or as much operations experience as some other Marriott executives, Grissen suggested, so he needs “exposure to the right areas.” He has conversations in which he asks David to list “three things that you go home and lose sleep over because you don’t know,” then work on them. 
“He’s going to build out his experience and credibility and business skills,” Grissen said, “but the one thing I think he’s a natural at it is a leader. He’s wonderful on stage, he’s got great platform skills … he’s genuine, he’s articulate, he speaks well, and he speaks from the heart.”
David “is a very normal guy,” Grissen said. “He’s got a very balanced head on his shoulders for someone who grew up in the Marriott family. You could end up very different, not a roll-up-your-sleeves kind of person. He truly appreciates a lot of what we’ve built as a company from a culture standpoint—our associates mean a lot to us and he gets that.”
Associates view their co-workers as “extended family,” Marriott said.
“I think it’s critical, particularly now, that that culture continues to grow and be strong. You look at our turnover, it’s extremely low. Look at our tenure, it’s extremely high. Our GMs are generally 20- to 25-year associates with the company, and the number of executives we have that are 30-plus years is unheard of.
“There’s a lot of people unemployed right now, more than in years,” he said. “We want to make sure we hold on to the best talent and attract the best talent, make sure the people we hire have a passion for this industry,” a field of hard work and long hours. 
 
“I’ve always believed you live in the moment and do the best you can with what you have on your plate,” Marriott said. “If you do that, the other things will take care of themselves. If my family life isn’t successful and happy to me, the rest of it, who really cares?”
Known as a huge Grateful Dead fan, Marriott abandons his BlackBerry on weekends. “It’s all about the kids when I’m not working, and it’s all about my wife, trying to carve out a couple of hours a week for ourselves.”

He probably said CRST (which stands for Courtyard, Residence Inn, SpringHill Suites, and TownPlace Suites) not C-Res.

David was a key speaker at our recent Town Hall meeting in Charlotte NC.  He was charismatic, interesting, and humble when answering his fathers questions.  I'm proud to have the Marriott family as my employer.

I have worked at Marriott's reservations contact center for the past 6 years and I must say it is a pretty good company to work for. I love the people I work with and that helps a lot to relieve some of the tediousness that come with repetitive nature of the job.

Marriott's Youngest Son Makes His Mark

Washington Post Staff Writer

Monday, October 29, 2007




There are moments for many parents when they look at their children and see themselves. It happened to Bill Marriott a few weeks ago during breakfast in Tokyo.



The hotel magnate, now 75 and slower with his steps but not his drive, was in Japan with his youngest son, David, who is 34 and the head of global sales at the Bethesda company that shares their last name. They were meeting the local sales team. David was a few minutes late, so his father got things started.


Bill Marriott is famous for his folksy touch with his front-line employees, but that morning, uncharacteristically, he went around the table very businesslike, pressing the sales crew for details on their deals. The employees were tense. Bill Marriott could feel it. Then in walks David, being Mr. Funny, cracking jokes, asking about their families.


"In a minute and a half, everyone was laughing and feeling good," Bill Marriott said, and it got them all talking. "It was telling to me: It was what I should have done and what I normally do."


It's one thing for a parent to feel joy in spotting a likeness in a child but quite another thing to do so in the context of a $15 billion company when the largest shareholder is one's family. More complications develop when Dad is 75, and what people want to ask but fear doing so is: Who comes after you? Reading the tea leaves becomes something of a sport around the office. It's a fact of life for the Marriotts that will loom larger as David radically reorganizes group and corporate bookings, moving sales reps out of individual hotels and into regional centers. Though it may sound bureaucratic, no one else does it that way. It has the potential to irritate some hotel owners, but it's a move Dad calls "the most transformational event that's happened here in a long time."


With David making one of his first significant public decisions at Marriott International, the questions are inevitable: Is he the real deal? And if he is, will he one day run the company his dad built? The questions follow David in a sort of silhouette. "I would be a complete liar if I would say there is no pressure there," he said, sitting on the couch of his office near a labyrinth of cubicles at the company's headquarters. "As a Marriott, you always live with the feeling that you're being looked at under a microscope."


There are four Marriott children. The oldest, at age 50, is Debbie, who works on government affairs. Stephen, 48, has a rare muscular disorder that has left him hearing-impaired and blind, and he works on culture issues and special events. John, 46, was head of lodging but left the company two years ago to run his family's investments. That leaves David as the only Marriott offspring working on day-to-day operations.


He has run global sales for three years, overseeing a department that takes in roughly 40 percent of the business at Marriott's full-service hotels. His first major initiative -- called SalesForce One -- shifts salespeople out of the company's hotels and into regional sales offices, where they will sell rooms at dozens of Marriott properties, not just the hotel where they were based. The idea is to sell to customers the way they want to be sold to: not by individual sales people calling from every hotel in a region, but one point of contact offering rooms at a variety of properties.


It helps Marriott, which manages hotels, please its deep-pocketed corporate clients, streamlining the booking process. But the company's hotels have individual owners with their own economic interests. Until now, owners could rest assured that salespeople were specifically focused on selling their property.


"A regional sales approach will definitely have greater appeal to the clients who we must ultimately serve and therefore should increase brand preference," said Fred Malek, a former top executive at Marriott who owns several of the company's hotels. "But it also has to be blended with consideration for the profit/loss interest of individual general managers in a diverse ownership group."


David acknowledges that there is uneasiness from some owners, but said: "What we have told them is that fair share in the new world will be different from the old world. The whole system will get a lift from SalesForce One." He has taken a lead role in reassuring hotel owners.


"There's quite high expectations from stakeholders when he walks in the room," said his boss, Amy McPherson, Marriot's executive vice president of sales and marketing.
