Balanced Fund









Share








































What is a 'Balanced Fund'
A balanced fund combines a stock component, a bond component and sometimes a money market component in a single portfolio. Generally, these hybrid funds stick to a relatively fixed mix of stocks and bonds that reflects either a moderate, or higher equity, component, or conservative, or higher fixed-income, component orientation.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Balanced Fund'
      Balanced funds are geared toward investors who are looking for a mixture of safety, income and modest capital appreciation. The amounts this type of mutual fund invests into each asset class usually must remain within a set minimum and maximum.Although they are in the "asset allocation" family, balanced fund portfolios do not materially change their asset mix. This is unlike life-cycle, target-date and actively managed asset-allocation funds, which make changes in response to an investor's changing risk-return appetite and age or overall investment market conditions.Equities and InflationInvestors who have dual investment objectives favor balanced funds. Typically, retirees or investors with low risk tolerance utilize these funds for growth that outpaces inflation and income that supplements current needs. While retirees generally scale back risk as age advances, many individuals recognize the need for equity exposure as life expectancies increase. While the equity holdings of a balanced fund tend to lean toward large, dividend-paying companies, those issues typically provide long-term total returns that track the S&P 500 Index. Historically, inflation has averaged about 3%, while the S&P 500 averaged about 9.8% from 1928 through 2014. Equities prevent erosion of purchasing power and help ensure long-term preservation of retirement nest eggs.Income NeedsThe bond component of a balanced fund serves two purposes: creating an income stream and tempering portfolio volatility. Investment-grade bonds such as AAA corporate issues and U.S. Treasurys provide interest income from semi-annual payments, while large-company stocks offer quarterly dividend payouts to enhance yield. Retired investors may take distributions in cash to bolster income from pensions, personal savings and government subsidies.Secondarily, bonds and Treasurys hold much less volatility than stocks. Bondholders have a claim against assets of a company while stocks represent ownership, bearing all inherent risk if bankruptcy occurs. Hence, debt security prices do not move in lockstep with equities, and their stability prevents wild swings in the share price of a balanced fund.Balanced Fund Performance ExampleThe Vanguard Balanced Index Fund has a below-average risk rating from Morningstar with an above-average reward profile. Through 10 years ending June 15, 2016, the fund, holding about 60% stock and 40% bonds, has returned 6.78% on average with a 1.89% trailing 12-month yield.

                Separately Managed Accounts: A Mutual Fund Alternative            


    By Katrina Lamb 






Share















































The investment management world is divided into retail and institutional investors. On one side are the traditional products designed for middle-income individual investors, like the retail classes of mutual funds; these have modest initial investment requirements. On the other side are managed strategies for institutions, with imposing minimum requirements of $25 million or more. In between these, however, is the growing universe of separately managed accounts (SMAs) targeted at wealthy (but not necessarily ultra-wealthy) individual investors. This article will examine the world of SMAs and what investors--or their financial advisors--should keep in mind when considering these investment vehicles.
SEE: Separately Managed Accounts: A Boon For AllDefining Managed Separate AccountsA SMA is a portfolio of assets under the management of a professional investment firm. In the United States, the vast majority of such firms are called registered investment advisors, and operate under the regulatory auspices of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 and the purview of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). One or more portfolio managers are responsible for day-to-day investment decisions, supported by a team of analysts, operations and administrative staff. SMAs differ from pooled vehicles like mutual funds in that each portfolio is unique to a single account (hence the name). In other words, if you set up a separate account with Money Manager X, then Manager X has the discretion to make decisions for this account that may be different from decisions made for other accounts.
Say, for example, that a manager operates a diversified core equity strategy including 20 stocks. The manager decides to launch a mutual fund containing these stocks and also a separately managed account offering. Assume that at the outset, the manager invests all portfolios with the same weight--both the mutual fund and the SMAs. From a client's perspective, the beneficial interests in either vehicle are identical at the outset, but the statements will look different. For the mutual fund client, the position will show up as a single-line entry bearing the mutual fund ticker--most likely a five-letter acronym ending in "X." The value will be the net asset value from the close of business on the statement's effective date. The SMA investor's statement, however, will list each of the equity positions and values separately, and the total value of the account will simply be the aggregate value of each of the positions. 
From this beginning point, things will begin to diverge. Decisions the manager makes for the mutual fund--including the timing for purchase and sale of shares, dividend reinvestment and distributions--will affect all fund investors in the same way. For SMAs, however, the decisions are at the account level and will therefore vary from one investor to another.
SEE: Wrap It Up: The Terms And Benefits Of Managed Money
Mass CustomizationThe high level of customization is one of the main selling points of SMAs, particularly when it comes to individual taxable accounts. Portfolio transactions have expense and tax implications. With managed accounts, investors can feel like they have a greater degree of control over these decisions, and that they are more closely attuned to the objectives and constraints set forth in the investment policy statement. 
So what is the price of entry for this extra level of customized attention? There is no single answer for the several thousand managers that make up the SMA universe. As a general rule of thumb, the price of entry starts at $100,000. SMAs targeted to high net worth retail investors tend to set account minimum balances between $100,000 and $5 million. For strategies designed especially for institutional managers, minimum account sizes may range from $10 million to $100 million.  
For style-based investors who seek exposure to several different investment styles (e.g., large-cap value, small-cap growth) the price of entry goes up, as there will be a separate SMA, and a separate account minimum, for each style chosen. For example, an investor seeking style-pure exposure in the four corners of the style box--large cap, small cap, value and growth--might need to have at least $400,000 available to implement an SMA-based strategy. Other investors may prefer an all-cap blend (or core) approach that could be found through a single manager. 
Fee StructuresOne of the difficulties inherent in making an apples-to-apples comparison among investment offerings is that fee structures vary. This is even trickier for SMAs than for mutual funds, for reasons we will explain here.
Mutual fund fees are fairly straightforward. The key number is the net expense ratio, including the management fee (for the professional services of the team that runs the fund), miscellaneous ancillary expenses and a distribution charge called a 12(b)1 fee for certain eligible funds. Many funds also have different types of sales charges. Funds are required to disclose this information in their prospectuses and show explicitly how the fund expenses and sales charges would affect hypothetical returns over different holding periods. Investors can easily obtain these prospectuses from the fund's parent company, either online or through the mail. Separate accounts do not come with prospectuses. Managers list their basic fee structures in a regulatory filing called a Form ADV Part 2. An investor can obtain this document by contacting the manager, but they tend not to be as widely available through unrestricted online downloads as mutual fund prospectuses. Moreover, the published fee schedule in the ADV Part 2 is not necessarily firm - it is subject to negotiation between the investor (or the investor's financial advisor) and the money manager. Often, it is not a single fee but a scale in which the fee (expressed as a percentage of assets under management) decreases as the asset volume (the amount invested) increases.
The Importance of Due DiligenceBecause SMAs do not issue registered prospectuses, investors or their advisors need to rely on other sources for investigating and evaluating the manager. In investor-speak, this is referred to as due diligence. A comprehensive due diligence will elicit sufficiently detailed information regarding all of the following areas: 
Performance DataA manager should be prepared to share performance data (annual and preferably quarterly returns achieved) since inception of the strategy. The information is contained on a composite--a table showing aggregate performance for all fee-paying accounts in that strategy. A good question to ask here is whether the composite complies with the Global Investment Performance Standards set by the CFA Institute and whether a competent third-party auditor has provided a letter affirming compliance with the standards.  
Philosophy and ApproachEach manager has a unique investment philosophy and way of going about applying that philosophy to an investment approach. You will want to know whether the manager has a more active or passive style, a top-down or bottom-up approach, how he or she manages alpha and beta risk, the strategy's performance benchmark and other similar information. 
Investment ProcessFind out who makes the decisions and how they get carried out; the roles and responsibilities of portfolio managers, analysts, support staff and others; who comprises the investment committee and how often it meets and the sell discipline and other key aspects of the process. 
OperationsSome managers have extensive in-house trading platforms, while others outsource all non-core functions to third-party providers like Schwab or Fidelity. You also need to understand transaction expenses and how they can affect your bottom line. Another useful area of information here is client and account services. Among other things, here you can find out about net client activity--how many new clients did the firm originate and how many left over a defined time period? What were the circumstances surrounding those who left? 
Organization and CompensationHow the firm is organized and how it pays its professionals--especially the managers whose reputations and track records are the big draw--is an extremely important area to cover. Understand the calculations behind incentive compensation. Are the manager's incentives aligned with those of the investor? This is a must. 
Compliance HistoryRed flags include prominent infractions with the SEC or other regulatory bodies, fines or penalties levied and lawsuits or other adverse legal situations. The SEC considers separate account managers to be investment advisors subject to the provisions of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. 
Much of this information can be obtained from the manager's Form ADV Parts 1 and 2 (with Part 2 having more of the details on strategy, approach, fees and biographical information on the principal team members). Performance data should be available directly from the manager, either online or through personal contact with a manager representative. The representative should also be able to coordinate phone or in-person meetings with key team members, and direct your questions appropriately on compliance and other issues.
The Bottom LineBy virtue of the account minimums, separately managed accounts are certainly not for everybody. If you have the means, they can be a useful alternative to mutual funds or other pooled vehicles and more closely align with your own specific return objectives, risk tolerance and special circumstances.

Message from the Board of Directors

The Year in Review
In 2016 SIPC initiated one new customer protection proceeding, the first new case since 2013. Much progress also was made on SIPC’s existing brokerage firm liquidation proceedings.
Global Arena Capital Corp.
On January 28, SIPC initiated a customer protection proceeding for Global Arena Capital Corp. in the federal District Court in Manhattan. In a rare event, the brokerage opposed SIPC, claiming that no customers were owed any cash or securities. Working with FINRA and the Securities and Exchange Commission, SIPC brought victims from as far away as Alaska, and presented 11 individual witnesses in a contested trial on February 3. On February 16, the District Court placed the firm in liquidation and designated SIPC as trustee.
The Global Arena case is an excellent example of how SIPC and securities regulators work together, under the oversight of the courts, to limit the harm to investors and obtain relief for investors as quickly as possible.
Ongoing Cases
SIPC initiated the liquidation of MF Global Inc. on October 31, 2011. Based on the amount of assets, this was the eighth largest insolvency, of any kind, in history. Early in 2016, Trustee James Giddens completed the liquidation with remarkable results. All securities customers were paid in full without the need for SIPC advances. All commodities customers were paid in full. The firm’s General Creditors received 95 cents on the dollar.
Lehman Brothers Inc., the largest insolvency of any kind, is also moving rapidly to a conclusion. While a number of judicial proceedings remain on appeal, all securities customers have received the contents of their accounts without the needs for SIPC advances, secured creditors and priority creditor claims have been paid in full, and a distribution of $8.8 billion has been made to general creditors.
The liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC involves the largest Ponzi Scheme in history. While complex litigation to recover more assets of the victims continues, the results to date have exceeded expectations. The Trustee has distributed $9.47 billion, with 1,303 accounts fully satisfied. Any customer that gave Madoff, net, up to $1,253,000 has been made whole. Customers with larger claims have received 60% of the net amount given to Madoff, plus $500,000 from SIPC. The process of asset recovery continues and the Board expects additional distributions in 2017.
Looking Forward
SIPC continues to look for ways to return customer assets more quickly and efficiently. Among other initiatives in 2017, we hope to implement technology that will allow customers to file their claims electronically.
For securities brokerage firms, their customers, and SIPC, cybersecurity remains a priority. SIPC is an active member of the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC), which aims to coordinate and plan the prevention of cyberattacks and respond to successful attacks as promptly as possible. The Committee, hosted by the Department of the Treasury, identifies critical infrastructure assets and establishes secure communications capabilities among financial regulators for communicating during an emergency. In 2016, working with the principals of U.S. financial regulatory agencies such as the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, SIPC participated in the review of several initiatives, including a Presidential Policy Directive on U.S. Cyber Incident Coordination Policy and the G7 Fundamental Elements of Cybersecurity for the Financial Sector. This effort is ongoing.
