How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in North Carolina:













Does Hurley William's Iii carry a valid contracting license?



In North Carolina a construction project with costs of $30,000 or more requires a contractor to be licensed.
Hurley William's Iii currently holds license 18837 (Residential), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in North Carolina?



Contractors in North Carolina must take an exam administered by PSI licensure certification in order to become licensed. 











Your liability risk when hiring Hurley William's Iii



Although state law does not require contractors to carry general liability or workers' compensation insurance, hiring contractors who do have an active policy of each insurance is highly recommended. Request a copy of each insurance certificate for your records before any work begins.











Financial recourse when hiring Hurley William's Iii



Contractors in North Carolina do not have to obtain a surety bond to perform work on residential properties. Homeowners have financial recourse in North Carolina through The Homeowners Recovery Fund, which provides assistance to eligible North Carolina homeowners who have suffered a financial loss caused by the dishonest or incompetent conduct of a licensed general contractor.











What else should I know before hiring Hurley William's Iii



Licensed contractors must furnish proof of financial responsibility to obtain a limited, intermediate, or unlimited license according to a company's working capital. Working capital is current assets minus current liabilities.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in North Carolina, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Early life[edit]
Hurley was born in Manassas, Virginia. In his youth, his family moved around a lot, as his father was a member of the US Army Special Forces. They lived in Germany, Virginia and Arizona before settling in San Antonio, Texas, where Hurley attended elementary school. The Hurley family later moved to Temple, Texas. Following his graduation from Temple High School in 1989, Hurley took electronic music courses at Temple Junior College, which would be the extent of his college education.[5]
An abbreviation of Hurley’s full name, “whurley” was originally Hurley’s Unix username when he was starting out in the open source community.[2][6] He began going by “whurley” professionally in 2002.[5]
Career[edit]
Large corporations and start-ups (1994-09)[edit]
Whurley moved to Austin in 1994 to work at Apple, eventually working in research and development.[7] He left Apple in 1997 for IBM, where he was appointed Master Inventor.[2][8] After leaving IBM in 2000, he worked for a series of start-ups, including security management company Symbiot, which he co-founded and served as chief technology officer from 2003 to 2005; and systems management company Qlusters, where he was CTO from 2005 to 2007.[9] Qlusters closed down a year and a half after his departure.[10] In the summer of 2002, whurley was hired by a resort group to infiltrate a Las Vegas casino's offices in order to perform security audits. This was covered as part of Kevin Mitnick's 2005 nonfiction collection The Art of Intrusion.[11] In 2007, whurley was hired as chief architect of open source at BMC Software, where he remained until 2009.[9]
Chaotic Moon Studios (2010-14)[edit]
In 2010, along with Ben Lamm and Mike Erwin, Whurley founded mobile software design and development company Chaotic Moon Studios.[12] Chaotic Moon has worked with News Corp to develop the first iPad-only digital newspaper The Daily, as well as building applications for Microsoft, CBS Sports, Sanrio, Pizza Hut and others.[12] In 2012, Chaotic Moon purchased whurley’s old company Symbiot.[12]
In 2011, Whurley and Phil Wheat formed a division to focus on developing new technologies, Chaotic Moon Labs.[6] Whurley serves as the division’s general manager,[12] overseeing the development of such products as a Microsoft Kinect-controlled skateboard (which the company named the “Board of Awesomeness”);[13] a skateboard controlled by the user’s mind through a Samsung tablet running Windows 8 (the “Board of Imagination”);[13] a shopping cart that follows a shopper around the store (“The Smarter Cart");[14] and a bicycle helmet fitted with seven cameras that begin recording on impact, functioning like an airplane’s black box in case of a hit-and-run (the “Helmet of Justice”).[15]
In July 2015, Chaotic Moon was acquired by Accenture, a consulting and technology services company.[16]
Honest Dollar (2014-present)[edit]
In 2014, Whurley left Chaotic Moon to co-found Honest Dollar with Henry Yoshida.[17] The Austin-based financial technology company helps set up and maintain employee retirement accounts for small businesses.[18][19] In March 2016, Goldman Sachs announced a deal to acquire Honest Dollar.[20][21]
Equals (2016-present)[edit]
In September 2016, International Telecommunications Union and United Nations Women announced that they had teamed up with whurley to launch Equals: The Global Partnership for Gender Equality in the Digital Age, an organization focused on empowering women across the globe by helping them learn technology skills and find technology-related jobs. At the time of its formation, there were 250 million fewer women online than men. Equals is based at the International Telecommunications Union in Geneva, Switzerland. Whurley put together a team in Austin to help launch the organization.[22][23][24]
Politics[edit]
On March 11, 2016, whurley and rapper/producer will.i.am co-hosted a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at South By Southwest in Austin, featuring President Barack Obama and musical guest J. Cole.[25][26]
Publications and patents[edit]
Whurley has co-written two books, both published in 1996: FreeHand: Graphics Studio Skills (a tutorial on Adobe FreeHand) and 60 Minute Guide to Shockwave (a tutorial on creating movies for the Internet).
Between 2000 and 2004, whurley was issued 11 patents, mostly related to systems management and security.[27]
In 2009, Whurley regularly wrote a blog on cloud computing for InfoWorld[28] and contributed technology articles to Bloomberg Businessweek.[29]
Community involvement[edit]
Whurley co-founded BarCamp Austin in 2006, a technology-related conference which took place around South By Southwest;[30][31] and iPhoneDevCamp (or “developers camp”), which debuted in 2007 as an assembly of 200-300 developers and enthusiasts who were interested in finding new ways to use and hack Apple’s iPhone.[32] It has since expanded to include iOSDevCamp and iPadDevCamp.[33] In the summer of 2013, whurley will be leading the inaugural GlassDevCamp, which will take place in San Francisco and will encourage the development of apps for the Google Glass platform.[34]
In June 2013, British Airways hosted UnGrounded, a group of business leaders and creative thinkers who met to address significant global problems. Whurley was one of 100 passengers to take part in the initiative, which took place on an 11-hour transatlantic flight from Silicon Valley to London. His group worked on strategies for getting more women involved in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). The passengers later presented their ideas as part of an innovation conference held during the 39th G8 summit, as well as to the United Nations' International Telecommunications Union.[35][36]
Film[edit]
In 2012, Whurley began working in film. He served as an associate producer on Pit Stop (2013), directed by Yen Tan. The feature was an official selection of the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.[37][38] That same year, he was executive producer on the short film Sahasi Chori (Brave Girl) (2013), directed by Erin Galey.[39] The film, which explores the sex trafficking industry through the story of a 13-year-old girl from a small village in Nepal who is taken by a con artist to Mumbai’s red light district,[40] was selected for the 2013 South By Southwest ShortCase program[41] and the 2013 Sarasota Film Festival,[42] among others.

Early life[edit]
Hurley was born in Manassas, Virginia. In his youth, his family moved around a lot, as his father was a member of the US Army Special Forces. They lived in Germany, Virginia and Arizona before settling in San Antonio, Texas, where Hurley attended elementary school. The Hurley family later moved to Temple, Texas. Following his graduation from Temple High School in 1989, Hurley took electronic music courses at Temple Junior College, which would be the extent of his college education.[5]
An abbreviation of Hurley’s full name, “whurley” was originally Hurley’s Unix username when he was starting out in the open source community.[2][6] He began going by “whurley” professionally in 2002.[5]
Career[edit]
Large corporations and start-ups (1994-09)[edit]
Whurley moved to Austin in 1994 to work at Apple, eventually working in research and development.[7] He left Apple in 1997 for IBM, where he was appointed Master Inventor.[2][8] After leaving IBM in 2000, he worked for a series of start-ups, including security management company Symbiot, which he co-founded and served as chief technology officer from 2003 to 2005; and systems management company Qlusters, where he was CTO from 2005 to 2007.[9] Qlusters closed down a year and a half after his departure.[10] In the summer of 2002, whurley was hired by a resort group to infiltrate a Las Vegas casino's offices in order to perform security audits. This was covered as part of Kevin Mitnick's 2005 nonfiction collection The Art of Intrusion.[11] In 2007, whurley was hired as chief architect of open source at BMC Software, where he remained until 2009.[9]
Chaotic Moon Studios (2010-14)[edit]
In 2010, along with Ben Lamm and Mike Erwin, Whurley founded mobile software design and development company Chaotic Moon Studios.[12] Chaotic Moon has worked with News Corp to develop the first iPad-only digital newspaper The Daily, as well as building applications for Microsoft, CBS Sports, Sanrio, Pizza Hut and others.[12] In 2012, Chaotic Moon purchased whurley’s old company Symbiot.[12]
In 2011, Whurley and Phil Wheat formed a division to focus on developing new technologies, Chaotic Moon Labs.[6] Whurley serves as the division’s general manager,[12] overseeing the development of such products as a Microsoft Kinect-controlled skateboard (which the company named the “Board of Awesomeness”);[13] a skateboard controlled by the user’s mind through a Samsung tablet running Windows 8 (the “Board of Imagination”);[13] a shopping cart that follows a shopper around the store (“The Smarter Cart");[14] and a bicycle helmet fitted with seven cameras that begin recording on impact, functioning like an airplane’s black box in case of a hit-and-run (the “Helmet of Justice”).[15]
In July 2015, Chaotic Moon was acquired by Accenture, a consulting and technology services company.[16]

Whurley moved to Austin in 1994 to work at Apple, eventually working in research and development.[7] He left Apple in 1997 for IBM, where he was appointed Master Inventor.[2][8] After leaving IBM in 2000, he worked for a series of start-ups, including security management company Symbiot, which he co-founded and served as chief technology officer from 2003 to 2005; and systems management company Qlusters, where he was CTO from 2005 to 2007.[9] Qlusters closed down a year and a half after his departure.[10] In the summer of 2002, whurley was hired by a resort group to infiltrate a Las Vegas casino's offices in order to perform security audits. This was covered as part of Kevin Mitnick's 2005 nonfiction collection The Art of Intrusion.[11] In 2007, whurley was hired as chief architect of open source at BMC Software, where he remained until 2009.[9]
Chaotic Moon Studios (2010-14)[edit]
In 2010, along with Ben Lamm and Mike Erwin, Whurley founded mobile software design and development company Chaotic Moon Studios.[12] Chaotic Moon has worked with News Corp to develop the first iPad-only digital newspaper The Daily, as well as building applications for Microsoft, CBS Sports, Sanrio, Pizza Hut and others.[12] In 2012, Chaotic Moon purchased whurley’s old company Symbiot.[12]
In 2011, Whurley and Phil Wheat formed a division to focus on developing new technologies, Chaotic Moon Labs.[6] Whurley serves as the division’s general manager,[12] overseeing the development of such products as a Microsoft Kinect-controlled skateboard (which the company named the “Board of Awesomeness”);[13] a skateboard controlled by the user’s mind through a Samsung tablet running Windows 8 (the “Board of Imagination”);[13] a shopping cart that follows a shopper around the store (“The Smarter Cart");[14] and a bicycle helmet fitted with seven cameras that begin recording on impact, functioning like an airplane’s black box in case of a hit-and-run (the “Helmet of Justice”).[15]
In July 2015, Chaotic Moon was acquired by Accenture, a consulting and technology services company.[16]
Honest Dollar (2014-present)[edit]
In 2014, Whurley left Chaotic Moon to co-found Honest Dollar with Henry Yoshida.[17] The Austin-based financial technology company helps set up and maintain employee retirement accounts for small businesses.[18][19] In March 2016, Goldman Sachs announced a deal to acquire Honest Dollar.[20][21]
Equals (2016-present)[edit]
In September 2016, International Telecommunications Union and United Nations Women announced that they had teamed up with whurley to launch Equals: The Global Partnership for Gender Equality in the Digital Age, an organization focused on empowering women across the globe by helping them learn technology skills and find technology-related jobs. At the time of its formation, there were 250 million fewer women online than men. Equals is based at the International Telecommunications Union in Geneva, Switzerland. Whurley put together a team in Austin to help launch the organization.[22][23][24]
Politics[edit]
On March 11, 2016, whurley and rapper/producer will.i.am co-hosted a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at South By Southwest in Austin, featuring President Barack Obama and musical guest J. Cole.[25][26]
Publications and patents[edit]
Whurley has co-written two books, both published in 1996: FreeHand: Graphics Studio Skills (a tutorial on Adobe FreeHand) and 60 Minute Guide to Shockwave (a tutorial on creating movies for the Internet).
Between 2000 and 2004, whurley was issued 11 patents, mostly related to systems management and security.[27]
In 2009, Whurley regularly wrote a blog on cloud computing for InfoWorld[28] and contributed technology articles to Bloomberg Businessweek.[29]
Community involvement[edit]
Whurley co-founded BarCamp Austin in 2006, a technology-related conference which took place around South By Southwest;[30][31] and iPhoneDevCamp (or “developers camp”), which debuted in 2007 as an assembly of 200-300 developers and enthusiasts who were interested in finding new ways to use and hack Apple’s iPhone.[32] It has since expanded to include iOSDevCamp and iPadDevCamp.[33] In the summer of 2013, whurley will be leading the inaugural GlassDevCamp, which will take place in San Francisco and will encourage the development of apps for the Google Glass platform.[34]
In June 2013, British Airways hosted UnGrounded, a group of business leaders and creative thinkers who met to address significant global problems. Whurley was one of 100 passengers to take part in the initiative, which took place on an 11-hour transatlantic flight from Silicon Valley to London. His group worked on strategies for getting more women involved in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). The passengers later presented their ideas as part of an innovation conference held during the 39th G8 summit, as well as to the United Nations' International Telecommunications Union.[35][36]
Film[edit]
In 2012, Whurley began working in film. He served as an associate producer on Pit Stop (2013), directed by Yen Tan. The feature was an official selection of the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.[37][38] That same year, he was executive producer on the short film Sahasi Chori (Brave Girl) (2013), directed by Erin Galey.[39] The film, which explores the sex trafficking industry through the story of a 13-year-old girl from a small village in Nepal who is taken by a con artist to Mumbai’s red light district,[40] was selected for the 2013 South By Southwest ShortCase program[41] and the 2013 Sarasota Film Festival,[42] among others.

Early life[edit]
Hurley was born in Manassas, Virginia. In his youth, his family moved around a lot, as his father was a member of the US Army Special Forces. They lived in Germany, Virginia and Arizona before settling in San Antonio, Texas, where Hurley attended elementary school. The Hurley family later moved to Temple, Texas. Following his graduation from Temple High School in 1989, Hurley took electronic music courses at Temple Junior College, which would be the extent of his college education.[5]
An abbreviation of Hurley’s full name, “whurley” was originally Hurley’s Unix username when he was starting out in the open source community.[2][6] He began going by “whurley” professionally in 2002.[5]

They lived in Germany, Virginia and Arizona before settling in San Antonio, Texas, where Hurley attended elementary school. The Hurley family later moved to Temple, Texas. Following his graduation from Temple High School in 1989, Hurley took electronic music courses at Temple Junior College, which would be the extent of his college education.[5]
An abbreviation of Hurley’s full name, “whurley” was originally Hurley’s Unix username when he was starting out in the open source community.[2][6] He began going by “whurley” professionally in 2002.[5]
Career[edit]
Large corporations and start-ups (1994-09)[edit]
Whurley moved to Austin in 1994 to work at Apple, eventually working in research and development.[7] He left Apple in 1997 for IBM, where he was appointed Master Inventor.[2][8] After leaving IBM in 2000, he worked for a series of start-ups, including security management company Symbiot, which he co-founded and served as chief technology officer from 2003 to 2005; and systems management company Qlusters, where he was CTO from 2005 to 2007.[9] Qlusters closed down a year and a half after his departure.[10] In the summer of 2002, whurley was hired by a resort group to infiltrate a Las Vegas casino's offices in order to perform security audits. This was covered as part of Kevin Mitnick's 2005 nonfiction collection The Art of Intrusion.[11] In 2007, whurley was hired as chief architect of open source at BMC Software, where he remained until 2009.[9]
Chaotic Moon Studios (2010-14)[edit]
In 2010, along with Ben Lamm and Mike Erwin, Whurley founded mobile software design and development company Chaotic Moon Studios.[12] Chaotic Moon has worked with News Corp to develop the first iPad-only digital newspaper The Daily, as well as building applications for Microsoft, CBS Sports, Sanrio, Pizza Hut and others.[12] In 2012, Chaotic Moon purchased whurley’s old company Symbiot.[12]
In 2011, Whurley and Phil Wheat formed a division to focus on developing new technologies, Chaotic Moon Labs.[6] Whurley serves as the division’s general manager,[12] overseeing the development of such products as a Microsoft Kinect-controlled skateboard (which the company named the “Board of Awesomeness”);[13] a skateboard controlled by the user’s mind through a Samsung tablet running Windows 8 (the “Board of Imagination”);[13] a shopping cart that follows a shopper around the store (“The Smarter Cart");[14] and a bicycle helmet fitted with seven cameras that begin recording on impact, functioning like an airplane’s black box in case of a hit-and-run (the “Helmet of Justice”).[15]
In July 2015, Chaotic Moon was acquired by Accenture, a consulting and technology services company.[16]
Honest Dollar (2014-present)[edit]
In 2014, Whurley left Chaotic Moon to co-found Honest Dollar with Henry Yoshida.[17] The Austin-based financial technology company helps set up and maintain employee retirement accounts for small businesses.[18][19] In March 2016, Goldman Sachs announced a deal to acquire Honest Dollar.[20][21]
Equals (2016-present)[edit]
In September 2016, International Telecommunications Union and United Nations Women announced that they had teamed up with whurley to launch Equals: The Global Partnership for Gender Equality in the Digital Age, an organization focused on empowering women across the globe by helping them learn technology skills and find technology-related jobs. At the time of its formation, there were 250 million fewer women online than men. Equals is based at the International Telecommunications Union in Geneva, Switzerland. Whurley put together a team in Austin to help launch the organization.[22][23][24]
Politics[edit]
On March 11, 2016, whurley and rapper/producer will.i.am co-hosted a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at South By Southwest in Austin, featuring President Barack Obama and musical guest J. Cole.[25][26]
Publications and patents[edit]
Whurley has co-written two books, both published in 1996: FreeHand: Graphics Studio Skills (a tutorial on Adobe FreeHand) and 60 Minute Guide to Shockwave (a tutorial on creating movies for the Internet).
Between 2000 and 2004, whurley was issued 11 patents, mostly related to systems management and security.[27]
In 2009, Whurley regularly wrote a blog on cloud computing for InfoWorld[28] and contributed technology articles to Bloomberg Businessweek.[29]
Community involvement[edit]
Whurley co-founded BarCamp Austin in 2006, a technology-related conference which took place around South By Southwest;[30][31] and iPhoneDevCamp (or “developers camp”), which debuted in 2007 as an assembly of 200-300 developers and enthusiasts who were interested in finding new ways to use and hack Apple’s iPhone.[32] It has since expanded to include iOSDevCamp and iPadDevCamp.[33] In the summer of 2013, whurley will be leading the inaugural GlassDevCamp, which will take place in San Francisco and will encourage the development of apps for the Google Glass platform.[34]
In June 2013, British Airways hosted UnGrounded, a group of business leaders and creative thinkers who met to address significant global problems. Whurley was one of 100 passengers to take part in the initiative, which took place on an 11-hour transatlantic flight from Silicon Valley to London. His group worked on strategies for getting more women involved in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). The passengers later presented their ideas as part of an innovation conference held during the 39th G8 summit, as well as to the United Nations' International Telecommunications Union.[35][36]
Film[edit]
In 2012, Whurley began working in film. He served as an associate producer on Pit Stop (2013), directed by Yen Tan. The feature was an official selection of the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.[37][38] That same year, he was executive producer on the short film Sahasi Chori (Brave Girl) (2013), directed by Erin Galey.[39] The film, which explores the sex trafficking industry through the story of a 13-year-old girl from a small village in Nepal who is taken by a con artist to Mumbai’s red light district,[40] was selected for the 2013 South By Southwest ShortCase program[41] and the 2013 Sarasota Film Festival,[42] among others.

Early life[edit]
Hurley was born in Manassas, Virginia. In his youth, his family moved around a lot, as his father was a member of the US Army Special Forces. They lived in Germany, Virginia and Arizona before settling in San Antonio, Texas, where Hurley attended elementary school. The Hurley family later moved to Temple, Texas. Following his graduation from Temple High School in 1989, Hurley took electronic music courses at Temple Junior College, which would be the extent of his college education.[5]
An abbreviation of Hurley’s full name, “whurley” was originally Hurley’s Unix username when he was starting out in the open source community.[2][6] He began going by “whurley” professionally in 2002.[5]
Career[edit]
Large corporations and start-ups (1994-09)[edit]
Whurley moved to Austin in 1994 to work at Apple, eventually working in research and development.[7] He left Apple in 1997 for IBM, where he was appointed Master Inventor.[2][8] After leaving IBM in 2000, he worked for a series of start-ups, including security management company Symbiot, which he co-founded and served as chief technology officer from 2003 to 2005; and systems management company Qlusters, where he was CTO from 2005 to 2007.[9] Qlusters closed down a year and a half after his departure.[10] In the summer of 2002, whurley was hired by a resort group to infiltrate a Las Vegas casino's offices in order to perform security audits. This was covered as part of Kevin Mitnick's 2005 nonfiction collection The Art of Intrusion.[11] In 2007, whurley was hired as chief architect of open source at BMC Software, where he remained until 2009.[9]
Chaotic Moon Studios (2010-14)[edit]
In 2010, along with Ben Lamm and Mike Erwin, Whurley founded mobile software design and development company Chaotic Moon Studios.[12] Chaotic Moon has worked with News Corp to develop the first iPad-only digital newspaper The Daily, as well as building applications for Microsoft, CBS Sports, Sanrio, Pizza Hut and others.[12] In 2012, Chaotic Moon purchased whurley’s old company Symbiot.[12]
In 2011, Whurley and Phil Wheat formed a division to focus on developing new technologies, Chaotic Moon Labs.[6] Whurley serves as the division’s general manager,[12] overseeing the development of such products as a Microsoft Kinect-controlled skateboard (which the company named the “Board of Awesomeness”);[13] a skateboard controlled by the user’s mind through a Samsung tablet running Windows 8 (the “Board of Imagination”);[13] a shopping cart that follows a shopper around the store (“The Smarter Cart");[14] and a bicycle helmet fitted with seven cameras that begin recording on impact, functioning like an airplane’s black box in case of a hit-and-run (the “Helmet of Justice”).[15]
In July 2015, Chaotic Moon was acquired by Accenture, a consulting and technology services company.[16]
Honest Dollar (2014-present)[edit]
In 2014, Whurley left Chaotic Moon to co-found Honest Dollar with Henry Yoshida.[17] The Austin-based financial technology company helps set up and maintain employee retirement accounts for small businesses.[18][19] In March 2016, Goldman Sachs announced a deal to acquire Honest Dollar.[20][21]
Equals (2016-present)[edit]
In September 2016, International Telecommunications Union and United Nations Women announced that they had teamed up with whurley to launch Equals: The Global Partnership for Gender Equality in the Digital Age, an organization focused on empowering women across the globe by helping them learn technology skills and find technology-related jobs. At the time of its formation, there were 250 million fewer women online than men. Equals is based at the International Telecommunications Union in Geneva, Switzerland. Whurley put together a team in Austin to help launch the organization.[22][23][24]
Politics[edit]
On March 11, 2016, whurley and rapper/producer will.i.am co-hosted a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at South By Southwest in Austin, featuring President Barack Obama and musical guest J. Cole.[25][26]
Publications and patents[edit]
Whurley has co-written two books, both published in 1996: FreeHand: Graphics Studio Skills (a tutorial on Adobe FreeHand) and 60 Minute Guide to Shockwave (a tutorial on creating movies for the Internet).
Between 2000 and 2004, whurley was issued 11 patents, mostly related to systems management and security.[27]
In 2009, Whurley regularly wrote a blog on cloud computing for InfoWorld[28] and contributed technology articles to Bloomberg Businessweek.[29]
Community involvement[edit]
Whurley co-founded BarCamp Austin in 2006, a technology-related conference which took place around South By Southwest;[30][31] and iPhoneDevCamp (or “developers camp”), which debuted in 2007 as an assembly of 200-300 developers and enthusiasts who were interested in finding new ways to use and hack Apple’s iPhone.[32] It has since expanded to include iOSDevCamp and iPadDevCamp.[33] In the summer of 2013, whurley will be leading the inaugural GlassDevCamp, which will take place in San Francisco and will encourage the development of apps for the Google Glass platform.[34]
In June 2013, British Airways hosted UnGrounded, a group of business leaders and creative thinkers who met to address significant global problems. Whurley was one of 100 passengers to take part in the initiative, which took place on an 11-hour transatlantic flight from Silicon Valley to London. His group worked on strategies for getting more women involved in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). The passengers later presented their ideas as part of an innovation conference held during the 39th G8 summit, as well as to the United Nations' International Telecommunications Union.[35][36]
Film[edit]
In 2012, Whurley began working in film. He served as an associate producer on Pit Stop (2013), directed by Yen Tan. The feature was an official selection of the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.[37][38] That same year, he was executive producer on the short film Sahasi Chori (Brave Girl) (2013), directed by Erin Galey.[39] The film, which explores the sex trafficking industry through the story of a 13-year-old girl from a small village in Nepal who is taken by a con artist to Mumbai’s red light district,[40] was selected for the 2013 South By Southwest ShortCase program[41] and the 2013 Sarasota Film Festival,[42] among others.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
