Personal life[edit]
Williams was born in Fort Mill, South Carolina and moved two months later with his parents to Darlington, South Carolina where he spent his early childhood and youth. He attended the local schools and graduated from St. John's high school. In 1949, Williams married the former Elaine Weaver and they had five children (daughter, Debbie, sons, James E. "Jr.", Stephen Michael, Charles E., and daughter, Gail) and seven grandchildren.
In 1999, Williams died on the Navy's birthday, October 13, and was buried at the Florence National Cemetery in Florence, South Carolina.[2]
Naval service[edit]
Williams enlisted in the United States Navy on August 8, 1947, at the age of 16, and completed basic training at Naval Training Center San Diego. He served for almost twenty years, retiring on April 26, 1967 as a boatswain's mate first class. During those years, he served in both the Korean War and Vietnam War. On May 14, 1968, Williams was presented the Medal of Honor by President Lyndon B. Johnson during the dedication ceremony of the "Hall of Heroes" in the Pentagon.[3] In 1977, he received the honorary title of chief boatswain's mate.[4]
During the Korean War, Williams served aboard the destroyer USS Douglas H. Fox (DD-779) from November 1950 to June 1952. He served off the coast of Korea where he was detached off the destroyer to take raiding parties into North Korea on small boats from March to June 1952.[5]
In Vietnam April 1966, with the enlisted rank of petty officer first class and the rate of boatswain's mate 1st class (BM1), Williams was assigned in May to the River Patrol Force, River Squadron Five, in command of River Patrol Boat 105 (PBR-105).[6] The force's mission was to intercept Viet Cong (VC-Vietnamese Communists) and North Vietnamese arms shipments, supplies, and personnel on the waterways of South Vietnam's Mekong Delta and to keep innocent boat traffic on the river and canals safe.[7]
On October 31, 1966, Williams was commanding PBR 105 alongside another PBR searching for Viet Cong guerrillas operating in an isolated area of the Mekong Delta. Suddenly, Viet Cong manning two sampans opened fire on the Americans. While Williams and his men neutralized one sampan, the other one escaped into a nearby canal. The PBRs gave chase and soon found themselves in a beehive of enemy activity as the VC opened fire on them with rocket propelled grenades and small arms from fortified river bank positions.
Williams repeatedly led the PBRs against concentrations of enemy junks and sampans. He also called for support from the heavily armed UH-1B Huey helicopters of Navy Helicopter Attack (Light) Squadron 3, the "Seawolves." When that help arrived, he kicked off another attack in the failing light. As a result of the three-hour battle, the U.S. naval force killed 1,000 Viet Cong guerrillas, destroyed over fifty vessels, and disrupted a major enemy logistic operation. For his heroic actions on that date he was awarded the Medal of Honor.
U.S. Marshals Service[edit]
After receiving an honorable discharge from the Navy, he became employed with the Wackenhut Corporation. In 1969, he was appointed U. S. Marshal for the District of South Carolina where he served until May 1977. He was then transferred to Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, Glynco, Georgia as an instructor and National Armorer. He was called back to South Carolina in July 1979 under court appointment as U. S. Marshal for South Carolina and served in that position until April 1980. He was then transferred to U. S. Marshal service Headquarters, Washington, D. C. as Programs Manager, Health and Safety and In-District Training Officer where he served until his retirement from the U. S. Marshals Service with the grade of GS-1811-15.

Medal of Honor citation[edit]

Rank and organization: Boatswain's Mate First Class (PO1c.), United States Navy, River Section 531, My Tho, RVN, Place and date: Mekong River, Republic of Vietnam, October 31, 1966. Entered service at: Columbia, S.C. Born: June 13, 1930, Rock Hill, S.C.
CITATION:
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. BM1 Williams was serving as Boat Captain and Patrol Officer aboard River Patrol Boat (PBR) 105 accompanied by another patrol boat when the patrol was suddenly taken under fire by 2 enemy sampans. BM1 Williams immediately ordered the fire returned, killing the crew of 1 enemy boat and causing the other sampan to take refuge in a nearby river inlet. Pursuing the fleeing sampan, the U.S. patrol encountered a heavy volume of small-arms fire from enemy forces, at close range, occupying well-concealed positions along the river bank. Maneuvering through this fire, the patrol confronted a numerically superior enemy force aboard 2 enemy junks and 8 sampans augmented by heavy automatic weapons fire from ashore. In the savage battle that ensued, BM1 Williams, with utter disregard for his safety exposed himself to the withering hail of enemy fire to direct counter-fire and inspire the actions of his patrol. Recognizing the overwhelming strength of the enemy force, BM1 Williams deployed his patrol to await the arrival of armed helicopters. In the course of his movement he discovered an even larger concentration of enemy boats. Not waiting for the arrival of the armed helicopters, he displayed great initiative and boldly led the patrol through the intense enemy fire and damaged or destroyed 50 enemy sampans and 7 junks. This phase of the action completed, and with the arrival of the armed helicopters, BM1 Williams directed the attack on the remaining enemy force. Now virtually dark, and although BM1 Williams was aware that his boats would become even better targets, he ordered the patrol boats' search lights turned on to better illuminate the area and moved the patrol perilously close to shore to press the attack. Despite a waning supply of ammunition the patrol successfully engaged the enemy ashore and completed the rout of the enemy force. Under the leadership of BM1 Williams, who demonstrated unusual professional skill and indomitable courage throughout the 3 hour battle, the patrol accounted for the destruction or loss of 65 enemy boats and inflicted numerous casualties on the enemy personnel. His extraordinary heroism and exemplary fighting spirit in the face of grave risks inspired the efforts of his men to defeat a larger enemy force, and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.

Medal of Honor citation[edit]

Rank and organization: Boatswain's Mate First Class (PO1c.), United States Navy, River Section 531, My Tho, RVN, Place and date: Mekong River, Republic of Vietnam, October 31, 1966. Entered service at: Columbia, S.C. Born: June 13, 1930, Rock Hill, S.C.
CITATION:
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. BM1 Williams was serving as Boat Captain and Patrol Officer aboard River Patrol Boat (PBR) 105 accompanied by another patrol boat when the patrol was suddenly taken under fire by 2 enemy sampans. BM1 Williams immediately ordered the fire returned, killing the crew of 1 enemy boat and causing the other sampan to take refuge in a nearby river inlet. Pursuing the fleeing sampan, the U.S. patrol encountered a heavy volume of small-arms fire from enemy forces, at close range, occupying well-concealed positions along the river bank. Maneuvering through this fire, the patrol confronted a numerically superior enemy force aboard 2 enemy junks and 8 sampans augmented by heavy automatic weapons fire from ashore. In the savage battle that ensued, BM1 Williams, with utter disregard for his safety exposed himself to the withering hail of enemy fire to direct counter-fire and inspire the actions of his patrol. Recognizing the overwhelming strength of the enemy force, BM1 Williams deployed his patrol to await the arrival of armed helicopters. In the course of his movement he discovered an even larger concentration of enemy boats. Not waiting for the arrival of the armed helicopters, he displayed great initiative and boldly led the patrol through the intense enemy fire and damaged or destroyed 50 enemy sampans and 7 junks. This phase of the action completed, and with the arrival of the armed helicopters, BM1 Williams directed the attack on the remaining enemy force. Now virtually dark, and although BM1 Williams was aware that his boats would become even better targets, he ordered the patrol boats' search lights turned on to better illuminate the area and moved the patrol perilously close to shore to press the attack. Despite a waning supply of ammunition the patrol successfully engaged the enemy ashore and completed the rout of the enemy force. Under the leadership of BM1 Williams, who demonstrated unusual professional skill and indomitable courage throughout the 3 hour battle, the patrol accounted for the destruction or loss of 65 enemy boats and inflicted numerous casualties on the enemy personnel. His extraordinary heroism and exemplary fighting spirit in the face of grave risks inspired the efforts of his men to defeat a larger enemy force, and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.

Personal life[edit]
Williams was born in Fort Mill, South Carolina and moved two months later with his parents to Darlington, South Carolina where he spent his early childhood and youth. He attended the local schools and graduated from St. John's high school. In 1949, Williams married the former Elaine Weaver and they had five children (daughter, Debbie, sons, James E. "Jr.", Stephen Michael, Charles E., and daughter, Gail) and seven grandchildren.
In 1999, Williams died on the Navy's birthday, October 13, and was buried at the Florence National Cemetery in Florence, South Carolina.[2]
Naval service[edit]
Williams enlisted in the United States Navy on August 8, 1947, at the age of 16, and completed basic training at Naval Training Center San Diego. He served for almost twenty years, retiring on April 26, 1967 as a boatswain's mate first class. During those years, he served in both the Korean War and Vietnam War. On May 14, 1968, Williams was presented the Medal of Honor by President Lyndon B. Johnson during the dedication ceremony of the "Hall of Heroes" in the Pentagon.[3] In 1977, he received the honorary title of chief boatswain's mate.[4]
During the Korean War, Williams served aboard the destroyer USS Douglas H. Fox (DD-779) from November 1950 to June 1952. He served off the coast of Korea where he was detached off the destroyer to take raiding parties into North Korea on small boats from March to June 1952.[5]
In Vietnam April 1966, with the enlisted rank of petty officer first class and the rate of boatswain's mate 1st class (BM1), Williams was assigned in May to the River Patrol Force, River Squadron Five, in command of River Patrol Boat 105 (PBR-105).[6] The force's mission was to intercept Viet Cong (VC-Vietnamese Communists) and North Vietnamese arms shipments, supplies, and personnel on the waterways of South Vietnam's Mekong Delta and to keep innocent boat traffic on the river and canals safe.[7]
On October 31, 1966, Williams was commanding PBR 105 alongside another PBR searching for Viet Cong guerrillas operating in an isolated area of the Mekong Delta. Suddenly, Viet Cong manning two sampans opened fire on the Americans. While Williams and his men neutralized one sampan, the other one escaped into a nearby canal. The PBRs gave chase and soon found themselves in a beehive of enemy activity as the VC opened fire on them with rocket propelled grenades and small arms from fortified river bank positions.
Williams repeatedly led the PBRs against concentrations of enemy junks and sampans. He also called for support from the heavily armed UH-1B Huey helicopters of Navy Helicopter Attack (Light) Squadron 3, the "Seawolves." When that help arrived, he kicked off another attack in the failing light. As a result of the three-hour battle, the U.S. naval force killed 1,000 Viet Cong guerrillas, destroyed over fifty vessels, and disrupted a major enemy logistic operation. For his heroic actions on that date he was awarded the Medal of Honor.
U.S. Marshals Service[edit]
After receiving an honorable discharge from the Navy, he became employed with the Wackenhut Corporation. In 1969, he was appointed U. S. Marshal for the District of South Carolina where he served until May 1977. He was then transferred to Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, Glynco, Georgia as an instructor and National Armorer. He was called back to South Carolina in July 1979 under court appointment as U. S. Marshal for South Carolina and served in that position until April 1980. He was then transferred to U. S. Marshal service Headquarters, Washington, D. C. as Programs Manager, Health and Safety and In-District Training Officer where he served until his retirement from the U. S. Marshals Service with the grade of GS-1811-15.

"Your best bet to beat pandemic influenza is to educate yourself, develop a personal preparedness plan, protect your family, use prescription and over-the-counter drugs wisely, and learn to beat the flu naturally when it comes."
From BEATING THE FLU
By J. E. Williams, O.M.D.


Supplements & ProductsWELCOME! How to Order Professional Quality Supplements;
This page is intended for patients by referral or under the care and guidance of Dr. Williams.WHAT ARE THE BEST SOURCES FOR NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS? Finding the best nutritional products at the lowest price is not easy. But after twenty-five years of clinical experience in natural medicine, I've found the ultimate sources. Each supplies a wide-range of the highest quality nutritional supplements and natural medications. WHAT MAKES THESE COMPANIES BETTER? To meet my professional standards, each company must meet the following criteria:Provide services and products only to licensed healthcare professionals and pharmacies.Provide product specifications and detail sheet, preferably by an independent laboratory and not marketing or informational material, including purity, fillers, and additive on every product upon request.Provide professional technical consulting by a doctoral level scientist or physician, not a customer service or sales representative, five days a week during normal business hours.Provide accurate labeling of all active ingredients, extract percentages if applicable, and amounts on the label.Provide expiration dates either labeled on products or upon request.

USS James E. Williams DDG-95
The USS James E. Williams (DDG-95) holds an important place in defending American interests and protecting freedom across the globe. As an Arleigh Burke class destroyer for the US Navy, she is impressively equipped to succeed in even the most demanding of missions.
The USS James E. Williams is named after Boatswain’s Mate 1st Class James Elliot Williams, the most highly decorated enlisted man in the history of the United States Navy. BM1 Williams earned the Medal of Honor and Navy Cross when he led two River Patrol Boats into battle with the Vietcong during a routine patrol and, due to his exemplary leadership and technical prowess, led his small contingent to sink 65 enemy ships and route the superior force.
Commissioned on 11 December 2004, the USS James E. Williams has a displacement of approximately 9,200 long tons and stretches some 510 feet in length. Armed with naval guns and anti-air, anti-surface, and anti-submarine missiles, plus other weapons, she is equipped for surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, and anti-submarine warfare. She also is the home for two SH-60 Sea Hawk helicopters.
Minted in the USA from solid bronze, using special deep-relief coining dies, and hand-finished with an antique patina for exceptional quality and detail, this coin pays tribute to the USS James E. Williams and salutes the exceptional service of her crew. The obverse contains a montage of the ship’s namesake, BM1 James E. Williams, with the Navy Cross above all, and a starboard view of the USS James E. Williams cutting through the water. The reverse displays the seal of the USS James E. Williams.

Additional Information



Product Description
We are happy to offer an authentic 5 panel custom US Navy destroyer DDG 95 USS James E Williams embroidered hat.
For an additional (and optional) charge of $7.00, our hats can be personalized with up to 2 lines of text of 14 characters each (including spaces), such as with a veteran’s last name and rate and rank on the first line, and years of service on the second line.
Our DDG 95 USS James E Williams hat comes in two styles for your choosing. A traditional “high profile” flat bill snap back style (with an authentic green under visor on the bottom of the flat bill), or a modern “medium profile” curved bill velcro back “baseball cap” style. Both styles are “one size fits all”. Our hats are made of durable 100% cotton for breathability and comfort.
Given high embroidery demands on these “made to order” hats, please allow 4 weeks for shipment.

 If you have any questions about our hat offerings, please contact us at 904-425-1204 or e-mail us at [email protected], and we will be happy to speak to you!
