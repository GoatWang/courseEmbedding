Edward F. Crawford
2014 Person of the Year






The Mayo Society of Greater Cleveland has set a new standard for inclusion by changing our bylaws. For the first time ever, a person without Mayo roots has been named Person of the Year – Edward F. Crawford.
When asked what this award means to him, the 2014 Person of the Year, Edward F. Crawford, said “I think it’s a wonderful, wonderful decision by the Mayo Society to step out and decide to be more inclusive here. There are other great Counties in Ireland. I think it gives the Mayo Society the opportunity to reach out to a broader group of individuals that, in one way or another, have contributed to the Irish sense of themselves.” And then, tongue-in-cheek, he added “I think they made the right decision in picking a Corkman I have to say.”
Crawford, a self-professed “serial entrepreneur”, is Chairman and CEO of ParkOhio Holdings Corp. and The Crawford Group, both headquartered in Cleveland. With $1.4 billion in sales world- wide, they employ 4,800 associates the U.S., China, Japan, India, Australia and Ireland. ParkOhio specializes in integrated logistics systems and manufactured products.
Committed to a balanced life of commercial activity, civic responsibility and political action he is best described by this writer as a man who knows what to do with his time and money. He wasn’t born with the proverbial “silver spoon” in his mouth. He knows where he’s from. And, from a geographical standpoint, that would be Manhattan.
In 1948 his electrician father bundled his wife and three sons up and off they headed to sunny California. A couple days later, as they were traveling on Route 20 in Ohio, the engine in their truck blew up. Within a day his mother located an apartment for the family in Cleveland Heights and California became a faded dream. And the family took root in Ohio.
An imaginative man with a sixth sense, his most recent activity in Cleveland’s Irish community has been the founding of the Irish Garden Club and the resultant restoration of Cleveland’s four acre Irish Cultural Garden. Under his leadership, the garden has become the jewel of Irish Cleveland.
As he drove on Martin Luther King Boulevard a few years ago, Crawford was shocked to see the deterioration of the Irish Garden. “I couldn’t believe it. The stones were upturned, the grass wasn’t getting cut regularly – it looked pretty beat up.” He remembered all of Cleveland’s ethnic Cultural Gardens and the boathouse that was located on what was then Liberty Blvd. “Growing up in Cleveland Heights in the 50s and 60s, the gardens were still in pretty good order. They reflected the diversity of Cleveland and I thought it was very special.” A couple weeks after first witnessing the deterioration he saw some volunteers working in the Irish Garden as he again drove by. He got out of his car and spoke with them. “After that I got on the phone and called some friends and that’s when I formed the Irish Garden Club.
At a breakfast meeting the process was begun to do the necessary fund-raising to get our garden back to the grand stature it was at one time. We really hoped that by getting it in ship-shape to where it was originally that maybe it would interest those responsible for other ethnic gardens along MLK Boulevard to do the same.” And that has happened in a big way. “As far as I can deter- mine it’s been about four million dollars invested in those other gardens,” he said.
The final jewel has been the construction of a fountain in the garden. While in Dublin on business he saw a beautiful fountain out- side in the garden of St. Patrick’s Church. Fascinated by, it he approached the Fred Lennon foundation about funding an effort to get a duplicate fountain built for Cleveland’s Irish Garden.
“I grew up with the Lennon family and they have never sought any public recognition in any way.” Crawford was able to convince their Fred Lennon Foundation to invest in the Irish Garden. The result is the spectacular fountain.  Crawford says Phase One has now been completed. “Phase Two is maintaining it at the level that we expect.” He gives credit to “a lot of volunteers; a lot of contributions. Everyone shares it; a lot of great people….surely it’s the greenest garden.”
Crawford’s grandparents both emigrated from Cork. His grandmother, Catherine McCarthy, was from New Market, Boherbue. His grandfather Healy was a Corkman. “We have plenty of Crawford and Hennessey first cousins there yet,” he added.
Ed and Mary Crawford take tremendous pride in their son Matthew. A Marshall Law School graduate, he is engaged in the succession of the family business. “Succession in America is very difficult but Matthew is transitioning ParkOhio with wonderful people we’ve brought aboard. They are taking us into the future.

PARK-OHIO INDUSTRIES, INC.





 > Encyclopedia of Cleveland History > Articles > P > PARK-OHIO INDUSTRIES, INC.









PARK-OHIO INDUSTRIES, INC., a diversified manufacturer engaged in energy development and the production of forged and machined products, induction heating systems, containers, industrial rubber products, and metal abrasives, was formed in 1967 by the merger of Park Drop Forge Co. and the Ohio Crankshaft Co.
Park Drop Forge was incorporated on May 27, 1907, to make closed die forgings for crankshafts, camshafts, and other parts for trucks, buses, and later diesel locomotives. Dwight Goddard was president of Park Drop Forge and the company's plant was located at 777 E. 79th St. Ohio Crankshaft was incorporated in 1920 by William C. Dunn to manufacture crankshafts and camshafts for diesel engines. In 1922, Ohio Crankshaft moved into facilities at 6600 Clement Ave., and in the 1930s, the company added two additional plants nearby and a fourth facility at 3900 Harvard Ave. Ohio Crankshaft developed a process that used high-frequency electrical current to heat, harden, or melt metals, which the company utilized in the production of the firm's crankshafts and camshafts. By 1967, Ohio Crankshaft had 2,500 employees, $42 million in annual sales, and a net income of $1.8 million. Park Drop Forge also to continued to grow and prior to the merger, the firm already owned 50% of Ohio Crankshaft. Shortly after the merger of the two firms in 1967, Park-Ohio acquired Growth Intl., Inc., which operated Discount Centers., Inc., and the entire organization took the name Park-Ohio Industries, Inc., in May 1972. Over the next two decades, Park-Ohio diversified by adding industrial plastics and rubber manufacturing as well as induction heating systems to its original forge, crankshaft, and camshaft products. These changes, expanded the company's emphasis from auto-parts to products for aerospace and housewares.
The new firm prospered until the recession in the 1980s, when management asked Ohio Crankshaft members of the UNITED AUTO WORKERS to take a cut in pay and fewer holidays. By this time, the division's employment had dropped from 800 workers in 1977 to 480 in 1980 to just 102 in July 1983. The workers refused any further concessions and, instead, walked out on a strike which lasted 9 years; the longest in UAW history. In a five-year period (1987 - 1992) during the strike, Park-Ohio lost nearly $50 million. In 1992 alone, Park-Ohio reported a net loss of nearly $34.5 million and after a struggle with management, Edward F. Crawford (the company's largest investor) gained control of the firm and was appointed chairman of Park Ohio in June 1992. Under Crawford's leadership, the company would return to profitability after the company ended its struggle with striking UAW workers in June 1992; signing a new three-year agreement. The following year, Park-Ohio-which had annual sales of $120 million-purchased the 122-year-old Cleveland City Forge Co. for $1.8 million. The company continued to acquire new operations and by 1993, Park-Ohio purchased the plastic container division of Cleveland Steel Container, the General Aluminum Manufacturing Co., and Kay Home Products, a maker of barbecue grills, lawn care equipment, and patio furniture. These purchases represented not only a new commitment to diversification through acquisition, but also Crawford's control over the firm for he has previously owned Kay Home Products, the Cleveland Steel Container, Co., and the General Aluminum Manufacturing Co. By 1994, Crawford owned nearly 25% of Park-Ohio. The acquisition of the RB&W Corp.- a leading maker of industrial fasteners- added its annual sales of $162 million to Park-Ohio's total revenues of $348 million in 1996. In 1995, Park-Ohio moved its headquarters in SHAKER HEIGHTS to TRW, Inc.'s former headquarters at 23555 EUCLID AVE. in EUCLID . By 1998, Park-Ohio spun off its fastener businesses, which included RB&W and Arden Industrial Products (acquired the previous year). The new company, called Integrated Logistics Solutions, Inc., had annual sales of $350 million. By June of that year, Park-Ohio Industries became a subsidiary of the newly formed Park-Ohio Holdings Corp., which signaled the company's clear commitment to acquire more companies. By 2003, Park-Ohio employed 2,500 nationally and had total annual sales of $624.3 million. Edward Crawford was chairman and CEO of the company, which was headquartered at 23000 Euclid Ave.

Ferguson Protester Edward Crawford, Subject of Iconic Photo, Found Dead

 Edward Crawford, a St. Louis resident who was the subject of an iconic photo epitomizing the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri, is dead. 
 Crawford was photographed throwing a flaming tear gas canister in an image broadcast widely during the months of unrest that followed the fatal shooting of Michael Brown Jr. by a police officer. 
 His death was confirmed to NBC News by the St. Louis Office of the Medical Examiner. Investigator Rose Psara said Crawford was pronounced deceased shortly before midnight on Thursday at 1435 Salisbury Street in the Hyde Park neighborhood.

 The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department told NBC News that Crawford shot himself in the backseat of a car while it was moving, according to two witnesses who were seated in the front of the car.

 "The victim began expressing he was distraught over personal matters to the witnesses," said the police department's Public Information Officer Leah Freeman. "The witnesses heard the victim rummaging in the backseat, then heard a gunshot and observed the victim had sustained a gunshot wound to the head." 
 Crawford was pronounced dead on the scene. Police said an investigation is ongoing and, while initially declared a suicide, the official cause of death will be determined by an autopsy.

 According to his father, Edward Crawford Sr., the 27-year-old was the father of four young children, had just gotten a new apartment, and was training for a warehouse job. 
 "I don't believe it was a suicide," the senior Crawford told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which first reported the death on Friday morning.

 It's not the first time a notable Ferguson protester has died from gunfire. 
 In September 2016, the body of Ferguson activist Darren Seals was discovered inside a burning car. Seals had been shot, and police declared the death a homicide.

 In November 2014 on the night a grand jury declined to convict the Ferguson police officer who fatally shot Brown, 20-year-old Deandre Joshua was found shot in the head with severe burns after being lit on fire. Like Seals, Joshua was discovered dead in his own car. 
 NBC News sent several requests for comment about the death of Edward Crawford to the St. Louis Police Department but did not receive a response. 
 It is unclear where Crawford's body was found. 
 On social media, notable leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement and the St. Louis community mourned Crawford's death. 
 Missouri State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal said that Crawford was a local hero after he famously picked up the tear gas canister and threw it out of the way of protesters. 

Edward Crawford is dead. Found in his car shot to death. He is #Ferguson's hero. For those of us tear-gassed, he was our local champion. RIP pic.twitter.com/RHtBEB174G— MariaChappelleNadal (@MariaChappelleN) May 5, 2017 

 In the photograph, which won the Pulitzer Prize for breaking news photography in 2015, Crawford appeared to be throwing the canister back at police while wearing a shirt emblazoned with an American flag. The photo came to symbolize anger at police killings of unarmed black youth. 
 He was later charged for assault and for interfering with a police officer in relation to the tear gas incident. 
 Crawford posted a photo on his Twitter profile in September 2015 showing him posing next to his iconic image at the offices of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 

@kodacohen very successful interview! #fanofafan #iconic #neverforget pic.twitter.com/HdYNdkszEG— That's that one dude (@eyeFLOODpanties) September 29, 2015 

 But Crawford told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2015 that he was trying to protect people from the tear gas. and that police were 30 or 40 yards away: "“I can’t even throw a baseball that far, let alone a burning can of tear gas." 
 "I didn’t throw a burning can back at police," said Crawford. "I threw it out of the way of children."
