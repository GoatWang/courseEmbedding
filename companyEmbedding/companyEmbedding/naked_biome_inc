Naked Biome is a microbiome-based therapeutics company developing bacterial probiotic therapies for the treatment of skin diseases, with a current focus in acne.
Location:
JLABS @ QB3



Problem:
Naked Biome is developing antibiotic alternatives to combat global antibiotic resistance and identify novel therapeutic opportunities to treat skin disease. The company is currently focusing on developing a live biologic therapeutic to treat and prevent acne. 

Solution:
Many bacterial-based acne therapies still kill Propionibacterium acnes, and function as biologic antibiotics. They are subject to the same selective pressures as conventional antibiotics that lead to resistance. Instead of killing Propionibacterium acnes, Naked Biome is redelivering a continuous supply of healthy Propionibacterium acnes with the goal of outcompeting and replacing pathogenic strains and restoring a healthy microbiome.

Passion:
Live biologic therapeutics have the potential to redefine how we treat and manage skin disease.  The potential to eliminate heavy dependence on antibiotics would be paradigm shifting. 

	Meet the team:

Emma Taylor, MD - CoFounder and CEO
