(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Mewbourne Energy Partners 08-A, L.P. ("the Partnership") was formed March 7, 2008. The offering of limited and general partnership interests began May 1, 2008 and concluded August 4, 2008, with total investor contributions of $73,000,000. During 2010, all general partner equity interests were converted to limited partner equity interests.  Future capital requirements and operations will be conducted with available funds generated from oil and gas activities. No bank borrowing is anticipated. The Partnership had net working capital of $281,841 at June 30, 2016.  The Partnership had reduced cash flows from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to the steep decline in oil and gas prices during the previous twelve months. Considering these reduced operating cashflows, the Partnership anticipates smaller distributions until prices improve.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership made cash distributions to the investor partners in the amount of $440,565 as compared to $1,013,932 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Since inception, the Partnership has made distributions of $67,762,153, inclusive of state tax payments.  The sale of crude oil and natural gas produced by the Partnership will be affected by a number of factors that are beyond the Partnership's control. These factors include the price of crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating supply of and demand for these products, competitive fuels, refining, transportation, extensive federal and state regulations governing the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, and other competitive conditions. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the future effect of these factors on the Partnership.  Results of Operations For the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015: Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 2015 Oil sales $ 271,148 $ 428,855 Barrels produced 6,882 8,482 Average price/bbl $ 39.40 $ 50.56 Gas sales $ 354,598 $ 481,904 Mcf produced 165,899 175,929 Average price/mcf $ 2.14 $ 2.74  Oil and gas revenues. As shown in the above table, total oil and gas sales decreased by $285,013, a 31.3% decline, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.  Of this decline, $94,668 and $105,868 were due to decreases in the average prices of oil and gas sold, respectively. The average price fell to $39.40 from $50.56 per barrel (bbl) and to $2.14 from $2.74 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.  Also contributing to the decline in sales were $63,039 and $21,438 due to lower volumes of oil and gas sold, respectively, by 1,600 bbls and 10,030 mcf.  Lease operations. Lease operating expense during the three month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $275,140 from $323,837 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 due to fewer well repairs and workovers.  Production taxes. Production taxes during the three month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $36,384 from $54,809 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 due to lower overall oil and gas revenue.  Administrative and general expense. Administrative and general expense for the three month period ended June 30, 2016 fell to $45,288 from $59,132 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 due to decreased administrative expenses allocable to the Partnership.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for the three month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $161,899 from $471,252 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015. This was due to the overall decrease in oil and gas production.  Cost ceiling write-down. There were cost ceiling write-downs of $113,400 and $6,145,004 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These were due to lower average oil and gas prices for the twelve months preceding each write-down.  Results of Operations For the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015: Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 2015 Oil sales $ 457,455 $ 817,497 Barrels produced 13,348 16,785 Average price/bbl $ 34.27 $ 48.70 Gas sales $ 673,518 $ 995,880 Mcf produced 330,851 337,394 Average price/mcf $ 2.04 $ 2.95  Oil and gas revenues. As shown in the above table, total oil and gas sales decreased by $682,404, a 37.6% decline, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Of this decline, $242,251 and $309,042 were due to decreases in the average prices of oil and gas sold, respectively. The average price fell to $34.27 from $48.70 per barrel (bbl) and to $2.04 from $2.95 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Also contributing to the decline in sales were $117,791 and $13,320 due to lower volumes of oil and gas sold, respectively, by 3,437 bbls and 6,543 mcf.  Lease operations. Lease operating expense during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $627,163 from $733,610 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 due to fewer well repairs and workovers.  Production taxes. Production taxes during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $62,287 from $113,313 for the six month period ended June 30, 2015 due to lower overall oil and gas revenue.  Administrative and general expense. Administrative and general expense for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 fell to $79,008 from $115,485 for the six month period ended June 30, 2015 due to decreased administrative expenses allocable to the Partnership.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $344,013 from $898,901 for the six month period ended June 30, 2015. This was due to the overall decrease in oil and gas production.  Cost ceiling write-down. There were cost ceiling write-downs totaling $876,016 and $9,586,869 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(Unaudited)



	 





	1.




	Accounting Policies






	Reference is hereby made to the Registrants
	Annual Report on Form 10, which contains a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Partnership in the preparation of its financial statements. These policies are also followed in preparing the quarterly report included herein.




	In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary to present
	fairly our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and partners capital for the periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the final results expected for the full year.
	We have evaluated the impact on these condensed financial statements of all subsequent events through August 14, 2009, the date the financial statements were issued.




	Recent Accounting Pronouncement SFAS No. 165  In May 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 165, Subsequent Events (SFAS No. 165). SFAS
	No. 165 establishes the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. It requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has
	evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date; that is, whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued. Consistent with SFAS No. 165, we evaluate subsequent events through the
	date the financial statements are issued. SFAS No. 165 should not result in significant changes in the subsequent events that an entity reports, either through recognition or disclosure, in its financial statements. SFAS No. 165 is
	effective for reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 165 on June 15, 2009 did not impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See the above paragraph for the related disclosure.

	Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities






	Mewbourne Energy Partners
	08-A, L.P., (the Registrant or the Partnership), a Delaware limited partnership engaged primarily in oil and gas development and production in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, was organized on March 7, 2008. The offering
	of limited and general partner interests began May 1, 2008 as a part of a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, and concluded August 4, 2008, with total
	investor contributions of $73,000,000 originally being sold to accredited investors of which $68,105,000 were sold to accredited investors as general partner interests and $4,895,000 were sold to accredited investors as limited partner interests.
	The managing general partner, Mewbourne Development Corporation (MD), has no significant equity interest in the Partnership.




	The Partnership
	follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized.
	Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas properties. At June 30, 2009, approximately $2.9
	million of capitalized costs were excluded from amortization. Proceeds from the sale or other disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains and losses on the sale or other disposition of properties are not recognized unless
	such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas reserves. Capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of
	future net cash flows of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties. There was a cost ceiling write-down of $12,496,218 at March 31, 2009 but none at June 30, 2009. There were no cost ceiling write-downs
	during the period from March 7, 2008 (date of inception) through June 30, 2008.

	Table of Contents






	3.




	Asset Retirement Obligations






	The Partnership has recognized an estimated
	liability for future plugging and abandonment costs. The estimated liability is based on historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to the liability could occur due
	to changes in well ownership interests, well plugging and abandonment costs or well useful lives, or if federal or state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the
	discounted liability over the remaining life of the well.




	A reconciliation of the Partnerships liability for well plugging and abandonment costs for
	the six months ended June 30, 2009 and the period from March 7, 2008 (date of inception) through December 31, 2008 is as follows:

	Related Party Transactions






	In accordance with the laws of the State of
	Delaware, Mewbourne Development Corporation (MD), a Delaware Corporation, has been appointed as the Partnerships managing general partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Partnership. Mewbourne Oil Company
	(MOC) is operator of oil and gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc. is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions are with MD and MOC.




	In the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that will be passed on to owners of the well for which the costs were incurred. The Partnership will
	receive their portion of these costs based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include recovery of gas
	marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision, pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator. Services and operator charges are billed in accordance with the program and partnership agreements.




	In consideration for services rendered by MD in managing the business of the Partnership, the Partnership during each of the initial three years of the Partnership will
	pay to MD a management fee in the amount equal to .7% of the subscriptions by the investor partners to the Partnership. The Partnership will include the management fee as part of the full cost pool pursuant to 4-10(c)(2) of Regulation S-X.




	In general, during any particular calendar year the total amount of administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall not exceed the
	greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnerships gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000 plus
	.25% of the capital contributions of limited and general partners.

	Table of Contents




	The Partnership participates in oil and gas activities through a Drilling Program Agreement (the Program).
	The Partnership and MD are parties to the Program. The costs and revenues of the Program are allocated to MD and the Partnership as follows:

	(1)    Pursuant to the Program, MD must contribute 100% of organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs which should approximate 20% of total capital costs. To the extent that
	organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs are less than 20% of total capital costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its share of the Programs total capital costs reaches approximately 20%. The
	Partnerships financial statements reflect its respective proportionate interest in the Program.






	           






	 





	5.




	Legal Proceedings






	MOC filed suit on March 9, 2009 in the U.S. District
	Court, Tyler Division, seeking a judicial declaration of its rights under a drilling contract with defendant Zenith Drilling Corporation. MOC contends that the contract releases it from any claim for damage to Zeniths drilling rig from a fire
	that occurred on January 9, 2009 during drilling operations on the Leslie Webb No. 1893 well in which the Partnership owns an interest. Zenith filed its Answer and Counterclaim on April 2, 2009, disputing MOCs interpretation of the contract,
	claiming that MOC is liable to pay Zenith for damage to its drilling rig.




	MOC intends to defend against Zeniths claims vigorously. Because the case
	has just begun, it is not appropriate to predict its outcome at this time. In any event, we believe that the eventual outcome of the case will not have a material impact on the Partnerships financial position.

	Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations







	Liquidity and Capital Resources





	Mewbourne Energy Partners 08-A, L.P. (the Partnership) was formed
	March 7, 2008. The offering of limited and general partnership interests began May 1, 2008 and concluded August 4, 2008, with total investor contributions of $73,000,000.




	The Registrant owns fractional working interests in developmental oil and gas prospects, which has resulted in participation in the drilling of oil and gas wells. At June 30, 2009, the Registrant owned working
	interests in ninety-two producing wells.




	Future capital requirements and operations will be conducted with available funds generated from oil and gas
	activities. No bank borrowing is anticipated. The Partnership had net working capital of $18,966,893 at June 30, 2009.




	During the six months ended
	June 30, 2009, the Partnership made cash distributions to the investor partners in the amount of $5,280,000. The Partnership expects that cash distributions will continue during 2009 as additional oil and gas revenues are sufficient to produce
	cash flows from operations.




	The sale of crude oil and natural gas produced by the Partnership will be affected by a number of factors that are beyond the
	Partnerships control. These factors include the price of crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating supply of and demand for these products, competitive fuels, refining, transportation, extensive federal and state regulations governing the
	production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, and other competitive conditions. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the future effect of these factors on the Partnership.





	Results of Operations





	Revenues and other income for the three month period ended June 30, 2009 totaled
	$3,426,128, and consisted of oil and gas sales of $3,424,868 and interest income of $1,260.




	Production volumes for the three month period ended
	June 30, 2009 were approximately 32,534 bbls of oil and 484,860 mcf of gas at corresponding average realized prices of $54.08 per bbl of oil and $3.43 per mcf of gas.




	Expenses for the three month period ended June 30, 2009 totaled $1,707,666, consisting of lease operating expenses in the amount of $237,835, production taxes of $207,385, depreciation, depletion, and
	amortization of $1,168,928, administrative and general expenses of $87,489 and asset retirement obligation accretion of $6,029. This resulted in net income for the three month period ended June 30, 2009 of $1,718,462.




	Revenues and other income for the six month period ended June 30, 2009 totaled $5,727,423, and consisted of oil and gas sales of $5,721,682 and interest income of
	$5,741.




	Production volumes for the six month period ended June 30, 2009 were approximately 55,700 bbls of oil and 782,887 mcf of gas at corresponding
	average realized prices of $47.11 per bbl of oil and $3.96 per mcf of gas.




	Expenses for the six month period ended June 30, 2009 totaled $15,806,827,
	consisting of lease operating expenses in the amount of $469,686, production taxes of $343,616, depreciation, depletion, and amortization of $2,365,566, administrative and general expenses of $121,560, and asset retirement obligation accretion of
	$10,181. In addition, there was a cost ceiling write-down of $12,496,218 at March 31, 2009 due to lower oil and gas prices on that date. This resulted in a net loss for the six month period ended June 30, 2009 of $10,079,404.




	 




	10







	Table of Contents




	The Partnerships oil and gas production should increase during the remainder of 2009 as additional wells are
	completed and oil and gas production is sold. Interest income should decrease in 2009 as available cash is utilized for drilling and equipping of wells.




	The Partnerships operations did not commence until the third quarter of 2008. Therefore, no corresponding activities occurred during the period from January 1, 2008 through June 30, 2008.




	 









	Item 3.




	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk





	 





	1.




	Interest Rate Risk






	The Partnership Agreement allows borrowings from banks
	or other financial sources of up to 20% of the total capital contributions to the Partnership without investor approval. Should the Partnership elect to borrow monies for additional development activity on Partnership properties, it will be subject
	to the interest rate risk inherent in borrowing activities. Changes in interest rates could significantly affect the Partnerships results of operations and the amount of net cash flow available for partner distributions. Also, to the extent
	that changes in interest rates affect general economic conditions, the Partnership will be affected by such changes.



	 





	2.




	Commodity Price Risk






	The Partnership does not expect to engage in
	commodity futures trading or hedging activities or enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for trading or other speculative purposes. The Partnership currently expects to sell a significant amount of its production from
	successful oil and gas wells on a month-to-month basis at market prices. Accordingly, the Partnership is at risk for the volatility in commodity prices inherent in the oil and gas industry, and the level of commodity prices will have a significant
	impact on the Partnerships results of operations. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, a 10% change in the price received for natural gas production would have had an approximate $310,000 impact on revenue.



	 





	3.




	Exchange Rate Risk






	The Partnership currently has no income from foreign
	sources or operations in foreign countries that would subject it to currency exchange rate risk. The Partnership does not currently expect to purchase any prospects located outside of either the United States or United States coastal waters in the
	Gulf of Mexico.




	 









	Item 4.




	Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	MD maintains a system of controls and
	procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the financial statements and other disclosures included in this report, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. MDs Chief Executive
	Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures with the assistance and participation of other members of management. Based upon that evaluation, MDs
	Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures are effective for gathering, analyzing and disclosing the information the Partnership is required to disclose in the reports it files under the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934 within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms.

PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 

Mewbourne Energy Partners 02-A, L.P. (the "Registrant") is a limited partnership
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 27, 2002 (date of 
inception). Its managing general partner is Mewbourne Development Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("MD").                                                    

A Registration Statement was filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as   
amended, registering limited and general partnership interests in a series of   
two Delaware limited partnerships formed under Mewbourne Energy 02-03 Drilling  
Programs. General and limited partnership interests are being offered at $1,000 
each. The maximum offering amount will be $18,000,000 (18,000 interests) per    
partnership. The Registrant was declared effective by the Securities and        
Exchange Commission on June 26, 2002. On October 10, 2002, the offering of      
limited and general partnership interests in the Registrant was closed, with    
interests aggregating $16,072,000 being sold to 647 subscribers of which        
$14,642,000 were sold to 596 subscribers as general partner interests and       
$1,430,000 were sold to 51 subscribers as limited partner interests.            

The Registrant engages primarily in oil and gas development and production and  
is not involved in any other industry segment. See the selected financial data  
in Item 6 and the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a summary of
the Registrant's revenue, income and identifiable assets.                       

The Registrant has acquired interests in oil and gas prospects for the purpose  
of development drilling. At December 31, 2002, 10 wells had been drilled and    
were productive and one well was drilled and abandoned. The following table     
summarizes the Registrant's drilling activity from inception through December
31, 2002:                                                                       

                                                                [Download Table]

The sale of crude oil and natural gas produced by the Registrant will be        
affected by a number of factors that are beyond the Registrant's control. These 
factors include the price of crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating supply  
of and demand for these products, competitive fuels, refining, transportation,  
extensive federal and state regulations governing the production and sale of    
crude oil and natural gas, and other competitive conditions. It is impossible to
predict with any certainty the future effect of these factors on the Registrant.

The Registrant does not have long-term contracts with purchasers of its crude   
oil or natural gas. The market for crude oil is such that the Registrant        
anticipates it will be able to sell all the crude oil it can produce. Natural   
gas will be sold to local distribution companies, gas marketers and end users on
the spot market. The spot market reflects immediate sales of natural gas without
long-term contractual commitments. The future market condition for natural gas  
cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the Registrant may experience delays
in marketing natural gas production and fluctuations in natural gas prices.     

Many aspects of the Registrant's activities are highly competitive including,   
but not limited to, the acquisition of suitable drilling prospects and the      
procurement of drilling and related oil field equipment, and are subject to     

2 

P-->10-K3rd�Page�of�36TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�3rd
governmental regulation, both at Federal and state levels. The Registrant's     
ability to compete depends on its financial resources and on the managing       
general partner's staff and facilities, none of which are significant in        
comparison with those of the oil and gas exploration, development and production
industry as a whole. Federal and state regulation of oil and gas operations     
generally includes drilling and spacing of wells on producing acreage, the      
imposition of maximum allowable production rates, the taxation of income and    
other items, and the protection of the environment.                             

The Registrant does not have any employees of its own. MD is responsible for all
management functions. Mewbourne Oil Company ("MOC"), a wholly owned subsidiary  
of Mewbourne Holdings, Inc., which is also the parent of the Registrant's       
managing general partner, has been appointed Program Manager and is responsible 
for activities in accordance with a Drilling Program Agreement entered into by  
the Registrant, MD and MOC. At March 28, 2003, MOC employed 121 persons, many of
whom dedicated a part of their time to the conduct of the Registrant's business 
during the period for which this report is filed.                               

The production of oil and gas is not considered subject to seasonal factors     
although the price received by the Registrant for natural gas sales will tend to
increase during the winter months. Order backlog is not pertinent to the        
Registrant's business.                                                          

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES 
The Registrant's properties consist primarily of leasehold interests in         
properties on which oil and gas wells are located. Such property interests are  
often subject to landowner royalties, overriding royalties and other oil and gas
leasehold interests.                                                            

Fractional working interests in developmental oil and gas prospects located     
primarily in the Anadarko Basin of Western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, and   
the Permian Basin of New Mexico and West Texas, were acquired by the Registrant.
At December 31, 2002, 10 wells had been drilled and were productive and one well
was drilled and abandoned.                                                      

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
The Registrant is not aware of any pending legal proceedings to which it is a   
party.                                                                          

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS 

No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the period ended   
December 31, 2002 covered by this report.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

At March 28, 2003, the Registrant had 16,072 outstanding limited and general    
partnership interests held of record by 648 subscribers. There is no established
public or organized trading market for the limited and general partnership      
interests.                                                                      

Revenues which, in the sole judgement of the managing general partner, are not  
required to meet the Registrant's obligations will be distributed to the        
partners at least quarterly in accordance with the Registrant's Partnership     
Agreement. During the period from inception through December 31, 2002, no       
distributions had been made to the limited and general partners.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

General                                                                         

Mewbourne Energy Partners 02-A, L.P. (the "Registrant") was organized as a      
Delaware limited partnership on February 27, 2002. The offering of limited and  
general partner interests began June 26, 2002 as part of an offering registered 
under the name Mewbourne Energy 02-03 Drilling Programs. The offering of limited
and general partner interests in the Registrant concluded October 10, 2002, with
total investor partner contributions of $16,072,000.                            

The Registrant was formed to engage primarily in the business of drilling       
development wells, to produce and market crude oil and natural gas produced from
such properties, to distribute any net proceeds from operations to the general  
and limited partners and to the extent necessary, acquire leases which contain  
drilling prospects. The economic life of the Registrant depends on the period   
over which the Registrant's oil and gas reserves are economically recoverable.

Results of Operations                                                           

Because the Registrant was formed during the period covered by this report, no  
trend analysis based on yearly changes in liquidity, capital resources or       
results of operations is available.                                             

Revenues and other income during the period from February 27, 2002 (date of     
inception) through December 31, 2002 totaled $242,244, and consisted of oil and 
gas sales in the amount of $219,099, and interest income in the amount of       
$23,145. Gas production volumes during the period ended December 31, 2002       
amounted to approximately 57,758 mcf of gas at a corresponding average realized 
price of $3.79 per mcf of gas. There was no oil production in 2002. Expenses    
totaling $377,889, consisted primarily of depreciation, depletion and           
amortization in the amount of $107,171,and a cost ceiling write-down of         
$242,261. Lease operating expenses totaled $6,018. Production taxes were        
$17,609. Administrative and general expenses were $4,830. At December 31, 2002, 
10 wells had been drilled and were productive and 1 well had been drilled and   
abandoned. The Registrant's oil and gas revenues should increase during 2003 as 
additional wells are completed and oil and gas production is sold. Interest     
income should decrease in 2003 as the remaining wells are drilled and the       
available cash is utilized for the equipping of such wells. The Registrant      
expects that drilling and completion costs will decrease during 2003 and that   
lease operating cost and depletion provisions will increase.                    

Liquidity and capital resources                                                 

Net cash increased by $4,052,370 during the period from February 27, 2002 (date 
of inception) through December 31, 2002. Approximately $12,020,988 of the net   
initial partners' capital of $16,072,000 was used for drilling and completion   
and prepaid well costs. Capital requirements in the future are expected to be   
paid with the initial partners' capital. Management believes that funds are     
sufficient to complete the wells for which funds have been committed. Under     
certain circumstances, as provided in the Registrant's Partnership Agreement,   
the Registrant may use revenues and/or borrow monies, either through a financial
institution or through an affiliate of MD, to fund additional capital           
requirements.                                                                   

Critical Accounting Policies                                                    

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted   
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of         
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and   
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.      
Actual results could differ from those estimates.                               

Significant estimates inherent in the Registrant's financial statements include 
the estimate of oil and gas reserves as reported in the footnotes to the        
financial statements. Changes in oil and gas prices, changes in production      
estimates and the success or failure of future development activities could have
a significant effect on reserve estimates. The reserve estimates directly impact
the computation of depreciation, depletion and amortization, and the ceiling    
test for the Registrant's oil and gas properties.                               

5 

P-->10-K6th�Page�of�36TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�6th
The Registrant follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and gas   
activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and nonproductive costs  
incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas         
properties are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and 
gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production   
method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas properties. Oil  
and gas properties are subject to an annual ceiling test that limits such costs 
to the aggregate of the present value of future net cash flows of proved        
reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties.            

All financing activities of the Registrant are reported in the financial        
statements. The Registrant does not engage in any off-balance sheet financing   
arrangements.                                                                   

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of      
Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (FAS 143), Accounting for Asset          
Retirement Obligations. This statement changes financial accounting and         
reporting for obligations associated with the retirement and disposal of        
long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs and is effective for
the Partnership beginning January 1, 2003. The Partnership is currently         
evaluating the effect of adopting FAS 143.                                      

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of      
Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 (FAS 146), Accounting for Costs          
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This Statement addresses financial 
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  
and is effective for the Partnership beginning January 1, 2003. The adoption of 
FAS 146 is not expected to have a material impact on the Partnership's financial
statements.

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and the related statements of    
loss, changes in partners' capital and cash flows present fairly, in all        
material respects, the financial position of Mewbourne Energy Partners 02-A,    
L.P. at December 31, 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash flows 
for the period from February 27, 2002 (date of inception) through December 31,
2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the     
Partnership's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these  
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance   
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit    
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and        
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles    
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall   
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a          
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Drilling Programs, (the "Program"), and concluded October 10, 2002, with total  
investor contributions of $16,072,000 being sold to 647 subscribers of which    
$14,642,000 were sold to 596 subscribers as general partner interests and       
$1,430,000 were sold to 51 subscribers as limited partner interests.            

The Program's sole business is the development and production of oil and gas    
with a concentration on gas. Substantially all of the Program's gas reserves are
being sold regionally in the spot market. Due to the highly competitive nature  
of the spot market, prices are subject to wide seasonal and regional pricing    
fluctuations. In addition, such spot market sales are generally short-term in   
nature and are dependent upon obtaining transportation services provided by     
pipelines. The prices received for the Program's oil and gas are subject to     
influences such as global consumption and supply trends.                        

The Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and gas  
activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and nonproductive costs  
incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas         
properties are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and 
gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production   
method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas properties. At   
December 31, 2002, approximately $1.3 million of capitalized costs were excluded
from amortization. The excluded costs were development costs incurred in 2002 on
wells in progress. These costs will be subject to amortization in 2003. Gains   
and losses on the sale or other disposition of properties are not recognized    
unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between      
capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas reserves. Capitalized costs are    
subject to an annual ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the
present value of future net cash flows of proved reserves and the lower of cost 
or fair value of unproved properties. A cost ceiling write-down of $242,261 was 
recorded for the year ended December 31, 2002.                                  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted   
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of         
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and   
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.      
Actual results could differ from those estimates.                               

Cash and cash equivalents                                                 

The Partnership considers all highly liquid investments, those with original    
maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition, to be cash       
equivalents.                                                                    

The Partnership maintains all its cash in one financial institution.

Oil and Gas Sales                                                         

The Program's oil and condensate production is sold, title passed, and revenue  
recognized at or near the Program's wells under short-term purchase contracts at
prevailing prices in accordance with arrangements which are customary in the oil
industry. Sales of gas applicable to the Program's interest are recorded as     
revenue when the gas is metered and title transferred pursuant to the gas sales 
contracts covering the Program's interest in gas reserves. The Partnership uses 
the sales method to recognize oil and gas revenue whereby revenue is recognized 
for the amount of production taken regardless of the amount for which the       
Partnership is entitled based on its working interest ownership. As of December
31, 2002, no material gas imbalances between the Partnership and other working  
interest owners existed.                                                        

Income Taxes                                                              

The Partnership is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes, and as a   
result, income of the Partnership is reported on the tax returns of the partners
and no recognition is given to income taxes in the financial statements.        

2. Organization and Related Party Transactions:                                 

The Partnership was organized on February 27, 2002. Mewbourne Development       
Corporation (MD) is managing general partner and Mewbourne Oil Company (MOC) is 
operator of oil and gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings,
Inc. is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions are with  
MD and MOC.                                                                     

Reimbursement to MOC for supervision and other operator charges totaled $222,098
for the period February 27, 2002 (date of inception) through December 31, 2002. 
Services and operator charges are billed in accordance with the program and     
partnership agreements.                                                         

In general, during any particular calendar year the total amount of             
administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership shall not exceed the       
greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnership's gross revenue from the sale of oil and 
natural gas production during each year (calculated without any deduction for   
operating costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000 plus .25%
of the capital contributions of limited and general partners. Under this        
arrangement, there were no charges allocated to the Partnership during the      
period ended December 31, 2002.                                                 

The Partnership participates in oil and gas activities through an income tax    
partnership, the Program. The Partnership and MD are parties to the Program     
agreement. The costs and revenues of the Program are allocated to MD and the    
Partnership as follows:

(1) As noted above, pursuant to the Program, MD must contribute 100% of         
organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs which will          
approximate 30% of total capital costs. To the extent that organization and     
offering costs and lease acquisition costs are less that 30% of total capital   
costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its share of the     
Program's total capital costs reaches approximately 30%.                        

The Partnership's financial statements reflect its respective proportionate     
interest in the Program.

bases of its net assets by $10,045,467 at December 31, 2002.                    

4. Recently Issued Accounting Standards:                                        

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of      
Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (FAS 143), Accounting for Asset          
Retirement Obligations. This statement changes financial accounting and         
reporting for obligations associated with the retirement and disposal of        
long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs and is effective for
the Partnership beginning January 1, 2003. The Partnership is currently         
evaluating the effect of adopting FAS 143.                                      

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of      
Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 (FAS 146), Accounting for Costs          
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This Statement addresses financial 
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  
and is effective for the Partnership beginning January 1, 2003. The adoption on 
FAS 146 is not expected to have a material impact on the Partnership's financial
statements.

Depreciation, depletion, and amortization per one thousand cubic feet of gas    
equivalent was $1.86 for the period from February 27, 2002 (date of inception)  
through December 31, 2002.                                                      

Although certain wells had been drilled, completed and began producing in       
December, 2002, a majority of the wells drilled, or to be drilled, by the       
Partnership have been, or will be, completed subsequent to December 31, 2002.   
The following information relates to the wells drilled and completed by December
31, 2002.                                                                       

Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves             

Proved reserve quantities were based on estimates prepared by MOC engineers in  
accordance with guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange           
Commission. The Partnership considers such estimates to be reasonable, however, 
due to inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data,         
estimates of underground reserves are imprecise and subject to change over time 
as additional information becomes available.                                    

There have been no favorable or adverse events that have caused a significant   
change in estimated proved reserves since December 31, 2002. The Partnership has
no long-term supply agreements or contracts with governments or authorities in  
which it acts as producer nor does it have any interest in oil and gas          
operations accounted for by the equity method. All reserves are located onshore 
within the United States.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows:           

The Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from estimated     
production of proved oil and gas reserves is presented in accordance with the   
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69, "Disclosures  
about Oil and Gas Producing Activities" (SFAS No. 69). In computing this data,  
assumptions other than those mandated by SFAS No. 69 could produce substantially
different results. The Partnership cautions against viewing this information as 
a forecast of future economic conditions or revenues.                           

The standardized measure has been prepared assuming year-end selling prices,    
year end development and production cost and a 10 percent annual discount rate. 
No future income tax expense has been provided for the Partnership since it
