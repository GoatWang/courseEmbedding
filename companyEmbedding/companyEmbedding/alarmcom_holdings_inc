VIENNA, VA., May 22, 2015 -- Alarm.com Holdings, Inc., the leading platform solution for the connected home, announced today that it has filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") relating to a proposed initial public offering of shares of its common stock.  The number of shares to be sold and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined.  Alarm.com has applied to list its common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol ALRM.

Goldman, Sachs & Co., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, and BofA Merrill Lynch are acting as joint book-running managers for the proposed offering.  Stifel, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., William Blair & Company, LLC and Imperial Capital are acting as co-managers.

The offering will be made only by means of a prospectus. When available, copies of the preliminary prospectus related to the offering may be obtained from Goldman, Sachs & Co., Attention: Prospectus Department, 200 West Street, New York, NY 10282, telephone: (866) 471-2526, email: prospectus-ny@ny.email.gs.com; or Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Attention: Prospectus Department, One Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010, telephone: (800) 221-1037, email: newyork.prospectus@credit-suisse.com; or BofA Merrill Lynch, Attention: Prospectus Department, 222 Broadway, New York, NY 10038, email: dg.prospectus_requests@baml.com.

A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.

Services are distributed exclusively through a network of authorized and licensed service providers.
History[edit]
The company was founded in 2000 as part of MicroStrategy's research and development unit, and was eventually incorporated, branding itself as Alarm.com.[1] In February 2009, Alarm.com was acquired by venture capital firm ABS Capital Partners for $27.7 million.[2]
Distributed through a dealer network, Alarm.com provides turnkey residential and business wireless security systems and web services for users to monitor premises through video, a web-based application, and mobile apps.[3] The company expanded into energy management in early 2010, allowing users to remotely control heating and cooling on their property using mobile apps or via the company's website.[4]
In 2014, Alarm.com reported revenues of $167.3 million and a user base of more than 2.3 million subscribers.[5][6]
In 2015, Alarm.com issued an IPO at $14 a share.[6] ABS Capital Partners and Technology Crossover Ventures, which invested $136 million in the company, remained the majority shareholders.[6]
In 2016, Alarm.com integrated its cloud-based connected home platform with Amazon's Echo wireless speaker and voice-command devices as well as the HomeKit-compatible Apple TV.[5]
