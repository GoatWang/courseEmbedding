Lawrence Gray (July 28, 1898 – February 2, 1970 ) was an American actor of the 1920s and 1930s.
During World War I he served in the U. S. Navy and gained a commission. After the war he began in the technical side of films at the Lasky Studios, but later became an extra in crowd scenes and such, and liking the work, decided on a film career. He appeared in over 40 films between 1925 and 1936, although many were B movies.
In 1930 he starred in the MGM film musical Children of Pleasure in which he starred alongside Wynne Gibson and was involved with the film score. He spent much of his career in vaudeville.[citation needed]

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.
