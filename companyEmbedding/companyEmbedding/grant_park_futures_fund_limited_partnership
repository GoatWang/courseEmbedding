	Grant Park Futures Fund Limited Partnership, which is referred to in this report as Grant Park, is a multi-advisor commodity pool. Grant Park, which is not registered as a mutual fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940, has been in continuous operation since January 1989. It is managed by its general partner, Dearborn Capital Management, L.L.C., and invests through independent professional commodity trading advisors.




	 




	Grant Park conducts its business in one operating segment and has been organized to pool assets of investors for the purpose of trading in the U.S. and international spot derivatives markets for currencies, interest rates, stock indices, agricultural and energy products, precious and base metals and other commodities and underliers. In trading on these markets, Grant Park may enter into: 1) exchange traded derivatives, such as futures contracts, options on futures contracts, security futures contracts and listed option contracts; 2) over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, such as forwards, swaps, options and structured financial products; and 3) contracts on cash, or spot, commodities. Grant Parks general partner, commodity pool operator and sponsor is Dearborn Capital Management, L.L.C., an Illinois limited liability company. The limited partnership agreement requires the general partner to own units in Grant Park in an amount at least equal to the greater of (1) 1% of the aggregate capital contributions of all limited partners or (2) $25,000, during any time that units in Grant Park are publicly offered for sale. Grant Park does not have any employees. The manager of Dearborn Capital Management, L.L.C. is David M. Kavanagh, its President.




	 




	Dearborn Capital Management, L.L.C., along with its predecessor as general partner and commodity pool operator, Dearborn Capital Management, Ltd., has had management responsibility for Grant Park since its inception. The general partner has been registered as a commodity pool operator and a commodity trading advisor under the Commodity Exchange Act (the Act) and has been a member of the National Futures Association (NFA) since December 1995. The general partner has been approved as a forex firm effective December 2010 and as a swap firm effective April 2013.  The general partner is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 since January 2013. Dearborn Capital Management, Ltd., which served as Grant Parks general partner, commodity pool operator and sponsor from 1989 through 1995, was registered as a commodity pool operator between August 1988 and March 1996 and as a commodity trading advisor between September 1991 and March 1996 and was a member of the NFA between August 1988 and March 1996.




	 




	Grant Park invests through different commodity trading advisors retained by the general partner. The assets of Grant Park are invested in various trading companies, each of which is organized as a limited liability company. Each trading company allocates those assets to one of the commodity trading advisors retained by the general partner.




	 




	The following is a list of the trading companies (each a Trading Company and collectively, the Trading Companies), for which Grant Park is the sole member and all of which were organized as Delaware limited liability companies:

(Rabar), Revolution Capital Management, LLC (RCM), Transtrend B.V. (Transtrend) and Winton Capital Management Limited (Winton) serve as Grant Parks commodity trading advisors.

As of January 31, 2015, the general partner allocated between 5% to 25% of Grant Parks net assets through the respective Trading Companies among its trading advisors Amplitude, EMC, Lynx, Quantica, Rabar, RCM, Transtrend and Winton. No more than 25% of Grant Parks assets are allocated to any one Trading Company and, in turn, any one trading advisor.

	Grant Park utilizes Jefferies Bache, LLC, E D & F Man Capital Markets Inc., UBS Securities LLC and SG Americas Securities, LLC as its clearing brokers. The general partner may retain additional or substitute clearing brokers for Grant Park in its sole discretion.




	 




	Since its inception and through February 28, 2003, Grant Park offered its beneficial interests exclusively to qualified investors on a private placement basis. Effective June 30, 2003, Grant Park registered up to an aggregate of $200 million of Class A and Class B units with the SEC and began publicly offering both Class A and Class B units for sale.

Effective April 30, 2012, Grant Park subsequently registered an additional $200 million of Global 3 Class units.  Class A and Class B units are outstanding but no longer offered by Grant Park. From July 1, 2003 through December 31, 2014, the Fund has raised approximately $1,438,558,000 of new capital and is continuing to publicly offer up to an additional $904,172,000 of units on a continuous basis at a price equal to the net asset value per unit as of the close of business on each applicable closing date, which is the last business day of each month. The proceeds of the offering are deposited in Grant Parks bank and brokerage accounts for the purpose of engaging in trading activities in accordance with Grant Parks trading policies and its trading advisors respective trading strategies.




	 




	As of December 31, 2014, Grant Park had a net asset value of approximately $298.5 million and 9,652 limited partners.

	There have been no material administrative, civil or criminal actions within the past five years against the general partner or its principals and no such actions currently are pending.




	 




	The affairs of Grant Park will be wound up and Grant Park will be liquidated upon the happening of any of the following events: (1) expiration of Grant Parks term on December 31, 2027, (2) a decision by the limited partners to liquidate Grant Park, (3) withdrawal or dissolution of the general partner and the failure of the limited partners to elect a substitute general partner to continue Grant Park, or (4) assignment for the benefit of creditors or adjudication of bankruptcy of the general partner or appointment of a receiver for or seizure by a judgment creditor of the general partners interest in Grant  Park.

	Regulation





	 




	Under the Act, commodity exchanges and commodity futures trading are subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC). The NFA, a registered futures association under the Act, is the only non-exchange self -regulatory organization for commodity industry professionals. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers and their respective associated persons and floor brokers. The Act requires commodity pool operators, and commodity trading advisors such as Dearborn Capital Management, L.L.C., and commodity brokers or futures commission merchants such as Grant Parks commodity brokers, to be registered and to comply with various reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Each of Dearborn Capital Management, L.L.C., Grant Parks commodity trading advisors and Grant Parks commodity brokers is a member of the NFA. The CFTC may suspend a commodity pool operators or trading advisors registration if it finds that its trading practices tend to disrupt orderly market conditions, or as the result of violations of the Act or rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In the event Dearborn Capital Management, L.L.C.s registration as a commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor were terminated or suspended, Dearborn Capital Management, L.L.C. would be unable to continue to manage the business of Grant Park. Should Dearborn Capital Management, L.L.C.s registration be suspended, termination of Grant Park might result.




	 




	In addition to such registration requirements, the CFTC and certain commodity exchanges have established limits on the maximum net long and net short positions which any person, including Grant Park, may hold or control in particular commodities. Most exchanges also limit the maximum changes in futures contract prices that may occur during a single trading day. Grant Park also trades in dealer markets for forward and swap contracts, which are not regulated by the CFTC. Federal and state banking authorities also do not regulate forward trading or forward dealers. In addition, Grant Park trades on foreign commodity exchanges, which are not subject to regulation by any United States government agency.

Dear Sir/Madam:
 
     DEARBORN CAPITAL
MANAGEMENT, L.L.C., an Illinois limited liability company
(the "GENERAL PARTNER"), serves as the
general partner of an Illinois limited
partnership pursuant to the Revised Uniform
Limited Partnership Act of the State
of Illinois (the "ILLINOIS ACT") under the
name GRANT PARK FUTURES FUND LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP (the "FUND"), for the purpose
of engaging in the speculative trading
of futures contracts, forward contracts,
options on futures contracts, forward
contracts and on commodities, security
futures contracts, spot contracts, swap
contracts and other commodity interest
contracts, implementing the trading
methods of the independent commodity
trading advisors engaged by the General
Partner on behalf of the Fund. [SELLING
AGENT] (the "SELLING AGENT") shall be a
principal selling agent for the Fund.
____________ and ____________ also will
serve as principal selling agents for the
Fund (the Selling Agent, collectively
with the other principal selling agents,
the "PRINCIPAL SELLING AGENTS"). Other
selling agents (the "ADDITIONAL SELLING
AGENTS") may be selected by the General
Partner in its sole discretion,
substantially in accordance with the terms of
the Form of Additional Selling Agent
Agreement, attached as Exhibit A hereto.
 
     The Fund desires
to raise capital as herein provided by the sale of units
of limited partnership interest in the Fund
(the "UNITS"), the purchasers of
which will become limited partners
("LIMITED PARTNERS") of the Fund, and the
Selling Agent hereby agrees to use its best
efforts to market the Units pursuant
to the terms hereof. Accordingly, the
Selling Agent, the General Partner and the
Fund, intending to be legally bound, hereby
agree as set forth below. This
Selling Agreement shall be referred to
herein as the "AGREEMENT."
 
     Section 1.
Representations and Warranties of the General Partner. The
General Partner represents and warrants to
the Selling Agent as of the date
hereof, with such representations and
warranties to be restated and reaffirmed
as of each Closing Date (as defined in
Section 2(g) hereof):
 
 
<PAGE>
 
 
         
(a) The Fund has provided to the Selling Agent, and filed with
the
     Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), a registration statement on
     Form S-1 (No.
333-104317), as initially filed with the SEC on April 4, 2003
     and an amendment
or amendments thereto, for the registration of the Units
     under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 ACT"), and has
     filed one copy
thereof with the National Futures Association ("NFA") in
     accordance with
NFA Compliance Rule 2-13, the Commodity Exchange Act, as
     amended (the
"COMMODITY ACT"), and the rules and regulations thereunder
     (the "CFTC
REGULATIONS"). The registration statement as amended and
     delivered to all
parties hereto at the time it becomes effective together
     with any
registration statement filed to register additional Units under
     the 1933 Act
pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the 1933 Act, and the prospectus
     included therein
are hereinafter called the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT" and
     the
"PROSPECTUS," respectively, except that: (i) if the Fund files
a
     subsequent
post-effective amendment to the registration statement, then
the
     term
"Registration Statement" shall, from and after the declaration of
the
     effectiveness of
such post-effective amendment, refer to the registration
     statement as
amended by such post-effective amendment thereto; and (ii) the
     term
"Prospectus" shall refer to the prospectus as most recently issued
by
     the Fund
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
under
     the 1933 Act
(the "SEC REGULATIONS"), together with any current supplement
     or supplements
thereto.
 
         
Except as required by law, the Fund will not file any amendment to
the
     Registration
Statement or any amendment and/or supplement to the Prospectus
     that shall be
reasonably objected to by the Selling Agent. The General
     Partner agrees
to suspend the offering immediately and inform the Selling
     Agent if the
General Partner has any reason to believe that it may be
     necessary or
advisable to amend the Registration Statement or supplement
     the
Prospectus.
 
         
The Fund will not utilize any promotional brochures or other
marketing
     materials,
including "Tombstone Ads" or other communications qualifying
     under Rule 134
of the SEC Regulations (collectively, "PROMOTIONAL
     MATERIAL") that
are reasonably objected to by the Selling Agent. No
     reference to the
Selling Agent may be made in the Registration Statement,
     Prospectus or in
any Promotional Material that has not been approved by the
     Selling Agent,
which approval such Selling Agent may withhold in its sole
     and absolute
discretion. The Fund will cooperate with the Selling Agent in
     causing to be
filed, all Promotional Material with the National Association
     of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD"), and will not use any such
     Promotional
Material unless the NASD has stated in writing that it appears
     to comply with
all applicable standards or the requirement for such a
     statement has
been waived by the Selling Agent. The Fund will file, or
     cause to be
filed, all Promotional Material in state jurisdictions as
     requested or
required by law, and will not use any such Promotional
     Material in any
state that has expressed any objection thereto (except
     pursuant to
agreed-upon modifications to the Promotional Material).
 
         
(b) The certificate of limited partnership (the "CERTIFICATE OF
     LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP") pursuant to which the Fund has been formed and
the
     Third Amended
and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement (the "LIMITED
     PARTNERSHIP
AGREEMENT") provide for the subscription for and sale of the
     Units of the
Fund; all action required to be
 
 
                                      
2
 
<PAGE>
 
 
     taken by the
General Partner and the Fund as a condition to the sale of the
     Units to
qualified subscribers therefor has been, or prior to the
Initial
     Closing Date (as
defined in Section 2(g) hereof) will have been, taken;
     and, upon
payment of the consideration therefor specified in all accepted
     Subscription
Agreements and Powers of Attorney, the form of which is set
     forth as
Appendix B to the Prospectus, the Units will constitute valid
     units of limited
partnership interest in the Fund as to which the
     subscribers
thereto will have limited personal liability to the extent
     provided for
under the Illinois Act and will be Limited Partners of the
     Fund entitled to
all the applicable benefits under the Limited Partnership
     Agreement and
the Illinois Act.
 
         
(c) The Fund is a limited partnership existing under the laws of
the
     State of
Illinois with full power and authority to engage in the
business
     to be conducted
by it, as described in the Registration Statement and
     Prospectus. The
Fund is qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in
     which such
qualification is necessary in order to protect the limited
     liability of
Limited Partners and in which the nature or conduct of its
     business as
described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus requires
     such
qualification and the failure to be so qualified would be
reasonably
     likely to have a
material adverse effect on the results of operations,
     financial
condition or business ("MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT") of the Fund.
 
         
(d) The General Partner is, and will continue to be so long as it
is
     the general
partner of the Fund, a limited liability company duly
     organized,
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
     Illinois and is
in good standing and qualified to do business in each
     jurisdiction in
which the nature or conduct of its business as described in
     the Registration
Statement and Prospectus requires such qualification and
     the failure to
be so qualified would, in the aggregate, be reasonably
     likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Fund or the General
     Partner.
 
         
(e) Each of the Fund and the General Partner has full limited
     partnership or
limited liability company power and authority, as the case
     may be, under
applicable law to perform its respective obligations under
     the Limited
Partnership Agreement and this Agreement, and to conduct its
     business as
described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus.
 
         
(f) When the Registration Statement becomes effective under the
1933
     Act and at all
times subsequent thereto up to and including each Closing
     Date, the
Registration Statement, Prospectus and Promotional Material
will
     comply in all
material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act, the
     SEC Regulations,
the Commodity Act and the CFTC Regulations. Each of the
     Registration
Statement, the Prospectus and each item of Promotional
     Material as of
the Initial Closing Date and each Closing Date thereafter
     will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
     material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
     circumstances
under which such statements are made, not misleading;
     provided,
however, that this representation and warranty does not apply
to
     statements made
or omitted in reliance upon, and in conformity with,
     written
information furnished to the General Partner with respect to
the
     Selling Agent by
or on behalf of the Selling Agent, expressly for use in
     such
Registration Statement, Prospectus or Promotional Material.

(g) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in
the
     Registration
Statement and the Prospectus, there has not been any material
     adverse change
in the results of operations, financial condition or
     business of the
General Partner or the Fund, whether or not arising in the
     ordinary course
of business, of which the Selling Agent has not been
     informed by the
General Partner.
 
         
(h) Each of the Limited Partnership Agreement and this Agreement
has
     been duly and
validly authorized, executed and delivered by the General
     Partner (in the
case of the Limited Partnership Agreement) and by the Fund
     and the General
Partner (in the case of this Agreement). The Limited
     Partnership

     Section 2.
Offering and Sale of Units.
 
         
(a) The Selling Agent is hereby appointed as a Principal Selling
Agent
     for the Fund
(although as described herein the Fund will engage the other
     Principal
Selling Agents and it is contemplated that various Additional
     Selling Agents
also may market Units) during the term herein specified for
     the purpose of
finding acceptable subscribers for the Units through a
     public offering
of such Units. Subject to the performance by the General
     Partner of its
obligations hereunder and to the completeness and accuracy
     in all material
respects of the representations and warranties of the
     General Partner
contained herein, the Selling Agent hereby accepts such
     agency and
agrees on the terms and conditions herein set forth to use its
     best efforts to
find acceptable subscribers for the Units, provided that
     there is no
minimum number of Units for which the Selling Agent agrees to
     find
subscribers.
 
         
It is understood that the Selling Agent's agreement to use its
best
     efforts to find
acceptable subscribers for the Units shall not prevent it
     from acting as a
selling agent or underwriter for the securities of other
     issuers,
including affiliates of the Selling Agent, that may be offered
or
     sold during the
term hereof. The agency of the Selling Agent hereunder
     shall continue
until the expiration or termination of this Agreement as
     provided herein,
including such additional period as may be required to
     effect a final
closing of the sale of the Units subscribed for through the
     date of such
termination. All subscriptions are subject to acceptance or
     rejection, in
whole or in part in the General Partner's sole discretion,
     and no
compensation shall be due hereunder in respect of rejected
    
subscriptions.
 
       
   The Selling
Agent acknowledges that the Units are divided into
     separate Classes
each of which is open for investment only by certain
     subscribers as
follows and as described in the Prospectus, or otherwise in
     the General
Partner's discretion. Class A Units are reserved for: (i)
     current Limited
Partners who purchased beneficial interests in the Fund
     during the
private offering of the Fund's interests ("EXISTING LIMITED
     PARTNERS"); and
(ii) new subscribers subscribing for the requisite minimum
     subscription
amount as described below. Class B Units are reserved for new
     subscribers
generally. The minimum initial subscription amount for Class A
     Units for new
subscribers is $200,000. The minimum initial subscription
      amount for Class A Units for
Existing Limited Partners is $15,000, except
     for Existing
Limited Partners that are employee
 
 
                                       
6
 
<PAGE>
 
 
     benefit plans or
individual retirement accounts, for which the minimum
     initial
subscription amount is $5,000. The minimum additional
subscription
     amount for Class
A Units for all Limited Partners is $15,000, except for
     Limited Partners
that are employee benefit plans or individual retirement
     accounts, for
which the minimum additional subscription amount is $5,000.
     The minimum
initial subscription amount for Class B Units is $10,000,
     except for
subscribers that are employee benefit plans or individual
     retirement
accounts, for which the minimum initial subscription amount is
     $5,000. The
minimum additional subscription amount for Class B Units for
     all Limited
Partners is $2,000. The foregoing minimum subscription
     requirements are
subject to any higher or different minimum subscription
     requirements
that may be imposed by certain state securities regulators, as
     may be set forth
in the Subscription Requirements attached as Appendix C to
     the
Prospectus.
 
         
No upfront sales commission will be payable to the Selling Agent
in
     connection with
its sales of any Class A Units. With respect to sales of
     Class B Units,
the General Partner agrees to pay, from its own funds, an
     upfront sales
commission to the Selling Agent equal to 3.5% of the Net
     Asset Value per
Unit (as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement) of
     each Class B
Unit sold by the Selling Agent at each Closing Date. The
     General Partner
shall pay the upfront sales commission with respect to any
     sale of Class B
Units due to the Selling Agent within fifteen (15) business
     days of the
applicable Closing Date.
 
         
The Selling Agent agrees that it will promptly pass on to its
     Registered
Representatives that portion of the upfront sales commissions
     received from
the General Partner for its sale of Class B Units to which
     such Registered
Representatives are entitled pursuant to the Selling
     Agent's standard
compensation procedures, as determined by the Selling
     Agent from time
to time.
 
         
(b) The General Partner agrees to pay, from its own funds,
ongoing
     trailing
commissions to the Selling Agent with respect to its sales of
the
     Units as
follows.
 
         
For ongoing services rendered to Limited Partners holding Class
A
     Units as
described below in this subsection (b), the General Partner
shall
     pay the Selling
Agent ongoing trailing commissions in an amount equal to
     .1875% of the
month-end Net Asset Value per Unit (a 2.25% annual rate) of
     all Class A
Units sold by the Selling Agent that remain outstanding as of
     the end of each
month (including Units redeemed as of the end of such
     month), provided
that the total underwriting compensation per Class A Unit
     will not exceed
10% of the subscription proceeds of the unit unless the
     Selling Agent
remains registered with the CFTC as a futures commission
     merchant or
introducing broker and remains a member in good standing of the
     NFA in such
capacity, and the registered representative of the Selling
     Agent
responsible for the sale is registered with the CFTC, is a member
of
     the NFA and has
either passed the Series 3 or Series 31 examination or was
     "grandfathered"
as an associated person of the selling agent.
 
         
Such ongoing trailing commissions shall begin to accrue with
respect
     to each Class A
Unit as of the end of the first full month following the
     Closing Date for
the sale
 
 
                                      
7
 
<PAGE>
 
     of such Unit,
and shall continue only for as long as such Class A Unit
     remains
outstanding, regardless of the termination of this Agreement
for
     any reason.
 
         
For ongoing services rendered to Limited Partners holding Class
B
     Units as
described below in this subsection (b), the General Partner
shall
     pay the Selling
Agent ongoing trailing commissions in an amount equal to
     0.292% of the
month-end Net Asset Value per Unit (a 3.5% annual rate) of
     all Class B
Units sold by the Selling Agent that remain outstanding as of
     the end of each
month (including Units redeemed as of the end of such
     month), provided
that the total underwriting compensation per Class B Unit
     will not exceed
10% of the subscription proceeds of the unit unless the
     Selling Agent
remains registered with the CFTC as a futures commission
     merchant or
introducing broker and remains a member in good standing of the
     NFA in such
capacity and the registered representative of the Selling Agent
     responsible for
the sale is registered with the CFTC, is a member of the
     NFA and has
either passed the Series 3 or Series 31 examination or was
     "grandfathered"
as an associated person of the selling agent.
 
         
Such ongoing trailing commissions shall begin to accrue with
respect
     to each Class B
Unit as of the end of the thirteenth full month following
     the Closing Date
for the sale of such Unit, and shall continue only for as
     long as such
Class B Unit remains outstanding, regardless of the
     termination of
this Agreement for any reason.
 
         
The General Partner shall pay the ongoing trailing commissions due
to
     the Selling
Agent within fifteen (15) business days of the end of each
     applicable
calendar month.
 
         
Notwithstanding the foregoing, ongoing trailing commissions shall
be
     payable to the
Selling Agent only in respect of Units sold by Registered
     Representatives
who are themselves registered with the CFTC and who have
     passed either
the Series 3 National Commodity Futures Examination or the
     Series 31
Futures Managed Funds Examination, and are contingent upon the
     provision by
such Registered Representatives of ongoing services in
     connection with
the Units sold by such Registered Representatives,
      including: (i) inquiring of the
General Partner from time to time, at the
     request of an
owner of Units, as to the Net Asset Value per Unit; (ii)
     inquiring of the
General Partner from time to time, at the request of an
     owner of Units,
regarding the commodity interest markets and the Fund;
     (iii) assisting,
at the request of the General Partner, in the redemption
     of Units; and
(iv) providing such other services to the owners of Units as
     the General
Partner may, from time to time, reasonably request. The Selling
     Agent agrees to
adopt procedures to monitor the adequacy of the ongoing
     services
provided by Registered Representatives.
 
         
The Selling Agent agrees to pass ongoing trailing commissions on
to
     their Registered
Representatives, pursuant to the Selling Agent's standard
     compensation
procedures, as determined by the Selling Agent from time to
     time.
 
         
(c) In the case of Class A Units acquired by Existing Limited
Partners
     in exchange for
their limited partnership interests in the Fund previously
     sold by the
Selling Agent on a private placement basis, the Selling Agent
     will not receive
any upfront sales commissions for the Units at the Initial
     Closing of such
Units. However, if the Selling Agent is receiving ongoing
     trailing
commissions in respect of such privately placed
 
 
                                      
8
 
<PAGE>
 
     limited
partnership interests it will continue to receive such ongoing
     trailing
commissions with respect to the Class A Units exchanged
therefor;
     provided,
however, that as of the Initial Closing, such ongoing trailing
     commissions
shall be paid in accordance with subsection (b) above (subject
     to Rule 2810 of
the NASD Conduct Rules in respect of aggregate compensation
     which may be
received by the Selling Agent).
 
         
(d) The General Partner, in its sole discretion, may select
Additional
     Selling Agents,
subject to the requirements set forth in the Additional
      Selling Agent Agreement, that are
either: (i) broker-dealers that are
     members in good
standing of the NASD; or (ii) foreign banks, brokers,
     dealers or
institutions ineligible for membership in a registered
     securities
association (within the meaning of Rule 2420 of the NASD's
     Conduct Rules)
that agree that they will make no sales of Units within the
     United States,
its territories or possessions or areas subject to its
     jurisdiction.
Each such Additional Selling Agent shall execute and deliver
     to the General
Partner an Additional Selling Agent Agreement in
     substantially
the form set forth as Exhibit A to this Agreement.
 
         
(e) The General Partner will pay the Additional Selling Agents
upfront
     sales
commissions and ongoing trailing commissions as set forth in
     subsections (a)
and (b) above, or in such lesser amounts to which the
     General Partner
and each such Additional Selling Agent may agree.
 
         
(f) Ongoing trailing commissions will be paid at the end of
each
     calendar month
on the basis of the Units outstanding during each month
     during such
month. Net Asset Value per Unit, for purposes of determining
     ongoing trailing
commissions, shall be calculated after reduction of all
     expenses of the
Fund, including accrued and unpaid expenses, as set forth
     in the Limited
Partnership Agreement.
 
         
The Selling Agent, although otherwise entitled to ongoing
trailing
     commissions will
not be entitled to receipt thereof for any month during
     any portion of
which the Registered Representative who is receiving
     compensation
based upon such ongoing trailing commissions is at any time
     not properly
registered with the CFTC or does not provide the ongoing
     services
described in subsection (b) above.
 
         
(g) The General Partner shall notify the Selling Agent of the
initial
     closing of the
sale of Units (THE "INITIAL CLOSING" and the date of such
     closing, the
"INITIAL CLOSING DATE"), as well as of the aggregate number of
     Units for which
the General Partner has received acceptable subscriptions.
     Thereafter,
Units may continue to be sold as of close of business on the
     last business
day of each calendar month (each such date or the Initial
      Closing Date, a
"CLOSING DATE"), in the discretion of the Fund.
 
         
(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the
     contrary, no
upfront sales commissions or ongoing trailing commissions
     shall be paid to
the Selling Agent on Units sold to the General Partner or
     any of its
principals or affiliates.
 
         
(i) The Fund shall not in any respect be responsible for any
upfront
     sales
commissions or ongoing trailing commissions described herein.
All
     such commissions
are to be solely the responsibility of the General
     Partner.

<PAGE>
 
 
         
(j) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2 to the contrary,
the
     Selling Agent
shall not be entitled to any compensation hereunder in
     respect of a
sale to any subscriber if the General Partner determines that
     another
authorized selling agent of the Fund is primarily responsible
for
     or should
otherwise be credited with such sale. In making this
     determination,
the General Partner shall endeavor to act fairly. Any
     dispute
regarding compensation shall be conclusively resolved by the
     General
Partner.
 
     Section 3.
  Compliance with Rule
2810 and General Laws.
 
         
(a) It is understood that the Selling Agent has no commitment
with
     regard to the
sale of the Units oth

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Fund Objective
The Fund seeks to provide income and capital preservation. 
Investment Growth 
July 31, 2015 - June 30, 2017

The Fund seeks to generate interest income and preserve principal by investing primarily in investment- grade fixed income securities.
The Fund defines investment grade fixed income securities as those that are rated, at the time purchased, in the top four categories by a rating agency such as Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group, or, if unrated, determined by the adviser to be of comparable quality.
The Fund’s portfolio will be invested without restriction as to issuer country, type of entity, or capitalization.
There is no guarantee that any investment will achieve its objectives, generate positive returns, or avoid losses.
The indices shown are for informational purposes only and are not reflective of any investment.   As it is not possible to invest in the indices, the data shown does not reflect or compare features of an actual investment, such as its objectives, costs and expenses, liquidity, safety, guarantees or insurance, fluctuation of principal or return, or tax features.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Fund Overview
The Fund utilizes three sub-strategies in pursuit of achieving the investment objective:
Cash Management strategy: Comprised of cash and cash-equivalent investments.
Short-Term strategy:  Comprised of fixed-income investments with maturities of one-to-three years at time of purchase; and
Mid-Term strategy: Consists of fixed-income investments with maturities from one-to-five years at time of purchase.

The Sub-Adviser establishes weightings to each sub-strategy based on its economic analysis of domestic and international fixed income investments within the context of the then-current fiscal and monetary policies in effect by national and regional governments, central banks, fiscal, monetary and regulatory authorities.
This view and sub-strategy allocation limits are established at the beginning of each calendar year and are formally confirmed or revised on a quarterly basis.
The Fund’s allocations to the specific sectors and markets are presented to illustrate examples of the diversity of strategies and sub-strategies accessed by the Fund, but may not be representative of the Fund’s past, or its future, access to market sectors, markets, and sub-strategies. It should not be considered a recommendation or investment advice. There is no guarantee that any investment will achieve its objectives, generate positive returns, or avoid losses.

Portfolio Allocation
As of June 30, 2017
The Sub-Adviser will not purchase investments on behalf of that sub-strategy if the Sub-Adviser does not believe the value of available assets within that strategy justify placing the Fund’s capital at risk. The conditions under which this could occur include periods of rapidly rising interest rates, periods when the fixed income markets do not have an ample supply of desirable investments or when the sub-adviser believes the duration-related risk for holding a fixed income security is undesirable.
Risk-Reward
The Fund attempts to deliver competitive returns while focusing on capital preservation.
Seeks to provide downside protection which the advisor believes can reduce a portfolio’s volatility and enhance overall performance

The Fund executes four trading strategies to identify and capture short-term price trends across a variety of market conditions within the target indices.  The Grant Park Absolute Return Fund invests in five key U.S. and European equity markets.
     Price Trend:  Medium-term strategy that seeks to identify persistent bullish or bearish price movement     Momentum:  Strategy designed to take advantage of short-term price movements in volatile markets     Counter Trend:  Seeks to exploit short-term dislocations of longer-term trends; and
     Pattern Recognition:  Seeks to identify short-term dislocations in intra-day trends
