Jim Henry, Inc. is a member of and approved Advertising
Specialty Institute (ASI) distributor.
 
Our History
Our founder, James H. Henry, began his career in creative
recognition in 1938. Initially, by providing class rings to high
schools across the midwest, his passion for artistic design in
jewelry and excellence in customer service was born.
Upon returning from military service in 1945 as an Air Force
Lieutenant in Great Britain, he opened a small jewelry
manufacturing facility in downtown Chicago with his partner, Doc
Morgan.
In the mid-1950's, the manufacturing facility relocated west of
downtown Chicago to St. Charles, Illinois. Later, in 1974, the
company incorporated and the new name Jim Henry, Inc. was firmly
established.
Primarily due to his efforts, it has been our privilege to serve
many prestigious national and international medical organizations,
associations, and corporate customers for several consecutive
decades. In 2000, Mr. Henry retired after 62 years of excellence,
showcasing his exceptional entrepreneurial spirit and passion for
creating a better recognition experience for his customers.
Today, the St. Charles facility is now managed by Jim Henry's
son, Jeff Henry, President of Jim Henry, Inc., along with a support
staff of highly skilled Account Managers to continue the tradition
of service, working closely with our customers to artistically
design and produce recognition products that go far beyond client
and industry expectations. The combination of technology, fine
materials, and craftsmanship produces exceptional quality that we
trust will make your recognition experience truly memorable.
