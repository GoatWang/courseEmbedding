GoPro, the wearable-camera maker looking to transform itself into a media company, has named former NBCUniversal cable exec Lauren Zalaznick to its board — the first woman to join GoPro’s board.
Zalaznick, who exited NBCU in 2013 after 12 years, had been the president of Bravo, building the cabler into a reality-TV powerhouse.
Currently, Zalaznick also serves on the boards of Nielsen, Shazam and Penguin Random House. In addition, she’s an adviser to Greycroft Partners, Refinery29 and Venture For America, where she most recently executive produced feature-length documentary film “Generation Start-Up.”
“We are excited to have such a distinguished media and business leader as Lauren join GoPro’s board of directors,” GoPro founder and CEO Nick Woodman said in a statement. “Her broad experience and perspective will influence GoPro’s evolution as an entertainment company and will benefit our business strategy overall.”







Zalaznick, for her part, commented that “GoPro represents everything that excites me in a digital media company: deeply respected products and an inspiring, globally recognized brand; profoundly engaging content available on multiple platforms, and an incredibly passionate audience.”
Her appointment to GoPro’s board comes after the company in May inked a broad deal with Red Bull, under which GoPro’s cameras will exclusively be used to capture footage at more that 1,800 Red Bull events over the next few years. Under the terms of the pact, Red Bull received an equity stake in GoPro of less than 1%.

Exec built Bravo into Peacock powerhouse is setting her sights on next-generation digital media ventures




The Lauren Zalaznick era at NBCUniversal is over. NBCU CEO Steve Burke confirmed in a memo Friday that the exec who combined programming and marketing savvy to build Bravo into a cable powerhouse for the Peacock is preparing to exit after 12 years with the company.This story first appeared in the October 01, 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more.
Her plan to depart by year’s end is no surprise, after losing her cable turf earlier this year when Burke decided to consolidate NBCU’s channels under Bonnie Hammer. Zalaznick segued to a non-operational role as exec VP of NBCUniversal and was tasked with exploring various digital strategies for NBCU content. Digital was right up her alley but the lack of any P&L responsibilities was frustrating to the exec, sources said.







Zalaznick’s current direct reports in her digital portfolio will be divvied up by Cesar Conde, the former Univision programming topper who joined NBCU International earlier this month, and Jeff Shell, the NBCU Intl. topper who will move back across the pond to become chairman of Universal Film Entertainment Group in January.
Zalaznick became synonymous with the high-end urbane programming that defined Bravo on her watch. She coined the term “affluencers” to describe the media-savvy young viewers the network courted with shows such as “Top Chef” and “Project Runway” as well as low-brow guilty-pleasure fare such as “The Real Housewives” franchise (which piggybacked on the early success of ABC’s soap “Desperate Housewives”).
One person familiar with Zalaznick’s thinking suggested the exec preferred more of a hands-on role, and her current duties forced her to be much more of “a suit,” who dealt with supervising and managing.
Smart and articulate, the exec has been a magnet for media attention herself, which hit a crescendo with a glowing New York Times Magazine profile in 2008.
Zalaznick came to NBCUniversal in 2004 through G.E.’s acquisition of Vivendi Universal Entertainment, which had tapped Zalanick two years earlier to run its pop culture-centric Trio cabler. The channel had limited distribution but got attention in media circles through a franchise marketed as “Brilliant But Canceled,” which made use of short-lived shows from notable creative auspices — a genius way to ingratiate herself into the creative community.
At NBC she was put in charge of Bravo, which the Peacock had purchased a few years before. Zalaznick was among the first traditional TV execs to recognize the importance of the emerging world of digital media to promoting and extending the reach of on-air brands as well as offering premium advertising opportunities. She spearheaded the formation of an Integrated Media group in 2007, overseeing disparate NBCU digital assets including iVillage and ultimately Comcast’s Fandango and Daily Candy.
Zalaznick also energetically took on oversight of NBCU’s “Green is Universal” environmental initiative to overhaul the conglom’s operations in green-friendly ways. For the past few years the ambitious campaign has also included a week of green-themed programming rolled out across NBCU’s various nets.







Zalaznick and Hammer split NBCU’s entertainment cable turf for years, a division that persisted even after the Comcast acquisition of NBCU in early 2011, with Zalaznick adding Style Network and Spanish-lingo nets Telemundo and Mun2 to her portfolio. But in February, Burke moved to consolidate the entertainment cablers and cable production unit under Hammer, while former Univision CEO Joe Uva was brought in to run NBCU’s Hispanic assets. Despite her digital street cred, Zalaznick’s shift to a digital strategy-focused post was seen as a means of marking time until she could sort out her exit.
Zalaznick was not immediately available for comment Friday about her next moves. There was instant speculation that she might pursue a startup venture of some kind.  The person familiar with Zalaznick’s point of view suggested the exec was interested in content and how it intersects with technology. Zalaznick is known to have forged advisory relationships with a number of tech- and digital media outfits, both as a coach for entrepreneurs and an consultant on media biz-matters. It’s also undersood that Zalaznick has made seed investments in two companies.
Those who are close to the exec say she’s likely to be less interested in a traditional player like Viacom or Time Warner and more keen on an emerging property or concern rather than a role focused in linear programming assets.  Rumors that Zalaznick may be headed to Yahoo or Discovery Communications are inaccurate, this person suggested.
Undoubtedly Zalaznick will be high on the list of sought-after candidates for high-level programming and digital openings at other networks and studios.
Here’s Burke’s memo:
I am writing to let you know that Lauren Zalaznick will be leaving NBCUniversal after 12 successful years working in a variety of leadership roles here.
Those of you who know Lauren well know she is one of those rare executives that combine great creative instincts with a true business orientation.  Her contributions to our company have been significant and far-reaching, from cable entertainment to Spanish-language broadcast, from digital initiatives to new marketing campaigns. Lauren also has been an important champion for many of our company-wide initiatives.
Moving forward, most of Lauren’s current group including Lori Conkling, Tony Cardinale, Nick Lehman and Lenore Moritz will report to Cesar Conde. Russell Hampton (Consumer Products) and Paul Yanover (Fandango) will report to Jeff Shell. John Shea and the Integrated Media group will report solely to Linda Yaccarino.
Lauren will remain at the company to transition her current portfolio, and then consult with NBCUniversal on digital media content and technology marketplace trends.
I want to thank Lauren for her years of service.  Her drive to innovate, her energy and her intelligence have made our company a better place. She has been an important member of our team and we wish her well in the future.
Steve-

Well said Tom.  After all this is a trade magazine.   She was a talented executive who has much to offer anyone smart enough to hire her.  In the middle of reading this story, Oprah’s name popped into my head.

Lauren Zalaznick has devoted her career in media to transforming the cultural landscape. From her start as an independent feature film producer to her most recent role as Executive Vice President, NBCUniversal, Zalaznick’s business interests have increasingly focused on the intersection of content, technology, and data as a means for substantial growth. She is also the Founder of The LZ Sunday Paper, a weekly newsletter that uncovers and distributes the most relevant content about women in business, technology, media and culture.
Zalaznick launched her career in independent film. From 1984 to 1994, she produced a number of groundbreaking feature films including the Cannes and Sundance Festival award- winning films Larry Clark’s Kids; Todd Haynes’ Poison and Safe; Tom Kalin’s Swoon, and Jim McKay’s Girls Town.
Zalaznick then moved into television, where she has overseen the transformation of some of the strongest television and digital brands in media, from VH1, to Bravo Media, to Fandango. Under her watch, each business achieved double digit growth across all viewer, user, and financial metrics.
Zalaznick sits on the Board of Directors of Shazam, Penguin-Random House, and NATPE. She advises and invests selectively in digital media startups and venture funds primarily focused on new content platforms, including Refinery29, Shelf.com, and Medium.com. She is also an Advisor to The Sundance Institute, Venture For America, and Greycroft Partners. Additionally, she is a trustee of Brown University, from which she graduated in 1984, Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude.
Zalaznick has been widely recognized as an industry pioneer and has received many honors for her achievements. Among them, she has won two Peabody Awards for "The N-Word" and "Project Runway;" countless Emmy nominations and wins including the first-ever win for a cable series in the Competitive Reality Category, for "Top Chef." She was awarded the Brandon Tartikoff Lifetime Achievement award by the National Association of Television Programming Executives (NATPE). Time magazine named Zalaznick one of the “Time 100: World’s Most Influential People.” She has been the subject of a New York Times Magazine cover story. In 2011, she delivered a TED talk that has been viewed well over half a million times.
She currently resides in New York City with her husband and three children.

Lauren Zalaznick: My Thoughts on Joining the GoPro Board of Directors













SHARE




















    community




Jul 7, 2016






Today, I officially join the GoPro board of directors – a role which closely tracks with my experiences helping transform the cultural landscape of mass media.
I see GoPro as a global change agent in evolving how people tell and experience the stories that shape their lives.  GoPro represents everything that excites me in a media company: deeply respected products and an inspiring, globally recognized brand; profoundly engaging content available on multiple platforms, and an incredibly passionate audience.  GoPro also represents what excites me in any modern company – the recognition they need to embrace, empower, and promote diversity, in the company and in their customer base.
Some abbreviated background on me to frame why I jumped at the opportunity to serve on GoPro’s board of directors: For most of my career I served in creative and executive positions at some of the world's greatest media companies. I left that world about two years ago. One of the things I do today is publish an e-newsletter, the LZ Sunday Paper–a passion project that promised to deliver a weekly dose of interesting content about and by women in business. I’m extremely proud of how both the content and the audience for the newsletter has scaled to include content for women and men from many demographics and cultural perspectives around the world. 
Like GoPro content, the goal of our stories is to inspire, surprise, entertain and bring people together. I’m excited about helping Nick Woodman and GoPro’s board guide the company.  I’m also excited about how much I can learn about visual communication from the GoPro team and the millions of people around the world who use GoPro hardware, software and platforms to capture and share the most important moments of their lives.
There’s never been a more exciting time to be at GoPro - joining the team at GoPro is an extension of what I’ve done throughout my whole career, and I’m proud to be here. 
 
– Lauren Zalaznick

During her tenure at NBC (nbc), two popular Bravo reality shows, Project Runway and Top Chef, scored numerous Emmy nominations with Top Chef winning the Emmy in 2010.Zalaznick is also a board member of television ratings company The Nielsen Company (nielsen), music app company Shazam, and Penguin Random House.

Her move is noteworthy given the dearth of women on the boards of major companies.According to the research group LedBetter, which compiles statistics on gender on the leadership teams of 230 companies that account for around 2,000 consumer brands, only 21% of those companies had women on their executive teams or boards.Security company Palo Alto Networks (panw), business software company Apigee (apic), supply-chain business Flextronics (flex), and data analytics company Hortonworks (hdp) are a couple of technology companies without female board members, according to a recent University of California, Davis study on women business leaders.Before Twitter (twtr) went public in 2013, the company was criticized for not having a female board member. Soon after, Twitter installed a publishing executive named Marjorie Scardino to its board.Diversity has become a hot topic for many technology companies facing pressure to release workforce demographics that seem to confirm that women and minorities are typically underrepresented.Meanwhile, GoPro’s has had a rough couple of quarters with declining sales of its action-cameras, a delay of a long-anticipated drone, and layoffs. The company has been trying to branch into the video and entertainment business, which Zalaznick’s experience at NBC could help with.For more about GoPro, watch:"Her broad experience and perspective will influence GoPro's evolution as an entertainment company and will benefit our business strategy overall,” GoPro CEO Nicholas Woodman said in a statement.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

Lauren Zalaznick to Leave NBCUniversal

Lauren Zalaznick 








New hire and former Univision Networks president Cesar Conde is set to absorb many of her responsibilities, with Zalaznick set to stay on to transition her portfolio.

Lauren Zalaznick is out at NBCUniversal.
The 12-year company veteran was a top cable operator at NBCU, overseeing a female-friendly portfolio of networks including Bravo, Oxygen and now-defunct Style until February of this year. At that time, her channels were absorbed by fellow cable exec Bonnie Hammer, and Zalaznick was moved into more of a strategic role. With NBCU executive vp as her title, she was charged with accelerating growth for the company portfolio by identifying and executing on new business opportunities.
STORY: Style Network to Take Over Style, Not G4

“Those of you who know Lauren well know she is one of those rare executives that combines great creative instincts with a true business orientation,” NBCU CEO Steve Burke wrote in an internal memo announcing the news of her departure Friday. According to sources close to Zalaznick, who has been described as both a powerful tastemaker and a quirky intellect, she likely will return to an operator role of some sort. It's not clear exactly what that next step will entail, though she has been quietly dabbling in the startup space, where she is either advising or investing in a handful of companies. 
Many of her current NBCU responsibilities will be assumed by new hire Cesar Conde, who joined the company in mid-September as an executive VP reporting to Burke. (Exceptions include Fandango, which will be shifted to a film group overseen by recently promoted Jeff Shell.) Zalaznick will stay on to help transition her current portfolio and then will remain affiliated with the company as a consultant on digital media content and technology marketplace trends for a period of time.
In making his early 2013 announcement, which made Zalaznick more of a behind-the-scenes suit than the high-profile programmer she had been, Burke touted her as an exec who "loves ideas and new ways of doing things. She also is innovative, energetic and focused on growth." Over the past six months, her gig has entailed such things as establishing the company’s first data science team and forming the NBCU Digital Council to focus on the impact of emerging global trends. 
Driven at least in part by fear of losing Zalaznick or Hammer following the Comcast/NBCU merger, Burke had elevated both execs to chairmen and split the cable portfolio between them. Zalaznick, who was often credited with cementing Bravo as a destination for upscale females, with juggernaut franchises including The Real Housewives and Top Chef, added Style, Telemundo and Mun2 to her purview.
She joined the company in 2004, after the acquisition of Vivendi Universal Entertainment, where she had been president of the TRIO network since February 2002. Zalaznick launched her TV career at VH1 in 1994, where her on-air credits include included Pop Up Video, Divas: Live and the VH1 Fashion Awards, after a stint in the independent film world.
STORY: Jeff Shell Moving to Universal Studios, Adam Fogelson Out
Zalaznick's departure comes some three weeks after NBCUniversal made a series of high-profile executive changes. Universal Studios chairman Adam Fogelson was ousted as Comcast vet named Shell vice chairman, with former co-chair Donna Langley upped to chair and Ron Meyer named vice chairman of NBCU. Over on the TV side, the Style network got a surprise reboot (it's now the Esquire network), and the cable group reshuffled its execs. Jeff Wachtel and Frances Berwick added new networks to their portfolio, while former Oxygen president Jason Klarman was let go.
Below is the text of the memo Burke sent the staff.
I am writing to let you know that Lauren Zalaznick will be leaving NBCUniversal after 12 successful years working in a variety of leadership roles here.
Those of you who know Lauren well know she is one of those rare executives that combine great creative instincts with a true business orientation. Her contributions to our company have been significant and far-reaching, from cable entertainment to Spanish-language broadcast, from digital initiatives to new marketing campaigns. Lauren also has been an important champion for many of our company-wide initiatives.
Moving forward, most of Lauren’s current group including Lori Conkling, Tony Cardinale, Nick Lehman and Lenore Moritz will report to Cesar Conde. Russell Hampton (Consumer Products) and Paul Yanover (Fandango) will report to Jeff Shell. John Shea and the Integrated Media group will report solely to Linda Yaccarino.
Lauren will remain at the company to transition her current portfolio, and then consult with NBCUniversal on digital media content and technology marketplace trends.
I want to thank Lauren for her years of service. Her drive to innovate, her energy and her intelligence have made our company a better place. She has been an important member of our team and we wish her well in the future.
