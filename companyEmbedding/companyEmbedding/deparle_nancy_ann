Education and personal life[edit]
Nancy-Ann Min was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Rockwood, Tennessee, where she graduated from Rockwood High School.[4][5] Her mother died of lung cancer when Nancy-Ann was 17.[6]
She attended the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where her major was history and her senior thesis was entitled "Uncle Sam, Hirohito, and Resegregation: The Tule Lake Segregation Center, 1943-1946." She was awarded a B.A. degree with highest honors and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and selected as a Phi Kappa Phi scholar.[5] She was the first female president of the University of Tennessee student body and was a member of the Gamma Alpha chapter of Delta Gamma. In 1978 Glamour magazine named her one of the year's top ten college women.[5]
After graduating from Tennessee, she enrolled in Harvard Law School, but interrupted her studies there when she was awarded a Rhodes scholarship. As a Rhodes scholar, she went to Balliol College of Oxford University, receiving a B.A. from Oxford in 1981.[5][6] After returning to Harvard, she earned a J.D. degree in 1983.[5]
She is married to Jason DeParle, a reporter for The New York Times.[7] She has two sons.
She has Chinese ancestry.[8]
Career[edit]
DeParle was a partner at the law firm of Bass, Berry & Sims in Nashville before serving as commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Human Services in the cabinet of Governor Ned McWherter from 1987 to 1989.[5]
DeParle has also served as a trustee at the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a research fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and a fellow at the Wharton School of Business. She has also been a Commissioner on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC). In November 2011, DeParle was included on The New Republic's list of Washington's most powerful, least famous people.[9]
Corporate connections[edit]
DeParle has drawn criticism for her lucrative service on corporate boards after her tenure in the Clinton administration. Msnbc.com reported that she was paid more than $6 million, and served as a director of half a dozen companies that faced federal investigations, whistleblower lawsuits and other regulatory actions. Many of these companies have a stake in the health care reform that she led.[10]
She served as a director of Accredo Health Inc., Boston Scientific, Cerner Corp., DaVita, Guidant, Medco Health Solutions, Speciality Laboratories, and Triad Hospitals. She was a managing director of CCMP Capital.[11]

She served as the director of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) from 1997 to 2000, administering the Medicare program for the Clinton administration, and before then worked at the Office of Management and Budget.

Education and personal life[edit]
Nancy-Ann Min was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Rockwood, Tennessee, where she graduated from Rockwood High School.[4][5] Her mother died of lung cancer when Nancy-Ann was 17.[6]
She attended the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where her major was history and her senior thesis was entitled "Uncle Sam, Hirohito, and Resegregation: The Tule Lake Segregation Center, 1943-1946." She was awarded a B.A. degree with highest honors and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and selected as a Phi Kappa Phi scholar.[5] She was the first female president of the University of Tennessee student body and was a member of the Gamma Alpha chapter of Delta Gamma. In 1978 Glamour magazine named her one of the year's top ten college women.[5]
After graduating from Tennessee, she enrolled in Harvard Law School, but interrupted her studies there when she was awarded a Rhodes scholarship. As a Rhodes scholar, she went to Balliol College of Oxford University, receiving a B.A. from Oxford in 1981.[5][6] After returning to Harvard, she earned a J.D. degree in 1983.[5]
She is married to Jason DeParle, a reporter for The New York Times.[7] She has two sons.
She has Chinese ancestry.[8]
Career[edit]
DeParle was a partner at the law firm of Bass, Berry & Sims in Nashville before serving as commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Human Services in the cabinet of Governor Ned McWherter from 1987 to 1989.[5]
DeParle has also served as a trustee at the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a research fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and a fellow at the Wharton School of Business. She has also been a Commissioner on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC). In November 2011, DeParle was included on The New Republic's list of Washington's most powerful, least famous people.[9]
Corporate connections[edit]
DeParle has drawn criticism for her lucrative service on corporate boards after her tenure in the Clinton administration. Msnbc.com reported that she was paid more than $6 million, and served as a director of half a dozen companies that faced federal investigations, whistleblower lawsuits and other regulatory actions. Many of these companies have a stake in the health care reform that she led.[10]
She served as a director of Accredo Health Inc., Boston Scientific, Cerner Corp., DaVita, Guidant, Medco Health Solutions, Speciality Laboratories, and Triad Hospitals. She was a managing director of CCMP Capital.[11]

Education and personal life[edit]
Nancy-Ann Min was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Rockwood, Tennessee, where she graduated from Rockwood High School.[4][5] Her mother died of lung cancer when Nancy-Ann was 17.[6]
She attended the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where her major was history and her senior thesis was entitled "Uncle Sam, Hirohito, and Resegregation: The Tule Lake Segregation Center, 1943-1946." She was awarded a B.A. degree with highest honors and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and selected as a Phi Kappa Phi scholar.[5] She was the first female president of the University of Tennessee student body and was a member of the Gamma Alpha chapter of Delta Gamma. In 1978 Glamour magazine named her one of the year's top ten college women.[5]
After graduating from Tennessee, she enrolled in Harvard Law School, but interrupted her studies there when she was awarded a Rhodes scholarship. As a Rhodes scholar, she went to Balliol College of Oxford University, receiving a B.A. from Oxford in 1981.[5][6] After returning to Harvard, she earned a J.D. degree in 1983.[5]
She is married to Jason DeParle, a reporter for The New York Times.[7] She has two sons.
She has Chinese ancestry.[8]
Career[edit]
DeParle was a partner at the law firm of Bass, Berry & Sims in Nashville before serving as commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Human Services in the cabinet of Governor Ned McWherter from 1987 to 1989.[5]
DeParle has also served as a trustee at the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a research fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and a fellow at the Wharton School of Business. She has also been a Commissioner on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC). In November 2011, DeParle was included on The New Republic's list of Washington's most powerful, least famous people.[9]
Corporate connections[edit]
DeParle has drawn criticism for her lucrative service on corporate boards after her tenure in the Clinton administration. Msnbc.com reported that she was paid more than $6 million, and served as a director of half a dozen companies that faced federal investigations, whistleblower lawsuits and other regulatory actions. Many of these companies have a stake in the health care reform that she led.[10]
She served as a director of Accredo Health Inc., Boston Scientific, Cerner Corp., DaVita, Guidant, Medco Health Solutions, Speciality Laboratories, and Triad Hospitals. She was a managing director of CCMP Capital.[11]

Nancy-Ann DeParle, one of the nation’s leading experts on healthcare and regulatory issues, was President Obama’s deputy chief of staff for policy and one of his most senior advisors. From 2009–2011, she served as counselor to the president and director of the White House Office of Health Reform, where she led the efforts on healthcare reform, including the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. DeParle was often called the president’s health reform “czar,” and she helped write the sweeping law. Obama considered her input so pivotal he hailed her as one of the “unsung heroes” of his health reform team. Karen Dynan, vice president of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said, “Nancy-Ann played a leading role in one of the most significant pieces of social legislation in a generation,” and according to TIME, “DeParle is universally known in healthcare-policy circles as one of the brightest minds of her generation.”
In 2011, DeParle was promoted to assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff. In that role, she oversaw the development and implementation of all policy and regulatory matters for the White House, including energy, environment, education, manufacturing, economic policy, and more. Exclusively represented by Leading Authorities speakers bureau, DeParle discusses the long-term effects of the Affordable Care Act with an insider’s view of how it came to be, where the ‘bodies are buried,’ and what implementation will likely look like. She also addresses healthcare trends or the nitty gritty in issues like Medicare payment methodologies or healthcare delivery system reform.
Additionally, DeParle offers a unique perspective on the current political environment. She speaks to the esoterica of budget negotiations, the politics of a divided Congress, and how President Obama will likely to approach major issues. After leaving the White House, DeParle served as a lecturer in law at Harvard Law School and a guest scholar in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. She is currently a partner at healthcare-focused private equity firm Consonance Capital.
A Healthcare Calling. DeParle’s interest in paying for healthcare comes from experience. She was only a teenager when her mother was diagnosed with aggressive lung cancer. Her mother continued working through her treatments so she could hang onto her job-sponsored health insurance. This led her to devote her life toward becoming a health policy expert, a feat she certainly accomplished. Before her time in the Obama administration, DeParle worked in the White House budget office under President Bill Clinton and was one of his point people on the 1990s attempt at healthcare reform. Serving as the associate director for health and personnel at the Office of Management and Budget, she handled budgets for federal healthcare programs and took on the task of managing Medicare and Medicaid as the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Early Career. DeParle was the first woman elected student body president at the University of Tennessee, for which Glamour magazine named her one of 1978’s top 10 college women. After graduating from Harvard Law School, Governor Ned McWherter appointed her to lead the Department of Human Services, making her the youngest Cabinet secretary in Tennessee history. As commissioner, she saw firsthand the healthcare system’s impact on workers and families. Continue Reading »

The Affordable Care Act and the Transformation of American Healthcare. As the woman whose influence helped write and pass the legislation, DeParle discusses the long-term effects of the Affordable Care Act with an insider’s view of how it came to be, where the ‘bodies are buried,’ and what implementation will look like. DeParle knows the ins and outs of this 900-page bill like no other speaker on the lecture circuit and tailors her talks to cover the issues important to her audience. She addresses why President Obama took on healthcare during his first term, what the system looked like before the ACA, the logic (and compromise) behind the current legislation, the changes and ramifications of the Act, and what problems the bill solves in American healthcare. She also discusses issues like current healthcare trends, whether the Department of Health and Human Services and the IRS are ready to administrate the new system and how states are handling setting up the marketplaces and exchanges. In her talk, DeParle covers healthcare from several points of view – from working with Congress and the president, to healthcare administrators and current patients.
Domestic Policy During the Obama Administration. Nancy-Ann DeParle is a leading expert on policy issues and a unique perspective on the political environment. As the Obama’s former deputy chief of staff, she oversaw all policy and regulatory matters for the White House, including energy, environment, education, national security, manufacturing, economy, and more. The most senior female member of the Obama administration, DeParle has great insights into the political landscape and the role of the White House in the current legislative climate. She tackles the audience’s selected topic areas and outlines Obama’s likely approach to major agenda issues in his second term, speaking to issues like the esoterica of budget negotiations, the politics of a divided Congress, the ramifications of policy decisions, and the behind-the-scenes happenings at the White House.
Regulatory Policy and Obama’s Approach to Regulation. Part of DeParle’s job as the White House deputy chief of staff was determining – on behalf of the president – which regulations passed and which ones did not. The general criterion for those that did was that it created jobs, but oftentimes, their necessity was more nuanced. DeParle outlines the Obama administration’s approach to regulatory policy and how she viewed the pros and cons of specific regulations. A former Harvard Law professor on the subject, she addresses how regulatory policy affects businesses and the economy.
The Future of Entitlements. Nancy-Ann DeParle has experience both managing entitlements (both the programs and their budgets) and affecting reform policy under Presidents Clinton and Obama. In this presentation, she outlines how the ACA affects entitlements for both current and future program participants, discusses the costs of the programs, how they could be improved, and the ramifications of any changes, in terms of cost controls or eligibility requirements. DeParle also looks at the politics behind healthcare and current industry trends to address where the future of entitlements in America is headed, for better or worse. Continue Reading »

Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                By Nancy-Ann DeParle  By Nancy-Ann DeParle  May 9, 2013      Nancy-Ann DeParle was assistant to the president and deputy White House chief of staff for policy from February 2011 to January 2013. From March 2009 to February 2011, she was counselor to the president and director of the White House Office of Health Reform.    For more than 100 years, leaders from both parties struggled to bring affordable health care to all Americans. When President Obama took up the fight, many people predicted defeat. Three years, 34 repeal votes, one Supreme Court decision and a presidential election later, some are questioning whether government is capable of implementing the historic law. Concern is understandable: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) transforms a health-care system that accounts for one-sixth of the U.S. economy and is central to our lives. But recent history shows that big changes in health-care policy can be implemented. The worries being voiced are familiar to those who follow health-care policy. They’re certainly familiar to me. I became the administrator of Medicare and Medicaid in 1997, just as Congress passed the most sweeping changes in Medicare’s history. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 cut nearly $400 billion from providers such as doctors, hospitals and nursing homes; cracked down on waste and fraud; created a new Medicare HMO program; and launched the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) with a goal of covering millions of uninsured children.  Even members of Congress who voted for the law soon questioned whether it could work. Critics said that it was too big and complicated, that payment reductions would drive doctors and hospitals out of business and strand senior citizens without care, and that states would not cooperate in enrolling children in CHIP. Some predicted a Y2K crisis that would cripple government computers. In fact, the law saved billions more than originally projected and extended the life of the Medicare “trust fund” by almost a quarter-century. We modernized payment systems and cut Medicare waste and fraud nearly in half. Millions of children in every state were insured thanks to CHIP.         1 of 42       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                         Skip Ad   ×           Tom Toles on health care      View Photos   A collection of cartoons on the debate.

A few years later, similar doubts surrounded the launch of two Republican initiatives: President George W. Bush’s Medicare prescription drug plan and Mitt Romney’s health-care reform in Massachusetts. Today, the Medicare prescription drug benefit helps millions of seniors, and the Massachusetts plan is a model for the nation.  Soon the Affordable Care Act will add a new chapter to this history of real-world success. Critics say the law is complex. They are right. When Obama first took office, 51 million Americans were uninsured, premiums had more than doubled in the preceding decade, and insurers could deny coverage to those who needed it most. If easy solutions existed, someone would have found them long ago.  The ACA tackles these problems. It provides near-universal coverage by requiring everyone who can afford coverage to have it; expanding Medicaid for the poorest and subsidizing those who are low-income or whose employers do not provide coverage; and creating online “health insurance marketplaces” where consumers and small businesses can shop for private plans competing on price and quality. Much has been made of the states that have not established marketplaces. Governors who chose to sit on the sidelines made the wrong call, but the federal government is ready to step in. Working with insurers, states and others, the Obama administration has been quietly testing the new system — tapping many of the officials who helped implement the Balanced Budget Act and the Medicare drug benefit — to ensure that it works. And although public discussion of the ACA has been contentious, I have been part of pragmatic, behind-the-scenes conversations with state officials and businesspeople invested in the law’s success. Critics say the law fails to bring down health-care costs. A review of the facts is in order. If you get insurance at work, the new law will not disrupt your coverage or make it more expensive. And premiums will fall for the overwhelming majority of consumers in the new marketplaces as coverage expands, administrative costs are reduced and discrimination based on gender and age is curbed. In 2014 alone, 6 million Americans will get tax credits, making health insurance more affordable.  The law includes virtually every big idea put forward to promote efficiency, such as rewarding doctors and hospitals for their quality — not quantity — of care. These policies are making a difference: Over the past three years, health-care costs have grown at their lowest level in 52 years. Reforms such as the penalties to hospitals with too many preventable readmissions are reducing spending. Skeptics ask whether consumers will buy insurance when the marketplaces open. A four-year partisan campaign to confuse the American people about “Obamacare” hasn’t helped the enrollment effort, and Congress has denied the Department of Health and Human Services the resources it needs to inform the American people about the law. Private organizations such as Enroll America are working to fill the gap. Insurance companies also have added incentives to compete for new customers. Amid predictions of failure, reforms that were unthinkable a few years ago are already the law of the land. Just ask the 6 million young Americans insured through their parents’ plans, thanks to the ACA. Large-scale change is never easy. But recent health-care reforms have outperformed their critics. When the Affordable Care Act does the same, Obamacare will have completed its journey from a pitched partisan battle to a national point of pride.   Read more at PostOpinions:   Robert J.

Education and personal life[edit]
Nancy-Ann Min was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Rockwood, Tennessee, where she graduated from Rockwood High School.[4][5] Her mother died of lung cancer when Nancy-Ann was 17.[6]
She attended the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where her major was history and her senior thesis was entitled "Uncle Sam, Hirohito, and Resegregation: The Tule Lake Segregation Center, 1943-1946." She was awarded a B.A. degree with highest honors and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and selected as a Phi Kappa Phi scholar.[5] She was the first female president of the University of Tennessee student body and was a member of the Gamma Alpha chapter of Delta Gamma. In 1978 Glamour magazine named her one of the year's top ten college women.[5]
After graduating from Tennessee, she enrolled in Harvard Law School, but interrupted her studies there when she was awarded a Rhodes scholarship. As a Rhodes scholar, she went to Balliol College of Oxford University, receiving a B.A. from Oxford in 1981.[5][6] After returning to Harvard, she earned a J.D. degree in 1983.[5]
She is married to Jason DeParle, a reporter for The New York Times.[7] She has two sons.
She has Chinese ancestry.[8]
Career[edit]
DeParle was a partner at the law firm of Bass, Berry & Sims in Nashville before serving as commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Human Services in the cabinet of Governor Ned McWherter from 1987 to 1989.[5]
DeParle has also served as a trustee at the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a research fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and a fellow at the Wharton School of Business. She has also been a Commissioner on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC). In November 2011, DeParle was included on The New Republic's list of Washington's most powerful, least famous people.[9]
Corporate connections[edit]
DeParle has drawn criticism for her lucrative service on corporate boards after her tenure in the Clinton administration. Msnbc.com reported that she was paid more than $6 million, and served as a director of half a dozen companies that faced federal investigations, whistleblower lawsuits and other regulatory actions. Many of these companies have a stake in the health care reform that she led.[10]
She served as a director of Accredo Health Inc., Boston Scientific, Cerner Corp., DaVita, Guidant, Medco Health Solutions, Speciality Laboratories, and Triad Hospitals. She was a managing director of CCMP Capital.[11]

Education and personal life[edit]
Nancy-Ann Min was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Rockwood, Tennessee, where she graduated from Rockwood High School.[4][5] Her mother died of lung cancer when Nancy-Ann was 17.[6]
She attended the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where her major was history and her senior thesis was entitled "Uncle Sam, Hirohito, and Resegregation: The Tule Lake Segregation Center, 1943-1946." She was awarded a B.A. degree with highest honors and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and selected as a Phi Kappa Phi scholar.[5] She was the first female president of the University of Tennessee student body and was a member of the Gamma Alpha chapter of Delta Gamma. In 1978 Glamour magazine named her one of the year's top ten college women.[5]
After graduating from Tennessee, she enrolled in Harvard Law School, but interrupted her studies there when she was awarded a Rhodes scholarship. As a Rhodes scholar, she went to Balliol College of Oxford University, receiving a B.A. from Oxford in 1981.[5][6] After returning to Harvard, she earned a J.D. degree in 1983.[5]
She is married to Jason DeParle, a reporter for The New York Times.[7] She has two sons.
She has Chinese ancestry.[8]
Career[edit]
DeParle was a partner at the law firm of Bass, Berry & Sims in Nashville before serving as commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Human Services in the cabinet of Governor Ned McWherter from 1987 to 1989.[5]
DeParle has also served as a trustee at the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a research fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and a fellow at the Wharton School of Business. She has also been a Commissioner on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC). In November 2011, DeParle was included on The New Republic's list of Washington's most powerful, least famous people.[9]
Corporate connections[edit]
DeParle has drawn criticism for her lucrative service on corporate boards after her tenure in the Clinton administration. Msnbc.com reported that she was paid more than $6 million, and served as a director of half a dozen companies that faced federal investigations, whistleblower lawsuits and other regulatory actions. Many of these companies have a stake in the health care reform that she led.[10]
She served as a director of Accredo Health Inc., Boston Scientific, Cerner Corp., DaVita, Guidant, Medco Health Solutions, Speciality Laboratories, and Triad Hospitals. She was a managing director of CCMP Capital.[11]

She served as the director of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) from 1997 to 2000, administering the Medicare program for the Clinton administration, and before then worked at the Office of Management and Budget.

Education and personal life[edit]
Nancy-Ann Min was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Rockwood, Tennessee, where she graduated from Rockwood High School.[4][5] Her mother died of lung cancer when Nancy-Ann was 17.[6]
She attended the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where her major was history and her senior thesis was entitled "Uncle Sam, Hirohito, and Resegregation: The Tule Lake Segregation Center, 1943-1946." She was awarded a B.A. degree with highest honors and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and selected as a Phi Kappa Phi scholar.[5] She was the first female president of the University of Tennessee student body and was a member of the Gamma Alpha chapter of Delta Gamma. In 1978 Glamour magazine named her one of the year's top ten college women.[5]
After graduating from Tennessee, she enrolled in Harvard Law School, but interrupted her studies there when she was awarded a Rhodes scholarship. As a Rhodes scholar, she went to Balliol College of Oxford University, receiving a B.A. from Oxford in 1981.[5][6] After returning to Harvard, she earned a J.D. degree in 1983.[5]
She is married to Jason DeParle, a reporter for The New York Times.[7] She has two sons.
She has Chinese ancestry.[8]
Career[edit]
DeParle was a partner at the law firm of Bass, Berry & Sims in Nashville before serving as commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Human Services in the cabinet of Governor Ned McWherter from 1987 to 1989.[5]
DeParle has also served as a trustee at the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a research fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and a fellow at the Wharton School of Business. She has also been a Commissioner on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC). In November 2011, DeParle was included on The New Republic's list of Washington's most powerful, least famous people.[9]
Corporate connections[edit]
DeParle has drawn criticism for her lucrative service on corporate boards after her tenure in the Clinton administration. Msnbc.com reported that she was paid more than $6 million, and served as a director of half a dozen companies that faced federal investigations, whistleblower lawsuits and other regulatory actions. Many of these companies have a stake in the health care reform that she led.[10]
She served as a director of Accredo Health Inc., Boston Scientific, Cerner Corp., DaVita, Guidant, Medco Health Solutions, Speciality Laboratories, and Triad Hospitals. She was a managing director of CCMP Capital.[11]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
