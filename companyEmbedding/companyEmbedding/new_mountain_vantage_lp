*Generally, New Mountain Senior Advisors are similar to "Operating Partners" who provide general or specific industry expertise on particular projects or transactions.  All persons listed in the Senior Advisors (Full Access) category are designated “access persons” pursuant to Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and are subject to New Mountain’s Code of Ethics, which therefore allows them to be fully included in New Mountain’s investment reviews.  Based on a variety of factors, the Senior Advisors for Special Projects (Matthew Ebbel, Judd Gregg and Frederic Salerno) are designated as “non-access persons” and are not subject to New Mountain’s Code of Ethics, which results in more limited or specialized roles.   List does not include Robert Grusky, who is non-exclusive to New Mountain.  Additionally, Robert Grusky is engaged in unrelated investment activities in connection with his own firm.

Private Equity


Strategy   |   Portfolio Companies







New Mountain’s private equity funds seek to acquire the highest quality leaders in carefully selected "defensive growth" industries, and then to build those businesses. The firm generally seeks to acquire just three or four companies each year, typically in the $100 million to $1 billion enterprise value range, and generally invests $100 million to $500 million per transaction.
Read More...New Mountain’s past and present portfolio companies are described on this website and are generally characterized by:

Market leadership in sustainable and noncyclical growth niches
High barriers to competitive entry
Strong downside protection in all reasonable worst-case scenarios
The opportunity for substantial value creation due to rapid growth or to special factors existing at the time of the investment

New Mountain emphasizes growth and business building, rather than excessive risk and debt, as the best path to private equity returns. The firm generally uses debt moderately (and in some cases, has used no debt at all) and New Mountain has never had a private equity portfolio company bankruptcy or missed an interest payment. We have consistently identified industries top down and proactively before an auction process began.
Once an investment is made, New Mountain works to help management add value to these companies, in order to create much larger and more profitable "new mountains" in their own industries.
Chief executives of New Mountain portfolio companies have been strong references for our Firm, and the variety of ways that New Mountain has helped management teams add value include:

Providing growth capital
Increasing management ownership
Developing and supporting new growth strategies
Seeking out, supporting and executing add-on acquisitions
Recruiting high quality board members
Strengthening management teams
Supporting technology and infrastructure upgrades
Supporting increased research and development
Making high level sales contacts on the company's behalf
Establishing strong financial Wall Street coverage and support
Establishing improved financial systems and controls

Since inception, New Mountain Capital has raised over $15.0 billion of committed capital across five private equity funds. We are currently investing capital committed to our fifth fund, New Mountain Partners V, during the first close. Our firm has been awarded numerous “private equity firm of the year” and similar honors since our founding in January 2000.
