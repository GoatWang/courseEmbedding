Refrigeration Innovation

Our commercial refrigeration products are built to precisely control climate conditions in facilities such as restaurants, warehouses and data centers. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. We offer everything from evaporators and air-cooled condensing units to off-site monitoring systems, walk-in coolers and customized climate-control equipment for all your commercial refrigeration needs. Though these products all have their own unique function and application, each has one thing in common—a commitment to customer satisfaction. Our focus on your needs is what makes us the best at what we do. 
Heatcraft Refrigeration manufactures refrigeration products for our family of four market-leading brands: Bohn, Larkin, Climate Control and Chandler. Also included in our product lineup is InterLink™ Parts, a one-source supplier of commercial refrigeration parts.

A stainless steel cabinet option and a stainless steel drain pan option are available on low- and medium-profile unit coolers, as well as center mounts and large unit coolers. The stainless steel evaporators are offered on Bohn, Larkin, Climate Control, and Chandler lines. The units are resistant to corrosion and are easy to clean, which results in an added sanitary feature, the company says. The stainless steel cabinet option is excellent for wine rooms, food processing, pharmaceuticals, biomedical, and other applications, states the manufacturer. The units include a stainless steel external cabinet, drain pan, hanger brackets, and external fasteners, all of which are constructed of 20-gauge stainless steel.
