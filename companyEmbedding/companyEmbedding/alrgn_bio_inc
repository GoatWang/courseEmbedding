Alrgn Bio develops patented non-GMO food processing technologies to reduce allergens in peanuts and tree nuts. Its first solution to be commercialized, Safer Peanut™, is a revolutionary post-harvest enzymatic process that safely deactivates dangerous allergens in peanuts. Independent testing shows the deactivation of up to 99%+ of the key allergenic proteins. Safer Peanuts look, crunch, taste, and process like non-treated peanuts. Food companies currently sell an estimated $20+ billion of peanut based foods in the US each year. By licensing our Safer Peanut process, these companies can extend current product lines and/or develop new categories of allergen reduced foods (e.g. peanut butter, peanut flour, airline snacks, candy, cookies, breakfast cereals, energy bars, protein drinks, etc.). These new reduced allergen product lines will create higher profit margins and deliver larger market share, while promoting safer environments (schools, airplanes, restaurants, stadiums, etc.) for those with peanut allergies.
Peanut-based foods have been banned in many public spaces (schools, airplanes, etc.). We believe that a new food category of Safer Peanutbased products will allow food companies to differentiate their products and regain access to these markets. Safer Peanuts will also provide restaurants and other venues that currently serve unsafe peanuts an inexpensive alternative that will mitigate legal liability. 
The Role
The Senior Research Officer position is currently available at Alrgn Bio. The primary purpose of this position is to continue research to optimize enzyme-based treatment processes to reduce allergens in peanuts, tree nuts and other food products. Alrgn Bio, Inc. develops and commercializes patented food processing technologies to reduce allergens in foods. Its first commercialized solution, Safer Peanut, is a revolutionary post-harvest enzymatic process that safely deactivates dangerous allergens in peanuts. This role will be fulfilled in the research triangle of Greensboro, Raleigh, and Durham.
Responsibilities

October 2, 2014
The world’s first commercially available allergen-reduced peanuts have officially emerged from the laboratory. 
Alrgn Bio, exclusive licensee of the allergen-reduced process patented by North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, has opened an office in the Gateway University Research Park.  Batches of peanuts are available to the food industry for evaluation, Alrgn announced today.
“We have received tremendous interest since we announced in June that the technology is available,” said Johnny Rodrigues, Alrgn founder.
“We will work with food processors and manufacturers to establish this process as the industry standard for peanuts and peanut-derived ingredients. We’ll work together to deliver safer peanut products to consumers as quickly as possible.”
Alrgn made the announcement Thursday at its demonstration facility at the Gateway University Research Park in Greensboro, North Carolina. Alrgn is a spin-off of N.C. A&T and Xemerge, the North Carolina- and Toronto-based technology development company that originally licensed the A&T peanut technology.  
Rodrigues introduced the new company to the news media and food industry executives along with two members of his executive team: Dr. Jianmei Yu, Alrgn’s chief scientist, leader of the research team that developed the technology, and research professor in the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences at A&T; and Dr. Ann Russell, Alrgn’s director of U.S. operations.
“It is very gratifying to see the results of our research being brought to the marketplace for the benefit of individuals and families whose lives are affected by peanut allergies,” Dr. Yu said.
“We will expand from the allergen-reduced peanut project to develop additional products that will benefit consumers, agriculture and the food industry.”
The allergen-reduced peanut technology is one result of N.C. A&T’s strength in agriculture and particularly post-harvest technology. As a land-grant university, A&T has been a historic leader in agriculture research. Today, the university’s School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences has expertise in biotechnology, agricultural and biosystems engineering, natural resources management, waste management, and food microbiology. It is the largest school of its kind at a historically black university.
A&T’s agricultural research projects include the Center for Excellence in Post-Harvest Technology at the North Carolina Research Campus in Kannapolis. The center adds value to agricultural commodities by finding ways to make food safer, to extend shelf life and to preserve health-promoting nutrients. Its research focuses on developing and testing functional foods, isolating and characterizing health-promoting food components, and improving processes to control spoilage and foodborne pathogens.

Alrgn Bio Inc., a startup company based at the Gateway University Research Park in Greensboro, has raised $946,188 in equity financing to help fund additional testing on the company's technology aimed at reducing allergens in peanuts, hire a chief science officer, buy equipment and compensate a lead researcher at N.C. A&T State University.
The company announced the equity financing as part of a Form D filing. Alrgn Bio is pursuing its safer-peanut technology at a time when "more people in the world are becoming allergic to peanuts," said New York real estate developer Kit McQuiston, who also is CEO of Alrgn Bio and based in Manhattan.

"It's the leading cause of anaphylactic food related deaths," McQuiston said.




McQuiston told Triad Business Journal that Alrgn Bio hopes to eventually commercialize its technology, which could be licensed by food manufacturers and food companies that in turn would create a safer peanut for everything from a snack served to airplane passengers and a peanut butter used in schools to a breakfast bar and a weightlifting powder.
"People who normally eat peanuts now wouldn't care but the restaurant owner would be happier because his liability just dropped significantly," McQuiston said. "I would imagine that large companies would find this helpful as sort of a brand extension or really the creation of a new (food) category."




 


A small portion of the $946,188 worth of funding will go to sponsored research at N.C. A&T and the compensation of Jianmei Yu, a Ph.D research scientist at N.C. A&T whose work on peanut allergen reduction resulted in a patent that was licensed to Alrgn Bio for commercialization.
Alrgn Bio's testing thus far has shown that the technology has dramatically reduced —in some cases "99 percent plus" — the proteins that humans are allergic to in peanuts, he said. The technology involves a process of taking peanuts and placing them in a large hot bath of water with some food enzymes, which break down the proteins. Alrgn Bio will focus on additional research at UNC-Chapel Hill, where the company plans to conduct tests on mice, which have been sensitized to simulate how a child with peanut allergies would react to the proteins.

"After that it goes to human oral challenge and then we will be able to license it to food companies," McQuiston said.
McQuiston said the company was founded about three years ago. He got involved two years ago because his daughter is allergic to peanuts. He is not taking a salary for his job as CEO. "Our focus is to keep the burn rate low and (placing) all the resources in proving out the technology," he said.
The company was recently featured in a New York Times story titled "Is it Possible to Make a Less Allergenic Peanut?"

Aaron Ward  |  11 November 2016 |  7,238  Angry Birds 2 Review                 Angry Birds 2 delivers a follow up that beats all the predecessors and brings the series the past glory. It’s back in all of the pig-smashing splendor, and ready to make you rush into the new adventure.                        Read More     Angry Birds 2 delivers a follow up that beats all the predecessors and brings the series the past glory. It’s back in all of the pig-smashing splendor, and ready to make you rush into the new adventure. Graphics 5/5 The graphics in Angry Birds 2 are greatly improved. The game is lavishly colored, beautifully polished, and with detailed and lively animation. Backgrounds are richer in detail, explosions are bigger, and the characters are much more emotive, especially with a picture-in-picture close-ups which show the bird grimacing in anger and the pigs quivering in fear. Angry Birds 2 provides you with a great three-dimensional experience as the good flings can result in both pigs and debris flying directly at the screen. Gameplay 4,5/5 Angry Birds 2 is very similar to what we have seen before in the series. The green pigs are back at talking your eggs, and your goal is to rescue these unborn birds by flinging fowl at annoying swine and their unsteady structures. You will have a score based on your performance, which also determines how many stars you receive at the end of the level. As it was in the previous iteration, each bird comes with the specific abilities triggered by tapping on the screen in mid-flight. The red bird sends a blow to everything in front of it, the yellow one can fly faster, the white one throws an egg bomb, the smaller blue bird splits into three, and the new gray character flies straight down and smashes the opponents. Controls 5/5 If you lived under a rock or just stepped out of a time machine, you would surely need the control tips. But, anyway, we are going to remind you: birds get revenge on the pigs by loading themselves into slingshots and flinging into the structures pigs hang out in. Once you popped all the pigs, you proceed to the next level and do it again.  Replay Value 5/5 Angry Birds 2 has 240 stages to play so that you won’t run out of fun. Besides, there is also a new feature called Arena, which allows you to play for as long as your birds will last you. Then, you can compare high scores with your friends and see who is the true master of the perch. This time, Rovio brings a randomization to the levels as the starting arrangement of the structures, pigs and birds will change with each retry. Thus, the same level will look differently every time you load it. This feature has a drastic impact on the way you play as you won’t be able to watch the video tutorial if you get stuck. Now you’re forced to think over the level from scratch. In-app purchases Angry Birds 2 doesn’t ask for one-time payment or make the game free with ads. Instead, Rovio decided to take advantage of the in-game currency system. The game uses gems, which can quickly become necessary as the levels get more difficult. If you don’t finish your levels successfully, you run out of lives and at some point without enough gems you will have to wait 30 minutes to keep playing. Thus, to get more lives immediately, or repeat the lost game, you’ll need to buy gems for actual money. The flow of free gems slows down after some time, so you will have to accomplish objectives, complete daily challenges and watch ads to get them with no charge. Conclusion Angry Birds 2 lives up to its billing as a numerical sequel, and despite limited lives, it won’t disappoint the gamers with polished-up graphics and the new challenges it has to offer. Rovio has done a good job to make Angry Birds 2 the best entry in the series so far.  Collapse               Conclusion The enhanced graphics, new challenges, and finessed gameplay bring you plenty of reasons to put all your eggs in Angry Birds 2's basket.    Pros : Great visuals; Evolving levels; 240 stages.    Cons : Paid life system.

This definition often means that the game cannot attract new fans and keeps up due to the old loyal audience, but Clash of Clans is not the case. The game was launched in August 2012 (for iOS devices) and in October 2013 (for Android). Even if you have never played it actually, you might have seen its aggressive ads within different apps. Now it’s stable, and each CoC update only brings bug fixes. Still, it doesn’t take everyday innovations to attract about 200-300 million users!                        Read More     Now that Clash of Clans had been time-tried long enough, this game can be referred to as mobile RTS classics. This definition often means that the game cannot attract new fans and keeps up due to the old loyal audience, but Clash of Clans is not the case. The game was launched in August 2012 (for iOS devices) and in October 2013 (for Android). Even if you have never played it actually, you might have seen its aggressive ads within different apps. Now it’s stable, and each CoC update only brings bug fixes. Still, it doesn’t take everyday innovations to attract about 200-300 million users! Graphics 10/10 Any Clash of Clans review should start with praising its graphics. The developers have made it rich and spectacular, but action scenes don’t turn to the usual mayhem we see in mobile strategies. The buildings and the units are easy to distinguish, the text part is well readable, and pictograms are easy to remember and tap when necessary. The app looks great both on phone screens and on tablets, though, if you own both, we’d recommend using the tablet. Full HD or QHD screens bring you the pleasure of making out the game details, but even usual HD screens we see in cheaper devices are able to retranslate what Clash of Clans looks like. Another difference is made by forced screen mode, portrait on smartphones and landscape on tablets. In fact, the experience on Android and iOS devices is virtually the same (unless you're using an Android device with obsolete hardware). Though older versions of Clash of Clans apps are still available through third-party sites, stable work is not granted. Gameplay 10/10 Like in most strategy games, in Clash of Clans you have to rule your kingdom and upgrade its industry, its agriculture and its army. The further you go, the more powerful enemies you have to fight and the harder tasks to fulfill you run into. There are three kinds of resources in this game: gold, elixir and crystals. While the first two is renewable and producible, crystals only can be received as rewards for your achievements (rare enough) or bought in the game store. The resources are complementary: it takes Elixir to upgrade your gold mines, and Gold to accelerate Elixir production. The army is produced in Barracks and stored in Army Camps defining the maximum capacity.  The more Camps you have, and the more advanced they are, the more troops you can send against your enemy. War is necessary as necessary are the trophies. You’ll have to wait too long until you mine enough gold to upgrade your Town Hall even to Level 3. Military part is made simple enough, yet it takes some good reaction and calculation. Select the place for your troops to land outside the red line bordering the enemy camp and watch them attack the closest targets. Their behavior is sometimes illogical; for example, troops attack and crash the walls to get to the target directly, instead of passing it even if it saves time. Just accept it as a feature. You can attack both trolls led by AI or real players in PvP mode. Remember: it's an open world, so you can be the attacker as well as the target. New users get a 3-day protection that makes them invisible to others. But as it expires, other players become able to attack you. So take care of your protection and build some defensive forces like Cannons, Archer Towers, and don’t neglect Walls and Bombs! If you don’t intend to spend real money on green stones, you’d better spend it on an external battery. To accelerate the processes, you’ll have to use many crystals, and if you choose not to accelerate, you’ll have to wait while the time ticks in the background. Though the app doesn’t have to run in the foreground (unlike Pokémon Go), it will notify you about its processes. Though CoC download is free and so is the gameplay, you’ll have to purchase crystals if you want to succeed in your ruling. There’s no way to cheat; though Clash of Clans cheats are promoted on many sites, all these efforts are blocked on the server side. By the way, didn’t we mention that the game requires an active Internet connection? Controls 10/10 Like in good old PC strategies, you don’t have to master strange moves or commands. Touchscreens do not allow grabbing a group of units by a frame, but you don’t have to at all. You have a great lot of buttons instead, leaving no option in most situation. Collect elixir or gold, produce troops, send them to fight the enemy, build a new gold mine or Elixir storage; you’ll have no place to mistap. The game doesn’t force you to the only right way, but you can only make strategical mistakes, not gaming errors. A little pleasant thing is Layout Editor that allows you editing your layouts and thus change your gaming experience. Replay Value 5/10 Yes, you can start your promotion right from the beginning by starting a new game. But tell me with your right hand on Sid Meier’s Civilization: will you? As your progress is constantly saved in the cloud and bound to your Google/Apple account, you don’t have to start it from the very beginning. The space to progress ahead is unlimited. The only reason to start the game again is your decision to quit it and pass your device with your account to someone else. But look, if you present or sell your smartphone or tablet to someone, they certainly will reset it with their own accounts and start their own game, right? So we imagine no practical need to replay Clash of Clans anew. The Bottom Line The game seems one of the best in its category. Brilliant graphics, advanced social part, multilingual interface, large tech tree and other features of a good strategy game are all here.  Collapse               Conclusion If you need a part of your life you’ll give an hour or two daily (at least), Clash of Clans is a good choice, with good graphics, exciting gameplay and a great chance to test yourself in virtual battles.    Pros : Detailed and easy to master graphics; Advanced social features; Interface designed for touchscreen devices; Layout editor.

Antoine DeGrasse |  21 September 2016 |  881,587  Pokemon Go – Worth Catchin' Em All?                 For many fans of the popular animation series, the release of Pokemon Go creates quite an interesting future for mobile users. For anyone looking to try out the new Pokemon Go game, you might find this page useful. We're going to break down the overall quality of the Pokemon Go app so that you can see if it's worth your time or not. Hopefully, this can help you decide whether you want to get involved or not.                     Read More     For many fans of the popular animation series, the release of Pokemon Go creates quite an interesting future for mobile users. For anyone looking to try out the new Pokemon Go game, you might find this page useful. We're going to break down the overall quality of the Pokemon Go app so that you can see if it's worth your time or not. Hopefully, this can help you decide whether you want to get involved or not. Functionality – 10/10 The functionality of the app is simple – go and catch Pokemon! You'll follow a range of different features across the map until you come across the Pokemon you want to catch. Since you need to use the real world around you, the functionality has been made to be as perfect as possible. Now, you should have no problems linking up your phone with the app. Since it tracks things even for the smallest and most remote of towns, Pokemon Go has wonderful functionality. It's easy to use and offers simple management of its various features and add-ons. Design – 10/10 The design of the layout is nice and simple, too. Whilst it might not accurately portray the exact roads of your location, meaning you need to know where you're walking, it offers lots of great extra. For example, the design makes it easy to get to all of the various features and to see what is going on around you. With clear indicators of stopping points and gyms, you'll have no problem finding your friends for a quick chat, trade and battle. The design is excellent and really makes buying into the world around you a fair bit easier. Usability – 8/10 Using the app is quite simple, too. Whilst it will take a few days of looking in each menu and getting to use with the context of everything you are being asked, it's certainly not impossible. Therefore, the usability of this app is more or less where I was hoping that it would be. It's easy to control and get around the menus, and the offers you need are just what you expect to see. This ensures that, in time, you'll start to see impressive new features and not have a problem using them, such is the ease of use. The usability is set to improve when new extras are added. Cross-platform usage – 10/10 This works across other platforms, yes. This makes it nice and easy to manage your Pokemon as you would have hoped for and expected, and also ensures you can work with your mates and other trainers no matter what system they are using. In-app purchases You can purchase certain add-ons from inside the Pokemon Go app, such as Lure sets. Lure sets are used to make it easier to find Pokemon in your area, but they will cost you a few dollars to buy. For those who live in rural areas with not much activity, or for those constrained by time and location, these are excellent solutions. Not only will this help you catch the kind of Pokemon that you were hoping for, it'll make it so much quicker to hunt down, appreciate and fully diversify the Pokemon that you are going to be running around with. If you find that minimal amounts and similar styles of Pokemon continue to appear, this might help you avoid that problem altogether. With the in-app purchases, you can make it quite easy to manage the world around you as you see fit. The Bottom Line To conclude, Pokemon Go looks to be everything people are talking about. Lots might be put off by the fact you need to be outside and it could become quite time-addictive, but it is a lot of fun to play. Not only will you find that the numerous Pokemon and Pokemon-related features are cool, but it makes a whole new style of the mobile game come to life. This is quite a unique approach and given the size of the label it is attached to, Pokemon, it really is no surprise that this has exploded into such a vibrant program. If you want something fun and exciting that ensures you can begin to get to grips with the world of Pokemon accordingly, this is definitely worth your time trying it out. It adds fun and flavor to your smartphone and helps people make gaming a bit more social and adventurous than before. Pokemon GO pushes a strong social function onto the gaming and makes it easier for people to get out and have fun. The game is deeply addictive and makes it easier than ever for players to engage with their local surroundings. With hot spots in every town that Pokemon Go works in, you'll find it easier than ever to have a new activity to enjoy taking part in.  Collapse               Conclusion Pokemon Go is a deeply satisfying product that tied up social engagement with major franchises. The ease of walking around and getting fit as you go makes Pokemon Go an easy product to turn around and enjoy using in the future for all. It's easy to understand and appreciate, though this means for casual gamers without much time flexibility, this one might be a toughie to get used to playing on a regular basis.     Pros : Easy to get into and a whole lot of fun; Suitable for nostalgic or children who are just getting into Pokemon; Provides only the classic Pokemon, saving it from feeling oversaturated; More or less impossible to finish – will take you longer than the servers are likely to be up for!   Cons : Deeply addictive! One of the hardest games out there to put down.  A little challenging to get used to; Hard to make progress in; Rewards players slowly.

Sims FreePlay: Seems Like Classic Sims                 The Sims FreePlay is a life simulation game from the popular The Sims series; unlike the other games in this series, this has been created for mobile games and the classic The Sims gameplay has been redesigned to suit mobile devices. Players create and care for their Sims as they go through life and age. This free to play game uses real-time to dictate the actions of Sims and the player needs to issue all instructions to their Sims.                        Read More     The Sims FreePlay is a life simulation game from the popular The Sims series; unlike the other games in this series, this has been created for mobile games and the classic The Sims gameplay has been redesigned to suit mobile devices. Players create and care for their Sims as they go through life and age. This free to play game uses real-time to dictate the actions of Sims and the player needs to issue all instructions to their Sims. Graphics 8/10 Despite being a mobile game, it has brilliant graphics that are close to the quality seen in the main games. It looks more like a 'top-down' game, however, this is not the case as the camera can easily be zoomed in and panned around the house. Everything in the game looks fantastic on mobile devices and follows the classic Sims graphics seen in the other games. Not only does Sims FreePlay work incredibly well on mobile devices, it's almost perfectly brought a free version of The Sims to mobiles; this is a great way to experience The Sims while away from a PC or console, however, it does have some downsides. While the game does feature a cash store, there's no need to ever actually buy anything; all gameplay impacting items that can be bought in the cash store can also be purchased with in-game money. The only downside to this, however, is the fact that it takes much longer to purchase these items and the player will need to do quite a bit of grinding. The only items in the cash store that can not be purchased anywhere else are clothing items; these are not needed to progress through the game and the free store already offers quite a lot of options to select from. The game uses real-time for everything and waiting for long periods at a time can be very annoying; as the game progresses more Sims are unlocked which helps with this issue slightly. The biggest annoyance due to this, however, is the fact that the game is constantly running, the Sims are always waiting for the player to command them and will not do anything for themselves. It gives the player more responsibilities about making sure they go to work on time and that they have their basic needs met. Gameplay 7/10 The game features a good tutorial at the start of the game to introduce the player to the mobile orientated game mechanics and controls; it's relatively simple with the classic pinching to zoom and pivoting to move the camera angle. The game features a clear UI that is easy to understand and use which allows for a smooth gaming experience. While the game doesn't feature the same high levels of customization seen in the main games, it does have high customization for a mobile game. Players can design and customize their own Sim from a range of pre-selected faces and various other physical attributes. In addition to this, there's a wide range of clothing items to select and most are available for free. More customization items are unlocked over time as the player levels up however, there are also items which can be bought with the game's premium currency. Being a game in the Sims series means that, the player can also construct and fully customize houses to their own design; there is a large range of items and furniture which can be bought and placed anywhere inside of the various houses in the game. Building the house is similar to the main games, the player can adjust room size and also more intricate details such as flooring. Controls 7/10 Controlling the Sims is pretty simple, they can be directed to walk to specific locations and to do certain actions by tapping. It works in a similar way to the main games and the control mechanics have been nicely transferred to mobile devices. Just like with the main games, Sims in this game have specific needs that must be filled to keep them happy and alive. However, Sims do not have any individual interests, skills or desires which means the player can have them do anything without consequences. They can also be given a variety of jobs which each starts at different times, the player needs to manually get them ready for work and then send them to work. As the game progresses more workplaces and shops can be built around town; this costs simoleons and lifestyle points, however. Sims can form friendships and romantic relationships with other Sims in the town; they can marry, move in together, have sex and have children just like in the main games. Any children a couple has are also customizable and fully controllable by the player. It's not just positive relationships Sims can form, they can become enemies and hate each other which can cause them to physically fight when provoked. Replay Value 6/10 The game is played entirely in real-time, every action a Sim takes exactly the same length in real-time; this includes when the player sends their Sim to sleep. When one Sim is sleeping, another one may still active for the player to control and play with; the main Sims games feature a fast-forward mechanic to skip long actions such as going to work. However, this game doesn't include this feature. As the player levels up, more of the game unlocks including the ability to have more Sims; a total of 34 Sims are unlocked across the game and each one is completely controllable by the player. There is no autonomy in the game and Sims will not do anything unless they are instructed to do so by the player, the game is also constantly running when the player is away from the game. This means that Sims will not care for themselves in any way and can potentially die if left alone for too long In-app purchases   Verdict The Sims FreePlay is a free-to-play mobile game from the popular Sims series; it follows the iconic gameplay seen in the life simulation series where the player creates and cares for their Sims. EA has released several mobile titles in The Sims series and FreePlay is potentially the best one from the group for a multitude of reasons.  Collapse               Conclusion Sims FreePlay brings the best of The Sims to mobiles but it does fall victim to the most frustrating 'feature' seen in most mobile games: the focus on real-time for completing actions.    Pros : Lots of customization; Can have children; Classic Sims gameplay.   Cons : Expensive ingame items; Long wait times; Forced to build houses; Large download.
