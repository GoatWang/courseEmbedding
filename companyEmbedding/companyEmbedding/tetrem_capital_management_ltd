 Educational Background



 
Class of 2006 


Dalhousie University

                  Dalhousie University (commonly known as Dalhousie or Dal) is a public research university in Nova Scotia, Canada, with three campuses in Halifax, and a fourth in Bible Hill. Dalhousie offers more than 4,000 courses and 180 degree programs in twelve undergraduate, graduate, and professional faculties. [3] The university is a member of the U15, a group of research-intensive universities in Canada.

Dalhousie was established as a nonsectarian college in 1818 by the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie, after whom the university was named. The college did not hold its first class until 1838, until then operating sporadically due to financial difficulties. It reopened for a third time in 1863 following a reorganization which brought a change of name to "The Governors of Dalhousie College and University". The university had formally changed its name to "Dalhousie University" in 1997 through provincial legislation, the same legislation which had merged the institution with the Technical University of Nova Scotia.

The Dalhousie library system currently operates the largest library in Atlantic Canada, as well as holds the largest collection of agricultural resource material in the region. The university operates a total of fourteen residences. There are currently two student unions that represent student interests at the university, the Dalhousie Student Union, and the Dalhousie Association for Graduate Students. Dalhousie's varsity teams, the Tigers, compete in the Atlantic University Sport conference of Canadian Interuniversity Sport. Dalhousie’s Faculty of Agriculture varsity teams are the Dalhousie Rams, and compete in the ACAA and CCAA.

Dalhousie is a coeducational university with more than 18,000 students and over 110,000 alumni. Notable alumni include government officials, academics, business leaders and 89 Rhodes Scholars. The university ranked 244th in the 2013 QS World University Rankings,[4] 251-275th in the 2012-2013 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[5] and 201–300th in the 2012 Academic Ranking of World Universities.[6] Dalhousie is a centre for marine research, and is host to the headquarters of the Ocean Tracking Network.                





 Career History



Vice President of Investments

                                    2010 - Current                


Tetrem Capital Management Ltd. (US)


                  Tetrem Capital Management (TCM) focuses on investments in large-cap Canadian and US equities. The firm employs a contrarian value style investment approach that seeks to identify and invest in the stocks of undervalued companies. TCM utilizes methods such as reversion to the mean and margin of safety when making investment decisions. The firm's investment approach  that focuses on Canadian and US equities. The firm offers the following investment strategies: Tetrem Canadian Equity (invests 100% in large cap Canadian equities); Tetrem Canadian Equity Plus (invests up to 70% in large cap Canadian equities and up to 30% in large cap US equities); Tetrem US Equity (invests 100% in large cap US equities); Tetrem US Plus (invests 80% in large cap US equities and 20% in large cap Canadian equities); Tetrem Canadian Dividend (invests in 100% large cap Canadian equities for dividend income and growth); Tetrem US Dividend (invests in 100% large cap US equities for dividend income and growth). TCM identifies investment candidates from a combination of quantitative screens, thematic views and fundamental analysis. They then perform fundamental, bottom-up research in order to gauge the controversy surrounding candidates, determine an estimate of the fair value for each, and develop an investment thesis in which they outline reasons to own, what to watch for, and a target price. Candidates are monitored continuously and tactically rebalanced as their valuations fluctuate around the TCM's estimate of their fair value.TCM's investment strategies are based on quantitative models, as well as well-defined and methodical fundamental research. Their core quantitative model ranks companies based on several characteristics including valuation and earnings quality. Each characteristic is scored independently, based on multiple factors, and is ranked within their research universe. This results in one broad composite score that combines all of the characteristics and the factors that comprise them.The firm's security selection process begins with quantitative analysis. Their quantitative analysis is complementary to the fundamental analysis TCM performs on all of the companies assessed in their equity selection process. The firm's fundamental analysis includes an in-depth review of the business of the company, its strategy, the competitive environment, regulatory environment, product and industry position, as well as analysis of the company's financial health. This process serves to either confirm or refute findings generated through TCM's quantitative analysis.

 Educational Background



Bachelor's Degree in Economics 


Trinity College

                  Trinity College looks like a traditional New England liberal arts school.

But we act in some untraditional ways.

Our commitment to urban-global education, for example, is groundbreaking, as is our interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program and our First-Year Program, one of the earliest in the nation. We have also just added more than 20 young teacher/scholars to our faculty, and our faculty across the board is committed to collaboration with students on real-world research projects.

We continue to re-examine and transform the concept of liberal arts education because our graduates expect to thrive and to have a serious effect on the world.

Trinity’s 10:1 student/faculty ratio means access to teachers who have time to discuss your term paper in person, encourage your research project, and celebrate your success on Commencement Day. Choose from 38 academic majors in the liberal arts and sciences, including one in engineering, another program that is not traditional for a college like Trinity. Twenty-six interdisciplinary minors like human rights, Jewish studies, and African American studies give you even more choices.

World-wide study abroad, courses that include interaction with the city around us, and for-credit academic internships give you experience beyond the classroom.

And yes, our campus is beautiful in a traditional New England-college way—100 green acres dotted with historic buildings—and it’s located in an interesting place, Connecticut’s state capital, the city of Hartford. It’s home to 2,300 students from 45 states and 47 countries who connect to the College and each other through 100 student organizations, 29 NCAA Division III athletic teams, internships, and volunteer projects.

You can learn about all of this here on our Web site—academics, athletics, student activities, and more—but the best thing is to visit Trinity and see for yourself. Campus visits are conducted year-round, and you are always welcome
