Bigfoot Project Investments mission is to create exciting and interesting proprietary investment projects and entertainment properties surrounding the mythology, research, and potential capture of the creature known as Bigfoot. The Company performs research in determining the existence of an elusive creature commonly called Bigfoot. Bigfoot Project Investments plans to establish itself as the most reliable and dependable source for materials including documentaries, physical evidence, and eye witness accounts for the purpose of documenting the evidence of the existence of Bigfoot. 

The Company's Searching For Bigfoot Team conducts Bigfoot hunting expeditions. The team travels across the country investigating, interviewing, surveying sighting locations and following up on current and past Bigfoot sightings and encounters. Expeditions include exploring remote wilderness locations where the creature has been sighted. These expeditions have produced extensive hours of raw footage which can be used for movie development. Negotiations have been initiated with 3D Movie production companies to produce a movie called "Bigfoot 3D". Established production companies with affiliated networks are also being sought to work on a new reality based Bigfoot Hunt show.

The Company's purpose is to focus all our projects into one public company. We have consolidated projects into one investment marketing  plan, which we believe could be more effective than a single plan, thereby increasing the overall profits of the projects than if they were individually marketed. 

We will create investment project entertainment properties surrounding the mythology, research and hopefully, capture the creature known as Bigfoot. Become an entertainment investment company, where our competitive advantage is our developed knowledge base and the advanced level of maturity of our projects. 

We intend to capitalize on the "Searching for Bigfoot Inc." current stockpile of projects through agreements; allowing our company to continue creation of media properties and the establishment of physical locations, partnerships and alliances with organizations to augment investment markets to create revenue as a stand-alone enterprise.

Bigfoot To Enter The Market

Bigfoot Project Investments, Inc. is about to add some mystery to the U.S. stock market by becoming a publicly traded company after years of small-time operations.

	The company, owned by Carmine Biscardi, will follow in the footsteps of Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) by filing an IPO under the 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.

	The law allows emerging growth firms with less than $1 billion in annual revenue to host an initial public offering. Bigfoot Project more than qualifies with just $6,324 worth of sales and assets, mostly garnered by making movies selling DVDs.

Big Money For Bigfoot

	In its filing with the SEC, Bigfoot Project said it hopes to raise $3 million, which the business will used to expand its movie making business and to âcapture the creature known as Bigfoot.â

	Several other Bigfoot themed businesses have been able to raise substantial amounts of money from supporters of the search, but the Bigfoot Project will be the first to aim for such a large sum.

Bigfoot Or Big Flop?

	The venture is unlikely to garner much cash, though. Many Bigfoot enthusiasts say the Biscardiâs company makes a mockery of what they consider to be a serious pursuit.

Related Link: Brands Of Pot Emerge As The Industry Grows

	In the past, Biscardi has been chastised by his peers after his sightings didnât pan out, with some calling his company a mere publicity stunt. Investors who donât believe Bigfoot exists are also expected to shy away as without the possibility of the creatureâs capture on the table, the company is generating most of its revenue from DVD sales.

	Still, some die-hard believers in the elusive Sasquatch may be willing to cough up the cash in hopes that Biscardi will finally capture Bigfoot.

	BIGFOOT PROJECT INVESTMENTS, INC.






	NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS







	NOTE 1 Â SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	Organization, Nature of Business and Trade Name






	A summary of significant accounting policies of Bigfoot Project Investments, Inc. (the ÂCompanyÂ), a company organized in the state of Nevada, is presented to assist in understanding the CompanyÂs financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the companying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the CompanyÂs management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity.





	The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 30, 2011. The companyÂs administrative office is located at 570 El Camino Real NR-150, Redwood City, CA and its fiscal year ends July 31. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was established as an entertainment investment company.





	The CompanyÂs mission is to create exciting and interesting proprietary investment projects, entertainment properties surrounding the mythology, research, and potential capture of the creature known as Bigfoot. The Company will perform research in determining the existences of an elusive creature commonly known as Bigfoot. For the past six years the research team, that has joined the company, has performed research on expeditions throughout the United States and Canada.





	The CompanyÂs key competitive advantage is the in-house developed knowledge base and the advanced level of maturity of their projects developed and currently owned by our current officers and shareholders. The Company will capitalize on the current stock pile of these projects through contract agreements which will allow the Company to continue creation of media properties and the establishment of physical locations, partnerships, and strategic alliances with organizations to augment investment markets to create revenue as a stand-alone enterprise.






	Basis of Presentation






	The accompanying unaudited balance sheet as of January 31, 2017 has been derived from the audited financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited financial statements and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (ÂGAAPÂ) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (ÂSECÂ) for interim financial statements. In the opinion of management such unaudited information includes all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of this interim information. Operating results and cash flows for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the entire year. The information included in this report should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2016 filed on SEC website on December 8, 2016.






	NOTE 2



	Â

	GOING CONCERN






	The CompanyÂs financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of American applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does not have significant cash or other current assets, nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern.





	Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.





	The ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.






	6










	In the coming year, the CompanyÂs foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and payment of expenses associated with operations and business developments. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.





	Historically, it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds such as shareholder loans and advances to finance its operation and growth. Management may raise additional capital by future public or private offerings of the CompanyÂs stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The CompanyÂs failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.






	NOTE 3 Â ADVANCE FROM SHAREHOLDERS






	In the six months ending January 31, 2017, additional advances from shareholders were received in the amount of $28,588. The Company was able to reimburse advances of $15,578 to shareholders in the quarter ending January 31, 2017. These advances bear no interest and are due on demand. The total advances from shareholders as of July 31, 2016 were $17,681 and as of January 31, 2017 were $30,691.






	NOTE 4 Â PROMISSORY NOTE Â RELATED PARTY






	In January 2013, Bigfoot Project Investments, Inc. executed a promissory note in the amount of $484,029 as part of the asset transfer agreement for the transfer of all assets held by Searching for Bigfoot, Inc. In August 2013, the Company increased the balance of the promissory note by $489 to add an asset that was not included in the original transfer The terms of the note are that the unpaid principle and the accrued interest are payable in full on January 31, 2016. The holders of this note have agreed to execute a new due date of January 31, 2018.





	The interest rate stated on the note is 4.0% (four percent). Monthly payments are not required in the note; however, the note does contain a prepayment clause that allows for payments to be made prior to the due date with no detrimental effects. The Company paid 12,148 toward the principle of the note during the period ending January 31, 2017.





	Interest expense for the six months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016 was $9,681 and $9,680, respectively.






	NOTE 5



	Â

	CAPITAL STOCK






	As of September 13, 2016, a new S1 registration was declared effective. The second offering provided for 20,000,000 shares at a share price of 0.75 cents. No shares have been sold from this offering.





	The Company has 208,717,000 and 217,317,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of July 31, 2016 and January 31, 2017, respectively.





	On November 26, 2016 the Company entered into a rescission and release agreement with the Advisors (see Note 6 Â Advisory Agreements) whereby the Company agreed to issue 900,000 and 200,000 shares of its common stock as full satisfaction of the Advisory Agreements.





	On November 18, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with FMX Media Works (the ÂMarketing Consultants) to provide Marketing advisory services to the Company.

FMX Media Works is required to provide management consulting, business development services, strategic planning, marketing and public relations. The Company recognized stock compensation of $750,000 pursuant to the advisory agreements for the quarter ending January 31, 2017.






	NOTE 6 Â ADVISORY AGREEMENTS






	On May 1, 2016, the Company entered into two agreements with Surf Financial and William Hiney (collectively, the ÂAdvisorsÂ) to provide advisory services to the Company. Compensation under each agreement was contingent upon each AdvisorÂs performance for an initial six-month period expiring on November 2, 2016 (the ÂContingency PeriodÂ).






	7










	Specifically, under each agreement, respectively, the Advisors were required to provide management consulting, business development services, strategic planning, marketing and public relations. If in the initial six-month contingent period, each Advisor was required to provide its or his best efforts to provide the advisory services described in each agreement; otherwise, the Company in its sole and absolute discretion could unilaterally cancel the agreements at the end of the Contingency Period and each agreement would be automatically null and void thereby terminating entirely the AdvisorsÂ right to compensation. As compensation, the Company shall issue to the Advisors 4,000,000 shares and 1,000,000 shares, respectively, of restricted common stock, subject to rescission and redemption at the end of the Contingency Period by the Company. The value placed upon the shares was $0.10 per share as this was considered fair value of the CompanyÂs common stock based upon its recently completed S-1 offering registered with the SEC. Fair value of the shares to be issued pursuant to the agreements was $500,000. The company recognized stock compensation in the amount of $250,000 which represents the fair value of the vested shares from May 1, 2016 through July 31, 2016.






	NOTE 7 Â CONVERTIBLE NOTE

	OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK







	Background






	In January 2013, Bigfoot Project Investments Inc. acquired all the assets of Searching for Bigfoot Inc. Since the majority shareholder of Searching for Bigfoot, Inc. is also the majority shareholder in Bigfoot Project Investments Inc. the asset acquisition was treated as a related party transaction and was not considered an armÂs length transaction under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.





	The assets acquired were transferred over at the existing book value listed on the balance sheet of Searching for Bigfoot, Inc. at the time of transfer. The transfer agreement called for the issuance of 4,400,000 shares of common stock which were valued at $.10 per share and the issuance of a promissory note in the amount of $484,029. The Company recorded a deemed distribution related to this transaction in the amount of $924,029. In August 2013, the Company increased the promissory note by $489 to add an asset that was not included in the original transfer. The Company paid $12,148 toward the principle of the note during the period ended January 31, 2017.





	As part of the asset transfer agreement Bigfoot Project Investments, Inc. received the following assets:





	Footprint cast of Bigfoot Â 73 original casts


	Photographs of Dead Creature from Strickler, Arkansas 1994 Dear Creature Incident


	109-inch Skeleton


	Various Media Artifacts Â Video TV News Media Â 52 news stories


	Contract to sell Dinosaur fossil Â most recent estimate by Paleontologist $1.2 million dollars


	Rubber suit from 2008 hoax






	9










	Various DNA samples Â Hair, and nails


	License to use 6 dinosaur displays


	Exclusive rights to the Bigfoot Website


	Exclusive rights to the Bigfoot Live Radio Show


	Exclusive rights to the Bigfoot Live Radio Show Website


	360 hours of raw footage from expeditions for movie development


	Various DVD Movies and Documentary film projects


	Exclusive rights to all current contracts negotiated under Searching For Bigfoot, Inc.





	The above list is a complete list of the fixed assets for Bigfoot Project Investments, Inc.





	We are a company who has, over the past year, developed nine DVD Movies; eight of which have been completed for distribution and one which is currently in the final stages of completion for distribution. We have established a contract with a Media Marketing Distribution Company (The Bosko Group), who has contracted six of the nine DVD movies to their distribution agents. We are a company with only minimal revenues to date: we have minimal assets, and have incurred losses since inception.





	Bigfoot Project Investments Inc. plans to establish itself as the most reliable and dependable source for materials including documentaries, physical evidence, and eye witness accounts for the purpose of documenting the evidence of the existence of Bigfoot. Our major source of revenue will be the sale of documentaries and specials that follow our progress. We have found that there is a market for these films and have started selling them on a semi-regular basis. In addition to the film sales we plan on having expeditions to locations where there have been multiple eye witness accounts as well as periodic exhibitions of the physical evidence that has been accumulated. We plan on focusing our efforts on expeditions to locations that have had multiple eye witness reports to maximize the chances of locating the creature and producing films that will be marketable to the public.






	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS






	During the three months ended January 31, 2017, we generated revenue of $269. During the three months ended January 31, 2016, we generated revenue of $256.





	During the six months ended January 31, 2017, we generated revenue of $1,570. During the six months ended January 31, 2016, we generated revenue of $1,616.





	Operating expenses during the three months ended January 31, 2017 were $779,452. Operating expenses during the three months ended January 31, 2016 were $4,331.





	Operating expenses during the six months ended January 31, 2017 were $1,035,239. Operating expenses during the six months ended January 31, 2016 were $17,244. Operating expenses for the six months ended January 31, 2017 consisted of consulting fees of $1,000,000, professional fees of $21,235, Expedition expenses of $10,222 and general and administrative fees of $3,782. Operating expenses for the six months ended January 31, 2016 consisted of professional fees of $12,615 and general and administrative fees of $4,629. Expenses increased during 2017 mainly due to the consulting agreements and CompanyÂs reporting requirements, having become fully reporting under the 1934 Act on March 16, 2015 and on the over the counter market in August 2016.





	There is significant uncertainty projecting future profitability due to our history of losses and lack of revenues. In our current state we have no recurring or guaranteed source of revenues and cannot predict when, if ever, we will become profitable. There is significant uncertainty projecting future profitability due to our minimal operating history and lack of guaranteed ongoing revenue streams.







	Liquidity and Capital Resources







	As of January 31, 2017, we had $29,231 in cash and did not have any other cash equivalents. The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this Quarterly Report. To date, we have financed our operations through the issuance of stock and borrowings.

	Since inception, we have financed our cash flow requirements through issuance of common stock and debt financing. As we expand our activities, we may, and most likely will, continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations, pending receipt of listings or some form of advertising revenues. We anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations through additional common stock offerings, to the extent available, or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to augment our working capital.





	We anticipate that we will incur operating losses in the next twelve months. Our lack of operating history makes predictions of future operating results difficult to ascertain. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Such risks for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model and the management of growth. To address these risks, we must, among other things, obtain a customer base, implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy, continually develop and upgrade our website, provide national and regional industry participants with an effective, efficient and accessible website on which to promote their products and services through the Internet, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.







	Operating activities







	Net cash used in operating activities was $24,783 for the period ended January 31, 2017, as compared to $14,354 used in operating activities for the period ended January 31, 2016.







	Investing activities







	Net cash used in investing activities was $0 for the period ended January 31, 2017, as compared to $0 used in investing activities for the same period in 2016.







	Financing activities







	Net cash provided by financing activities for the period ended January 31, 2017 was $53,362 as compared to $14,326 for the same period of 2016.





	We believe that cash flow from operations will not meet our present and near-term cash needs and thus we will require additional cash resources, including the sale of equity or debt securities, to meet our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next 12 months. We will require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions, implementation of our strategy to expand our sales and marketing initiatives, increase brand awareness, or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our own financial resources and then current cash-flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.

	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.









	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk






	This item is not applicable as we are currently considered a smaller reporting company.









	Item 4T. Controls and Procedures








	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures







	Our Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, it was concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not designed at a reasonable assurance level and are not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECÂs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.







	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting







	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.







	Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures







	In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.










	PART IIÂOTHER INFORMATION









	Item 1. Legal Proceedings.






	We are not a party to any material legal proceedings.
