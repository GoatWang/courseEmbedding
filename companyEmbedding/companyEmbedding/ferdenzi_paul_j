Curtiss-Wright Names Paul J. Ferdenzi General Counsel And Corporate Secretary






GlobeNewswire



Mar 19, 2014 4:00 PM EDT













 




























































    CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 19, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Curtiss-Wright Corporation (NYSE:CW) today announced the promotion of Paul J. Ferdenzi to the position of Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary, effective immediately.  Most recently, he was Vice President, Human Resources of the Corporation since November 2011, and has also served as Associate General Counsel and Assistant Secretary since June 1999 and May 2001, respectively. He has been an executive officer since 2011.  "I am pleased to announce the well-deserved promotion of Paul Ferdenzi as Curtiss-Wright's next General Counsel and Corporate Secretary," said David C. Adams, President and CEO of Curtiss-Wright Corporation. "Paul possesses a breadth of experience across both our legal and human resources teams, providing a solid combination of senior management experience and leadership ability which will serve him well in his new role. This appointment reflects the continued dedication and energy that he brings to Curtiss-Wright and ensures that he will remain a valuable contributor to the organization."  Mr. Ferdenzi will continue to report directly to Mr. Adams. He is succeeding Michael J. Denton, who retired as Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, effective February 21, 2014, after serving in these positions with Curtiss-Wright since August 2001.  Mr. Ferdenzi joined Curtiss-Wright in June 1999 as an Associate General Counsel responsible for the Corporation's legal needs in the areas of employment, securities and real estate law. Prior to joining Curtiss-Wright, Mr. Ferdenzi was employed by the law firm of Gallagher, Briody & Butler, where he practiced law in the areas of securities, banking and finance, corporate governance, employment and real estate. Prior to that, he served four years (1993 - 1997) with the United States Navy in the Judge Advocate General's Corps ("JAGC"). He served in various capacities as a trial and appellate defense counsel and legal assistance attorney to the United States Naval Academy and the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.
