            which cleanser would I use it the anti again cleanser made me break out. I thought the rose stem cleanser. Do you think this would be gentle enough.
        


Asked by: Twyla

            Hi there!

While the Rose Stem Cell cleanser is slightly gentler, if you struggle with breakouts the Acne Clearing Wash might actually be the best cleanser for you. Hope this helps!

Sales vs. Marketing at SaaS Companies

Posted on July 4, 2014 by Douglas J. Roth  

It is amazing to me how many early-stage companies don’t really know the difference between sales and marketing, and therefore, aren’t able to drive or manage either exceptionally well.
My first job was as a Sales Rep. responsible for selling telecommunications transmission infrastructure equipment.  The difference between sales and marketing responsibilities was described to me in this way:
“Sales is getting rid of what we have;
Marketing is making sure we have what we can get rid of.”
Tomasz Tunguz of Redpoint Ventures had a great blog recently:  The Marketing Math Behind Scaling a SaaS Salesforce.  The focus is on the marketing side of the equation and the gist is that as a SaaS company scales, the company must begin to mechanize the sales process.  Mechanization is about making sure that not only has sales figured how to sell in an efficient, repeatable manner, but sales also has a pretty good idea of when more resources are needed and the level of production that can be expected by the addition of new sales reps.  Successful marketing is a prerequisite to this mechanization process.  Tomasz’s states, “In SaaS companies, one of the marketing department’s primary responsibilities is generating sufficient customer interest to enable the company to achieve their revenue targets.”  Said another way, marketing’s job is to get the snowball rolling down the hill, such that it collects more snow, grows in size, rolls faster, and gains momentum.
My dad’s retirement gift to himself was a John Deere tractor.  One of the attachments we use is a wood chipper.  The wood chipper runs off the drivetrain of the tractor.  Once you engage the wood chipper, the tractor engine starts spinning the wood chipper’s heavy flywheel with its teeth or blades.  It is the momentum of this spinning flywheel that enables you to chew-up and spit-out branches four inches in diameter or greater.  However, it takes some time for the flywheel to get up to cutting speed before the power of the system becomes truly impressive and productive.

SaaS businesses are a lot like a wood chipper.  It takes a lot of customers to generate the kind of momentum that generates truly impressive revenue generation.  The wood chipper will actually keep cutting for a time, even after the tractor is turned off.  Similarly, a SaaS business will continue to generate revenue, even if no new customers are added – although churn will slowly cause that revenue to diminish over time, similar to the flywheel slowing down and diminishing its cutting ability.
The mechanization of sales is no different than getting the flywheel of a chipper spinning at a fast-enough speed that it becomes an efficient cutting machine.  Marketing is the tractor drivetrain providing the power to the sales team.  There are a number of ways – or levers – marketing can help sales, and therefore the company, improve the rate of sales growth and ensure its sustainability.  Tomasz lays out some simple SaaS sales math that suggests some of these levers.
In a basic finance class at business school, we learned about one way to measure the success of a company and compare it to others operating in the same or other industries.  Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of the productivity or efficiency with which shareholders’ equity is employed, and is defined as the company’s net income divided by its shareholder equity.  This simple equation can be expanded into three financial ratios:  (1) Net Income/Sales; (2) Sales/Assets; and (3) Assets/Shareholders’ Equity.  These ratios are commonly referred to as (1) Profit Margin; (2) Asset Turnover; and (3) Financial Leverage.  This says that management has three levers for controlling ROE: (1) the earnings squeezed out of each dollar of sales; (2) the sales generated from each dollar of assets employed; and (3) the amount of equity used to finance those assets. (See Analysis for Financial Management, by Robert C. Higgins)
Just as there are various levers that can be adjusted to improve ROE, there are levers available to marketing to improve the SaaS math.  One lever Tomasz suggests, “Before investing heavily in growing a sales team, SaaS companies should understand if the marketing team can generate sufficient leads to feed the sales team’s pipeline.”  Marketing can take actions that increase the total number of leads in the pipeline.  But not all leads, however, are the same – Quality versus quantity.  By improving the quality of the leads before they eventually become sales’ responsibility, marketing is adjusting another lever at its disposal, one focused on improving the Lead-to-Close Success Rate.  Another lever, Average Selling Price, can also be manipulated to some degree by marketing.  Getting back to my early definition of marketing – making sure you have what you can get rid of – marketing must have a solid understanding of the needs of the market and develop a product roadmap that delivers a compelling solution to customers’ problems.  You can charge more if you can solve more of a customer’s problems.
I’ve seen far too many companies staff up well in advance of expected demand only to find demand never materialize or develop at a much slower pace.  The results are an increase in burn with no corresponding increase in revenue or customer adoption.  This generally doesn’t end well.  For SaaS companies in particular, we know ahead of time that it will take a while for sales momentum to grow.  But with a solid understanding of the distinct roles both sales and marketing can play in the organization, entrepreneurs can leverage their marketing team to create sales momentum.  Then you can feed your competition into the wood chipper…

So true – I can’t tell you how many software/SaaS developers I’ve talked to that don’t know the difference between sales and marketing. The simple way I think about it is that generally sales is driving short-term revenue, and marketing is teeing up what’s needed for long-term revenue

Thanks for your comment.  I totally agree with your description of marketing’s role. There is an even larger continuum that I think about (described in generalities, of course):  A company’s Labs are focused on scientific and technology research that will generate revenue 10+ years out; Product Development teams are developing product concepts and platforms that will generate revenue in 7+ years; the Corporate Venture arm is seeking revenues in 3 – 5 years; Business Development is developing partnerships, channels, and strategic relationships to resulting in revenue 2 – 4 years out; Marketing is teeing up revenue 1 – 3 years out; Sales is generating now – monthly, quarterly, and annually; and Corporate Development is able to purchase revenue streams across all these time periods.  In addition to “teeing up” revenue, marketing should also be making the sales job easier – higher qualified leads, leads primed to purchase, leads preferring your brand to others, etc.

            which cleanser would I use it the anti again cleanser made me break out. I thought the rose stem cleanser. Do you think this would be gentle enough.
        


Asked by: Twyla

            Hi there!

While the Rose Stem Cell cleanser is slightly gentler, if you struggle with breakouts the Acne Clearing Wash might actually be the best cleanser for you. Hope this helps!
