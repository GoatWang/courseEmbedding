Career[edit]
Bronson is a Director/Trustee of two publicly-traded real estate companies, Starwood Property Trust (NYSE: STWD), the largest commercial mortgage real estate investment trust in the United States and Colony Starwood Homes (NYSE: SFR), a nationally-recognized leader in the acquisition, renovation, leasing and management of single family homes.
Bronson served with Steve Wynn as a director of Mirage Resorts,[1] and was president of New City Development, a Mirage Resorts affiliate, as Wynn's representative for developments outside of the state of Nevada.[2][3]
Since 2000, Bronson has served as CEO of Beverly Hills-based The Bronson Companies, a real estate development firm. The company has so far developed over 100 office buildings and shopping centers nationally.[1][3] The Bronson Companies specializes in high-yield projects such office buildings, shopping centers, casino resort real estate development projects, entitlement management, and development consultation.[4] Bronson developed City Place, an office tower in downtown Hartford. At 1.2 million square feet and 38 stories, it is the largest and tallest office building in the state.[5]
Other ventures[edit]
Bronson was a founding partner in Monitor Productions, a joint venture with Main Events. Monitor Productions was a sports promotion company that developed the careers of boxers, including 1984 Olympic gold medal winners Mark Breland, Pernell Whitaker, Meldrick Taylor, and the former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield. The company promoted "Battle of the Ages" in 1991, a boxing event featuring George Foreman and Holyfield, which set a pay-per-view record and grossed over $80 million.[5]
Wynn and Donald Trump Atlantic City dispute[edit]
Bronson worked with the New Jersey Governor's Office on their initiative to build the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector, a $330 million road leading to a planned Mirage resort, in spite of the objections of Mirage’s competitors, including Donald Trump.[6] The dispute between Mirage and the Trump Organization escalated into a lawsuit and extensive legal battle that was ultimately dropped. Construction was completed in 2001. Wynn's interests were purchased by MGM Grand, Inc. and the plans for the development were changed.[7] The legal dispute between Wynn and Trump, including Bronson’s involvement, are detailed in Bronson's book The War at the Shore: Steve Wynn, Donald Trump and the Epic Battle to Save Atlantic City.[8] In spite of the dispute, Trump and Bronson became friends, with the help of the late Edward S. Gordon, founder of ESG, a commercial brokerage firm in New York City.[1]
