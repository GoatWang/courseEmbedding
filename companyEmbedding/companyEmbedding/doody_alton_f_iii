He has authored or co-authored Marketing in America, Retailing Management, and Reinventing the Wheels: Ford's Spectacular Comeback. He also wrote articles for The Harvard Business Review, the Journal of Marketing, and the Encyclopedia Britannica. Doody served as a trustee of Ohio Wesleyan University, the National World War II Museum (where he was one of the founders) and Loyola University in New Orleans. Also, as a senior fellow at the A.B.
