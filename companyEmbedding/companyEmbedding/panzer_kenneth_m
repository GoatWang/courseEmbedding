This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

@YourMamaTweets 





SELLER: Heidi KlumBUYER: Kenneth PanzerLOCATION: Los Angeles, CAPRICE: $24,000,000SIZE: 12,300 square feet, 8 bedrooms, 9.5 bathrooms
YOUR MAMA’S NOTES: Every property gossip on the planet has already discussed how supermodel turned Emmy-winning reality TV mogul Heidi Klum sold her 8.4 acre estate in a posh guard-gated enclave in L.A.’s quietly über-affluent Brentwood area for $24 million but Your Mama’s gonna weigh in anyways…
The German-born blond and her musician ex-husband, Seal, acquired the property out of foreclosure — if y’all can believe that — in December 2010 for $14,200,000. The $24 million recorded sale price means Miz Klum realized a small but proper $9.8 million fortune over the 3.5 years she owned the estate.







The buyer of Miz Klum’s estate shows up in property records as an obscurely named corporate entity so we did what we often do and queried well-informed Platinum Triangle real estate insider Peter Propertyseller who whispered to Your Mama that word on the real estate street is that the buyer of the Klum’s old krib is Kenneth Panzer, the well-compensated COO of a Southern California real estate conglomerate who, Your Mama’s research shows, already owns a 9,000-plus-square-foot bluff-top mansion in Malibu’s Point Dume area he and his missus, Theresa, scooped up in 2001 for $6.95 million.
A few of the more interesting features of the 12,300-square-foot Italian-esque villa that the children might like to diss and/or discuss include a train station sized double-height foyer, a formal dining room sheathed in boiserie ripped from the private dining room of a hotel in Paris, and a library outfitted with glass-fronted and slightly sinister looking ebonized cabinetry once installed in Napoleon’s country house. The 9.5-bathroom behemoth also contains a family room off the expensively and extensively appointed kitchen, a game room, home office, temperature-controlled wine cellar, and a home theater with rivet-accented upholstered walls.
Not surprisingly, one of the seven guest/family bedrooms was done up for Miz Klum as a professional grade dressing and styling room and the sprawling master suite encompasses a bedroom, separate sitting room, private ocean-view terrace, dual bathrooms and extensive fitted closets capable of turning any fashion savvy clothes horse’s knees go jelly with desire and envy.
The high-maintenance spread includes three flat and largely landscaped acres, an infinity-edged swimming pool and spa, formal rose gardens, several fountains and a koi pond, a gazebo or two, sweeping lawns, a children’s playhouse, meandering hiking trails, and a rolling green for putting and driving golf balls into the canyon.
The guard-gated enclave is home to a handful of rich and famous folk who include sit-com super-producer Kevin Bright and philandering former California governor and aging action flick movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger who both own mansions just down the street. Amid much ballyhoo and flabbergast in the celerity real estate gossip columns, Dr. Dre and Nicole Threatt recently paid exceptionally well reimbursed model Giselle Bündchen and her also highly remunerated professional pigskin tosser husband, Tom Brady, a shell-shocking $40 million for their much larger and newly constructed faux-chateau directly across the street. Miz Klum, in case of the children missed it, moved on to another slightly smaller 11,600-square-foot red brick Neo-Georgian manse in a discreet but swank, guard-gated enclave in Bel Air that she picked up in October 2013 for $9,875,000.

This house is way way way way better than that crappy Gisele Bundchen house. That Gisele Bundchen house was only on like two aces and sold for almost twice as much as Heidi Klum’s home that’s on like 8 acres??? Also the the Gisele home is surrounded by streets from all sides which makes for a horrible view. I think the Giselle home only sold for that much because of all the hype. The Gisele home wasn’t even as large as the media originally speculated. I have read some reports that the Gisele home is only 14,000 square feet which isn’t much larger than Heidi’s home. I think Heidi should have started the price of this home at $60,000,000 and then settled for no less than $45,000,000. This home is four times the acreage of the Bundchen/Brady home. What was Heidi thinking?

LGB you always beat me to the punch! It escapes me why she would leave this to go to the new property. This woman is not hurting for funds and surely she could have done better. That said, the girl has some smarts so maybe I will eat my words one day.

I’m guessing that since her net worth is reportedly much more than Seal’s that the divorce agreement stipulated the sale of the property — and I’m hoping whatever vision she has for her current abode is a complete redo, if not an outright teardown. She’s no slouch, business-wise.
