FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

GlobeNewswire



Jul 5, 2017 8:34 AM EDT













 




























































 ATHENS, Greece, July 05, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Diana Containerships Inc. (NASDAQ:DCIX), (the "Company"), a global shipping company specializing in the ownership of containerships, today announced that it has paid an aggregate of US$85.0 million for full and final settlement of its US$148.0 million secured loan facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc ("RBS"), entered into on September 10, 2015, which had an outstanding balance of US$128.9 million as of June 30, 2017. The Company funded the refinancing of the RBS loan with aggregate proceeds of US$75.0 million under two new secured loan facilities with Addiewell Ltd., an unaffiliated third party, in the amount of US$35.0 million, and with Diana Shipping Inc. in the amount of US$40.0 million, together with available cash on hand of US$10.0 million.¬† The Company has refinanced its existing unsecured loan facility with Diana Shipping Inc., entered into on May 20, 2013, having an outstanding balance of US$42.6 million as of June 30, 2017. The principal amount of the new secured loan of US$82.6 million with Diana Shipping Inc. includes the existing loan and the new loan used to refinance the Company's RBS loan. The new loans, which are secured by first and second priority mortgages over the Company's eleven containerships, each mature in eighteen (18) months and bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum for the first twelve (12) months scaled to 9% for the next three (3) months and further scaled to 12% for the remaining three (3) months of the loans. Additionally, there is a discount premium amount of US$10.0 million and US$5.0 million for the loans with Addiewell Ltd. and Diana Shipping Inc., respectively. The new loan facilities include financial and other covenants which stipulate the repayment of these facilities with proceeds from the sale of assets of the Company, proceeds from the issuance of new equity and proceeds from the exercise of existing warrants to purchase the Company's Series B Convertible Preferred Shares.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCESCODE OF ETHICSANTI-FRAUD POLICY AND FRAUD RESPONSE PLANBOARD OF DIRECTORSCOMMITTEESAUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTERPOLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO DETECT AND PREVENT INSIDER TRADING

                        Code of Ethics

                    

The Board of Directors of Diana Containerships Inc. (the "Company") has adopted this Code of Ethics (the "Code") for all of the Company's employees, directors, officers and agents ("Employees").

I. Conflicts of Interest
¬†
A conflict of interest occurs when an Employee's private interests interfere, or even appears to interfere, with the interests of the Company as a whole.¬† While it is not possible to describe every situation in which a conflict of interest may arise, Employees must never use or attempt to use their position with the Company to obtain improper personal benefits. Any Employee who is aware of a conflict of interest, or is concerned that a conflict might develop, should discuss the matter with the Audit Committee or counsel to the Company immediately.

II. Corporate Opportunities
¬†
Employees owe a duty to advance the legitimate interests of the Company when the opportunities to do so arise. Employees may not take for themselves personally opportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate property, information or position.

III. Confidentiality and Privacy
¬†
It is important that Employees protect the confidentiality of Company information. Employees may have access to proprietary and confidential information concerning the Company's business, clients and suppliers.¬† Confidential information includes such items as non-public information concerning the Company's business, financial results and prospects and potential corporate transactions. Employees are required to keep such information confidential during employment as well as thereafter, and not to use, disclose, or communicate that confidential information other than in the course of employment.¬† The consequences to the Company and the Employee concerned can be severe where there is unauthorized disclosure of any non-public, privileged or proprietary information.
To ensure the confidentiality of any personal information collected and to comply with applicable laws, any Employee in possession of non-public, personal information about the Company's customers, potential customers, or Employees, must maintain the highest degree of confidentiality and must not disclose any personal information unless authorization is obtained.

IV. Honest and Fair Dealing
¬†
Employees must endeavor to deal honestly, ethically and fairly with the Company's customers, suppliers, competitors and employees.¬† No Employee should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair-dealing practice. Honest conduct is considered to be conduct that is free from fraud or deception.¬† Ethical conduct is considered to be conduct conforming to accepted professional standards of conduct.

V. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets
¬†
The Company's assets are only to be used for legitimate business purposes and only by authorized Employees or their designees. This applies to tangible assets (such as office equipment, telephone, copy machines, etc.) and intangible assets (such as trade secrets and confidential information). Employees have a responsibility to protect the Company's assets from theft and loss and to ensure their efficient use.¬† Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the Company's profitability. If you become aware of theft, waste or misuse of the Company's assets you should report this to your manager.

VI. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations
¬†
It is the Company's policy to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.¬† It is the personal responsibility of each Employee to adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed by those laws, rules and regulations, and in particular, those relating to accounting and auditing matters.
Any Employee who is unsure whether a situation violates any applicable law, rule, regulation or Company policy should contact the Company's outside legal counsel.
¬†
VII. Securities Trading
¬†
Because we are a public company we are subject to a number of laws concerning the purchase of our shares and other publicly traded securities. Company policy prohibits Employees and their family members from trading securities while in possession of material, non-public information relating to the Company or any other Company, including a customer or supplier that has a significant relationship with the Company.
Information is "material" when there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the information important in deciding whether to buy, hold or sell securities.¬† In short, any information that could reasonably affect the price of securities is material. Information is considered to be "public" only when it has been released to the public through appropriate channels and enough time has elapsed to permit the investment market to absorb and evaluate the information.¬† If you have any doubt as to whether you possess material nonpublic information, you should contact a manager and the advice of legal counsel may be sought.

VIII. Disclosure
¬†
Employees are responsible for ensuring that the disclosure in the Company's periodic reports is full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable.¬† In doing so, Employees shall take such action as is reasonably appropriate to (i) establish and comply with disclosure controls and procedures and accounting and financial controls that are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company is made known to them; (ii) confirm that the Company's periodic reports comply with applicable law, rules and regulations; and (iii) ensure that information contained in the Company's periodic reports fairly presents in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
Employees will not knowingly (i) make, or permit or direct another to make, materially false or misleading entries in the Company's, or any of its subsidiary's, financial statements or records; (ii) fail to correct materially false and misleading financial statements or records; (iii) sign, or permit another to sign, a document containing materially false and misleading information; or (iv) falsely respond, or fail to respond, to specific inquiries of the Company's independent auditor or outside legal counsel.

IX. Procedures Regarding Waivers
¬†
Because of the importance of the matters involved in this Code, waivers will be granted only in limited circumstances and where such circumstances would support a waiver.¬† Waivers of the Code may only be made by the Audit Committee and will be disclosed by the Company.
¬†
X. Internal Reporting
¬†
Employees shall take all appropriate action to stop any known misconduct by fellow Employees or other Company personnel that violate this Code.¬† Employees shall report any known or suspected misconduct to the Chairman of the Audit Committee or the Company's outside legal counsel.¬† The Company will not retaliate or allow retaliation for reports made in good faith.

XI. Ethics Hotline and Whistleblower Program

Employees may call the following number +30-216-6002594 and leave a voice message with our whistleblower hotline answering service if they wish to ask questions, seek guidance on specific situations or report violations of this Code, including but not limited to accounting, internal controls and auditing matters. Employees may choose to remain anonymous but even if they identify themselves, their contact with the whistleblower hotline will remain strictly confidential.
¬†
Employees may also report known or suspected violations of the Code to the Company at the email address ‚Äúwhistleblower@dcontainerships.com‚Äù Employees may choose to be anonymous; however, it will not be possible to obtain follow-up details necessary to investigate the matter. In either case, employee information will be kept strictly confidential, thus there should be no fear of any form of retaliation. The whistleblower hotline answering service and email will be accessible only to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Company‚Äôs Internal Auditor.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Diana Containerships Inc. Announces One-for-Six Reverse Stock Split

in  Hellenic Shipping News
26/07/2017




Diana Containerships Inc., a global shipping company specializing in the ownership of containerships, today announced that its Board of Directors (the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù) has determined to effect a reverse stock split of the Company‚Äôs common shares, par value $0.01 per share, at a ratio of one-for-six. The Company‚Äôs shareholders approved the reverse stock split and granted the Board the authority to determine the exact split ratio and proceed with the reverse stock split at the Company‚Äôs Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on June 29, 2017.
The reverse stock split will take effect, and the Company‚Äôs common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, as of the opening of trading on or around July 27, 2017 under the existing trading symbol ‚ÄúDCIX.‚Äù The new CUSIP number for the Company‚Äôs common stock following the reverse stock split is Y2069P309.

Upon effectiveness of the reverse stock split, every six shares of the Company‚Äôs issued and outstanding common stock will be automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change to the par value per share. This will reduce the number of outstanding common shares of the Company from approximately 6.1 million shares to approximately 1.0 million shares.
No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Shareholders who would otherwise hold a fractional share of the Company‚Äôs common stock will receive a cash payment in lieu thereof at a price equal to that fraction to which the shareholder would otherwise be entitled multiplied by the closing price of the Company‚Äôs common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the last trading day prior to the effective date of the reverse stock split.
Shareholders with shares held in book-entry form or through a bank, broker, or other nominee are not required to take any action and will see the impact of the reverse stock split reflected in their accounts on or after the effective date. Such beneficial holders may contact their bank, broker, or nominee for more information.
Shareholders with shares held in certificate form will receive instructions from the Company‚Äôs exchange agent, Computershare, for exchanging their stock certificates for a new certificate representing the shares of common stock resulting from the reverse stock split.
