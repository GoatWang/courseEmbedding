                Nearby Support Suggests Now Is the Time to Buy Base Metals (JJM, DBB)            


    By Casey Murphy | May 23, 2017 — 8:21 AM EDT    






Share





















































The insatiable appetite for risk by global investors has triggered a retracement in relatively slow moving commodities such as copper, zinc, and aluminum. In the article below we’ll take a look at charts of tracking funds that target segments of the base metals market because nearby support is suggesting that current levels are presenting an ideal buying opportunity. (For further reading, check out: What Does it Mean to Invest in Base Metals?)
iPath Bloomberg Industrial Subindex Total Return ETN
The retracement in industrial metals such as those listed above has sent the price of the iPath Bloomberg Industrial Subindex Total Return ETN (JJM) from its high of $26.18 to the recent close near $24. The weakness has pushed the price of the fund toward the long-term support of the 200-day moving average, which you can see from the chart below, has propped up the price on each attempted pullback over the past twelve months. Active traders will use the dotted trendline as part of their strategy for determining the placement of their buy and stop-loss orders. More specifically, based on technical analysis, traders will likely maintain a bullish outlook on this ETN until the price closes below $23.44. (For more, see: Can Industrial Metals Make a Comeback?)

PowerShares DB Base Metals Fund
Another exchange-traded product that is popular for gaining exposure to base metals is the PowerShares DB Base Metals Fund (DBB). As you can see from the chart below, this fund has been trading within a clearly defined uptrend since early 2016, and the recent retracement toward the combined support of the ascending trendline and the 200-day moving average could be an excellent time for strategic traders to look for an entry. Active traders will also look to the bullish crossover between the  MACD indicator and its signal line (shown by the blue circle) as confirmation of a resumption in the dominant trend. (For more on this topic, check out: Active Traders Are Turning Bullish on Industrial Metals)

iPath Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return ETN
Copper has traded within one of the strongest uptrends since the announcement of the U.S. Presidential election in late 2016. Talk of increased spending on infrastructure across the U.S has sparked a strong rally, but as you can see from the iPath Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return ETN (JJC), interest in this story has faded in favor of other more lucrative opportunities. The recent bounce off of the support of the 200-day moving average (red line) suggests that the long-term uptrend is still clearly intact. Proponents of technical analysis will be looking to take advantage of pullbacks and buy as close to the long-term support levels as possible because it offers an ideal risk/reward ratio. (For more, see: Shift Your Attention From Precious Metals to Industrial Metals)

The Bottom Line
It appears as though active traders have lost interest in investment themes involving base metals such as a copper, zinc, and aluminum in favor of other high-risk opportunities in recent weeks. Based on the charts shown above, the recent retracement toward critical long-term support levels is presenting active traders an ideal buying opportunity.

                Trade Commodities With These 3 ETFs (DBB, DBC)            


    By Casey Murphy | November 21, 2016 — 9:32 AM EST    






Share





















































Economic uncertainty marked by spikes in volatility in recent weeks has renewed the interest of many investors towards hard assets such as base metals. Recent price action shown on the charts of several key commodity-related exchange-traded funds suggests that the final days of 2016 could prove to be a strategic entry point for those willing to take a risk. (For more, see: Investing In The Metals Markets).
PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund
When it comes to commodities trading, one of the most popular products utilized by retail investors is the PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC). In case you aren’t familiar, this fund is comprised of futures contracts on fourteen of the most heavily traded physical commodities, and as you can see from the chart below, recent weakness has sent the price of the fund toward the long-term support of its 200-day moving average. In technical analysis, the 200-day moving average is one of the most significant levels that is used to determine the long-term direction of the trend, and the recent close near $14.35 is creating one of the most lucrative risk/reward setups of 2016. 
Technically speaking, the sideways price action over the past few recent sessions is signaling that the support is stronger than many think and a move away from the support and back toward the swing high of $15.45 before the end of the year could be in the cards. (For more, see: Top 5 Metal Mining Stocks of 2016).

iPath Bloomberg Copper Subindex
One of the strongest performing assets in the commodities market in recent weeks has been that of copper as shown by the chart of the iPath Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return ETN (JJC). More specifically, commodity bulls have pushed the price sharply higher after the results of the U.S. presidential election because of the likelihood of increased infrastructure spending. As you can see from the five-year chart below, the recent surge higher has caused a bullish crossover between the 50-day and 200-day moving average, which is a standard long-term technical buy signal known as a golden cross. This bullish crossover combined with the break above a key long-term descending trendline puts the trend squarely in favor of the bulls, and many will likely maintain a bullish outlook until the price closes below the support near $24.84. (For more on this subject, check out: Forget Gold - Base Metals Are Back).

PowerShares DB Base Metals Fund
When it comes to the metals markets the precious metals get all of the attention. Industrial metals or base metals such as copper tend to be ignored, but as discussed recent developments have made a strong case for many to consider adding exposure to this segment. One product in particular that could be worth a closer look is the PowerShares DB Base Metals Fund (DBB). As you can see from the chart, the price has been slowly trekking higher since the start of spring, and the recent surge in upward momentum suggests that the move is not near being over yet. Based on technical analysis, the upward sloping 200-day moving average suggests that the long-term trend is in its early stages and 2017 could prove to be the year that many base-metal investors having been waiting for. (For more, see: Base Metals Are Starting To Shine).

The Bottom Line
The prices of many hard assets such as the base metals have found themselves trading near significant levels of support. Based on the charts discussed above, it looks as though the lucrative risk/reward setups are creating ideal opportunities for active traders to establish positions before the momentum continues in 2017. (For more, see: Can Industrial Metals Make A Comeback?)

Analyst Report







Analyst Report



This ETF offers exposure to a basket of base metals, including copper, zinc, and aluminum. As such, DBB can be a tactical tool for investors with a bullish outlook on this corner of the commodities market; those seeking more broad-based exposure to natural resources would be better served by a fund such as DBC or DJP that includes a variety of other products including; precious metals, agriculture, and others. Those seeking more granular exposure have metal-specific ETPs available to them, such as JJC which tracks copper. The structure of DBB is worth noting; as an ETF that invests in futures contracts, this fund may be subject to some unique tax consequences; investors may want to take a look at the similar BDG or JJM, both of which are structured as ETNs, for treatment that potentially could be more favorable.

DBB Fund Description
The PowerShares DB Base Metals Fund tracks an index of three base metal futures contracts. It selects contracts based on the shape of the futures curve to minimize contango.
  
DBB FactSet Analytics Insight
DBB is the clear leader among industrial metals ETFs. As a commodity pool, it holds a basket of futures directly, but also distributes a complicated K-1 tax form at year-end. DBB holds just three equally weighted metals—aluminum, copper and zinc. That sets it apart from our production-weighted benchmark, which also includes nickel and lead, and DBB's equal weighting strategy gives zinc a sizeable bump at the expense of copper. DBB optimizes its contract selection to minimize the effects of contango, though that could also make it less sensitive to spot prices compared to a front-month strategy. The fund sees significant trading activity, with narrow spreads. The fund's expense ratio is quite reasonable, but it struggles to track its index consistently, potentially raising realized holding costs. Still, with a decent asset base, DBB is one of the more stable funds in its segment.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.
