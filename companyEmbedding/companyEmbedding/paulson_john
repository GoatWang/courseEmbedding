                Drugmaker rises 6.4% after hedge fund manager’s appointment
            



                Paulson became largest holder after Ackman left in March
            













Gabelli's Jonas Doesn't Expect Much Change at Valeant




Billionaire hedge-fund manager John Paulson bought into Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. stock on its way to the top. Now, he’s trying to help push it off the bottom.Paulson will join the board after the noisy exit of another high-profile investor: onetime backer Bill Ackman. The appointment of Paulson, whose firm became Valeant’s biggest shareholder after Ackman bailed out in March, could help comfort shareholders that he’s sticking with the drugmaker while it tries to rebuild itself after high-profile scandals.The stock rose 6.4 percent to close at $13.47 in New York Monday -- still a fraction of where it traded when Paulson & Co. reported its first purchase three years ago.




Getting a seat on the board gives Paulson a firmer hand on one of his most troublesome holdings, and some influence over the turnaround undertaken by Chief Executive Officer Joseph Papa, who has started selling a few assets to chip away at the debt. Although the shares have bounced back from recent lows in the past months, they are still down more than 80 percent from their 2015 peak, after Valeant became embroiled in accounting probes and drug pricing outrage. Paulson’s first investment dates back to the first quarter of 2014, according filings, at a time when the drugmaker was a Wall Street darling and traded at an average of more than $130.Paulson shot to fame betting on the collapse of the U.S. housing market in 2007. A decade later, the hedge-fund manager is struggling to persuade investors to stay with him after a string of missteps on assets including gold and drug stocks. The firm’s primary merger arbitrage strategy fell 25 percent last year. But unlike Ackman, Paulson has been sticking with his bets on pharmaceutical companies so far: In a May letter to investors of one of its funds, Paulson said his firm still believes in Valeant’s “core value.”“The stock has been all but abandoned at this point,” said David Tawil, the founder of Maglan Capital LP, a New York-based hedge fund that specializes in corporate strategies. There is a “fair amount of financial engineering” that could be done at Valeant, a company that was built through acquisitions and lots of debt, he said.“If they could retrace a considerable amount of that loss, it would be a big winner for Paulson,” Tawil said.It will be a challenge. Paulson’s latest significant Valeant transaction came during the second quarter of 2016, when the shares were still trading in the high 20s. He raised Paulson & Co.’s stake to about 19 million shares at the time, and the holding has remained at that level since, give or take slight fluctuations in the past year.Sign of Frustration?




Paulson became director on June 14, bringing the number of members to 11, Valeant, which has its legal headquarters in Laval, Quebec, and is run from New Jersey, said Monday in a statement. Armel Leslie, an outside spokesman for Paulson who works for Peppercom, declined to comment.Even after Ackman’s departure -- the hedge fund manager called his investment a “huge mistake” -- Paulson won’t be the only big investor on the board. Robert Hale, a partner with hedge fund ValueAct, has been a director since August 2015. ValueAct boosted its stake to more than 5 percent recently, and remains among the biggest holders after first investing in mid-2006 in what was then a small experimental-drug developer.Valeant CEO Papa has agreed to sell units worth about $5 billion combined this year so far to help reduce the massive debt and refocus the business. Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli & Co., isn’t expecting much change in the strategy after Paulson’s appointment.“They already have the right strategy that he seems to agree with,” Jonas said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “Really they’re making the best they can out of a bad situation.”David Maris, an analyst at Wells Fargo and a longtime critic of Valeant, viewed the new appointment with skepticism.“It could be a sign that a major holder is frustrated with the pace and direction of change,” Maris, who rates the shares underperform, said in a note to investors. “We do not know what new domain experience that Paulson brings to Valeant’s board that was not already present, especially with ValueAct already on the board.”

Paulson is joining Valeant while winding down his role as a director at American International Group Inc. Paulson was elected last year to the insurer’s board after proposing that then-Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock split the company into three separate businesses. Paulson’s fund sold AIG shares while he was on the board, and AIG has since replaced Hancock with Brian Duperreault. AIG said in April that Paulson wouldn’t stand for reelection “due to his other time commitments.”AIG shares have underperformed the S&P 500 Index since Feb. 11, 2016, the day the insurer announced that Paulson and an ally of fellow activist Carl Icahn would join its board. They’ve gained 26 percent through Friday’s close, while the S&P 500 rose 33 percent.Paulson’s firm has about about $10 billion in assets, just $2 billion of which is outside capital, according to its most recent regulatory filing. Most of the remaining $8 billion is Paulson’s own fortune. Paulson founded it in 1994. At its peak in 2011, the firm oversaw $38 billion.“With his significant business and financial expertise, John will be a strong addition to the board,” Valeant CEO Papa said in the statement Monday. “His experience will be especially valuable as we continue to execute on our transformational strategy to turnaround Valeant.”— With assistance by Katherine Chiglinsky, and Justin Mattingly

John Paulson’s Fall From Hedge Fund Stardom
The hedge fund Paulson & Company manages just under $10 billion today, down from $36 billion in 2011.

John A. Paulson is one of the best-known names in the hedge fund industry. But these days, Mr. Paulson is having more success in the political realm than he is managing his business.Mr. Paulson, 61, was one of the first people on Wall Street to back Donald J. Trump’s bid for the presidency. He counseled Mr. Trump on economic matters during the campaign. He gave $250,000 to Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee. And he recently visited President Trump at the White House for a “C.E.O. Town Hall.”But his investors are unlikely to be impressed by his political access. His firm, Paulson & Company, has recorded nearly double-digit losses in several of its larger funds as of the end of March.That dismal record is a far cry from nearly a decade ago, when Mr. Paulson made nearly $15 billion betting on the collapse of the housing market. Back then, state pension funds and investors around the world rushed to give him their money to manage. Even Mr. Trump became an investor with Mr. Paulson — and eventually lost money.

Mr. Paulson’s struggles come after a gut-wrenching 2016, when he recorded even steeper losses in those funds, partly because of several wrong-footed bets on drug makers, including the troubled Valeant Pharmaceuticals. That followed a painful 2015, when investors first balked and began pulling their money from his firm.A representative of Mr. Paulson declined a request for an interview with him. His funds are said to have performed better in April, said a person with knowledge of the firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Despite his mounting losses, there is little indication that Mr. Paulson, who donated $400 million to Harvard University’s school of engineering in 2015, is throwing his hands up and walking away.“It is clear that Paulson has dug in with both heels and committed to steering the firm through this period,” said David Black, founder of Quadra Advisors, a recruiting firm for hedge funds and other investment firms.Nonetheless, his assets under management continue shrinking. Paulson & Company manages just under $10 billion today, down from $36 billion in 2011. Nearly two years ago, some Wall Street banks began to recommend that investors redeem some of their money from the firm.

And while Mr. Paulson is not the only hedge fund manager to see large investors pull their money in recent years, he has become a symbol of what some pension funds have taken issue with for the industry at large: big fees for little reward and little originality.Mr. Paulson has remained upbeat with investors, according to two people who have seen recent investor letters but spoke on the condition of anonymity.“While we are disappointed in performance in 2016, we believe we have a path to a recovery,” Mr. Paulson told investors in one letter.But it has not been smooth sailing. In another letter to investors of a merger arbitrage fund that declined by 49 percent last year, Mr. Paulson called 2016 “the most challenging year since inception.” In May, Mr. Paulson will address his investors at a meeting at Claridge’s Hotel in London.Mr. Paulson’s fall from stock-trading stardom underscores a common disclaimer in industry parlance: Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.In early 2007, Mr. Paulson, who started his firm in 1994, was still a relatively unknown hedge fund manager. A former Bear Stearns investment banker, he had a reputation for running a solid if boring hedge fund that made bets on the outcomes of various mergers and acquisitions.

But as the housing market began to show signs of overheating, Mr. Paulson had a hunch that home loans to borrowers with spotty credit histories — which were ballooning at the time — were about to go sour. He positioned his firm to benefit in the event of a huge failure of the subprime mortgage market.It was a bet that few were willing to take, but one that resulted in a major payday for him and his firm, and was later referred to as “The Greatest Trade Ever,” in a book by the reporter Gregory Zuckerman.

For several years, Paulson & Company continued to make money for some of his investors, but the performance increasingly grew bumpy. This was particularly true for the firm’s flagship Advantage fund. It lost 36 percent in 2011 and plunged another 14 percent in 2012, but rallied to post a 26 percent gain in 2013, according to an HSBC industry report and people with knowledge of the firm’s performance. The losses were amplified in Advantage Plus, a version of the fund that uses leverage to enhance returns.Over the last three years, Advantage has consecutively recorded double-digit losses. Some of Mr. Paulson’s merger funds, credit funds and gold funds have posted positive returns, but the overall picture has not been pretty.But Mr. Paulson soldiered on and even began to raise money in 2015 for a private equity fund and one focused on health care stocks.Health care bets, in particular those on pharmaceutical companies, have proved especially punishing for Mr. Paulson and his investors. Losing wagers on economic recoveries in Greece and Puerto Rico haven’t helped.The Valeant trade resulted in a nearly $2 billion loss for the firm — bad, but not as disastrous as it was for another famed investor, William A. Ackman, whose firm Pershing Square Capital Management lost $4 billion on Valeant.Some of Mr. Paulson’s top talent have moved on. Putnam Coes, his former chief operating officer, left the firm in September. Soon after, John Reade, a senior vice president who was based in London, left.Despite his losses, Mr. Paulson is still making new and speculative investments. In November, Paulson made an investment in Didi Chuxing, a fast-growing Chinese ride-hailing firm that signed a deal to acquire Uber Technologies’ operations in China.One bright spot could be a bet on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has pledged to return the mortgage finance giants to free-standing publicly traded companies, a development that could make Mr. Paulson’s funds big profits. Mr. Paulson and Mr. Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager, once worked together to pull OneWest Bank out of the wreckage of IndyMac, a lender that the federal government seized in 2008.

Several new funds the firm has started are posting positive returns, too.“We remain confident in the long-term relationship we have with Paulson,” said Christopher Zook of CAZ Investments, a Texas wealth management firm that recently rotated out of the poorly performing Paulson Special Situations fund into a newer Paulson fund.And Mr. Paulson and other hedge fund managers stand to be big beneficiaries of Mr. Trump’s plans to slash taxes.Yet 2017 is shaping up as another rough one for Mr. Paulson. The Advantage fund was down 9.7 percent as of the end of March and the Partners Enhanced fund continues to sink — falling just over 8 percent after last year’s 49 percent plunge.Even after several years of losing money for his investors, Mr. Paulson remains one of the richest men in the world — with a net worth of about $7.9 billion, according to Forbes.But, as the financial magazine recently noted, he is now $2 billion poorer.

Billionaire John Paulson, the largest shareholder in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., increased his stake in the drugmaker to 6.3 percent, from 5.7 percent at the end of March.

Paulson holds about 21.8 million shares, according to a regulatory filing Monday. The hedge fund manager disclosed that his funds purchased 2.72 million shares on May 11 at an average price of $13.71 each. The document also shows that the funds hold cash-settled swaps on an additional 862,500 Valeant shares, raising the total economic stake to 6.5 percent. The Paulson funds can’t vote or trade the shares underlying the swaps.Valeant has gained 24 percent since Paulson & Co. bought the additional shares. The hedge fund manager joined Valeant’s board earlier this month to help the company with its turnaround.
