Research partners
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center pioneered the medical invention of bone marrow transplantation, a procedure that has saved hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide. This discovery set the stage for our pursuit of innovative treatments and cures such as the lifesaving transplantation technique using cord blood that could make stem cell treatments available to thousands of patients who cannot find tissue-matched bone marrow donors.

 Clinical Applications – Nohla Therapeutics






























































 

 












 




Clinical Applications
The first clinical trial using Notch-mediated ex vivo expanded cord blood HSPC was opened by Dr. Delaney in 2006 in the myeloablative double cord blood transplant setting. This trial used patient-specific cord blood units for ex vivo expansion followed by immediate infusion. No serious adverse events related to the expanded cell product were reported in this Phase 1 trial, and the clinical relevance of using Notch ligand for ex vivo generation of increased numbers of human stem and progenitor cells was established. This was the first trial demonstrating that infusion of ex vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells, without co-infusion of T cells from the same donor, could result in a significant decrease in the time to hematopoietic recovery of both neutrophils and platelets.
Thus, with established proof of concept, the goal was further development of this T cell deplete cellular therapy as an economically and clinically feasible product with ready patient access, specifically as a cryopreserved universal donor cell product. Without the need for HLA matching, the product can be cryopreserved for future on demand use. In contrast to the initial patient-specific product, patient access to this cryopreserved product would be dramatically enhanced as all of the expanded products would be potentially available for any given patient, regardless of HLA typing or location of the patient.
Two clinical trials have been completed in adults using this cryopreserved universal donor product in the context of cord blood transplant and high dose chemotherapy, with no unexpected safety issues and preliminary efficacy data demonstrating reduction in treatment side effects and time to engraftment. Other trials are ongoing, including a multicenter randomized trial comparing cord blood transplant with and without use of the expanded cell product and a pediatric trial using the product in the setting of intensive chemotherapy.
Advantages of the product 
The cryopreserved universal donor expanded CB progenitor product has many advantages:

It is devoid of T-cells and can thus be administered without need for HLA matching, making it a true universal donor product
It is a “pre-expanded” cryopreserved product and can be distributed and stored for immediate on demand use
It has potential uses in a broad variety of indications requiring temporary myeloid engraftment (for example chemotherapy-induced severe neutropenia, sepsis, or accidental radiation exposure)

Advantage of the platform
The true advantage of this ex vivo expansion platform is the ability to manipulate the Notch signaling pathway with tight regulation, thereby optimizing this methodology to direct stem and progenitor cell fate in vitro for the ex vivo generation of other cell types: NK cells, pre-T cells, platelets and red cells.

Scientific Advisory Board

Nohla Therapeutics appreciates the esteemed contribution of some of the most distinguished innovators in the cord blood transplant arena, the top minds in oncology, immunology, and cellular therapy.










Colleen Delaney, MD Chief Medical Officer
Colleen Delaney is the Chief Medical Officer at Nohla Therapeutics. She is also an Associate Member and recipient of the Madeline Dabney Adams Endowed Chair of the Fred Hutch Clinical Research Division and an Associate Professor at the UW Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology. Colleen is a member on the Advisory Council on Blood Stem Cell Transplantation of the Health Resources and Services Administration. She also serves on the Boards of Directors of the American Society of Bone Marrow Transplant and the Cord Blood Association.
In 2006, she established and became the Director of the Cord Blood Transplant Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, which has grown to be one of the busiest such programs in the country and the coordinating center of several multicenter clinical trials. She is the sponsor-investigator of three Investigational New Drug FDA files and has been the Principal Investigator of nine ongoing and completed clinical trials and several ancillary studies.
Colleen is also the Principal Investigator of a research laboratory focused on the role of the Notch signaling pathway in hematopoietic stem cell regulation and ex-vivo expansion of umbilical cord blood stem and progenitor cells for clinical applications. Her group at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center developed novel and clinically feasible methods for the ex vivo expansion of cord blood derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the presence of Notch ligands. This work was translated into a pilot study investigating the use of ex vivo expanded cord blood progenitors to augment conventional cord blood transplantation. She has since extended this work to investigate the potential of cryopreserved, non-HLA matched “off the shelf” ex vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells to provide rapid but transient myeloid reconstitution in the setting of cord blood transplant and following dose-intensive chemotherapy.
Colleen received her MD from Harvard Medical School in 1996, and went on to complete a residency in Pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco followed by a Fellowship in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center/University of Washington.











Shelly Heimfeld, PhD Advisory Board Chair and Executive Vice President, Manufacturing and Research
Shelly Heimfeld is a Full Faculty Member at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and serves as Scientific Laboratory Director for the cGTP Cellular Therapy Laboratory and cGMP Therapeutic Manufacturing Facilities. These facilities are responsible for all minimally and more extensively manipulated cell components used for treatment of patients at the Center. His primary responsibilities are to ensure the safety, quality, and effectiveness of each product, but also include implementation of new technologies, translation of basic science procedures into appropriate clinical protocols, product development, process improvement, and regulatory compliance.
Shelly is internationally recognized for his research in hematopoietic-derived stem cells and the development of cell processing technologies for improved cancer therapy. His long-term goals have a direct therapeutic focus, many involving the “engineering” of transplant products to improve clinical outcomes. Pre-clinical translation activities include identification of better markers for characterization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, improvements in isolation/purification technologies, and development of ex vivo manipulation strategies that can enhance the therapeutic potential of cells such as T-cell-based immunotherapy for treatment of various diseases.
Shelly is a Past-President for International Society of Cellular Therapy (ISCT), and is a leading authority in the FDA regulations and lab practices needed for clinical cell therapies, including Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), Good Tissue Practice (GTP), and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Shelly continues to work with the FDA and other organizations to facilitate the exchange of ideas and best practices in the rapidly evolving area of Cell Therapy.
Shelly received his PhD in Cell Differentiation from the University of California, Irvine and completed postdoctoral studies with Dr. Irving Weissman at Stanford before going into industry to work as a founding scientist at SyStemix and later at CellPro, Inc., the first company to develop an FDA-approved device for CD34+ cell enrichment.











Irwin D. Bernstein, MD Advisory Board Member
Irwin D. Bernstein, MD, is chief of the Division of Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant at Seattle Children’s Hospital and professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Irwin holds the John R. Hartmann Endowed Chair in Pediatric Oncology/Hematology at Seattle Children’s and is an American Cancer Society professor. He is director of the Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology in the Department of Pediatrics and Member and head of the Pediatric Oncology Program at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) where he also heads NIH-supported grants for career development in pediatric and medical oncology.
His past appointments include a member of the Scientific Advisory Board for the University of Minnesota Cancer Center and board membership for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Irwin’s research interests have focused on developmental aspects of hematopoiesis, including normal and leukemic hematopoietic stem cells. Studies conducting in Dr. Bernstein’s lab were credited with the identification of maturation-linked cell surface antigens used to develop Mylotarg as a targeted anti-CD33 therapy for AML and for the development of stem cell transplantation using isolated CD34+ cells. Additional studies of normal hematopoiesis in his lab are aimed at determining methods to direct primitive hematopoietic precursors to commit to a particular maturational pathway or to self-renew. These studies, focused on the role of Notch signaling, demonstrated that constitutive Notch1 signaling can enhance self-renewal and lead to the immortalization of cytokine-dependent pluripotent murine hematopoietic stem cells. This in turn led to the finding that Notch signaling induced by exogenously presented engineered Notch ligands enhances the ex vivo generation of primitive multipotent precursors and has served as the basis for the development of novel clinically relevant expansion methods of human cord blood stem and progenitor cells now being developed by Nohla Therapeutics.

Nohla Therapeutics Launches with Major US Cancer Research Institute Deal, Substantial Investment Round, and Key Appointments | Business Wire
























































Nohla Therapeutics Launches with Major US Cancer Research Institute 
      Deal, Substantial Investment Round, and Key Appointments






December 03, 2015 08:01 AM Eastern Standard Time



SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nohla Therapeutics Inc. (Nohla), a new cellular therapies start-up based 
      in Seattle, Washington, is pleased to announce the signing of an 
      exclusive licensing and collaboration agreement with the Fred Hutchinson 
      Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch). Nohla has also secured an 
      investment term sheet for a USD $20M investment round which it expects 
      to close in December, and has also announced several high profile 
      appointments to its Scientific Advisory Board and Clinical Advisory 
      Board.
    


      The transaction with the Fred Hutch provides Nohla with a 20 year 
      worldwide exclusive licensing agreement to seven patent families and 
      know-how relating to an ex vivo expanded umbilical cord blood platform. 
      Two INDs also transfer as part of the transaction. Patents under this 
      agreement cover the use of a non-HLA matched expanded cord blood product 
      which has been used in a number of clinical trials already. The ex vivo 
      expanded allogeneic cord blood product can be manufactured to provide a 
      truly “off the shelf” cell therapy distinct from several other emerging 
      technologies.
    

      In addition to the license agreement, Nohla has executed a five year 
      Collaboration Agreement with Fred Hutch, in the form of sponsored 
      research agreement. The Collaboration Agreement will accelerate both 
      pre-clinical and clinical research being conducted within labs at the 
      Fred Hutch. The Collaboration commitment consists of USD $1.5M per annum 
      with initial capital directed toward manufacturing transfer.
    

      Nohla’s most progressed clinical trial, currently enrolling, is a 
      multi-center, randomized Phase IIb trial in which patients undergoing a 
      conventional cord blood transplant are randomized to receive the non-HLA 
      matched ex vivo expanded umbilical cord blood product as an adjuvant 
      graft. In the pilot safety trial using the non-HLA matched ex vivo 
      expanded cord blood product in the cord blood transplant setting, rates 
      of acute graft-versus-host disease were significantly lowered and so too 
      were rates of transplant related mortality in addition to enhancing the 
      kinetics of hematopoietic recovery.
    

      Commenting on the agreement, Nohla CEO Benjamin Bergo said, “we are 
      delighted with the relationship we have formed with the scientific 
      inventors and research team at Fred Hutch, and our executive team is 
      fully committed to further developing and commercialising what we see as 
      a transformative and truly ‘off the shelf’ cell therapy.”
    

      Joining the executive team as Chief Medical Officer is Dr. Colleen 
      Delaney from the Fred Hutch. Dr Delaney is a key inventor and the 
      translational leader of the ex vivo expanded umbilical cord blood 
      platform. “I am very excited to bring this product to market, a product 
      which has helped so many patients already, and one that we see making a 
      tremendous impact across a range of disease indications”, said Dr 
      Delaney.
    

      Dr. Irwin Bernstein who is a co-inventor of the company’s technology 
      platform and is currently Chief of the Hematology, Oncology, and Bone 
      Marrow Transplantation divisions at the Seattle Children’s Hospital, has 
      joined the company’s Scientific Advisory Board.
    

      Also joining Nohla from the Fred Hutch is Faculty member Dr. Shelly 
      Heimfeld who joins the company as Interim Chair of the Scientific and 
      Clinical Advisory Boards, bringing a wealth of experience in the 
      manufacture of cellular therapies.
    

      Professor Mark Kirkland, Chief Scientific Officer of Nohla and 
      co-founder of Australia’s largest private cord blood bank stated, “We’re 
      very pleased to bring together our shared vision of this ex vivo 
      expanded cord blood product, with complementary capability in Australia.”
    

      Mr. Michael Sistenich has joined the company as Head of Corporate 
      Development, following an 18 year career in hedge funds management and 
      most recently in investment banking. Mr. Darren Scotti joins as Company 
      Secretary and CFO. Dr. Jason Carstens, formerly a Director of 
      Manufacturing at Fred Hutch joins Nohla as VP of Manufacturing, and Ms. 
      Heather Brammer has joined the company, also from the Cord Blood Program 
      at the Fred Hutch as Director of Program Management. Mr. Guy Moeneclaey 
      has joined the company as Research Manager and Dr. Claudia Gregoria-King 
      as Clinical Operations Manager.
    

About Nohla Therapeutics


      Nohla’s goal is to transform the medical care options for patients with 
      our expanded cord blood product. The proprietary expansion platform 
      multiplies the number of stem cells found in cord blood donations up to 
      500 times. This landmark advance made cord blood a viable alternative to 
      adult bone marrow in the transplant setting.
    

      Nohla’s expanded cord blood product can be stored for off-the-shelf use 
      at any time. Our products can be used in conjunction with other 
      therapies to give patients a bridge of infection-fighting cells while 
      they wait for immune system recovery. With a broadly applicable expanded 
      cord blood platform, we will provide superior treatment options across 
      many disease indications.

Colleen is the Chief Medical Officer at Nohla Therapeutics. She is also an Associate Member and recipient of the Madeline Dabney Adams Endowed Chair of the Fred Hutch Clinical Research Division and an Associate Professor at the UW Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology. Dr. Delaney is a member on the Advisory Council on Blood Stem Cell Transplantation of the Health Resources and Services Administration. She also serves on the Boards of Directors of the American Society of Bone Marrow Transplant and the Cord Blood Association.
In 2006, she established and became the Director of the Cord Blood Transplant Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, which has grown to be one of the busiest such programs in the country and the coordinating center of several multicenter clinical trials. She is the sponsor-investigator of three Investigational New Drug FDA files and has been the Principal Investigator of nine ongoing and completed clinical trials and several ancillary studies.
Dr. Delaney is also the Principal Investigator of a research laboratory focused on the role of the Notch signaling pathway in hematopoietic stem cell regulation and ex-vivo expansion of umbilical cord blood stem and progenitor cells for clinical applications.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
